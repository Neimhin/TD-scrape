            <p eId="para_4">42. <b>Deputy Darragh O'Brien</b> asked the <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</b> his views on whether the EU and the international community are doing enough to end the conflict in Syria, which has just marked its seventh anniversary; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_5">Does the Tánaiste believe the EU and the international community are doing enough to end the conflict in Syria, which has just marked its seventh anniversary? Almost 500,000 people have been killed since 2011, while more than 13 million people require humanitarian assistance, including nearly 3 million trapped in besieged and hard-to-reach areas. Are there proposals for a change in the EU response?</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_6">The UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, is leading political negotiations to end the conflict based on the 2012 Geneva communique and UN Security Council Resolution 2254. Ireland and the EU fully support this process. The EU provides direct assistance to the UN-led Geneva peace talks and has launched, in co-ordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground. Ireland strongly welcomed the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 2401 on 24 February. This resolution calls for an immediate ceasefire and unhindered humanitarian access.</p>
            <p eId="para_7"> The international community must redouble efforts to press for the immediate and full implementation of the ceasefire, and unimpeded humanitarian access to populations in need. EU Foreign Ministers discussed the situation in Syria at their informal meeting on 15 February and again at the Foreign Affairs Council meetings on 26 February and 19 March. The EU and its member states have to date mobilised more than €10.4 billion for humanitarian assistance inside Syria and in neighbouring countries, making the EU the largest donor to the effort. The EU hosted a donor conference for Syria in April 2017 at which pledges totalling €5.6 billion were made, and will host another donor conference on Syria in April 2018.</p>
            <p eId="para_8"> Since 2012, Ireland has contributed over €95 million to the humanitarian effort in response to the conflict in Syria. Ireland will make a further pledge of humanitarian support in 2018 at the Brussels donor conference next month. Ireland also provides political and financial support to a broad range of measures to ensure full legal accountability for all war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Syria. However, the direct answer to the Deputy's question is we never can do enough until the conflict is over. In the years ahead, history will judge the international community harshly in terms of how the conflict developed over a long period and the number of civilians who have lost their lives as a result.</p>

            <from>Deputy Darragh O'Brien<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_9">I agree wholeheartedly that we can never do enough in this regard but the problem is the conflict has moved into its eighth year. The indiscriminate attacks on, and bombing of, eastern Ghouta is a carbon copy of what happened in Aleppo when the international community effectively stood by, although it does care about it. We must examine how the veto works at the UN Security Council and Russia's role as a member of the council while also being a major player in the region and a major supporter of the Assad regime. It is more worrying that the war has become a global war being fought out in Syria involving different global partners. The conflict has become more complex and the longer it goes on, the less opportunity there will be to end it in the short term.</p>
            <p eId="para_10">I wonder, on foot of his discussions with colleagues in the region - I know he has visited the region - what the view is there. Is there any chink of light or any hope at all in regard to the stalled talks? While I know it is difficult to include Assad in those talks, perhaps there is an attempt to include members of the regime to try to bring about a ceasefire, or are we really just waiting for Assad to effectively win the war and wipe out the opposition?</p>

          <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_7" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade">
            <from>Deputy Simon Coveney<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_11">I was at the UN Security Council when it met a number of weeks ago. The first item on the agenda, raised by Secretary General Guterres, was eastern Ghouta and he made a personal appeal to all of the states represented around that table to implement an immediate ceasefire. He described what is happening there as hell on earth, and I think many of us who have looked at video coverage and television footage of what was happening at that time in eastern Ghouta, particularly those of us who are parents, found it pretty hard to watch. There is a huge effort to try to make this ceasefire work and stick. Having said that, I think the Assad regime feels it is victorious and needs to finish the job militarily. Of course, that is resulting in ongoing conflict and military activity that is impacting, in a pretty dire way, on many civilians, particularly women and children.</p>
            <p eId="para_12"> We will continue to push hard through the Foreign Affairs Council and UN structures to ensure that the EU voice is very strong and clear on this, which it is. However, I believe we have some way to go yet.</p>

          <speech by="#DarraghOBrien" eId="spk_8">
            <from>Deputy Darragh O'Brien<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_13">I am fully aware of the constraints Ireland operates under and the small level of influence we have, but it is important this is kept to the top of the agenda. In the context of Ireland seeking a seat on the UN Security Council in 2020 and given the failure of the latter to halt the Assad regime and its allies, such as Putin's Russia, will the Tánaiste be seeking changes to how the Security Council operates or has he thought about such proposals, particularly on the use of the veto and if it is employed by one of the combatants in the context of a combat situation? We need to look at that into the future. Has the Tánaiste any thoughts on this issue? It might also give him an opportunity to update the House briefly on how that campaign for us to secure a seat in 2020 is going.</p>

          <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_9" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade">
            <from>Deputy Simon Coveney<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_14">It is going reasonably well but this is a very competitive race and Norway and Canada are significant competitors. There are three countries going for two places but I think there is a very strong case to be made for Ireland as the only EU country putting its name forward. At that time, the only EU representative on the UN Security Council will be France, as a permanent member, so there is a very strong case to be made. We are a small, neutral country and we are not afraid to speak our mind. We use the UN to raise significant concerns from a humanitarian perspective in terms of consistency with international law. I think that will be a very compelling and strong case.</p>
            <p eId="para_15"> We support the reform of the UN generally but also of the Security Council. We would support a French approach which suggests that, in cases of humanitarian crises, a veto would not be used - that is, when the Security Council is responding to significant crises, vetoes would not be used where there is a need for collective action on a humanitarian basis. That is something we should pursue. There are broader changes we would also like to happen in regard to the Security Council but that one in particular would be very helpful.</p>

            <p eId="para_16">43. <b>Deputy David Cullinane</b> asked the <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</b> the Government's understanding of the goods that will be listed on annex 2.1 of the protocol attached to the European Commission draft withdrawal agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_17">Annex 2.1 of the proposed protocol attached to the European Commission draft withdrawal agreement lists goods which it says will be covered under any alignment of goods and services between North and South on the island of Ireland. Why is there a list of goods that are being covered, particularly as this would obviously suggest that some goods are not covered? Can the Tánaiste give a broad outline of the goods that are covered?</p>

          <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_11" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade">
            <from>Deputy Simon Coveney<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_18">First, I welcome the progress made on the draft protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland during the most recent round of negotiations, which concluded on 19 March. This is recorded in an annotated, colour-coded version of the draft withdrawal agreement published by the Commission task force on 19 March, which reflects agreement on some articles of the draft text, including "Common Travel Area" and "Other areas of North-South cooperation".</p>
            <p eId="para_19"> During the negotiations, the UK accepted that a legally operative version of the backstop for the Border will be included in the withdrawal agreement, that this must be in line with paragraph 49 of the joint progress report agreed last December and that all the issues identified in the draft protocol reflect those that must be addressed. These were important steps forward, which I do not believe everybody has recognised.</p>
            <p eId="para_20"> The European Council, in agreeing additional negotiating guidelines on 23 March, stressed that work remains to be done in order to achieve overall agreement on the draft withdrawal agreement, especially with regard to the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland. It reiterated that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. To this end, an intensive schedule of negotiations has been agreed between the EU and the UK, with a view to continuing efforts to narrow the remaining gaps on the draft protocol and its annexes. The first round took place earlier this week and more will be held over the coming weeks. Irish officials will be involved in some of these meetings where the task force believes this would be helpful and we will remain in close contact with the task force throughout.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> These negotiations include discussions on Article 4 of the draft protocol, which addresses the free movement of goods between Northern Ireland and the EU. The overall aim is to maintain full alignment with those rules of the Single Market and customs union that are necessary to protect North-South co-operation and the all-island economy, as well as to avoid a hard border. It is necessary, therefore, to have comprehensive and accurate lists of all relevant rules, which will be set out in a number of annexes to the protocol. While the Commission, in conjunction with Government Departments, has already done a great deal of work on this, it will be in the course of the EU-UK negotiations that the content of the annexes will be finalised.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DavidCullinane" eId="spk_12">

            <p eId="para_22">With respect, I think the Tánaiste has presented inaccurate information to the House. I read the draft protocol and also the draft withdrawal agreement. It is colour-co-ordinated, as the Tánaiste knows, and every single section that refers to Ireland and the protocol, with the exception of the common travel area, is in white, which means it is still to be agreed. He will also know that Downing Street and the British Prime Minister rejected, out of hand, a legal text that was published by the European Commission. What the British Government is saying is that it agrees in principle to some form of protocol but it has not signed up to any legal text. That is the difficulty here. Yes, there has been progress, and the Tánaiste knows we have recognised progress, but we have a concern in regard to what all of this will mean.</p>
            <p eId="para_23"> I want to see the North staying in the customs union and the Single Market because that is the best way to avoid any hardening of the Border. I want to see a free trade agreement or some form of customs partnership between Britain and the EU, which would certainly be a big help. However, the backstop arrangement, which we were told was a cast-iron guarantee, only covers areas of North-South co-operation, the all-island economy and the 1998 agreement; it does not cover all goods and all services. My clear question to the Tánaiste is this: if, as a worst-case scenario, the backstop arrangement is put in place, what goods and services will not be covered and be subject to checks, either in factories or on the Border itself?</p>

            <p eId="para_24">I am glad I have a copy of the protocol here with me so I can correct the record given the Deputy has just misrepresented the case. It is not true to say that, in the Irish protocol, the only piece in green, which is agreed, is the common travel area, which, by the way, is very welcome. The whole first page is in yellow, which is agreed in principle. The whole second page is in yellow, which is also agreed in principle. The third page on the common travel area is in green, so it is done. The next page, on the single electricity market, is in yellow again. In terms of Article 8 and other areas of North-South co-operation, it is in green - agreed. In terms of Article 10, it is in green - agreed. On Article 9, which relates to state aid, it is in yellow, so major progress has been made.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> This is an issue that is serious and has huge implications for the future of our country and of this island, North and South. It is important to be accurate. We have made significant progress regarding the protocol in terms of areas that are already agreed. There are, of course, areas that are contentious and which need future agreement, and that is what we are working on now.</p>

            <p eId="para_28">I have read it very well. Unless it is in green, it is not agreed. We had agreement in principle last November and December. That was when we had a political agreement which we were told was a cast-iron guarantee. My quarrel is not necessarily with the Minister but with the British Government. It seems to accept, in principle, all of these proposals but, in practice, it is not coming forward with proposals. With respect, until we see an agreement which is actually agreed and a text which translates the backstop arrangement into a legal arrangement, then all we have is a political agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_29"> While I accept it might be a step forward, it is not black and white. Whatever other colours we can throw about the place, it is not black and white at this point in time. We are concerned we will have some hardening of the Border if all goods and services are not fully and absolutely protected. We do not want to see any checks on goods and services or any hardening of the Border at all.</p>

            <p eId="para_30">We are all agreed on that. However, this is a negotiation which will take time. Each time there is a round of agreement and negotiation, Ireland has made progress on each of its key issues. In December, we made a significant step forward in getting agreement on the backstop and how it would work in terms of maintaining full alignment of the rules of the customs union and Single Market to ensure an all-Ireland economy can function. That is a political agreement from which the British Government is not resiling.</p>
            <p eId="para_31"> It has said it wants to negotiate a legally operable text around what was committed in paragraph 49 in December. That for it, of course, is not the first priority in terms of agreement. It wants to get agreement on option A, a future relationship which does not require the backstop to be used. We support that position. We also will insist, however, as will the EU, that the backstop will be part of a withdrawal agreement before it is signed off. In other words, there will be no withdrawal agreement if there is not a backstop on the Irish Border issue, which is obviously linked to the text in the Irish protocol. That is what is being negotiated this week.</p>

            <p eId="para_35">The draft wording for the backstop was published by the EU on 28 February 2018. It was rejected by the UK, however. The British Prime Minister said emphatically it represented a threat to the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. Last Monday, many of us were taken by surprise when the EU's task force released the Brexit document which showed no progress had been made on agreeing the legal wording for the backstop to ensure no border around Northern Ireland. Last Friday, the Taoiseach said the wording may not be agreed until October. How long will the Government allow phase 2 continue without clarity on that specific legal wording which needs to be in the final document?</p>

            <p eId="para_36">That is a fair question which recognises that this is a negotiation on which we need to make progress. We have a focus of the British negotiating team and the EU task force on getting a legally operative wording which is true to paragraph 49 agreed in December. Nobody is resiling from that. However, the draft the EU produced, which I happen to agree with as it is a good and loyal interpretation of paragraph 49, was not agreed with by the British Government. It is up to the British Government to come forward with proposals which will have the same outcome as to what was committed to in paragraph 49 in terms of maintaining full alignment with the rules of the Single Market and customs union to avoid any hard Border.</p>
            <p eId="para_37"> Ireland asked for a review of guidelines in June to allow us to reassess the approach of the British Government on a whole range of issues before any deal is concluded by October. I am certainly hopeful that we will see some progress on the Irish backstop issue by June. This will allow us to make an assessment as to whether we are on track to get a draft withdrawal treaty or withdrawal agreement agreed by October. June is a significant date from an Irish perspective. If there is no progress or no significant effort made at making progress on a backstop which can provide reassurance to the Irish Government by June, then we will have to ask some serious questions. If it is not possible by June, will it be possible by October?</p>
            <p eId="para_38"> We have an opportunity in June to reassess where we are. That will be an important point from an Irish perspective. Ultimately, we have to get this done by October to allow the European Parliament to take the time it needs to ratify any withdrawal agreement.</p>

            <p eId="para_39">I am concerned by that. The longer we go on without agreed wording on the Border, the more it becomes one of many legitimate priorities across the EU member states. The talks were set up to ensure we could get agreement on a reasonably small number of important issues, including for us the Border in phase 1, before agreeing a transition and moving to phase 2. It was recognised right at the start that this was going to be incredibly difficult. We have the December agreement. The EU and UK sides immediately had different views of it, however. We had the EU say this was its interpretation and legal wording. I agree with the Tánaiste that it was a fair representation by the EU. However, we must be cognisant that it has been rejected emphatically by the UK.</p>
            <p eId="para_40"> The concern is that this should have been closed off by now, before moving on to phase 2. Now, many of our neighbours - our friends and our allies - have legitimate interests as well. We could get to a point in October where hundreds of billions of euro of trade and the future relationship between the UK and Ireland are being held up, and there might be reasonable pressure from our neighbours to water it down.</p>

            <p eId="para_43">It is important for people to understand how these negotiations are actually working. There is a negotiation to conclude a withdrawal agreement and there is conversation just starting on what a future relationship might look like. That conversation will go on way beyond October. There is no question of there being a free trade agreement signed off on by October. The best we can hope for is to have a withdrawal agreement by October which then gets ratified by the European Parliament. Then there has to be some sort of framework agreement which sets the parameters within which we can get a future trade and future relationship agreement negotiated signed off over time. The European Union cannot even legally negotiate a free trade agreement until Britain is out of the European Union because it cannot negotiate for one with a member state.</p>
            <p eId="para_44"> It is important not to fudge and merge these two issues into the same debate. What we need is a withdrawal agreement which has an Irish backstop in it. The British Government has agreed to do that. Then, we will have a future relationship debate, which, hopefully, will result in the backstop being unnecessary because we will have an option A which does not require any borders, North, South, east or west. We have to have the assurance mechanism and the backstop in the withdrawal agreement just in case that is not possible. We are on our way to doing that.</p>

            <p eId="para_45">Nobody is suggesting that a free trade agreement will be signed, sealed and delivered by October. It will take years to do that. The Brexit talks were, nonetheless, structured in phases 1 and 2. The whole purpose of that was to make sure we got closure on some important issues. The so-called withdrawal bill, reciprocity of people's rights and the Irish Border were the three which received the most attention. It was during phase 1 that we had considerable support from the other 26 EU member states.</p>
            <p eId="para_46"> Respectfully, it is not me who is merging the withdrawal framework with the detail of a free trade agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_47">I would suggest that the Minister, the Government and the EU have allowed the merging of phase 1 and phase 2. Surely we should have been looking for closure on the Border before moving on to phase 2 and surely that is what the talks were structured to do. The Minister has answered the first question, which is October. Why did the Minister not make a call? Did he consider making a call for the Council meeting that has just gone to say that this really is the beginning of the future relationship talks and that we must get closure and agreement on something that was agreed in principle in December?</p>

            <p eId="para_48">The Deputy says that I mentioned October. I also mentioned June and I think June will be a very important gauge for Ireland with regard to whether this is moving in the direction in which we need it to move. If it clearly is not, then we have some decisions to make with the task force. I believe we will have absolute solidarity in that as we have had at every step of the way so far. Ireland's problem is the EU's problem. Michel Barnier repeats that virtually every time he talks on this issue. I think the EU task force will expect significant progress on the Irish Border issue by June and so do we. To be clear on that, I have always said, any time I have been asked questions on phases 1 and 2, that all of the issues in phase 1 would not be closed off entirely before phase 2 starts but that we needed to make sufficient progress in phase 1 on phase 1 issues in order to move on to phase 2. That was the test. It was not closure but sufficient progress. We made sufficient progress in December and we have subsequently made more progress in the last round of negotiations and agreements on the Irish Border. The British Government is now committed to ensuring that there is a backstop in the withdrawal agreement. The EU task force is making it very clear that, without that backstop, there will be no withdrawal agreement.</p>

While I accept that the vast majority of the UN peacekeeping force are honourable and courageous people, we must accept that this is a problem that must be tackled. Last month, it was reported that over 600 women and children claimed that they are victims of sexual abuse and exploitation at the hands of United Nations peacekeeping forces sent to protect them.</p>

            <p eId="para_51">The UN relies on its global reputation as a positive force for good in the world in order to be effective. It is horrific to think that those in great need require protection in some cases from their protectors. According to my latest information, no Irish troops have been implicated in this issue. That does not surprise me, having visited many of our troops abroad, and knowing their discipline. However, Ireland fully supports UN efforts to address this and believes all UN member states must work closely with the UN system to ensure that efforts are taken to eradicate sexual exploitation and abuse in peacekeeping operations in different parts of the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_52"> Ireland is strongly committed to its active role in UN peacekeeping operations and we are proud of our unbroken record of service over the last six decades. Today, over 540 Irish men and women are serving on UN peacekeeping duties. For these men and women, service with the UN is rightly regarded as noble and important. In order for the UN to continue with its good work, all troops and personnel deployed by the UN to peacekeeping missions must operate to the highest possible standards. During my attendance at the 72nd session of the UN General Assembly last September, I participated in a high-level meeting on the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse, convened by UN Secretary General António Guterres, where I supported the introduction of a voluntary compact on the elimination of cases of sexual exploitation and-or abuse by UN peacekeeping forces between the UN and peacekeeping contributory states. I welcome UN Secretary General Guterres' recent appointment of Jane Connors as the UN's first victims' rights advocate for victims of sexual exploitation and abuse. Ireland fully supports the placing of the rights and dignity of victims of sexual exploitation and abuse at the forefront of the UN's prevention and response efforts in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_53"> Any case of exploitation or abuse or any case where the trust placed in the UN by all of us is broken is a case too many. The UN can only meet its responsibilities as a force for good for our shared world if its staff and actions are beyond reproach. The UN must therefore have the systems and policies in place which provide transparency and accountability and Ireland will continue to support the Secretary General as he implements such policies.</p>

            <p eId="para_54">I too want to state that I fully support and have great respect for the United Nations peacekeepers and indeed the veterans, many of whom I saw on parade on St. Patrick's Day. They are recognised all over the world. I thank the Minister for his reply. As I noted earlier, official UN statistics reveal that over the past five years, the UN has recognised the claims of 612 women and children who said they were victims of abuse, involving 353 separate claims against UN staff in peacekeeping operations alone. Some officials claim that the allegations represent only the tip of the iceberg and that the figure could be up to ten times that amount. It is truly horrifying. Some incidents involved multiple women or children claiming that they were abused by more than one perpetrator. It has been reported that, in 121 cases, the victims said they had been made pregnant by their attacker, with many mothers being children themselves when they were abused. Since the beginning of last year, a total of 21 of the abuse allegations relate to children, with seven claiming that their abuser left them pregnant. Dianne Penn has reported in Africa Renewal Online that the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic, MINUSCA, says it has received details of allegations in the town of Bambari from a team of Human Rights Watch researchers.</p>

            <p eId="para_56">I share the Deputy's concerns. There are thousands of UN peacekeepers in dozens of countries across the world where civilians, in particular women and children, rely on UN peacekeepers to protect them. If that protection becomes exploitation at times, that cannot be allowed to go unchecked and we need to address it comprehensively. I think the UN is attempting to address this comprehensively. There are undoubtedly cases, some of which the Deputy has referred to, that have happened as recently as the past number of years. There needs to be a new and absolute no tolerance approach towards sexual exploitation and abuse that involves UN peacekeepers. I am glad to say that there is no evidence to suggest that Irish troops have been involved in any of this. Having said that, we are part of the UN structures as a whole and we need to be part of the solution here.</p>

            <p eId="para_57">The article states: "MINUSCA says there was 'sufficient initial evidence' that five of the victims were minors and had been sexually abused." The head of MINUSCA has already expressed his outrage and shame. He went on to say: "It's a sad day because I got to know and to see with my own eyes the depth of the problem and I have to say to start with, that there is not going to be a quick-fix on this matter, and that's the sad news." The article continues: "He told the troops that sexual abuse and exploitation was 'a double crime that affects the vulnerable women and children' they were sent to protect." As the Minister said, they are protecting very vulnerable people. We trust them and respect them highly in our country. It is a pity that their good names would be tarnished by these despicable actions of certain people from wherever or whatever country. They are sent to help very distressed and traumatised people, to mind them, nurture them and keep them safe. The very thought of them being exploited or abused is horrific.</p>

            <p eId="para_61">I seek as an honest an assessment as the Tánaiste can give on the possibility of calling a British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference as one of the potential mechanisms for unlocking the current impasse in the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. As we approach the 20th anniversary of the establishment of this incredible structure, it is particularly sad that the Good Friday Agreement is in such difficulty. What response, if any, has the Tánaiste received to his call for convening an Intergovernmental Conference? What would be the agenda of any such meeting?</p>

            <p eId="para_62">I share Deputy Eamon Ryan's frustration and concern as we approach the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, which was a transformative agreement for many people in Northern Ireland that laid the foundation for a peace process that has taken hold in the past two decades and resulted in the creation of an invisible border on the island of Ireland, a border we are seeking to protect from Brexit. The agreement has, at times, brought together political parties and communities that would otherwise have been polarised and divided. That said, there remains much work to be done, inspired, I hope, by the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement and using its structures to ensure that we can solve the current problems and impasse in terms of the lack of a devolved government at Stormont. Devolved government is a central piece of the Good Friday Agreement in terms of ensuring it works to facilitate structured North-South co-operation and devolved decision-making in Northern Ireland. In its absence, the Irish and British Governments regularly discuss how we will find a way forward to get devolved government back up and running because that is the only credible answer to how politics should function in Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_63"> When this issue was last raised - I believe it was Deputy Eamon Ryan who raised it - I made the point that I had, in conversation, asked the Secretary of State, Ms Karen Bradley, to think about convening a British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference at ministerial level. I will speak to the Secretary of State on the matter this week. At the time, she indicated she wanted to reflect on the matter, which was a reasonable response because any decision one makes has consequences and triggers reactions, responses and so on. I do not have a formal update for the Deputy. However, I will speak to the Secretary of State this week and we will see how things progress from there.</p>

            <p eId="para_64">Earlier this week. I spoke with my Green Party colleagues in the North, Stephen Agnew, MLA, and Clare Bailey, MLA, who gave a harsh assessment of what is happening. They are in constant contact with various community groups and other organisations that are effectively shutting up shop because the budgetary process is continuing and they are not receiving funding. The whole mechanism of local government and local community involvement is falling apart. This cannot go on because we have reached crisis point. My colleagues are on the ground and close to the political system and their assessment is that there is not a snowball's chance of a devolved administration or assembly returning. No one in the North believes that is on the cards in the foreseeable future for a range of complex reasons connected to Brexit and other matters. What happens if the Secretary of State says "No" or needs another two or three weeks to respond to the Tánaiste's request? What would that say to the community and other groups we work with, which are effectively operating under direct rule? They are not being given direction or shown fairness.</p>

            <p eId="para_65">I share many of the Deputy's concerns. The current impasse in Northern Ireland is very serious. That is why, when the devolved institutions are not functioning, it is important the two Governments work together, build a relationship based on trust and ensure that decisions are made in the best interests of people in Northern Ireland who rely on their sovereign Government, namely, the British Government, but also on the structures of the Good Friday Agreement, which provides the Irish Government with a consultative role in terms of some of the considerations that are needed now. Much thought is going into how best to proceed. We must do so without being in any way naive about the barriers, frustrations and blockages that are clearly in place, some of which linked to tension regarding Brexit, while others are linked to ongoing inquiries and conversations that are taking place in political parties. My approach is to listen to and consult all the political parties and ensure that the Government plays its role and fulfils its responsibility as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement in terms of the relationship it continues to have and in partnership with the British Government in the context of decisions that need to be made.</p>

            <p eId="para_66">While the Good Friday Agreement was a huge leap forward and set a great international example, it was not without flaws. For some time, the Green Party has been calling for a constitutional convention involving ordinary citizens in Northern Ireland similar to the Citizens' Assembly. We need to recognise that a range of mechanisms in the Northern Ireland administration and assembly need to be reformed because of their sectarian nature. For example, forcing Members of the Legislative Assembly, MLAs, to declare whether they are nationalists or unionists and the use of petitions of concern are deeply flawed structures. Rather than focusing discussions entirely on what I would describe as the sectarian end of the political spectrum in the North, why has the Government not engaged with the likes of my colleague, Stephen Agnew, to examine ideas that might break the impasse, particularly as no such ideas are coming from a sectarian position in terms of administration of the Good Friday Agreement? My colleagues are trying to make the agreement work and this will require change. Will the Tánaiste break out of the DUP-Sinn Féin hold on this issue and start broadening the political debate to try to break the impasse?</p>

            <p eId="para_67">The straight answer to the Deputy's question is "Yes". I have been open to listening to, discussing and debating with parties in Northern Ireland other than the DUP and Sinn Féin. I will be happy to speak to Green Party representatives in that regard. I speak to the SDLP, the Alliance Party and the Ulster Unionist Party and will continue to do so. We have an obligation to listen to everybody. All the parties, big and small, have a mandate and all of them, including the big two, want devolved government restored at Stormont. The question is how we can create a context that will allow this to happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_68"> The truth is that we cannot have devolved government if the two largest parties do not agree to work together to make it happen. We want to have a fully inclusive executive that involves all of the parties. Fundamentally, however, this will be very difficult in the absence of efforts by the two largest parties to accommodate each other in terms of a way forward. If it is not possible to do that in the short term, we will have to look at ways in which we can create stability in the medium term, while we try to put a context and structure in place that can ultimately deliver the outcome of devolved government. However, we also need to be careful not to question and undermine the Good Friday Agreement when trying to achieve this outcome because the agreement is the one certainty and foundation that we know works in terms of providing structures within which to work. This is why the Government is so committed to using the structures of the agreement to try to find a way through the current impasse. This is not the first time there has been an impasse in Northern Ireland that has posed significant difficulties. We need to find a way of overcoming the current impasse and I believe it is possible to do so.</p>

            <p eId="para_73">I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to put some facts on the table, as this is an issue for many Deputies who have contacted my office.</p>
            <p eId="para_74"> Between 1 January and 22 March, the Passport Service received more than 222,000 applications, an increase of 7% on the same period last year, which itself saw an increase on the previous year. The service is currently processing more than 70,000 passport applications. These are going through the normal checking, processing and security stages. There is a significant security element involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_75"> The turnaround timeframe for a passport application will depend in the first instance on the channel through which the application is submitted. The target turnaround time for applications made via the online passport application service is ten working days plus postage time. Approximately half of online applications are currently being processed within five working days, which is well ahead of target. The award winning online service accommodates adult renewals and passport card applications and it is planned to extend this service to children and all other categories of renewals by the end of this year. Whether residing in Ireland or overseas, I urge applicants wishing to renew their passports to avail of the online passport application service where possible, as it allows us to make decisions more quickly.</p>
            <p eId="para_76"> The average turnaround time for renewal applications submitted through passport express, which is the postal service, is currently 14 working days, one day ahead of the target turnaround time of 15 working days. Other types of application submitted through passport express, such as first-time applications and applications to replace lost, stolen or damaged passports, take longer due to additional security checks.</p>
            <p eId="para_77"> In recent weeks, we have had higher than average turnaround times for some categories of application owing to high application volumes and disruption caused by adverse weather conditions and the subsequent closure of the Dublin and Cork passport offices for two days. However, the turnaround times have considerably reduced and in many cases are now shorter than the published target times.</p>
            <p eId="para_78"> My Department continues to monitor the level of passport demand closely to ensure that all resources are effectively deployed. Additional measures taken by the Passport Service this year include the recruitment of additional staff and the use of targeted overtime.</p>
            <p eId="para_79">
              <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_80"> I am pleased to say that over 20 permanent staff have recently joined the Passport Service's existing 322 full-time equivalent staff. Furthermore, the Passport Service has received sanction this year for 220 temporary clerical officers to be appointed to the passport offices in Dublin and Cork. The majority of these officers are already in place. Targeted overtime for the Passport Service was also sanctioned to increase processing capacity.</p>
            <p eId="para_81"> In managing increasing application volumes, my Department's approach has not been merely to recruit or assign additional staff, but to continue to implement service improvements in order to provide an exceptional service and minimise the impact high application volumes have on turnaround times. The passport reform programme is delivering major upgrades to the passport service technology platforms and business processes as well as significant customer service improvements. The award winning online passport application service will continue to make a major contribution to the effective management of application volumes by allowing existing resources to be more effectively deployed within the Passport Service.</p>

            <p eId="para_82">I thank the Tánaiste for his reply. There have been considerable demands for passports to be issued. I welcome the online service, which was introduced recently, but people have told me that the 14-day turnaround when applying via An Post leaves their schedules tight. I appeal to everyone. People are now preparing for their holidays, so the first thing they should do is ensure that their passports are in date. Every constituency office in the country is visited by numerous people who, having already booked their holidays, are now looking for passports because a child or someone else does not have one. It is important that the Passport Service and we as public representatives send out a message so that people avoid finding out at the last moment that they cannot travel on their holidays or for events.</p>
            <p eId="para_83"> On behalf of Deputy Heydon, I thank the Tánaiste for the answers he has provided.</p>

            <p eId="para_84">I refer the Deputy to the additional information contained in my reply.</p>
            <p eId="para_85"> I am more than aware of the problems that we have faced with passports in recent weeks. Passport offices were closed for processing and the machines were turned off for two days because of extreme weather conditions. We could not bring staff in - it was not safe. When the service is processing in or around 70,000 passport applications at any given time, such a closure will have a major impact. However, we are getting back on top of it. We are again ahead of the target processing times even though there was a great deal of significant disruption in recent weeks. Many Deputies contacted my office about this matter on behalf of their constituents. I hope that we were able to resolve the emergency cases and that we will be able to return to an efficiently run system after the significant interruption, which was outside our control. We have made up for that by using extra staff and overtime to get the processing times back under the targets.</p>

            <p eId="para_86">I acknowledge the work done by the Tánaiste, his staff and the officials. When I dealt with them about emergency passports in the past 12 months, they were accommodating and helpful in every way. The Tánaiste referred to 70,000 applications, which is a large number. With Brexit and the current level of demand for Irish passports, staff are doing a significant amount of work. I am sure that we would all like to thank them for what they have done, their understanding and their help. It is only right and proper that we acknowledge that.</p>

            <p eId="para_87">In an effort to get the process back on track, there was no bank holiday Monday for the staff in the passport offices. They were in working, trying to get the turnaround times back to where we wanted them to be under the target threshold. There is a considerable commitment to making up for the shock to the system that came with the severe weather, which resulted in the passport offices having to close for two days.</p>
            <p eId="para_88"> We are seeing an unprecedented number of applications. There was a significant increase last year on the year before and it looks like there will be another significant increase this year. We are gearing up to deal with that. Last year, we introduced many reforms to use technology more efficiently. More and more people are using the online system, which we will expand this year to all passport applications for children as well as adults. We are responding to increased demand and shocks to the system. I encourage everyone who is listening, including parents and families, to please check their passports early in the year so that they can get renewals when they are required instead of approaching us at the last minute and interrupting the whole system, since we must stop the process to pull out a passport for someone on an emergency basis, which slows the system down for everyone else.</p>

            <p eId="para_94"> That conversation has taken place at various times, including last summer when the all-party talks were in play and later when there was a focus on what were essentially two-party talks that both Governments were trying to facilitate. We have had conversations with the parties at different times about whether an independent chair would be helpful.</p>
            <p eId="para_95">One gets different feedback from different parties. There was certainly a view from the two larger parties that they wanted to try to do this on their own, together. There was a view from some of the other parties that there was a need to bring in an independent chair and broaden this out to make sure that all the parties were involved in the discussions. I have an open mind on it. If it would help, of course we will do it, but Northern Ireland is in a different place now from where it was 20 years ago when there was a need for high profile involvement and intervention to try to encourage people to make this huge step, which was the Good Friday Agreement. Parties have worked together for many years since then, in devolved government and outside devolved government, and there is a sense that the parties know each other very well and that we should be able to try to find accommodation for each other without having to bring in an independent chair. That being said, we are looking at all options now and anything that will help progress conversations that can lead to an Executive being re-established is something to which we are very open.</p>

            <p eId="para_96">I hear what the Tánaiste is saying about how matters have advanced during the past 20 years but the Assembly has not been sitting in the North of Ireland since January 2017 and there is no prospect of that happening, at least in the short term. In view of all the complicating factors, such as the attempts to get the Assembly up and running and have self-governance in the North of Ireland, and the challenges, of which the Tánaiste is well aware, with which he is dealing on a daily basis in terms of Brexit and how that will impact on the island of Ireland, and in particular on the North of Ireland, we may need to consider, given that it is almost 18 month since the Assembly sat, the need to move the process on to a another level. I hear what the Tánaiste is saying about the way matters have worked during the past 20 years, but we have reached a juncture where I believe an independent chair is required. How long more can matters drift without action being taken to try to bring the parties together in the interests of all of us on the island, and particularly those in the North of Ireland, as we go deeper into the Brexit negotiations to make sure an Assembly is up and running in the North?</p>

            <p eId="para_97">I do not disagree with any of that. The question is what new structures would be helpful in terms of bringing this process forward and is an independent chair part of that. I do not think the two Governments are in any way precious about that. What we want is to try to respond in a way that helps the parties - by that I mean all parties, not only the big two - to come together to accommodate each other to form a fully inclusive Executive, and currently it is a big challenge to do that. Often before agreements were made there was a lot of pessimism. The job of the two Governments is to work together, to trust each other and to try to bring about a situation whereby the political environment changes. That is what we have to do in the coming weeks and months. There may well be a role for an independent chair as part of a new process but we need to determine how that process will work for us. Simply naming a new chair on its own certainly will not take this process forward.</p>

            <p eId="para_98">The easiest thing to do would be to name a new chair. The two Governments trust each other and are involved in the negotiations, and the Brexit negotiations are taking place at another table. Decisions regarding the North of Ireland, the Border and all of that are crucial for the island of Ireland. In light of the discussions the Tánaiste is having with all the parties in the North, does he believe that an independent chair would move the process forward in attempt to get a resolution and secure self-governance? I understand the point the Tánaiste made that the easiest thing to do would be to name a chair, but does he believe there is a willingness among the parties to accept an independent chair at this juncture?</p>

            <p eId="para_99">I think different parties have different views; that is the straight answer to the Deputy's question. I think some parties would need some persuasion that introducing an independent chair at this stage would be helpful because I am not sure that it is right now. What the Governments need to do, and what we will be doing, is discussing how the two Governments, working together, can help to create a context and, in time, put a structure in place that can allow for a political negotiation to result in a willingness to set up devolved government and an Assembly again. There is work to do in that area, and I have to say I am concerned about the polarisation in Northern Ireland right now. Some of that is linked to Brexit and some of it is linked to a frustration about a lack of progress in terms of devolved government. That impacts on the capacity of many community projects and so on that rely on political decision making for support and they are very uncertain about their future and future funding models and so on. There was a need for a budget to be passed in Westminster to try to provide financial certainty at least for the moment, and we support that. There is a need for political structures to be in place to ensure that political decisions can be made in Northern Ireland which cannot be made at the moment.</p>

            <p eId="para_104">I also welcome the delegation. I had the pleasure of having lunch with the Deputy Prime Minister and his delegation yesterday. The relationship between Ireland and Singapore is growing stronger every year, and I thank him for being here.</p>
            <p eId="para_105"> I am glad the Deputy raised this question. The treatment of Palestinian minors under the Israeli occupation and military justice system has long been an issue of concern for us, which we have discussed here and which the Government has raised with the Israeli authorities and at EU and international level, including statements by Ireland at the UN Human Rights Council. I have expressed these concerns directly to Israeli leaders during my recent visit to the region in January. Despite occasional improvements on specific details, worsening aspects have been accurately tracked in reports such as those by UNICEF recently and Israeli non-governmental organisations, NGOs, with whom we have contacts. </p>
            <p eId="para_106"> For me, the bottom line is that Palestinian children are clearly subject to widespread treatment which Israel would - correctly - consider to be unacceptable for its own children. The case to which the Deputy refers is one which exhibits many issues that concern us. First, there is the way in which protest against the occupation can be criminalised and suppressed. Second, there is the exertion of political pressure in Israel to press the military authorities to take heavy handed and highly publicised action against a Palestinian family who posed no genuine security threat. Third, there is the treatment of Palestinian minors and their families to pressure them to accept plea bargains which then supposedly justify the whole process.</p>
            <p eId="para_107"> I believe that the Israeli authorities should re-examine these approaches in this case and in others. Until they do so, the image of Israel and the legal system imposed on Palestinians in occupied territory will be gravely impaired.</p>

            <from>Deputy Gino Kenny<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T11:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_108">Since 2002, some 1,200 children have been imprisoned in Israeli jails and currently 350 children are in Israeli jails. Most of these children were prosecuted for simply throwing stones at the occupiers in their towns and villages. These children are subjected to torture, ill treatment and abuse.</p>
            <p eId="para_109">The conclusion from the UNICEF report Children in Israeli Military Detention is damning of the Israeli prison system. It states:</p>
            <p eId="para_110">... the ill-treatment of children who come in contact with the military detention system appears to be widespread, systematic and institutionalized throughout the process, from the moment of arrest until the child's prosecution and eventual conviction and sentencing.</p>
            <p eId="para_111">It is understood that in no other country are children systematically tried by juvenile military courts ...</p>
            <p eId="para_112">This blatantly goes against the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and international law. Israel is the only country in the world that prosecutes children in military courts.</p>
            <p eId="para_113"> Did the Tánaiste raise the issue with the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr. Netanyahu, when he visited Israel in January? Did he raise the case of Ahed Tamimi?</p>

            <from>Deputy Simon Coveney<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T11:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_114">On the Tamimi case, Irish and other EU diplomats attended the hearings in the military court as the case developed. An officer from Ireland's representative office in Ramallah was present in the court last Thursday when sentencing took place. During my visit to the Middle East in January, I raised directly with Israeli authorities my concerns about the detention of minors, as well as the issues of night-time arrests and blindfolding. I recalled that the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child entails obligations to use detention only as a means of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period in the case of minors.</p>
            <p eId="para_115"> I have raised this particular case and also the general issue of how minors are treated within the occupied territories. It is damaging to Israel's reputation internationally and that is why it is in everybody's interest to change the approach. My approach to the issue, as the Deputy knows, is to be blunt and discuss with all sides the issues of occupation and settlements. I will continue to have that conversation with the Israeli authorities and also with the Palestinians.</p>

            <p eId="para_116">While that all sounds well and good, most Irish people will ask why we treat Israel like a normal state - like any other state in the EU or across the world. Israel is an abnormal state. It is an apartheid state that detains not only children but also hundreds of thousands of ordinary Palestinians fighting against occupation. There are similarities between apartheid South Africa and apartheid Israel. We should not engage in any trade whatsoever with the state of Israel. Most people in the House probably do not know that we have imported €14.5 million worth of Israeli military goods. That military equipment is being used by the Irish military and it is being used by the Israeli military against Palestinians.</p>

            <p eId="para_140">The Government has consistently conveyed to the US Administration and congressional leaders the priority which Ireland attaches to immigration reform in the United States, while at all times respecting that US immigration policy is a matter solely for the US authorities to formulate and implement.</p>
            <p eId="para_141"> In encouraging our friends in the US towards immigration reform, we have two key objectives: increased pathways for legal migration by Irish citizens to the US and relief for the plight of undocumented Irish citizens living in the US.</p>
            <p eId="para_142"> In that regard, the Taoiseach discussed the issue with President Trump in the Oval Office on 15 March and also in his meetings on Capitol Hill during the St. Patrick’s Day visit. This long-standing tradition of meetings at the highest level in Washington around St. Patrick’s Day affords Ireland a unique opportunity to engage with the US Administration and congressional leaders at the highest level on issues of particular interest to Ireland, including immigration reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_143"> I had previously raised the issue with the then Secretary of State, Mr. Tillerson, when I visited Washington last month.</p>
            <p eId="para_144"> The Government’s special envoy to the United States Congress on the undocumented, Deputy Deasy, has also been very active, while our Embassy in Washington DC is engaged with the Administration and with contacts on Capitol Hill on an ongoing basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_145"> Through these many high-level contacts and discussions, the Government has been exploring a number of different options, including the possibility of a reciprocal agreement covering the undocumented Irish in the US, on the one hand, and US citizens looking to move to Ireland, on the other.</p>
            <p eId="para_146"> However, this remains a very challenging issue and I do not want to raise expectations unduly. Immigration reform has been a divisive issue within the US political system for decades, with pronounced disagreement, even within the same political parties, on the best way to deal with an issue which directly affects approximately 11 million people.</p>
            <p eId="para_147"> In that context, finding a solution for the thousands of undocumented Irish in the US is still a difficult task, but we are trying to make progress on it.</p>

            <p eId="para_148">I thank the Tánaiste for his reply. As I said at the outset, the plight of the undocumented is well known, with between 10,000 and 50,000 people affected. I ask the Tánaiste to take this opportunity to clarify his understanding of the numbers affected. When we hear figures, sometimes we do not think of the individuals behind them. I recently met a widow at a clinic in Granard. She can only visit her son when she can go to America. Thankfully, her grandchildren can come back because they are US citizens. She said to me, with a tear in her eye, that she is getting much older and she does not know for how much longer she will be able for the journey to the United States.</p>
            <p eId="para_149"> The Tánaiste said that the Taoiseach raised the issue again most recently at the St. Patrick's Day celebrations, which is welcome. How realistic does he think it is that we will be able to enter a bilateral reciprocal visa arrangement with the US, similar to that which, I understand, the US has with Australia?</p>

            <p eId="para_154">I endorse what Deputy Troy said on the need to keep the immigration reform issue at the top of the agenda. The embassy and the consulates do excellent work on this in the United States, but it is extremely important that immigration reform is also kept at the top of the political agenda.</p>
            <p eId="para_155">I ask the Minister to ensure that this proposal regarding a reciprocal arrangement similar to the Australian E-3 visa be given urgent consideration as well. Like Deputy Troy, I attended a funeral of a family friend within the past number of weeks. Her daughter, who had been in the US for 14 years, was unable to return home for her mother's funeral. She had not seen her since she emigrated. Understandably, this was a major upset for a family. Mr. Ciaran Staunton's lobby group has put forward a proposal relating to the need to formally request the US Embassy to lift the three and ten-year ban on returning Irish immigrants. As the Minister knows, there are some undocumented Irish who are in a position to regularise their status through investment visas or sponsorship visas. At present, however, a person who would take that route must come home to finalise that application. They will then not get back to the US. I understand that there is an arrangement for some countries whereby this can be done in the US. The lobby groups are anxious that the Minister pursue this immediately with the United States Embassy to allow people to finalise such visa applications in the US because if they return to Ireland, they will not be allowed back into the US.</p>

            <p eId="para_156">I will follow up on the issue raised at the end of the Deputy's contribution. It is very important that I do not raise expectations that we can solve this issue easily. I have been in this House for nearly 20 years, as have many others. I and others have been to Washington many times trying to deal with the issue of the undocumented Irish. There have been false dawns over and over again. We have been quietly working to try to find a way forward that could create a reciprocal arrangement whereby we would facilitate US citizens who may want to retire or come to Ireland and on the other side, we would get access to visas for Irish people in the US and Irish people who may want to go to the US. That is something the Taoiseach discussed directly with President Trump. It is something I discussed with Rex Tillerson, although he has now moved on. A process and a discussion are under way. A legislative vehicle is needed to do that, which means getting support on Capitol Hill for that and having a sponsor and appropriate legislation and so on. There are many components to a potential solution and there are potential blockages with each one of them even though I think there is goodwill towards what we are trying to do on the part of many key players, including the President. We will continue to work on that in a way I hope does not raise too much expectation but tries to get an outcome. Deputy Deasy has done a really good piece of work in this area with quiet, firm diplomacy, if one wants to call it that, over many months to try to find a way forward that may work. Time will tell in the coming weeks whether we can get something significant across the line.</p>

            <p eId="para_160">I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 102 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_161"> Dealing with long outstanding issues relating to the legacy of the conflict in Northern Ireland is of the utmost importance to the Government. The programme for Government highlights this priority with specific reference to implementation of the all-party Dáil motions relating to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. </p>
            <p eId="para_162"> I acknowledge also those across the House who work on a cross-party basis with the Government on this issue and the tireless efforts of Justice for the Forgotten. I will be meeting with Justice for the Forgotten in the coming weeks to hear its views and update it on the Government's continuing engagement on legacy issues, including with the British Government on the Dáil motions.</p>
            <p eId="para_163"> The all-party motion on the 1974 Dublin-Monaghan bombings that was adopted by the Dáil on 25 May 2016 has, like those adopted in 2008 and 2011, been conveyed to the British Government. These motions call on the British Government to allow access by an independent, international judicial figure to all original documents relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, as well as the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973, the bombing of Kay’s Tavern in Dundalk and the murder of Seamus Ludlow. The Government is committed to actively pursuing the implementation of these all-party motions and has consistently raised the issue with the British Government. </p>
            <p eId="para_164"> I am actively engaged with the British Government on an ongoing basis on this issue, as are officials from my Department. I discussed the matter on a number of occasions with the former Secretary of State, James Brokenshire, and I will continue to pursue the issue directly with his successor, Karen Bradley. </p>
            <p eId="para_165"> As part of this engagement, the Government underlines that the Dáil motions represent the consensus political view in Ireland that an independent, international judicial review of all the relevant documents is required to establish the full facts of the Dublin-Monaghan atrocities. I have also advised that the absence of a response from the British Government is of deep concern to the Government and indeed this House and I have emphasised the urgent need for such a response. The Government will continue to engage with the British Government on the request relating to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and pursue all possible avenues that could achieve progress on this issue consistent with the request made by this House. </p>
            <p eId="para_166"> On the broader legacy issues, we are putting together legislation that can allow for hearings to be heard for inquests in Northern Ireland relating to some of the other legacy cases and hearings that will be taking place in order that we can essentially have a cross-jurisdictional hearing system in the High Court in Dublin to ensure that Ireland does everything it can to make sure that any information linked to legacy cases can be accessed and fully heard and understood in the context of hearings. </p>

            <p eId="para_167">I cannot but be struck by the irony there. We expel a Russian diplomat. Leaving aside the threat to our neutrality, I will go back to the Minister's words. He said that Ireland had a choice to either show active solidarity with our closest neighbour or sit on our hands and do nothing. That is what British Governments have been doing for almost 44 years. They have sat on their hands and done absolutely nothing on this issue. There is no indication that the British Government will reciprocate the solidarity the Minister is anxious to show regarding that other situation. The language of the Minister's reply is the same language I have been getting from other Ministers. It is all very nice. The Government is going to actively pursue the matter, it is a major priority, there is a commitment in the programme for Government, the urgent need, deep concern, etc. but nothing has happened. It is almost as if it is a case of wearing down the relatives and Justice for the Forgotten so they will give up and go away but they are not going to give up and go away. The British Government has shown absolute contempt for the three motions that have been passed here.</p>

            <p eId="para_168">I concur with Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan regarding speaking out of both sides of our mouths regarding how we treated the recent Russian episode and how the people of Ireland have been treated by the British authorities. It is 44 years since the atrocity when 33 people were killed, including an unborn child. These families continue to suffer. They are stopped at every avenue when it comes to getting to the truth. These families need truth, honesty and, most of all, transparency if they are to begin, and only begin, the healing process regarding the atrocity and tragedies they suffered. I must concur with the Deputy and ask that the Minister does everything in his power to get these families the answers they deserve. Margaret Irwin is one of the people who is very much to the fore in Justice for the Forgotten. It feels as though these people are being led a merry dance, are being led round and round in circles and are still not getting the answers they deserve.</p>

            <p eId="para_169">In respect of the issues raised by the two Deputies, I take umbrage at times when reference is made to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings despite their importance. I was glad to hear the Minister reference the Kay's Tavern bombing and the case of Seamus Ludlow because the Dundalk bombing had an impact as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_170">Quite a number of the people we are meeting in respect of legacy issues through the Good Friday Agreement just want closure as opposed to individuals coming to trial. How far advanced are we in achieving a similar arrangement to that relating to the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains in respect of facilitating people who were not prosecuted to give evidence in order to allow closure for families that are really distressed? All they want is the truth of the situation. They are not necessarily looking for redress at this stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_171">The Tánaiste quite rightly referred to the three motions passed unanimously by Dáil Éireann calling on the British Government to give an international eminent legal person access to the papers and files pertaining to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. The Tánaiste also referenced the work of the cross-party group. His predecessor as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, had an arrangement to regularly update Deputies Crowe and Maureen O'Sullivan and me, as representatives of the cross-party group, on the ongoing talks with the British Government and the Secretary of State. Perhaps it would be possible to reconstitute that arrangement.</p>

            <p eId="para_172">I share the frustrations that have just been outlined. I am happy to reconstitute the cross-party group. I spent some time with victims of atrocities and their quest for the truth is powerful. Hopefully, we will soon see an opening of a public consultation process in respect of the introduction of new legislation consistent with the Stormont House Agreement in terms of legacy structures, inquests and the funding required to see that through. It is in that context that we will continue to pursue the reasonable requests of the families concerned and those advocating on their behalf. It is suggested that some may think the families will give up and go away. I do not believe they will. I assure the Deputies that the requests coming from the Irish Government in respect of this issue are not going to go away either.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T12:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_173">For far too many children, Ireland has become an unresponsive, hard and cruel place in which to live. There is a fundamental lack of political prioritisation of the needs of children. Too many children in Ireland are homeless. Too many children are living in poverty. Too many children have to wait far too long for hospital appointments, be it for outpatient or inpatient treatment. The position regarding access to mental health services for children and young people is shocking and unacceptable. The position regarding access to speech and language therapy, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and many other therapies is equally unacceptable. The lack of access to such therapies is appalling, particularly when they are critical in terms of the development of a child. For some children with special needs, access to special schools and school placement can be a very challenging journey, with very little advocacy for the child within the special education sector. The parents have to do all of the heavy lifting and beg for school placements, many of them sub-optimal in terms of the needs of the child. There are over 3,000 children who are homeless and living in emergency accommodation but there are thousands more living with their grandparents, uncles and aunts. The stress which we all see every week in our clinics is very distressing indeed to witness and very difficult on the families concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_174"> Mental health services, although there is a lot of rhetoric, are clearly sub-optimal. There were 6,000 children waiting for primary care psychology appointments at the end of January 2018. Of these, 1,600 had been waiting over a year. Some 2,500 children and young people were waiting for appointments with child and adolescent mental health services. Of these, 350 had been waiting more than 12 months. I can go on. There were 15,000 children waiting more than a year for outpatient appointments and this month there are close to 9,000 children who have been waiting over 18 months for outpatient appointments. When he was Minister for Health, the Taoiseach pledged that this would be ended by the close of 2015. That has not happened and the numbers have gone up tenfold since.</p>
          <p eId="para_175"> The fundamental question I put to the Taoiseach is why services for children across the board, in so many areas, are so difficult to access. Why are waiting times so long in so many areas? Is the Government not ashamed of the very poor political prioritisation given to children's needs in our society? Can the Taoiseach explain the absence of such political prioritisation?</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T12:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_176">I am afraid I cannot agree with the Deputy's thesis and assessment regarding this Government's commitment to children and our response to the needs of children and the need to support their families. I would argue that the needs of children are actually at the heart of what the Government does. We invest in children because we know it makes sense; investment in children gives them opportunities for the future and, if anything, will save us money in the future. Providing care for children and support for education and health care is very much a large part of what the Government does.</p>
          <p eId="para_177"> Looking back over the seven years I have been in government, to give a few examples of what is not just rhetoric but is real action and real substance, there was: the establishment, for the first time, of a full Minister for Children and Youth Affairs sitting at the Cabinet table as well as of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs; there was the establishment of Tusla, a dedicated agency for child protection, because the HSE was not prioritising it enough; and, after many years of promises, mandatory reporting was brought in last December. The introduction of subsidised child care was, again, talked about for decades and is now a reality. Everyone between the ages of six months and three years, for example, receives subsidised child care. There are two years of free preschool education where there was only one before - and none before that. In education, there are record numbers of special needs assistants, SNAs. We have never had more SNAs in our education system. That is a recognition of the need that is there. In health, as I mentioned before, in the past, children with severe disabilities in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance got a medical card based on their parents' income. That was the case when the Deputy served as Minister for Health. We changed all that and now children with severe disabilities, 40,000 of them, get a medical card as a right regardless of their parents' income, and no longer face the kind of reviews that caused people enormous worry in the past, including in all those decades when Fianna Fáil was in office.</p>

          <p eId="para_179">We have introduced free GP care for all children under six. The national children's hospital, promised again and again by previous Governments and previous Ministers for Health, is now under construction. The third storey is up on the satellite unit in Blanchardstown. Child poverty is falling again, at least according to the CSO's survey on income and living conditions, having risen a lot during the economic crisis. Just this week, an increase was made to the family income supplement, lifting low-paid working families out of poverty; there was an increase in the one-parent family payment and, for the first time in a very long time - perhaps ten years - an increase in payments to people on welfare who have a dependent child. That is just a short list of a few things the Government has done in the past couple of years.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> In the limited time I have left, I would say that we absolutely acknowledge that a lot more needs to be done and we are committed to doing that.</p>

          <p eId="para_181">The Taoiseach ignored all of the key areas that I outlined in my question. The fundamental point is that children in need, who are homeless or who require special interventions, particularly children with special needs, are not getting them and are waiting far too long, be it any of the therapies the Taoiseach wants to mention. Since the Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Health, gave a pledge that no one would be waiting longer than 18 months by the end of 2015, the number on that waiting list has gone up tenfold. All of the Taoiseach's own targets in the areas of mental health, therapeutic intervention, and childhood assessment under the Disability Act, have become worse and worse as the months go on. There are over 4,000 children waiting for an assessment. Early intervention is the key to a child fulfilling his or her potential. By any yardstick or metric, the Government is failing dramatically in respect of those targets. The Taoiseach can ask Barnardos, which knows a thing or two about the needs of children. It has stated this and called it the forgotten scandal in our society. I would appreciate if the Taoiseach could address more meaningfully the questions relating to mental health services access for children, special needs access for children and so on, the position in respect of which is quite shocking.</p>

          <p eId="para_183">I acknowledge that much more needs to be done in the areas mentioned, whether in child mental health services or housing. The rising number of homeless children distresses us all and requires us to focus even more on the work that we do as a Government. One of the major investments we are making in the area of housing other than building houses - and it will be many years before our housing supply is at the correct level - is the investment in family hubs, which helps to reduce the number of children in hotels and bed and breakfasts. I have visited family hubs and spoken to the people who are living there. I have seen the quality of accommodation that is available there. It is, of course, only a temporary, inadequate solution to the problem of child homelessness.</p>
          <p eId="para_184"> We will continue to invest in family hubs and to reduce the number of people - families in particular - who have to live in hotels and bed and breakfasts, while we do what needs to be done, which is the building of vast amounts of social and affordable housing. The Deputy will know that Project Ireland 2040 provides for 110,000 new homes for social housing tenants to be built over the next ten years. </p>

          <p eId="para_185">There was a harrowing, heartbreaking letter from a victim of rape carried in <i>The Irish Times</i> on Monday. I do not know if the Taoiseach has read it. This person was a victim of marital rape and the letter was shocking. The author wrote bravely and with considerable dignity. Her words reflected the trauma of being sexually assaulted and the additional horror inflicted when the perpetrator is one's intimate partner. She describes being terrified for hours the night she was attacked. She wrote:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_186">I was threatened with a knife, I was threatened with being raped a second time until I promised to stay in the relationship. For the remainder of the night I was threatened with being killed unless I promised that I would stay.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">Her child witnessed this.</p>
          <p eId="para_188"> The crime was punished and the perpetrator was sentenced. However, the woman expresses her deep anger and distress at the news in February that the sentence of the perpetrator of her rape was to be reduced by two years. She explained that "Every day of those ... years counted for us", and how the reduction in the initial sentence has robbed her, as she puts it, of her "peace of mind and freedom". The victim believes that the judges did not take seriously enough the gravity of the offence against her, that is, the offence of marital rape. She feels abandoned and let down by the judicial system. </p>
          <p eId="para_189"> I have raised the issues of inconsistency, leniency and light sentences, particularly those related to sexual crime, in this House previously.</p>

          <p eId="para_197">There are significant issues relating to inconsistencies, leniency and light sentencing, particularly when it comes to sexual crime. I believe this underlines the need for sentencing guidelines. I understand that the Judicial Council Bill 2017 contains provision for a sentencing information committee. However, it does not recommend the drafting of guidelines, and as such I believe it will prove far too weak and will therefore not have the desired effect. This sends a dangerous message to victims generally and to society at large, because the case I have described is by no means unique. It is by no means isolated. There are many others. I have previously urged the Government to face up to that fact and to take the appropriate action.</p>
          <p eId="para_198"> I have commended the adoption of the sentencing council model as the way forward. I have outlined its merits in terms of consistency, accountability and the appropriate involvement of stakeholders. I want to know if the Government will now adopt that approach and adopt guidelines for sentencing. </p>

          <p eId="para_199">I have not seen that letter, but there was an article on the front page of <i>The Irish Times</i> during the week which I believe covered the case the Deputy is referring to. I read that article. Rape is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed on any individual, whether on a man or a woman, and it is particularly serious and egregious when that crime is perpetrated by a husband, wife or family member, particularly when the victim is a child. Everyone in the House will agree with those sentiments.</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> The Domestic Violence Bill is making its way through these Houses at the moment. The Domestic Violence Bill passed Committee Stage in this House as recently as this morning and I appeal to all parties in this House to co-operate with the Government to help get that Bill passed. The Opposition can really help the Government on this by making sure that we do not have unnecessary amendments or repetitive debates. We can all work together to get that through, and I would appeal to all parties to help us with that. In addition, the Judicial Council Bill 2017 is before the Seanad. That Bill potentially provides for the making of sentencing guidelines, which is something the Government is very keen to explore with Opposition parties. </p>
          <p eId="para_201"> We do, however, have to make a distinction between guidelines and mandatory sentencing. We have separation of powers in this country. Judges sit through entire cases for days and days, something we do not do. They hear all of the evidence and all sides of the story, including any mitigating factors. I am not referring to any particular case but am speaking generally. It is not right for us, having not sat through these cases and heard the evidence, to second-guess the judgments made, because, ultimately, it is the judges who sit through those cases for days and days, hear all of the evidence, all of the arguments and all of the circumstances and ultimately come up with a sentence on that basis. I do not believe that it is correct that people who do not do what judges do should second-guess their decisions. Having said that, nobody agrees with inconsistency in sentencing, and if there is room for guidelines in that area we are certainly happy to explore that with other parties. </p>

          <p eId="para_204">I am not presuming for a second to second-guess any member of the Judiciary. This case went through the courts. The accused was found guilty. The sentence was handed down and the matter was then appealed. That all happened. Furthermore, I am not referring to mandatory sentences. I have raised this issue many times and I am simply highlighting again the fact that there is now a deep disquiet in large sections of society in terms of consistency and leniency of sentences handed down. This woman was not second-guessing anything either. She lived through this horror, not just as a witness to it but as the victim of it. She has now set out her experience in the clearest of terms and it is not unique.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> The Judicial Council Bill 2017 does not, as it currently stands, allow for sentencing guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">However, my colleague Deputy Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire has moved amendments that would allow that to happen. I want a commitment from the Taoiseach that those amendments will be not just considered, but adopted. We have debated this with the Taoiseach many times and this is the only way in which we can build the kind of confidence and trust that the Judiciary deserves in respect of serious crime and the sentences handed down.</p>

          <p eId="para_207">I will talk about what we can do about this, because I think we are largely in agreement that we need to take action in this area to support victims and ensure the perpetrators receive sentences they should receive. We can work together as parties in two ways. First, there is the Judicial Council Bill 2017, which Deputy McDonald mentioned. It is before the Seanad currently. It proposes to establish a judicial council. Perhaps a judicial council would be the right body to draw up sentencing guidelines rather than Parliament. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, says that he would be happy to discuss that as part of the debate when that Bill enters this House, so I would encourage that this is done.</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> I also mentioned the Domestic Violence Bill 2017. This Bill specifically provides that where the victim of a sexual assault was in an intimate relationship with the offender, that will be treated as an aggravating factor for sentencing purposes. If this Bill passes, if somebody who has been subjected to a rape or sexual assault by someone who is known to them, by someone they have an intimate relationship with, that will be seen as an aggravated offence for sentencing purposes. As I say, that Bill has passed through the Seanad. It has passed through Committee Stage. I now appeal to Opposition parties to allow us to get that through Report Stage quickly. Let us have it enacted before the end of next month.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T12:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_209">To paraphrase the unfortunate words of a UK special adviser on 9/11, yesterday was a good day to bury bad news. While the Government was taking the unprecedented step of expelling a Russian diplomat in solidarity with another country, the Taoiseach's Department managed to get out the bad news, publishing the reports on the strategic communications unit and the Collins report on the Department of Justice and Equality. Despite the report finding no evidence of wrongdoing, the Government has decided to wind down the unit. The defence put forward by Ministers, do not hit me with a civil servant in my arms, completely misses the point. It was a Government decision to establish the unit and politicise Government communications.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> These are important matters, but pale in comparison with the report published today. The Central Statistics Office, CSO, is an independent agency of this State which gathers information on economic, social and general activities and conditions in Ireland. It plays an essential role in informing the people and policymakers. It is independent but answerable to the Department of the Taoiseach. Today, it has published crime statistics for the first time since last June, a remarkable fact in itself. Those figures show a substantial increase in homicides. They show that there has been an 18% increase in reported homicides, an additional 234 incidents between 2003 and 2016. A caveat has been added to the previous CSO data of 2015. The statistics have been published under reservation, an action that is doubly troubling to those of us who place our trust in the institutions of this State. The independent agency has made observations about the recording and classification of crime. These crimes cover infanticide, dangerous driving causing death, manslaughter and murder. As I say, the revisions go back over 15 years to 2003, with an average of 18 extra deaths now classified as homicides each year. It is a matter of serious concern and has come to light due to the work of two civilian officers in the Garda statistics unit.</p>
          <p eId="para_211"> That homicides figures might have been reduced surreptitiously or by poor practice is an affront to our society. The public needs to have confidence that we have accurate recordings of the most serious crimes, that they are properly investigated and that our statistics are accurately reported. The Garda Commissioner has said that he is concerned about the shortage of supervision in the force. This echoes the criticism of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, about the shortage of supervisors. What action will the Taoiseach take to ensure our front-line gardaí are provided with the training and supervision that they need? Moreover, in light of the revelations about homicide statistics, will there be an independent investigation into how this happened? What other areas of crime statistics are currently being reviewed?</p>

          <p eId="para_212">Yesterday was a busy day for Government. As on every Tuesday when the Dáil is in session we had a Cabinet meeting. There were 31 items on the Cabinet agenda yesterday, so many items that we had to have a morning meeting and an evening meeting. The items ranged from the Collins report to the discussion on Russia to abortion legislation, so while the Opposition may be obsessed with Government communications, I can totally reassure the House that the Government is obsessed with getting its work done. After we have got it done, then we communicate and that is the way things should be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> The crime statistics produced by the CSO were only published at 11 a.m. this morning. I have not had a chance to study them or review them at this stage, because we have had less than an hour to do so, but in the first instance I welcome the fact the CSO is once again producing crime statistics, albeit under reservation, because statistics are important. What we do not measure we cannot improve, so it is important that we have good statistics that are accurate, that are comparable and that appear frequently and periodically. Even though they are under reservation, it is welcome that those statistics are becoming available again. </p>
          <p eId="para_214"> In terms of resources, an additional 800 gardaí are going to be recruited this year. That is in addition to the 600 extra gardaí recruited last year. About 500 civilians will be recruited to the Garda throughout the course of this year as well. That will allow more gardaí to do front-line work while civilians can do other work on their behalf. Our aim is to have a Garda force that is 14,000 strong by the end of this year and we are confident that can be achieved. There is also additional investment, as Members will know, in Garda vehicles and IT systems, which I think will be essential in improving PULSE data and making sure that it is accurate and up to date.</p>

          <p eId="para_215">I would like the Taoiseach to address the central issue here, which is that we do not have reliable crime statistics in this State. For the Taoiseach to welcome the publication of statistics that the CSO, our independent statistics office, cannot stand over is quite worrying. An officer of the CSO said on national radio this morning that they were the best available statistics, but are certainly subject to further amendment and change. How can we have what the Taoiseach says the country needs, accurate and comparable statistics? Patently we have not. What is he going to do to ensure not only that the homicide figures are accurate, but that all statistics produced about crime in this country are absolutely accurate? What measures will he take to ensure that whatever failings have occurred to deny us that accuracy will be brought to light?</p>

          <p eId="para_216">In the first instance, it is worth pointing out that for the last few quarters the CSO would not publish crime statistics. It is an independent agency and it rightly upholds statistical standards. It did not publish them for several quarters because it did not feel it could do so, given the quality of those statistics. The CSO is now in a position to produce statistics under a new category called "under reservation". This is a classification that is in keeping with other jurisdictions and statistical domains. It serves to indicate to users that the quality of these statistics does not meet standards required of official statistics published by the CSO. The best thing we can do is to make sure that in future statistics are accurate. I am not sure it is possible to correct statistics that were wrong in the past. Things that were not measured in the past cannot be measured retrospectively. For us to make sure that the Garda has adequate resources, adequate training and adequate ICT, but also the adequate culture, standards, management and expectations, I think it is essential that these numbers are collected correctly in future.</p>

          <from>Deputy Noel Grealish<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T12:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_217">Every week in the media we hear reports of overcrowding and congestion in accident and emergency departments across the country. Last year alone, 1.3 million people attended accident and emergency departments, with only 330,000 requiring admission for further treatment. The accident and emergency department in University Hospital Galway is one of the busiest in the country, with more than 60,000 people each year presenting there. Staff are overworked and trying to do their best in almost impossible conditions, working in a unit which is universally accepted as being cramped, dilapidated and not fit for purpose. Hospital management has stated that it is an ongoing challenge to manage the large numbers attending daily and it has become an extremely stressful environment for patients and staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">Chronic parking congestion at the hospital is also a major problem, and it causes people to miss appointments frequently.</p>
          <p eId="para_219"> I recently visited a minor injuries unit at Roscommon hospital to see for myself how it operates. I was given a full tour of the facility by the general manager, Ms Mary Garvey, and the director of nursing, Ms Ursula Morgan, and I was very impressed by the facility. I compliment both on the excellent work they do there. They inform me it takes an average of just 55 minutes for a person to be seen, treated and discharged.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> The ten other minor injuries units throughout the country can handle everything from broken bones, lacerations, strains and sprains to minor scalds and burns, and they are open seven days per week, from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Last year, the unit in Roscommon treated more than 6,000 patients. The unit is staffed by a small number of competent staff and is overseen by a consultant physician and an advanced nurse practitioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_221"> I strongly believe the establishment of a minor injuries unit in the Merlin Park University Hospital grounds would be an immediate and cost-effective method of relieving the overcrowding and stress at the accident and emergency unit at University Hospital Galway. I acknowledge there are plans in train for a new emergency department at University Hospital Galway but this project is still at design stage. A new facility is still many years away.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> The HSE target for patients to be seen by a doctor in an accident and emergency unit is six hours. We know, however, that this is never achieved. In Galway, it could be double that time, especially for a non-urgent minor injury. I know of cases where people with a minor injury waited up to 24 hours to be seen.</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> There are 11 minor injuries units operating very effectively across the country. Surely Galway, which is acknowledged as having one of the most congested accident and emergency departments in the country, should be considered for one. A minor injuries unit could reduce the number attending the emergency department in Galway by thousands.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> Is not the obvious solution to provide a minor injuries unit at Merlin Park University Hospital in Galway city? It has acres of space, easier access from almost anywhere in Galway and ample parking. Most important, it would relieve so much of the ongoing pressure on the emergency department at University Hospital Galway.</p>

        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_122">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T12:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_225">I thank Deputy Noel Grealish for raising this important matter and for the constructive suggestion he put forward. I am advised that the Saolta University Health Care Group, which runs the hospitals in the west, is working with the HSE to examine the potential for a new day-services hospital block at Merlin Park. As the House will be aware, Project Ireland 2040 provides for ten new hospitals to be built over the next ten years, three of which are now under construction. As part of that, there are plans for a new elective medical centre for Galway. Merlin Park is being considered as one of the possible sites for that centre. It is not currently proposed to have a minor injuries unit as part of that hospital development but the argument the Deputy makes is a very strong one. Someone with a minor injury could have to wait for hours to be seen at the accident and emergency department in Galway because more serious cases are seen first. If he or she were able to get transport to Roscommon, he or she would probably be seen, treated and home in the same time as he or she would spend waiting in University Hospital Galway. That is fine if one has transport or someone to drive one but, of course, that is not possible for everyone.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> There are now a number of minor injuries units around the country, in Dundalk, Monaghan, Roscommon, the old orthopaedic hospital in Cork, Smithfield in Dublin, Loughlinstown, and St. John's in Limerick. I only wish people knew more about them. There are thousands of people around the country waiting in waiting rooms in emergency departments who could be seen very quickly at these minor injuries units. There is no such unit in Galway. Galway is a county with a big and growing population. In the context of the hospital development, the plan for Merlin Park, the Deputy makes a very good suggestion to consider a minor injuries unit as part of it. I will certainly pass that on to the Minister for Health and the HSE.</p>

          <p eId="para_227">I thank the Taoiseach for his response. I submitted a parliamentary question recently to the Minister for Health on the elective hospital planned for Merlin Park and he replied that this is a long-term plan and that, with a ten-year plan, many proposals, including an elective-only hospital, are at a very early stage. It could be ten, 15 or 20 years away while the minor injuries unit could be up and running by the end of the year. A small staff, including a consultant and advanced nurse, is all that is needed. It could be put in one of the units. The Taoiseach should not be going back to the proposed ten-year plan for building a hospital in Merlin Park because that is a long time down the road. The emergency department in Galway was built in the 1950s and upgraded in the 1990s. It caters for six core counties, with a population of 800,000 people. If we could bring the people with scalds, burns, strains, lacerations and broken bones to a minor injuries unit in Merlin Park, it could reduce the number attending UHG accident and emergency department by tens of thousands. It would free up parking and take the pressure off the staff and the accident and emergency department.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> I want the Taoiseach to commit that he will move this project forward. It will alleviate much of the pressure on the accident and emergency department in University Hospital Galway.</p>

The construction of the new acute mental health unit in Galway is now complete. That is ready to open. When it comes to radiation oncology for people suffering from cancer, enabling works, including the demolition of the old mental health unit, are due to commence in the third quarter of this year. They will be completed in 2020. When it comes to the new emergency department and ward block for University Hospital Galway, the design team has been appointed and the project should be completed by 2023. The new ambulance base is in design. There is a pipeline of investment and it is happening. I take the Deputy’s point, however, that a minor injuries unit could be put into place, perhaps not this year but relatively quickly.</p>

I hope I am wrong in that regard. The report and its conclusions are serious. While Mr. Michael Collins says there is no evidence to suggest any deliberate concealment or withholding of material from the tribunal, he concludes, on the other hand, that there was no meaningful explanation provided as to why the initial search for documents did not include email accounts of officials in the policing division or senior officials in the Secretary General's office.</p>
          <p eId="para_235"> The report raises far more questions than it answers. It illustrates the need for major reform within the Department before credibility can be restored.

          <p eId="para_238">I welcome the completion of the investigation and the consequent publication of the report. There are issues of some concern raised in the report. These were issues that form part and parcel of fundamental reforms within the Department of Justice and Equality. It must be seen as part of an overall package to include investment in IT systems and to ensure that management functions are co-ordinated in a way that does not allow for the lapse that did occur.</p>
          <p eId="para_239"> It is worth remarking, in the context of emails and electronic communication, that we are dealing with a four-year period involving 30 million items of correspondence by email. That is a significant number but I wish to assure the House that every effort is being made on an urgent basis to ensure we have the type of fundamental reform recommended in a number of independent reports. I am happy to keep the House and justice committee fully informed of developments in that area.</p>

          <p eId="para_240">The Government has just published the scheme of the Bill which will be introduced if the referendum to remove the eighth amendment succeeds. I welcome that and I trust it will provide the necessary clarity on many of the legislative issues involved. Whatever about the level of confusion sown yesterday, there should be no confusion as to the necessity to repeal the eighth amendment. Issues relating to women's health do not belong in our Constitution. There is nothing unclear about that in my mind. I trust that the proposed legislation is humane, compassionate and respects women's health and choices. I appeal to people to consider the matter on that basis. The campaign is now on and we will campaign vigorously for a "Yes" vote. I hope others who similarly take a "Yes" position will do likewise, including the Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_241"> When will the referendum date be officially announced? I understand 25 May is generally considered to be the date on which the referendum will be held. Is it possible to confirm that for us today?</p>

          <p eId="para_243">I ask for an update on the national review of specialist cardiac services. The Taoiseach will be well aware that this matter is very much to the fore of the minds of all Deputies from the south east. We were to have a review of cardiac services in the south east commencing last August. This has now been subsumed into the national review. There is growing and real concern in the south east on the timeframe for this and what immediate action can be taken to ensure there are adequate and appropriate cardiac services, including 24-7 access to primary percutaneous coronary intervention, PPCI, in the region.</p>

As he knows, I have asked Professor Philip Nolan, the President of NUI Maynooth, to chair the national review, work on which has commenced. The review team is available to brief Members, as appropriate, and will engage in public consultation so that people in the south east and all other parts of the country will have an opportunity to have their say. I am very much of the view that if we have to look at an issue in the south east or elsewhere, we must also look at the whole country and how we distribute cath labs and the provision of expert cardiac services nationally in a fair and equitable way, based on clinical evidence. That work is under way and I am very happy to meet Members from the south east on a cross-party basis in the week the Dáil resumes after Easter.</p>

          <p eId="para_245">I ask about broadband and its roll-out in rural Ireland. It is just not happening notwithstanding all the figures which are spun at us. It is having a hugely detrimental effect on students, businesses and the Action Plan for Rural Development because it is not possible to do business today without access to fast broadband speeds. It is just not being delivered even though it has been announced for us. As Deputy Healy-Rae said recently, the Government should buy back Eir because this will never be delivered without a company that is willing to do it. Eir pulled out, however. This is a serious impediment to doing business in rural Ireland, whether one is farming, in business or trying to access data as a student. It is just not fair to people in rural Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_249">The UK Government has just announced that it will introduce a deposit refund scheme for glass and plastic bottles and aluminium cans. We are working at the joint committee on progressing the Waste Reduction Bill, which we presented last July and which reached Second Stage at that time. It is slowly coming to its end and I am confident we will have the numbers in the House to support a Committee Stage debate. However, that will require a change in policy on the part of the Government and an end to opposition to the measure by Fine Gael and the Independent Ministers. I expect that we will have to make a call on this in the coming weeks. Will the Government block the legislation or will it provide the necessary money message to allow us to progress to Committee Stage, at which point the Bill may have to be amended? We are on the right track, it is the right policy and we have the right legislation. It is doable and legal and it goes where Europe is going. Every indicator says this is the right thing to do. Why is Fine Gael blocking it and why is it setting us on a course where it charges for green bins and is happy to burn waste or ship it off to China? Will the Government change course and its opposition to the legislation and permit Committee Stage to take place by sending the money message?</p>

          <p eId="para_255">The HSE is getting massive sums of money each year and there are five Ministers in the Department of Health. Nevertheless, we do not have enough front-line staff. It has become apparent again in recent days that the HSE is hiring clerical and administrative staff at a 3:1 ratio as against front-line staff. That is where we are falling down. That is why we have queues in the accident and emergency department at Tralee hospital. That is why we had 27 people on trolleys the day before yesterday.</p>

The HSE is hiring administrative and clerical staff at a 3:1 ratio to front-line staff. This is totally wrong. All through the crisis when the country was in serious trouble, the HSE was still hiring them and it is hiring them again now when there are not enough front-line staff. What is the Taoiseach going to do about that?</p>

          <p eId="para_258">We need a root-and-branch review of the recruitment process within the HSE to tackle the chronic lack of doctors, nurses, care assistants and other medical experts to deal with the crisis. At 6 p.m. yesterday, a local GP sent a notice on social media asking people not to attend casualty at University Hospital Kerry unless absolutely necessary because 26 patients were on trolleys at that time awaiting admission to the wards. The notice said there was a 12-hour waiting list and standing room only in the area. That reflects very accurately the crisis we are undergoing. It all goes back to the lack of necessary staff and a root-and-branch review of the recruitment process is long overdue.</p>

          <p eId="para_259">The Deputy is referring to an article that was in a newspaper this morning. The article does not deal with all the facts or put them in the public domain.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">It clearly focuses in on the increases in administrative staff who make up approximately 16% of the overall staff but one must look at where historically there were reductions in staff. The moratorium put in place in 2009 had a greater impact on administrative staff than front-line staff for obvious reasons and as that moratorium has been lifted, we are trying to bring services back up.</p>
          <p eId="para_261"> One also must remember the range of services that are undertaken by administrative staff, such as processing medical cards. If we were to cut back on that and hold that back, we in this House would be animated if people were not gaining access to that service. We must be careful what we wish for.</p>
          <p eId="para_262"> Some of the largest increases in staffing in the medical care sector has been in the area of carers, the number of which has increased from 16,000 in 2009 to 19,000. Obviously, we have encountered difficulties in recruiting some front-line staff, particularly nurses, and that continues to be a challenge and a focus of the HSE actions to deal with that.</p>

          <p eId="para_264">Under the programme for Government, on page 60, regarding the waiting lists, the latest figures for outpatient appointments put the HSE figure at more than half a million in the State. The numbers of people waiting in Cork University Hospital, the maternity hospital, the South Infirmary-Victoria University Hospital, the Mercy University Hospital and Mallow General Hospital stand at 23,433, 368, 22,383, 4,999 and 3,688, respectively. In all fairness, that amounts to more than 57,000 people waiting for treatment in Cork. Last night, we passed a motion with which the Government agreed regarding people with disabilities. More than 14,500 people in east Cork alone could be affected by this and surely this is a national disgrace. What will the Government do about these appalling figures?</p>

          <p eId="para_266">On a related matter, the <i>in loco parentis</i> clause in home-care nursing contracts was a key element in last evening's Private Members' motion adopted unanimously in this House. The response that is issued in replies to parliamentary questions, which was repeated orally last night, can be summed up as follows: when the national quality assurance process is complete, the national steering group for children with complex medical conditions will review the <i>in loco parentis</i> issue. This, like the reply we have received on the optional protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, is a case of <i>mañana</i>, <i>mañana</i>, <i>mañana</i>. That is what it amounts to. It is any and every excuse to delay change and progress. Has the Taoiseach seen the "Prime Time" programme of Thursday night last? Is he conscious and aware of the real impact of the <i>in loco parentis</i> clause on parents struggling with very ill children, often with life-limiting conditions? I appeal to the Taoiseach that there be no more consideration and no more delay. It is within the gift of the Taoiseach and the Government to abolish this most offensive clause that is causing massive distress for already hard-pressed and very stressed parents across this land.</p>

          <p eId="para_268">On the first question on waiting lists in Cork, Deputy Buckley asked specifically what the Government is doing about waiting lists. The Government allocated €85 million for a winter initiative this year: €40 million for winter measures; €11.6 million to deal with waiting lists and another €35 million was allocated to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, to outsource some procedures to deal with those waiting lists. A further €5 million was allocated in the aftermath of Storm Emma to try to deal with the waiting lists. One hundred and eighty-nine beds have been opened this winter in a series of different acute hospitals throughout the country in an effort to alleviate that crisis. I assure Deputy Buckley we will continue in our efforts to do that.</p>

          <p eId="para_271">I refer to the programme for Government. The current waiting time to get tonsils out here is three years. Young children are in pain, suffering and missing out from school because they cannot get their tonsils out. In the past three weeks, I made contact for three people and introduced them to the service in Belfast. Those three people are getting their treatment in Belfast. The irony is - the same as oncology, patients with hips and patients with knee operations - we can refer them to the North, they can go up, have the procedure carried out and fill up the necessary paperwork, and we can return their money when they come back down to the South. It is a scandal that children waiting for tonsil procedures must be sent by us to the North if we want to alleviate their pain and discomfort quickly by having the procedure done even though we have the money to give back to their parents when they come back here. It makes no sense. It follows on from previous questions the Taoiseach was asked here today about HSE mismanagement and the craziness of the situation that is our health service today.</p>

Every country in the EU is able to avail of services in any other EU country. That is not unique to Ireland. We are not merely exporting, which is the narrative that is being put out there, these operations abroad. It is the right of every citizen of the EU to avail of a service in any other EU country and we are only fulfilling our obligation under EU law.</p>
          <p eId="para_277"> A little while ago, I referred to an additional €35 million being given to the NTPF this year to purchase these operations. Many of those are not done abroad but are done in the private sector in Ireland. There is capacity within the private sector to deliver and to help with the waiting lists. Much of the money that is being spent is being spent in our own country as well.</p>

The Government agreed in the programme for Government to allow seven-days-a-week home-help service where possible but two years later, I see little or no evidence of the seven-days-a-week home help available in west Cork even though workers on the ground are seeking extra hours. This weekend, many of the elderly, who in many cases live alone, will not see a home-help service from Friday until Tuesday. Promises in the programme for Government are meaningless in this situation. When will a seven-days-a-week home-help service be openly available?</p>

          <p eId="para_281">On home help, as Deputy Michael Collins will be aware, a statutory scheme is being developed. Home help, as we acknowledge and have done so on many occasions, is <i>ad hoc</i> and sporadic around the country. It is a demand-led scheme and €408 million is being allocated by the Government this year to meet the needs of home help. There are 50,500 people availing of home help. However, it is not enough and we accept that and we want to do more. That is why the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and I launched a consultation to develop a statutory scheme. That consultation has now concluded. We will have a scheme underpinned by law, which will guarantee the right to home help but it will take two to three years to bring it about in full. We are moving down the road towards it. We cannot click our fingers and make it happen overnight. If the Ceann Comhairle remembers, it took up to nine years to bring about the fair deal scheme. We are trying to bring about a scheme similar to the fair deal scheme that will guarantee access to each and every person on a fair and level basis, irrespective of the geography and the other challenges involved. We do not want there to be a postal lottery involved in this.</p>

          <p eId="para_283">It is a question for the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste. It pertains to the many commitments made in the programme for Government aimed at protecting Ireland from the harmful effects of Brexit. The up-to-date expert opinion is that the Border region of Ireland will be the worst hit region in the country, with many business owners already starting to struggle due to decreased tourism from the UK and a weak pound sterling. On that basis, perhaps the Taoiseach or Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, can advise me as to what the Government is doing to protect small businesses in my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim, Donegal and the other Border counties from the harmful effects of Brexit?</p>

Finally, the Government remains steadfast in ensuring that we will not see the re-emergence of border infrastructure in the Border counties in Ireland or, for that manner, anywhere else on this island.</p>

          <p eId="para_287">There continues to be an almost total vacuum in the regulation of online campaigning. Concerns have been heightened by recent revelations of high profile campaigns in recent weeks. The Taoiseach will be aware of the Bill I introduced last year, the Online Advertising and Social Media (Transparency) Bill 2017. I wrote to the Taoiseach about it last week and my party leader has also raised it with the Taoiseach several times in recent weeks. The Bill passed Second Stage last December and last night the joint committee on communications considered the Bill and decided to prioritise its passage or ease its scrutiny including extra meetings as required. I also note that Mr. Martin Fraser, Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach, highlighted the Bill in his report which was published last night, indicating the real issues that it raised and the need for regulation in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_288"> As the Taoiseach himself said in relation to another Bill, Report and Committee Stages are the very place for amendments to be tabled, scrutiny to occur and discussions to take place. In light of the very real need for this legislation to be enacted, will the Taoiseach withdraw the Government's opposition to the Bill and engage constructively with myself and colleagues on the joint committee on communications to advance the legislation in a constructive fashion?</p>

          <p eId="para_295">I welcome the new tenant purchase scheme which will give many families an opportunity to buy out their homes, which is everyone's ambition. I believe there are anomalies in the scheme as it stands in the case where one of a couple whose name would have been on the title of a property previously, whether in the case of a family home, parents' home, or a home from a previous relationship sold following a divorce, for instance, is now in a new relationship. The local authority is able to sell the house to that particular couple but it cannot lend them the money. This arises as a consequence of the incremental purchase charge on the property. These people are then advised to approach the bank for a mortgage but the bank will not lend to these people because of the incremental charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_296"> There is another anomaly which relates to the €15,000 earned income. This deprives elderly people of the opportunity to purchase their own homes. Everyone wants to purchase their home. These elderly people on pensions are in a position to buy their homes. This relates to houses that will not be returning to the housing stock - that would be a different situation - but they will not. That needs to be changed.</p>

          <p eId="para_298">On the responsibility for river maintenance, outside the rivers maintained by the Office of Public Works, OPW, under the arterial drainage Acts, the local authorities and the OPW are facing a limbo where no one has responsibility for maintaining those rivers. It is particularly acute in Donegal where massive damage was done as a result of the flooding in August. Rivers have been very significantly damaged but there is no one to take responsibility for addressing the problem, fixing them or to maintain them in the future. Will the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government tell us what engagement he has had with the Minister of State with responsibility for flooding in the OPW? Action is necessary. What action, if any, does the Minister propose to take to ensure that someone takes responsibility for maintaining these rivers and works with landowners on them, ultimately ensuring that they can be fixed, in the case of Donegal, and maintained on an ongoing basis so that we can protect against the type of massive flood damage that we have experienced on too many occasions recently?</p>

We are currently discussing how best to manage this. I have provided additional funding to the local offices to do this work and recently spoke to the river trusts conference in Iveagh House which was the first conference it held outside the UK. We discussed other initiatives that can be taken on funding and also support to the groups which manage these different river areas.

            <p eId="para_332">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 16, inclusive, together. The questions take up three pages.</p>
            <p eId="para_333"> My St. Patrick’s Day programme ran from 11 to 17 March, during which time I visited Texas, Oklahoma, Washington DC and New York. I had courtesy calls with Texas Governor, Greg Abbott, and Oklahoma Governor, Mary Fallin, in both cases discussing the deepening of links between the US and their respective states and Ireland. I visited the Choctaw Nation in Durant, Oklahoma, to thank Chief Gary Batton and the Choctaw people for the humanitarian aid raised by their ancestors back in 1847, at the height of the Great Famine, and to announce a joint scholarship scheme to commemorate this historic act and foster future relations. This scheme will allow Choctaw students to study in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_334"> I took part in South by South West, a technology and music convention in Austin, Texas, to promote Ireland as a location for innovation and inward investment. During my visit I met with many Irish-owned companies doing business in the United States. One important message I sought to convey during my visit was that the economic relationship between Ireland and the US is very much a two-way, bilateral one, with over 100,000 people employed by Irish-owned companies across 50 states in the United States and a broadly balanced trading relationship worth €2 billion per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_335"> I spoke at a number of events in Washington DC on matters of foreign policy, on the 20th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, on contemporary affairs in Northern Ireland, on Brexit negotiations, and on US-Ireland and US-EU relations. I had a series of political meetings, including with President Trump, Vice President Pence, Speaker Ryan, Senate Majority Leader McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Schumer, and Senator Patrick Leahy, as well as the Friends of Ireland caucus. In all these meetings, I emphasised the importance of the two-way transatlantic relationship between the US and Ireland and between the US and the EU. I suggested that the best way to secure free and fair trade between us was to revisit the question of a comprehensive free trade agreement between the EU and the US.</p>
            <p eId="para_336"> I also discussed Ireland’s interests in relation to Brexit negotiations and potential solutions for the undocumented Irish living in the US. President Trump indicated that he was favourably disposed towards the possibility of a bilateral agreement on immigration based on a reciprocal arrangement for US and Irish citizens that could help resolve the difficult situation faced by undocumented Irish citizens in the US. This project is being led by Deputy John Deasy. However, it is also important to recall that finding a solution remains a complicated question that requires support both from the Executive and from Congress. We will continue to work at all levels to secure a positive outcome. The President was not yet in a position to announce the appointment of a US ambassador to Ireland, although I understand this issue is now being given high priority, and nor was there any announcement regarding a US special envoy to Northern Ireland. I had a very cordial discussion with Vice President Pence. The Vice President kindly invited me to return next year and I in return extended an invitation to him to visit Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_337"> In New York, I attended a business lunch hosted by Michael Bloomberg. I visited the site of the new Irish Arts Center in Hell's Kitchen to announce an additional $2.5 million of Government funding for that project. I met with the political leadership of the New York City Council including Mayor de Blasio and Speaker Corey Johnson. I also made a presentation to Denis Mulcahy, founder of Project Children, and announced the expansion of the Washington Ireland programme into New York. Finally, I attended the annual St. Patrick’s Day events in New York, including the Mayor’s breakfast, mass at St. Patrick’s Cathedral and the New York St. Patrick’s Day parade. </p>
            <p eId="para_338"> In conclusion, this was an excellent opportunity to promote Ireland’s priorities with the US Administration and with political, business and community leaders, as well as to further develop the strong political, cultural and economic links between Ireland and the US.</p>

            <p eId="para_340">For almost a year the Taoiseach has been telling us that he was going to speak truth to Donald Trump in the White House. On 21 June 2017, when referring to the visit to the White House the Taoiseach said "I will absolutely include in those meetings", with Donald Trump, "discussions of the issues he mentioned, whether it be climate change, human rights, LGBT rights and the need to respect Muslim people". On 27 June 2017, again in reference to visiting the White House for St. Patrick's Day, the Taoiseach said, "I will not shirk from raising issues such as climate change, LGBT rights and so on with President Trump". Just over a week before he went to the White House, I raised these issues with the Taoiseach and gave him these quotes during Leaders' Questions. He told me that he would raise the issues which I had raised including Trump's racist policies, his anti-LGBT measures, his anti-environmental policies and his anti-immigrant rhetoric.</p>
            <p eId="para_341"> It was all talk, was it not? The Taoiseach did not raise those issues. The only thing which he did was tell a silly joke about intervening in a planning matter on Trump's behalf. It was absolutely cringeworthy. The Taoiseach achieved the not inconsiderable feat of making Deputy Enda Kenny appear to have been a paragon of progressive thought on his previous trip. How does the Taoiseach explain the contrast between what he said he was going to do in advance of the trip to Washington and all the truths he was going to speak as against the reality of what he did and his craven behaviour there?</p>

            <p eId="para_342">Like many people, I was extremely disappointed at the Taoiseach's approach to President Trump. We understand that such visits have to be performed with decorum and that Irish interests are at stake but the Taoiseach indicated, when he was in opposition, when campaigning for the Fine Gael leadership, and subsequently, that he was going to be honest with Donald Trump about our views as a country. I was particularly disappointed that he did not take up with Donald Trump issues such as the views he has often expressed with regard to women, which are really sexist and misogynistic. They seemed to have no part in the discourse. The Taoiseach was trying to pander to President Trump, to use an American phrase for when one covers someone in congratulations and leaves difficult issues, which can be discussed between countries that have strong mutual relations and which deserve to be mentioned, to one side. I do not understand what overcame the Taoiseach. Did he lose his nerve? Did he feel that, strategically, raising Mr. Trump's ire was not worth setting out the Irish position on many issues? The Taoiseach did himself and the country no service in simply pandering to Donald Trump on that day. Yes, it must have been a very exciting day for the Taoiseach, but the Irish people deserved better representation.</p>

            <p eId="para_343">I share the general assessment and view expressed by the previous two speakers. I want to ask the Taoiseach a number of specific questions if he has the opportunity to listen. There has been a lack of clarity about the Taoiseach's view of the specific proposal to appoint a special envoy to Northern Ireland. Is it something he welcomes? Is it something he has asked for? What is his attitude to it? In terms of the invitation extended to President Trump to visit Ireland, which the Taoiseach reiterated, have there been any discussions about a potential date for such a visit?</p>
            <p eId="para_344"> I understand that the Taoiseach had a discussion with President Trump on tariffs and that he reported back to the European Council because he was the first EU head of government to meet President Trump after he announced his tariffs on aluminium and steel. When they were announced a temporary exclusion for the EU was included. What is the nature of that exclusion? How long is it? Are conditions attached to it?</p>

            <p eId="para_345">Over the years the amount of attention paid to the St. Patrick's Day visit to the United States keeps increasing without any obvious justification. I hope that the Taoiseach will have learned about appropriate language and about how our Head of Government should act when talking about our own public administration. While I do not agree that the Taoiseach should try to give a lecture to the US Government, it is important and it is the role of the Taoiseach to speak up for our values and to leave no one in any doubt about them. One does not get a sense that transpired on this occasion. On the issue of the undocumented Irish, the reality is that this is in an issue which is now being decided in the context of the overall immigration debate within the United States.</p>
            <p eId="para_346">We have been searching for a bilateral deal for well over a decade but to no avail. Did the Taoiseach hear anything at any of his meetings, especially in respect of Congress, which would suggest a way forward or some degree of consensus emerging there?</p>
            <p eId="para_347"> Regarding Northern Ireland, the appointment of a special envoy is something we probably should have sought a number of years ago, once it became clear there were problems with the workings of the institutions. It is not immediately clear that the current Administration has access to the kind of people who could have an impact on a par with previous envoys. Will the Taoiseach tell us what was discussed on this matter?</p>
            <p eId="para_348"> It is welcome that the Trump Administration appears to have stepped back from initiating-----</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_351">Would the Taoiseach not accept that telling a joke about assisting Donald Trump with a planning matter was at best an embarrassing mistake but at worst conveyed a desire to cuddle up to the US President and make common cause with him rather than criticise him for some of his dangerous and, in many cases, obnoxious policies? I say this in all seriousness, setting aside the debate as to whether the Taoiseach was naive, whether he lost his nerve, etc. There was a more serious side to this, which was a desire to show common cause. We might help a multimillionaire like Trump on a planning matter or perhaps it was just a joke. However, it was not very funny from the point of view of the people who take these things seriously. It was part of a pattern, as the Taoiseach also, incredibly, commended Donald Trump on reducing taxes on corporations and pointed out how similar this was to Irish policy. Does the Taoiseach not recognise that the race to the bottom in respect of corporate tax, whatever about Irish domestic policy, is not a good thing in a world where it is contributing directly to growing inequality in the distribution of wealth?</p>

            <p eId="para_357">The intervention on the planning matter was wrong for so many reasons. First, why did the Taoiseach decide to put this country on the same side as Trump? It was well known at the time that Trump had been in a ten-year war against wind farms. Taking a position on this said a lot about this country and our position. It was such a mistake, to my mind, and the process was all wrong.</p>
            <p eId="para_358"> Second, what was most mortifying for me was the congratulations the Taoiseach offered to Donald Trump on his tax policy. The Taoiseach said Donald Trump was brought into line with us in this regard. We positioned our economy in line with Donald Trump on the issue of tax. That is so bad for this country, and I cannot understand how the Taoiseach can justify it. The reason for our low tax rates, I understood, was that we are a small, peripheral country. It was an incredible mistake to pass this off to the Americans as our being in line with them and being all in this race to the bottom together. I have one specific question, and perhaps the Ceann Comhairle will be able to assist with the response. If Donald Trump takes up the offer of a visit, who decides whether a foreign president is offered an invitation to speak before this House? This is a common courtesy that has been carried out for most visits.</p>

            <p eId="para_361">I was actually at the Speaker's lunch for the first time when the Taoiseach told his story about his interaction with President Trump. Although the telling of it was gauche and cringy, I am more worried about the fact that it happened than the fact that the Taoiseach said it out loud on that occasion. Correct me if I am wrong, but I am not sure he has actually given an explanation for that turn of events, how it was that a very wealthy business person, in this case Donald Trump, could contact him, a senior Cabinet Minister, when, I understand, he was abroad and how the chain of events then unfolded. I understand that the Taoiseach did not contact the local authority directly but that the contact was mediated through an agency under his Department's control. I understand it was Fáilte Ireland. The Taoiseach needs to take the opportunity to set out that chain of events - a chain of events that is deeply worrying from the substantive point of view not only of planning policy, wind farms and renewable energy, but also just of governance. How is it a good message? I understand the close relations with America and Irish America and the diplomatic realities of that-----</p>

            <p eId="para_364">I thank the Deputies for their questions. The nature of these meetings is such that they tend to last approximately 35 to 40 minutes. In that period one may want to raise 20 matters and one tries to get through as many as possible. Often one can get through a lot, sometimes not so many. As the meetings to which the Deputies referred were neither recorded nor televised, I appreciate that their knowledge of what was discussed is limited and that they are not fully informed. I am therefore happy to use this opportunity to inform them about some of the things that were discussed in those meetings.</p>
            <p eId="para_365"> In the meeting with President Trump in the Oval Office, migration was discussed and I did tell him about Ireland's commitment to the European Union and our commitment to free trade and free enterprise and values such as human rights and multilateralism. During my engagement with Vice President Pence and Mrs. Pence we discussed LGBT issues, freedoms and rights, and they very kindly asked about my partner and suggested he would be very welcome in their home should we visit again. I thought that was a very kind gesture. There were no discussions of the attack in Salisbury at either meeting.</p>
            <p eId="para_366"> Other issues were covered by public speeches, of which Deputies will be aware. In general, when it comes to meeting any prime minister or president, any head of state or government, people endeavour to do three things. The first is to try to form some form of personal relationship on the basis that they will probably speak again, whether in a meeting or over the phone. The second is to find some areas where they have common cause. The third is to find areas where there is difference. That is the way I approach my interactions with almost anyone, not just prime ministers and presidents. First, I try to strike up some form of relationship with a bit of an ice-breaker and we talk to each other. Second, we talk about the areas where we find common cause and on which we are aligned. Then we look at the areas where we disagree. Then one sees if it is possible to convince the other person of one's view or to find some sort of compromise. I appreciate that other people's approach to politics does not involve this and that it is just about shouting at people, throwing mud at them, beating them down and so on. However, I am glad to say that is not my approach to politics.</p>
            <p eId="para_367"> I would absolutely welcome a special envoy to Northern Ireland. Any US interest in Northern Ireland is welcome. I very much welcome the input from Peter King and Richard Neal, whom I had the chance to get to know for the first time when I was in the United States. The value in having an envoy would be to have someone who could be the eyes and ears for the White House and to a lesser extent Congress in Northern Ireland reporting back to them accurately what is going on rather than just relying on the Irish Government assessment, the British Government assessment or the assessment of the different parties. Having their own eyes and ears on the ground in Northern Ireland would be of real value. However, my priority is that we should have an envoy to Ireland, which would be the appointment of an ambassador. If the White House is looking for people to send to Ireland, I ask that they prioritise the appointment of a permanent ambassador, but both would certainly be welcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_368"> Tariffs on steel and aluminium were discussed in the meeting with President Trump and in all the meetings with congressional leaders. Congressional leaders tend to be free traders. President Trump is not a free trader. His position is more protectionist, more socialist, in my view-----</p>

            <p eId="para_370">-----than that of the leaders in Congress, who are more for free trade and free enterprise. I very much gave my view that I would prefer for us to have a trade deal rather than a trade war and that we should have a free trade agreement, FTA, between the EU and the United States. President Trump did not dismiss this out of hand; he was actually quite open to it. This was one of the takeaways from the meeting that surprised me.</p>
            <p eId="para_371">I thought he would be against that but he was not. He had a particular concern about trade deficits with countries such as Germany and China and a particular concern about the fact the EU imposes higher tariffs on cars than the US imposes on the EU. I suggested the best way to resolve these issues is not tit-for-tat tariffs and restrictions but engagement in a free trade agreement. That was not dismissed out of hand and I thought it would have been. The exemption for steel and aluminium is temporary and applies until May. In that period, there will be engagement between the EU and US on some grievances the US has in respect of trade practices. We will see what happens after that. Obviously the EU is looking for a permanent exemption and not one that ends in May.</p>
            <p eId="para_372"> On the Irish undocumented, Deputy Deasy is leading that project. In the absence of an overall solution and comprehensive immigration reform in the United States, we are seeking a bilateral solution for Ireland. There were previous models in the past, and people will know about the various eponymous visa programmes that existed. There is also Australia, which has an E-3 visa, a certain number of which are given every year. What we are working on is a proposal whereby a certain number of visas would be made available to Irish people who are undocumented in the US, perhaps 2,000 or 3,000 a year for three years or 5,000 for two years, with a total of 10,000 or 15,000. In return for this we would do something similar here, given the large number of US citizens who now live in Ireland and the large number who retire to Ireland. There are certain restrictions on them at present. It is very much something we could do that would be mutual. This was very well received by the President, and he directed his staff to work with my staff to progress it. It would, of course, require congressional approval and that could pose a difficulty given that many members of Congress, even though they are very supportive of doing something for the Irish undocumented-----</p>

I imagine it involves some sort of communication between the office of the Ceann Comhairle and my office. Ultimately, I would have thought it is the prerogative of the Oireachtas rather than a decision of Government. Having said that, there is a specific provision in the Constitution that states foreign affairs are a matter for the Government. How and ever, there certainly have been presidential visits in the past that did not include a visit to the Oireachtas or a speech to the Oireachtas, so it is not that they have to happen together.</p>

            <p eId="para_397">I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 to 26, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_398"> I attended the European Council in Brussels on Thursday and Friday, 22 and 23 March. </p>
            <p eId="para_399"> On Thursday, we discussed jobs, growth and competitiveness, touching on the Single Market, digital Single Market, capital markets union, the European semester, economic and monetary union and social issues. Given recent events, the need to ensure protection of personal data in the context of social networks was also discussed.</p>
            <p eId="para_400"> In a leaders' agenda discussion on taxation and digital taxation, a wide range of different views were expressed, including views on the desirability of interim measures in advance of completion of its work by the OECD. I did not support any interim measure. I emphasised that all companies should pay their fair share of tax and should pay it when it is due and where it is owed, and that our approach should be evidence-based, sustainable and focused on aligning taxing rights with the location of real, substantive value-creating activity. The Council will return to this matter in June and ECOFIN will consider it in the interim.</p>
            <p eId="para_401"> Partners strongly condemned the attack in Salisbury and offered full solidarity and support to the UK. All 28 member states agreed with the assessment of the UK that the Russian Federation was highly likely to have been involved in the attack and we agreed to recall the EU ambassador from Moscow.</p>
            <p eId="para_402"> On Friday, we discussed trade, including President Trump's decision to exempt the EU from tariffs on steel and aluminium, at least for now. I briefed colleagues on my meeting with President Trump on 12 March and his particular approach to trade.</p>
            <p eId="para_403"> On Brexit and Article 50, the European Council considered progress in the negotiations with the UK on the draft withdrawal agreement. Good progress has been achieved in some parts, including on citizens' rights, the financial settlement and transition period. Importantly, the UK explicitly confirmed that the backstop option, as agreed in the joint report in December, will form part of the legal text and it is now engaging on the detail of that text.</p>
            <p eId="para_404"> The European Council agreed guidelines for negotiating the framework for the future relationship between the UK and the EU. These reflect our ambition for a close partnership, while ensuring a level playing field, fair competition and the integrity of the Single Market. They also leave open the possibility of the European Union revisiting its position and guidelines should the United Kingdom evolve its approach beyond the currently expressed red lines. The European Council will review all the withdrawal issues at our meeting in June, with a view to finalising work on the withdrawal agreement in October. It is important to emphasise that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.</p>
            <p eId="para_405"> In euro summit format, we also discussed economic and monetary union. I stressed the need, in particular, to focus on areas of practical value, including completion of the banking union and having a deposit guarantee system for Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_406"> In the margins of the meeting, I met the Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, who again expressed support for our position on Brexit and we discussed our common positions on tax and trade.</p>
            <p eId="para_407"> I also had a short meeting with the British Prime Minister, Mrs. May, during which I conveyed my solidarity with her on the attack that occurred in Salisbury. On Brexit, I welcomed her Government's commitment to ensuring a backstop forms part of the withdrawal agreement and looked forward to progress on this and on the other options before the European Council in June. I will be making a full statement to the House on this later in the afternoon.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T13:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_408">Will the Taoiseach level with the Dáil as to what work is under way at present on the possibility of a hard border? I know it is something nobody wants, including the Taoiseach, but on the other hand we now have fairly continuous statements, ranging from the somewhat authoritative to the very authoritative, from figures such as the Secretary of State, Mr. Davis, on a technological type of border in particular. I imagine the Taoiseach must have officials examining what form these particular possibilities might take. I also noticed that yesterday, he made a hopeful reference that perhaps subsequent to the UK leaving there could be an agreement which would mirror the exact arrangements of now. That is what I understood the Taoiseach to say yesterday. This has been frequently described as magical thinking, namely, that everything can change but at the same time everything can stay the same. It would be interesting if the Taoiseach could advise us as to why he expects this because short of a British general election or a second Brexit referendum, there does not really seem to be a capacity to deliver, post the UK leaving, a mirror arrangement to what exists now.</p>

          <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_233">
            <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T13:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_409">In respect of the appalling attack in Salisbury in the UK, we are aware of the common statement made by the European Council and the decision to recall to Brussels the EU ambassador, a decision I welcomed and supported last Friday.</p>
            <p eId="para_410">Was other co-ordinated action by EU member states discussed or agreed at the Council and what was the Taoiseach's input to those discussions?</p>
            <p eId="para_411"> In regard to other matters discussed, for example, the legal form of the backstop agreement - the so-called option C of last December - what is the attitude of other member states to the Commission's legal version which has been rejected out of hand by the United Kingdom? Where does this formal legal version now stand or has it been set aside to be renegotiated with the UK? On Turkey, I know that leaders condemned Turkey's action in areas close to Cyprus but of greater concern is the actions Turkey has taken against Kurds in the Afrin region. Was this matter discussed at the European Council?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_234">
            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_412">The Taoiseach and I previously discussed this matter briefly and we will have statements on it later today, at which time we get into the specifics.</p>
            <p eId="para_413"> Yesterday, I asked the Taoiseach if he agreed with the following statement that was made by the Tánaiste, "If we don't have it done by June, then I think obviously, we have to raise some serious questions as to whether it is possible to finalise a withdrawal treaty at all." As the Taoiseach neglected to respond yesterday, I would like to give him another opportunity to do so. Is our objective an agreed backstop by text by June or is the Taoiseach unconcerned if it slips to October? His commentary on Thursday last directly implied that October is no problem in spite of lots of evidence to the contrary.</p>
            <p eId="para_414"> On co-ordinated action against Russia, did every country accept the irrefutable evidence that there is a pattern of Russian aggression in Europe? Does the Taoiseach accept that we should all be concerned about Russia's direct and ongoing support of extremism and anti-European Union sentiment in a range of countries? It is striking how the far right and far left have been united in defending Russia on this occasion and in every other example of Putin's aggression, such as the evasion and partition of Ukraine. Given that our security organisations have expressed concern about Russia's need for an outsized embassy here and the evidence of online interference in most recent elections in Europe, I seek the Taoiseach's support in urgently progressing Deputy Lawless's Bill on related matters.</p>

            <p eId="para_415">Honesty is an important prerequisite to serious debate. Deputy Martin said that those who are critical of the decision to expel are defending Russia, in response to which I noted the Taoiseach was nodding.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_417">The Deputy did say it. As recently as last week, Deputy Gino Kenny and I condemned the behaviour of Russia on the floor of the Dáil. We asked the Government to bring in the Russian ambassador to answer questions about what Russia is doing in Syria. Lest anybody is in any doubt, Putin is an authoritarian war monger but this does not, however, mean that Russia is guilty, without evidence, of what happened in Salisbury, nor does it mean that, therefore, President Trump and the European Union are without sin in an escalating cold war. Do we think President Trump, in his expulsion of Russian diplomats, is any less of a dodgy authoritarian or at least in the same league as Putin in his attitude to geopolitical affairs?</p>

            <p eId="para_419">Are the Russians trying to hack? Definitely. We are all aware of the scandal that unfolded recently in regard to Facebook, an American company which gave information to Cambridge Analytica, which is being used to subvert democratic elections. The Russians and the Americans are dodgy and there are spies in the Russian embassy, the American embassy and the Israeli embassy. Let us be even handed in all of this. What is required is a bit of consistency. I ask the Taoiseach for consistency in dealing with these matters.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryLouMcDonald" eId="spk_240">
            <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_420">The net point is that whatever views are taken of Russia, America or any other administration or regime, at the core of this matter is this country and its policy and tradition of military neutrality and an independent foreign policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_421"> Was the issue of Catalonia discussed? The Taoiseach will be aware that Charles Puigdemont was detained in Germany on Sunday. All of this is playing out before the international community and European Union. This is extraordinary. The lengths to which not only the Spanish state but the European system has been deployed to subvert, quell and crush the desire in Catalonia for independence, democratically expressed at polling stations, is astonishing. One can argue constitutionally the legality or the status of that particular process, which may be fine, but what is beyond doubt is that real, legitimate political aspirations are now meeting the heavy hand of the law. Was this issued and what did the Taoiseach say on the matter?</p>

          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_241">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_422">On a hard border, it is fair to say that all of us in this House want to avoid it and I think we can and will avoid it. The terms of the transition are now agreed. Even though nothing is finally agreed until everything is agreed, at least the terms of it are agreed and are now highlighted in green, which means we have until 2021 to prepare for any permanent changes that may occur. In terms of what is happening now, a series of meetings are taking place in Brussels, with the UK on one side and Ireland and the task force on the other side. We are engaging on the text of option C and any alternatives that the UK may put forward. Other member states are 100% supportive of the text produced by the protocol. We are open to amendments as long as the outcome remains the same. This is the approach we are taking. We are not making any specific preparations for a hard border. We are doing everything we can to avoid it, first, by having a backstop in place and, second, by trying to negotiate a new close partnership between the EU and the UK that would allow us to not ever have to activate the backstop. They are the objectives we are working to.</p>
            <p eId="para_423"> On Salisbury, the Council agreed two things. It agreed the text that we agreed with the UK's assessment that it was highly likely that the Russian federation was involved in this response and also that the EU ambassador would be recalled from Moscow. There were many other suggested actions but that is what was agreed. It was also agreed that member states that were willing and able would expel diplomats in a co-ordinated way on Monday afternoon and 14 EU states did so. We decided to wait until after the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday and so we were the 15th or 16th state to do so. </p>
            <p eId="para_424"> On Turkey, there was no discussion on the Kurdish region. There was a discussion on Cyprus and its territorial waters and the two Greek soldiers who were not being detained in Turkey. </p>
            <p eId="para_425"> On the Tánaiste's comments, I would first need to see the question he was asked. I am always loath to comment on the comments of others without first seeing the question asked and the full answer given. I am pretty sure I agree with what he said, which is that we expect and want to have the terms of the backstop agreed by June and we are pushing very hard to have that done.</p>

            <p eId="para_429">My Department receives significant volumes of correspondence. All correspondence received is acknowledged and most correspondence receives a further substantive reply. Depending on the nature of a particular item of correspondence, it may be brought to my attention or to the attention of staff within my Department. </p>
            <p eId="para_430"> Oftentimes, correspondence which is initially received by my Department necessitates collaboration with another Department. </p>
            <p eId="para_431"> In many cases this can take the form of a request for its observations on a draft reply or, in some instances, my Department provides information to another Department to facilitate it in formulating an appropriate response within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
            <p eId="para_432"> A full record of the journey that a particular item of correspondence travels is maintained and all responses are stored in an electronic system, which includes detailed search capabilities for retrieval of correspondence at a later point.</p>
            <p eId="para_433"> To achieve this, my Department uses a system known as eCorrespondence, an application offered under the "build to share" work programme of the public service ICT strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_434"> My Department worked closely with the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, OGCIO, as part of a project team to agree a common set of user requirements upon which the eCorrespondence system was designed.</p>
            <p eId="para_435"> The objective of the project team was to provide a solution which encompassed the required functionalities associated with the receipt, acknowledgement, reply and tracking of all correspondence and to provide this in such a way that it could become a common solution across all Departments over time.</p>
            <p eId="para_436"> The eCorrespondence system has been operational in my Department since June 2017 and replaced a number of disparate systems which had been deployed prior to that date.</p>
            <p eId="para_437"> One learns something new every day.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T13:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_438">The Taoiseach said a substantive response is usually given to any correspondence his Department receives within an appropriate time. I have a specific question about a piece of correspondence dealing with a serious matter. It relates to a whistleblower whose story and the issue he brought to public attention featured in a "Prime Time Investigates" programme in 2015. It involved a company called Eurosurgical which was subsequently wound up with big tax liabilities. The company was exposed as having given gifts to procurement managers in 13 different hospitals to manipulate the tendering process and to get contracts to sell surgical equipment to those hospitals. It was very serious stuff. It was exposed and brought to public attention by a whistleblower who formerly worked for that company.</p>
            <p eId="para_439"> That whistleblower has requested some assistance from the Minister for Health. A journalist who helped break the story wrote to the Taoiseach on 31 October last to point out that the whistleblower has been blackballed ever since then. He cannot get a job anywhere in the private health sector because he blew the whistle. The whistleblower legislation does not apply retrospectively and it was passed after he had blown the whistle and done the State a service on a very serious matter. The State has offered the guy nothing and he cannot get a job. A letter was sent to the Taoiseach's Department and to the Minister for Health asking that they give this whistleblower some support and assistance. He has even spoken about going into the witness protection programme because of a fear of intimidation and retaliation. I ask the Taoiseach to look into this correspondence and to have the decency to respond in a serious manner to a whistleblower who has done the State a service.</p>

            <p eId="para_440">Central to the handling of correspondence is that emails should be preserved and should use official addresses. Has the Taoiseach used a private email for public business? If he has, what security measures has he taken and does he preserve and make emails available to the freedom of information officer in his Department? Can he give us a 100% assurance that his private emails have been made available if required for freedom of information purposes?</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T13:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_441">The Office of the Government Chief Information Officer is a relatively new but important office in the State administration. It is important that it is resourced. It is hard to get people of the calibre we need in the public service who are competent in this field. I ask the Taoiseach to reflect on the needs of that office and to ensure it is properly resourced and staffed.</p>

            <p eId="para_442">On the last matter, I certainly will reflect on it. I am aware of the office and I know it has to prove much new software and ICT programmes for the Government, but I am not as knowledgeable as I ought to be. I will certainly accept Deputy Howlin's suggestion in that regard. He was involved in much of that work when he was Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_443"> As regards the correspondence mentioned by Deputy Boyd Barrett, I will look it up as it has not crossed my desk. I remember the case he mentioned because I was Minister for Health when that story broke. I will take a look at the correspondence, although I am not sure there is anything we can do to assist somebody to get employment.</p>

            <p eId="para_445">I never give a reference to somebody I do not know. It is my general practice not to give references to people I do not know and that is not always well received in my constituency clinic.</p>
            <p eId="para_446"> With regard to email, I have a number of email accounts. I have had an Oireachtas email account for ten or 11 years, which is used mainly for constituency correspondence. I have a Department email account which changes as I move from Department to Department. I also have a personal email account. It is my practice to use them for their intended purpose - my personal email for personal use, my Department email for departmental use and the Oireachtas email for Oireachtas use. Needless to say, however, on occasion I have to use the personal email, such as when the system is down or when I do not have my work telephone with me and only have a personal telephone. In some cases, and I believe the Deputy is referring one such case, people who I have known since before I became Taoiseach email me on a business matter to my personal email account. I follow my Department's email policy, which I signed off on last October. Where a personal email is used I make sure it is forwarded to somebody who has a Department of the Taoiseach address, which is how it appears for freedom of information, or I forward it myself or produce a hard copy. That is how to ensure it is public record and can be released under freedom of information. That is in line with the email policy which I signed last October.</p>

          <p eId="para_449">Tá áthas orm labhairt os comhair an Dála inniu faoi chruinniú Chomhairle an Aontais Eorpaigh a bhí ar siúl sa Bhruiséil Déardaoin agus Dé hAoine. The European Council met in four different formats over the course of the two days - in regular format to discuss jobs, growth and competitiveness and a number of foreign policy items; in leaders’ agenda format to discuss digital taxation; in euro summit format to discuss economic and monetary union and reform thereof; and in Article 50 format to discuss the Brexit negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">I had two scheduled bilateral meetings in the margins of the European Council - one with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, the other with UK Prime Minister Theresa May - and I had the opportunity to speak informally with my other counterparts over the two days. The Netherlands and Ireland are like-minded on many EU issues, and Prime Minister Rutte and I discussed the European Council agenda, particularly Brexit, economic and monetary union and digital taxation. The Prime Minister reiterated his strong support for Ireland’s unique concerns in respect of Brexit. We agreed that we have a shared interest in achieving a comprehensive and ambitious future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p eId="para_451"> In my meeting with Prime Minister May, I expressed deep concern at the reprehensible nerve gas attack in Salisbury and offered my full support in ensuring an appropriate response at EU and at national level. On Brexit, I welcomed the Prime Minister's explicit commitment to ensuring that the backstop forms part of the withdrawal agreement, as reiterated in her letter to President Tusk of 19 March, and looked forward to progress on this and on the other options before the European Council in June.</p>
          <p eId="para_452"> The European Council opened on Thursday with a short exchange of views with President Tajani of the European Parliament, an update from Prime Minister Borisov of Bulgaria, which currently holds the EU Presidency, and a brief discussion on migration.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> We moved on to review progress on jobs, growth and competitiveness. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi noted the continued strengthening of the European economy, notwithstanding external risks. Our subsequent exchanges covered the Single Market, the digital Single Market, the European semester, trade, social issues, climate change, the banking Union and issues around data and analytics.</p>
          <p eId="para_454"> Ireland has been very active on the Single Market and in calling for greater ambition for the digital Single Market, and I was very pleased that we strengthened the conclusions on this section. The Single Market is now 25 years old, and this milestone should be celebrated. We need to continue our work to complete it and to make sure it functions fully. We tasked the Commission to report by the end of the year on how best this can be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_455"> In light of recent revelations, we exchanged views on data and analytics. Prime Minister May confirmed that the UK Information Commissioner is now investigating Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. There was wide agreement on the need to guarantee transparent practices and full protection of citizens’ privacy and personal data in social networks and on digital platforms. We also discussed EU trade policy, although at that point we awaited confirmation from the US about its decision to impose new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports before finalising our discussion on Friday morning. While Ireland is not a steel producer, we account for approximately 30% of all aluminium produced in the EU at Rusal Aughinish. Although very little of this is traded with the US, any tariffs will impact global commodity prices and we were pleased at the White House decision to exempt the EU from the tariffs until May. There was wide support - notwithstanding the current challenges - to continue to pursue a robust and ambitious trade policy based on an open and rules-based multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization at its core.</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> I also took the opportunity to update colleagues on my meeting with President Trump in Washington DC on 15 March. The leaders’ agenda, initiated by President Tusk last year, is a process with the aim of facilitating free-flowing exchanges between EU leaders on the future of Europe. The focus of the exchange last week was on taxation in the digital era. Our discussions were based on a note prepared by President Tusk, which posed a number of fundamental questions. This was a useful exchange with a range of views expressed around the table. I stated our commitment to tax reform, saying that all companies, including large digital platforms, should pay their fair share of tax, when it is due and where it is owed. In the era of the World Wide Web, however, this is a global issue that requires a global solution. We also need to ensure that tax is paid by companies where value is created, not simply where a transaction happens. Unilateral EU action on that basis could damage EU competitiveness, hand an advantage to our competitors and disadvantage smaller member states with smaller markets. We also need solutions that are evidence based and sustainable in the longer term.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> Ireland will continue to actively engage in work on the digital economy at both OECD and EU level. Finance Ministers will now have time to consider and critically assess the Commission’s latest proposals, which were published on 21 March, and we will have another discussion on tax matters at the European Council in June. On Thursday evening, we had a lengthy discussion on external relations, including the upcoming western Balkans summit, which I look forward to attending in May, and on our relations with Turkey and with Russia. The solidarity and support expressed among member states on these issues was very striking. In global terms, most of us are small countries but, by acting together, we have a powerful impact. This underlines the inherent value of the European Union, especially for smaller countries such as Ireland. In discussing Turkey, we expressed full solidarity with Cyprus and Greece in condemning the ongoing illegal actions in the eastern Mediterranean Sea and the Aegean Sea, as well as the continued detention of EU citizens in Turkey.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> On Russia, we offered full support to Prime Minister May in condemning the attack in Salisbury and the use of chemical weapons under any circumstances, by anybody anywhere. All 28 member states agreed with the UK Government’s assessment and undertook to co-ordinate on the consequences to be drawn from this, although any specific steps are for individual member states. On Monday, 14 partners confirmed that they would be expelling Russian diplomats. Yesterday, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, confirmed that, in light of the European Council conclusions and following an assessment conducted by the security services and relevant Departments, the accreditation of a member of staff at the Russian Embassy with diplomatic status is to be terminated and the individual required to leave the jurisdiction. The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will provide more detail on some of these issues in her remarks later.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> The euro summit on Friday morning, with the 19 member states of the eurozone, focused on economic and monetary union. We also had a debate on banking union on Thursday, with all 28 EU member states. This included a presentation from the President of the Eurogroup. Our approach is fivefold. First, we believe we should be inclusive in our work, allowing non-euro member states to opt into any new policies and programmes. Second, we believe the best way to strengthen the euro is through national policies - essentially countries should take action to reform themselves to balance their books, to reduce their debt and to make their economies more competitive. Third, we support developing the European Stability Mechanism into a European monetary fund on an inter-Governmental basis. Fourth, we want the banking union and deposit insurance to be prioritised, hopefully by December. Fifth, we believe the next EU budget - the multi-annual financial framework - should be used to promote growth, with funding provided for research education, Structural Funds and other fields that boost economic growth. The Finance Ministers of Ireland, Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark. Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania recently published a paper outlining our shared views on this matter. President Tusk will convene another euro summit in June, at which we will continue our discussions on deepening, strengthening and improving economic and monetary union.</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> On Friday, the European Council met in Article 50 format - without Prime Minister May - to discuss Brexit. Michel Barnier reported on progress in the negotiations between the task force and the UK on the draft withdrawal agreement. Good progress has been achieved on some parts of the text including on citizens' rights, the financial settlement, and transitional arrangements, which are now all in green. These are all important areas where we have pushed for practical solutions. Most importantly for Ireland, the UK has now explicitly confirmed that the backstop option, as agreed in the joint report in December, will form part of the legal text of the final withdrawal agreement and that all the issues identified in the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland will need to be addressed to deliver a legally sound solution to avoid a hard border. Prime Minister May reiterated this in her letter to President Tusk on 19 March. It has always been intended that the backstop will apply unless and until another, better solution is found. I share Prime Minister May’s preference to resolve these issues through a wider agreement on the future relationship between the EU and the UK, and look forward to seeing the UK’s detailed proposals on that and on specific solutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_461"> Over the coming weeks, in addition to considering these UK proposals our objective will be to continue to close the remaining gaps to agree the protocol. To this end, EU and UK negotiators have agreed on an intensive schedule of meetings on the Irish issues. Those meetings will start this week. The transition period, which will run until the end or 2020, is now conditionally agreed. This is important for Ireland as it gives certainty to public services, businesses, employers, employees and citizens that EU law will continue to apply in the entire UK - as it does now - until the end of 2020.</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> In light of the progress made, we agreed a set of guidelines to enter into discussions with the UK on the framework for a future relationship. These reflect our ambition for a close partnership with Britain while ensuring a level playing field, fair competition and the integrity of the Single Market. I am pleased that they also leave open the possibility of us revisiting our position and guidelines, should the UK approach evolve and its red line softens. It is very important to emphasise that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and that discussions on the future relationship are dependent on progress on the outstanding elements of the withdrawal agreement - including the Border. I am glad that the other leaders agreed with my strong view that we must review all the withdrawal issues including progress on the backstop at our meeting in June.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">This is essential if we are to make the progress necessary to have both the withdrawal agreement and the framework for the future relationship wrapped up by October, to allow sufficient time for the ratification procedures to be completed by next March. Urgency on all aspects of the negotiations is now required.</p>
          <p eId="para_464"> I assure Deputies that the Government will continue to defend Ireland’s interests in the Brexit negotiations, as we have done, and to advance our interests where opportunities arise. I now look forward to hearing Deputies’ views.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T14:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_465">Is maith an rud é go bhfuilimid ag caint faoin Eoraip inniu agus is léir go raibh an-chuid nithe faoi chaibidil ag an gcomhairle an tseachtain seo chaite. Ní féidir liom caint faoi gach aon cheann. Beidh mise ag díriú ar trí cinn de na hábhair is tábhachtaí a bhí faoi chaibidil ag an gcomhairle.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> I want to use the limited time available to address the three core issues of the Brexit withdrawal treaty, Russia and the economic reform agenda. With exactly a year to go until we reach Brexit day, there has been a significant edging towards some clarity on how the UK will exit and the likely long-term relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union. An enormous amount of time has been wasted waiting for the United Kingdom to accept that it is in no position to dictate the terms of a departure for which it alone is responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> Overall, Michel Barnier and his team have remained true to the basic principles that the European Union's legal order will not be compromised and that access to the benefits of the Single Market and customs union comes with full financial and legal responsibilities. Equally, they have been correct in insisting that the transitionary period must come to an end before the next multiannual financial framework becomes operative. If the United Kingdom discovers at some point soon that it will not be ready, even at the end of 2020, then Norway terms should be available, though it is difficult to see how this can possibly be reconciled with the positions of both the Tory party and, unfortunately, the UK Labour party leadership.</p>
          <p eId="para_468"> We welcome the large amount of text in the draft treaty which is coloured green and is, as such, agreed. We emphatically do not welcome the failure to progress any substantive matter concerning Ireland to a stage beyond the general and, in parts, contradictory agreements of last December. Even the most basic look at the record shows that our Government has, for the past year, been briefing that its core strategy has been to ensure that Ireland is not caught up in final stage negotiations where the pressure for compromises will be greatest. When the negotiating guidelines were first announced we were told that Ireland must be decided before other items were decided. This will not now be the case and the Taoiseach has refused to even acknowledge the change of strategy, let alone justify it. Let no one be in any doubt - no backstop has been agreed. The European Union has prepared a text which the United Kingdom has said is unacceptable, including this week in the House of Commons. They have agreed the principle of there being some sort of backstop if there is no agreement on a final status but they have repeatedly said, including in the letter from the Prime Minister, Theresa May, referred to by the Taoiseach, that they will not agree a measure that makes Northern Ireland subject to a different legal and customs regime. This is no small difference and the Taoiseach's decision to have it long-fingered to a later stage in the process is, potentially, a huge error.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> It is an unfortunate reality that the Taoiseach's approach to this issue means whenever a legitimate challenge is made his first reaction is to go on the political attack. He arrived back from Berlin last week and informed the Dáil that he did not believe anyone was fit to replace him - an incredible statement from someone in the job for less than a year. Instead of explaining why his agreement to proceed without progressing the Irish text was consistent with past policy, the Taoiseach chose to launch an absurd attack on Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly and Fianna Fáil. He could have risen to the occasion and argued in good faith but he did not. Instead, we got the recitation of a ridiculous Sinn Féin attack and a false claim that we are inconsistent. That he would align himself with Ireland's most consistently anti-European Union party for the sake of making a political attack on this matter reveals a lot.</p>
          <p eId="para_470"> The Tánaiste said that, if we do not have this done by June, we will have to raise some serious questions as to whether it is possible to finalise a withdrawal at all. How does this reconcile with the Taoiseach's casual acceptance of waiting until October? I know the Taoiseach has had difficulty in the past week or so with statements from the Tánaiste but this one needs to be squared. It is regrettable that parts of the media appear to be wholly reliant on the Government's briefings and narrative in covering Brexit and, therefore, have not examined a significant change in Government strategy. In comparison, the international coverage has emphasised how little progress has been made on Ireland, how an agreed backstop is further away than ever and how other countries were now pushing their own national agendas for October. We remain absolutely of the belief that it is an error to pretend that Ireland can be addressed through the overall UK-EU relationship. A form of special status which respects the constitution and settlement agreed by the people in 1998 remains the only viable route, something which has been made more difficult by the megaphone diplomacy of the past six months which has raised entirely unreasonable fears.</p>
          <p eId="para_471"> It appears now that the Government will declare whatever emerges from the overall negotiations as a great success and will hail itself for accepting the technologically managed Border suggested by the United Kingdom, for which there is no international model. If the Taoiseach and Tánaiste wish to have the support of the pro-European Union majority in this House during the remainder of the negotiations, it would be well advised to consult more and step back from its attacks when others disagree with it on how to get the best outcome for Ireland and the European Union as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> As we stated last night, Fianna Fáil supports the Council's decision to condemn Russian aggression and the actions which have followed. It is unfortunate that the Government appears to have made no preparations in advance of last Friday and that it took no steps to brief the constructive parts of the Opposition about serious Irish-related security issues. We have been raising Russian aggression during these sessions for the past four years and pointing out how the direct threat to Europe and the wider world was escalating all the time. Let us put aside the nonsense that Russia's denials should be taken seriously. We heard the same aggressive denials when it invaded and partitioned Ukraine, when it shot down a Dutch passenger plane, when it blocked any international action after the grotesque repressions and slaughter of the Assad regime, when it supplied funding to extremist anti-democratic and racist parties in Austria, France, Hungary and other countries, when it interfered in referendums in Britain and the Netherlands and elections in the Netherlands, France and elsewhere, when it launched the largest ever cyber attacks on European Union states and the Baltic states, and when it systematically undermined any real actions on human rights by the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the OSCE. Does anyone here forget that the very people today denying responsibility for Salisbury denied they had troops in the Crimea? Subsequently, the Russian state not only admitted it had lied, it issued medals to the troops and erected a statue to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_473"> Last night, we heard the nonsense argument that we are somehow following a Cold War mentality or losing our neutrality by saying that enough is enough. Russia must know that the democratic world will not just roll over and let it be undermined and we believe Ireland must stand with the democratic world. It never ceases to amaze me how people and parties who spend their time lecturing us about rights are nearly always silent on Russia and are even apologists for Russia. With the exception of Deputy Boyd Barrett, whose commitment to the Kurdish cause means he regularly and quite correctly attacks the behaviour of Russia in that region, others go through incredible contortions to blame anyone but Russia. The displays of whataboutery are frankly pathetic. Our self-declared crusaders on neutrality were even silent when Russia sent nuclear armed bombers to Irish-controlled airspace with their transponders turned off - thereby endangering civilian aviation.</p>

          <p eId="para_475">Sinn Féin's behaviour is notable. It goes to the United States and pretends to be a friend of that country when raising money, yet it goes to incredible lengths to avoid giving offence to Vladimir Putin. When he invaded and partitioned a European country, the sum total of Sinn Féin's criticism was that the Crimean referendum could have been run a bit better. Perhaps the party's new leadership will take the opportunity to break with this lamentable record. Every single person here knows that Russia is responsible for Salisbury as it fits into a pattern of nearly a decade where real and perceived enemies of Putin are killed. It is now incumbent on the Government to follow up this action. It should immediately work with Deputy James Lawless to get his legislation through and to make whatever amendments are required and I welcome what the Taoiseach said yesterday on this. It should take other steps if fears about commercial espionage and sabotage are proven to be correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> The digital taxation proposal was a superficial proposal, lacking a basic impact assessment.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">The only reasonable way to proceed is on the basis of a wider international approach and proper evaluation of different options. We remain concerned at the emerging push for a conservative approach to fiscal policy and economic reforms. An approach which puts restraint and regulation as the core policy will not deliver the growth and progress Europe needs. There should be more ambition on the banking union, on fiscal contributions and on the financial backstop. We again call on the Taoiseach to state clearly what policies he is signing Ireland up for. The only way to protect and build upon the constructive consensus on Europe which has defined the majority position in Irish politics is to return to the tradition of genuine consultations.</p>

          <p eId="para_478">I am sharing time with Deputy Cullinane. We will take five minutes each. </p>
          <p eId="para_479"> I am very glad to hear the leader of Fianna Fáil reiterate the necessity for special status for the North of Ireland and to protect the peace agreements, to ensure no hard border and to keep the North inside the customs union and the Single Market. There are women in the Gallery from Ligoniel in north Belfast. The Taoiseach might wave to them. This is of specific concern to these fine women because they live in that part of Ireland. They are from a cross-community group and we have hosted them before. This is north Belfast at its finest and the women are very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> I will not waste any of my time answering the histrionic nonsense. By all means, be tough on Russia and on Putin. The Government should please do that, and it may be tough on any other regime or government that threatens international stability and violates international law. I might include the state of Israel in that. Above all, the Taoiseach's duty is to protect people here. The position from which we exert most authority and influence is our long-standing position of military neutrality. Despite what Deputy Micheál Martin and Deputy Stephen Donnelly, who seems to be extraordinarily thin-skinned if we are to believe his leader, stated, I think that is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> It is clear that the British Government maintains a very dismissive and arrogant attitude towards Ireland when it comes to Brexit. This has been the case from the beginning. Its attitude threatens the island, North to South, and might in fact imperil relationships - not least commercial and trading relationships - east to west between Ireland and Britain. The hard Tory Brexiteers just want Brexit at any cost and they are becoming increasingly irresponsible in their rhetoric in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_482"> We know a backstop was negotiated in December. The Taoiseach called it cast-iron, bulletproof and so on. The Tories moved to dismiss that and to say they were opposed to it. They have not put an alternative backstop on the table. We know from speaking to the European authorities and from interactions with the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, that the backstop is the bottom line. The British cannot come forward with something less than that and imagine it will fly. Also here, the Taoiseach's message is that the preference is for a wider trade arrangement. We hear all of that. It is absolutely imperative that by June, the British have shown us the colour of their money. If they do not like the backstop as proposed and written out in legal text by the European authorities, they need to come up with their own one. We need to know it meets the requisite standard. There is a real danger, if this drifts any further, that we could become the victims and collateral damage of the pressure politics that will undoubtedly unfold as Europe as a whole and individual member states move to protect what they regard as their individual interests. My colleague, Deputy Cullinane, will elaborate on some of these ideas.</p>
          <p eId="para_483"> I raise again the issue of Catalonia. I condemn the arrest of Carles Puigdemont and his colleagues. It is absolutely reprehensible and counter-productive. The actions of the Spanish Government have served only to deepen the crisis. The dispute between the peoples of Catalonia and the Spanish state over independence will not be resolved by incarceration or repression. The people voted for independence and the European Union at this stage has a duty to come off the sidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_484"> It is not good enough for an Irish Government to hide behind the lie that this is an internal matter for the Spanish Government. This is a matter of democracy. It is a matter of national self-determination, and we in this country should know all about that. I am asking the Taoiseach to show leadership in calling on the Spanish Government to release democratically elected representatives, commit to dialogue and mediation, and to respect the vote of the people of Catalonia. I ask the Taoiseach to pick up the telephone to Mr. Rajoy and other EU leaders, and to convey a message in the strongest possible terms that in disputes such as these - we know this to our cost, and the women from north Belfast in the Gallery could tell the Taoiseach this - that repression and incarceration do not work; dialogue does. That is the great lesson from Ireland and the Taoiseach should be an ambassador for it.</p>

          <from>Deputy David Cullinane<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T14:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_485">As the Taoiseach and the leader of Fianna Fáil will know, Sinn Féin has given the Irish Government and the European negotiators a qualified support on Brexit. We do so not because we support the Government or the European negotiators, but because we support what we see as an Irish approach and an Irish solution to Brexit. Every single political party on the island of Ireland should be behind a special solution for the North, which involves keeping the North in the customs union and Single Market, protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and ensuring the rights of citizens are also protected. That should be the position of everybody on the island and we certainly want that as the final outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_486"> While we give the Government qualified support, we are also concerned about responses to many of the agreements which have been reached by the British Government. The Taoiseach would surely have to agree that there are contradictions between what was agreed last December and what was in the most recent joint report, as well as the actual statements from the British Prime Minister and others in Britain in respect of all of these issues. We were told last December that what we had was a cast-iron, bulletproof guarantee, yet we are still involved in negotiations. This morning, I challenged the Tánaiste on the backstop arrangement and the fact that the British Government has dismissed out of hand the legal text that has been put forward by the European Commission. The Tánaiste said I had to understand that we are still involved in a negotiation. Why are we involved in negotiations on a cast-iron guarantee? Our difficulty is that while we have a political agreement in principle, in practical terms the British Government has not signed up to any legal text which would give expression to that political agreement. The Taoiseach would surely understand that this will cause concern to people in Ireland. As Teachta McDonald said, we cannot sit around waiting for months more to see the colour of the money from the British Government. We have to see the legal text to which they will agree.</p>
          <p eId="para_487"> The most recent joint agreement between Britain and the European Union was colour coded in yellow, green and white. There were some elements in yellow, which we were told meant agreement in principle. There were very few Irish issues in green, meaning there was agreement, and they were on the common travel area and a few other issues. On the crucial issue of trade there was no agreement whatsoever. On the crucial issue of the Border there was no agreement whatsoever. It is still outstanding. That is the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_488"> Let us be very clear that the backstop agreement does not mean the North of Ireland staying in the customs union and Single Market. We all hope there will be an agreement between Britain and the European Union on trade and a customs type partnership that will make it a lot easier. Let us hope we do get to that position. If we do not and the backstop agreement is the baseline and is implemented, all we are doing is aligning the North and the South in terms of trade in areas to do with North-South co-operation and the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">It does not cover all services or all goods. How those goods and services are to be monitored and checked must be outlined. That will have to be done via checks, either at the Border or at the premises of companies or factories, which will put the responsibility back on businesses. These are real questions and real concerns that people living on either side of the Border have. There is a responsibility on the Government to ensure that we move away from the rhetoric, the words, the fine promises and the political agreements and towards a legal agreement we can all see which will protect the Good Friday Agreement, the interests of Ireland and the rights of citizens and will protect against any hardening of the Border. </p>
          <p eId="para_490"> It is often said by Brexit commentators that they do not wish to see a hard border in Ireland. We do not want to see any hardening of the Border in Ireland at all. That should be the position of the Government. It should not merely seek to avoid a hard border. No hardening of the Border can be accepted by any Irish Government, and that must be the Government's position as the negotiations continue. </p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T14:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_491">In the run-up to the EU Council meeting last week the overwhelming focus was on Brexit and the proposals leaders were to discuss on digital taxation. However, as the UK prepares to leaves the Union, we were provided with a symbolic and poignant demonstration on the benefits and power of membership. Prime Minister May addressed the assembled leaders of 27 other member states on the chemical weapon attack in Salisbury. She asked for the EU to stand shoulder to shoulder with the UK on their response to Russia. EU leaders strongly condemned the attack and the use of chemical weapons under any circumstances. They expressed deepest sympathies to all whose lives had been threatened or affected by the attack, lent their support to the ongoing investigation and stressed the Union's unqualified solidarity with the UK. Following that decision, the EU withdrew its ambassador to the Russian Federation for a period of four weeks. That was a strong and clear signal to Russia, and a clear manifestation of European solidarity.</p>
          <p eId="para_492"> I was alone among the Opposition to support the Government’s stance in Brussels last Friday of standing in solidarity with the UK. It is simply not credible that Ireland would stand alone of the 28 EU member states on this issue, which includes both neutral countries like Sweden, but also those like Greece and Cyprus that have close friendships with Russia. It is a collective tragedy for the UK and the EU that such a shared action will not occur after March 2019. If this happened in a year’s time, Prime Minister May would not have been at the Council and would have to rely on bilateral discussions with countries like Germany, France or others to make the case. It was a clear demonstration that by pooling our sovereignty in the EU, we have actually strengthened our position as individual countries. This has most recently been shown with European support for Ireland on the status of the Border in Brexit negotiations. It is reassuring for Ireland to know that should an attack like this happen here, or a natural disaster ever impact on us, that we can automatically rely on the friendship and solidarity of member states. </p>
          <p eId="para_493"> There was an expectation that the proposals for a digital tax would dominate the outcome of the Council. It is interesting, as others have commented, that the conclusions of the Council do not include any mention of the proposal. The policy design of the tax, which would allow companies to use the amount paid as a credit against corporation tax, shows that it would be a transfer of revenue from smaller to larger countries. This is a difficult issue for Ireland but large digital corporations should be required to pay more tax on the profits they make. However, in the race and ambition to do that, the position and national competencies of member states should not and cannot be undermined. We have been very clear about our support for the OECD base erosion profit shifting, BEPS, process, which has shown concrete results and will continue to do so if all countries remain committed to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_494"> Ireland was expected to take a position at the Council arguing that moves to impose such a tax would be viewed negatively in the United States and potentially escalate into a trade war. However, that issue was removed from the table on Thursday when the US announced it would temporarily exempt the EU from President Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminium. As the Taoiseach has told us in reply to questions earlier, this is a temporary measure that will apply until May. Despite this concession we can expect that the Trump Administration will continue to press its case. The EU Council has said that these measures cannot be justified on the grounds of national security, which is the pretext used for moving away from an agreed international tariffs regime. However, it has been reported that Germany wants tariffs reduced on car imports from the US into the EU from 10% to possibly match the US rate of 2.5%. That signals to me that the strong-arm unilateral tactics being deployed by the Trump Administration are having an impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_495"> On trade in general, as the US retreats from open trading arrangements across the globe, it falls to the EU now to lead. The Council reaffirmed its commitment to an open and rules-based trading system with the World Trade Organization, WTO, at its core, and is working to progress talks with Mexico and Mercosur. The trade agreements with Japan and Singapore also need to be concluded. However, it is important that in any trade talks, the people of the EU can retain confidence in what is being negotiated, that their concerns are heard and that the EU and other member states listen and take on board the legitimate concerns of people in all our countries, including trade unionists and civil society.</p>
          <p eId="para_496"> The Council was to focus on jobs, growth and competitiveness. Social issues are a part of that and delivering on the European social pillar is a shared commitment of the EU and all our member states. The Council has now been invited to consider the Commission proposals under the social fairness package. This includes the proposal on a European labour authority. This new agency would provide support for mobile workers and ensure that their rights are fought for and maintained across borders. There are 17 million cross-border workers in the EU, and many of them live in Ireland. I asked last week what were the views of the Government on this proposal and I hope this can be outlined in the response of the Minister of State at the end of this debate. It would be welcome if the Government would outline an implementation plan for the European pillar of social rights. Social issues cannot just be seen as a tagged on to general trade discussions or as a general part of trade and competitiveness talks, or as something of a sop or an afterthought. They are at the core of what people who are enthusiastic about the European project want to see achieved. It must be at the heart of what we seek from Europe, to address the genuine concerns of people on issues such as job security, terms and conditions of work, education, health and child care. </p>
          <p eId="para_497"> On the Paris Agreement, the Council asked the Commission to present by next year a long-term EU strategy to reduce emissions that takes into account national plans. Ireland has singularly failed to show ambition on tackling climate change, and the Government, having published its Project Ireland 2040 plan, must now ensure we meet our greenhouse gas reduction targets. </p>
          <p eId="para_498"> The Council condemned Turkey’s actions in the Mediterranean and the Aegean Sea over the rights of Cyprus and Greece to offshore oil and gas exploration. I am also concerned at the continued actions of Turkish forces in northern Syria, and the city of Afrin in particular, which I raised earlier today, and the impact that incursion is having on civilians and in particular on Kurds who are under attack.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> I ask the Taoiseach to raise this matter again at the EU Council and to ensure that it becomes a permanent focus at EU Council meetings until this matter is resolved. There was an EU-Turkey summit on Monday and relations between the EU and Turkey remain tense. Turkey was once on track actually to become a member state. That is now increasingly unlikely. Future enlargement of the Union has now turned to the western Balkans. There are six possible future members, namely Albania, Kosovo, Serbia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. While the EU efforts appear most focused on Serbia, it is important that the others are not neglected and I do not believe they will be.</p>
          <p eId="para_500"> Last week the Albanian Prime Minister urged the start of talks and visited Brussels in advance of the summit to press his case. If the Government has a view on future enlargement, I again invite the Minister of State to set it out.</p>
          <p eId="para_501"> Finally, under Article 50 the EU agreed to open talks on the future trade relationship with the United Kingdom and the outline of a transition deal was agreed. We have discussed this at length and I know we will continue to discuss it, but I want to reiterate that I am concerned about the ongoing fudge on the Irish Border. It must be resolved and hopefully can be resolved well before the October deadline that the Taoiseach referenced. </p>

          <p eId="para_502">Last Sunday, the former President of Catalonia, Mr. Carles Puigdemont, was arrested in Germany on foot of a European arrest warrant. He had been in exile since October and Catalonia's declaration of independence and he faced charges from the Spanish state, including the charge of rebellion. He was arrested when his car pulled into a petrol station in northern Germany, following a spy operation carried out by 12 agents of the Spanish state who had a tracking device on his car and used geolocation on his friend's mobile telephone.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> Last week, on 21 March, the day before the EU Council summit commenced, a Spanish Supreme Court judge brought similar charges against leading Catalan politicians, bringing the number of such politicians facing these grave charges to 25. On Friday, 23 March, while the EU Council met, five of these leading politicians were jailed and another was forced into exile, bringing the number in pre-trial detention without bail to nine. These are political prisoners. The number of such politicians forced into exile has climbed to seven.</p>
          <p eId="para_504"> The charge of rebellion in the Spanish legal code makes reference to public and violent uprising. There was no public and violent uprising. I myself was in Catalonia on 1 October, the day of the independence referendum. I witnessed a huge number of people coming out peacefully queueing outside polling stations to cast their votes. There was violence on the day; it was exclusively at the hands of Spanish state police who used batons, rubber bullets, plastic bullets and so on. This violence has been repeated in recent days. The protests in Barcelona during the past several days and in other Catalan towns and cities were attacked by Spanish state police. Some 89 were injured. That was the figure I saw, which has probably risen since then. Police fired live ammunition into the air. The ghost of General Franco lives on. In the upper echelons of the Spanish state there are strong echoes of the type of Francoist repression and attitudes that prevailed 40 years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_505"> By the way, this does not just apply to repression in Catalonia. Recently, we saw the jailing of the Spanish rapper Josep Miquel Arenas Beltran, whose stage name is Valtònyc. He was imprisoned for three and a half years by the Spanish Supreme Court because of his song lyrics, which according to the court included defamation against the crown. He joined another rapper who had been jailed for two years and a rap collective which had been jailed for two years and a day. The extra day is a technicality to extend their sentence.</p>
          <p eId="para_506"> This was happening while the EU Council met. The arrest of Mr. Puigdemont was on the Sunday after the EU Council summit, but the other events took place the day before and while it met. What did the leaders of Europe say? Nothing. What did the EU Council say? Nothing. What did the Taoiseach say? Nothing at all. The Taoiseach and the other Governments of Europe have everything to say about the possible, perhaps probable, actions of the Russian authorities, but nothing to say about the actual actions of the Spanish authorities. Double standards, by any standards. </p>
          <p eId="para_507"> Is it any wonder that in Barcelona on Sunday night the crowd marched to the European Commission offices and chanted "This Europe is shameful"? It is far from being a defender of democratic rights or the rights of small nations, as we often hear in this House. Just look at Catalonia. In conclusion, April 15 has been named as a day of protest in Catalonia. Unions and civil society organisations are getting behind that. I hope that turns into a general strike and I think we will see a general strike in Catalonia in April. We send that movement solidarity and greetings. We call for the release of all political prisoners, for a general strike in Catalonia against repression, for an end to capitalism, for a socialist republic of Catalonia with the rights of all minorities guaranteed and for the unity of the working class, for a socialist and voluntary federation of the peoples of the Spanish state.</p>

        <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_260">
          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T14:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_508">Deputy Barry has outlined how a state of the European Union is engaged in pretty unacceptable and brutal repression of those protesting against injustice. There is also an ally of the European Union with preferential trade arrangements, Israel, whose actions we should consider as we come to Easter weekend. Easter, of course, commemorates the persecution of the Israelites by the Roman Empire during the time of Jesus Christ. I am not particularly religious, but nonetheless I note that it commemorates the crucifixion of somebody who spoke up for a persecuted minority. Most people in Europe now give allegiance to that religion. As we speak, in the very same land, the modern day Israelites are the Palestinians.</p>
          <p eId="para_509"> This weekend, on Good Friday, there will be peaceful protests all over the land of Palestine. Members can see for themselves online. I suggest they read about the international co-ordination for the great return march. It is a protest that will involve all civil society groups and families who were dispossessed in 1948. All political parties in Palestine are supporting these protests, although they will not be visibly present because they want it to be a genuine grassroots protest. There is absolute commitment that there will be no violence. There will be totally peaceful sit-downs very close to the Gaza border and to the security line between the West Bank and Israel. This protest will run from Land Day, which is this Friday, until 15 May. The protestors are going to occupy the area of the security zone, and at some point they will peacefully approach the barriers, citing a United Nations resolution which gives refugees who have been dispossessed the right to return to their own country. They expect to be met with pretty brutal violence by the Israelis, who are already gearing up to attack the protests.</p>
          <p eId="para_510"> If that happens I think it is terribly important that we, the Taoiseach and the European Union speak up for the Palestinian people, who are simply seeking to assert their right under international law, the right to return.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">The United Nations has just produced several reports detailing the continuing illegal expansion into east Jerusalem, Hebron and the Golan Heights. It has called for an end to this. There have been demolitions of houses and hundreds of young people have been jailed. Ahed Tamimi, a child, has spent eight months in prison. She joined hundreds of other children in administrative detention on having been arrested by the Israelis. Twelve elected representatives of the Palestinian Legislative Council are in prison on administrative detention, most without any charge. We have to speak out. This is the weekend to do it if we care about rights, opposing oppression and persecution and preventing the violence from which these peaceful protesters are very likely to suffer. I invite all those who are sympathetic to the Palestinian cause to a short Solidarity gathering outside the Dáil at 2.30 p.m. tomorrow in solidarity with the international march. I hope people will join that.</p>
          <p eId="para_512"> Today the Central Bank is likely to recommend the closing down of the Sandyford printing press where we print euro notes. If its recommendation is implemented, Ireland will no longer have independent capacity to print currency. I do not know what will happen to the euro. It will probably last, and might last a long time, but we know from the most recent crisis that not being able to print our own currency in the event of a serious problem with the euro is very retrograde. The representatives of the workers at the press pointed out an extraordinary fact, namely, that much State printing - security printing - is outsourced but could be done in Sandyford, thereby preventing the closure. Did the Government know Irish stamps are printed in Australia? I did not know. Could this work and some of the other security work be given to the Sandyford printing press rather than having 45 jobs go, robbing this State of the capacity to produce its own currency?</p>

          <p eId="para_513">I am sharing time with Deputy Clare Daly.</p>
          <p eId="para_514"> When speaking last week prior to the European Council meeting, I made the point that it was strange that there are so many humanitarian crises in the world that the Council is not addressing. I had the opportunity a few days ago to meet parliamentarians from Yemen. I listened to them on the effects of the three-year war on their country. They referred to suffering, destruction and devastation in addition to a lack of water and electricity and very poor access to medical services. They referred to the shutdown of the media. There is one newspaper left out of 300 that existed before the war. There are also threats to parliamentarians. The parliamentarians to whom I spoke made the point very strongly that there is a need for the UN Security Council and the European Council to take a much stronger stance.</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> Let me turn to the sustainable development goals. One hundred and ninety-three countries, in Europe and outside it, have signed up to the goals but not one of them can be achieved in a conflict zone. Therefore, the implementation of the goals means standing up to and confronting the arms industry. Hypocritically, countries that signed up to the goals are selling arms to countries that also signed up to them. Those arms are fuelling and exacerbating conflict in so many countries. It means that the goals cannot be implemented. Some $100 billion is spent on the nuclear arms budget. What could be achieved if this were used to address humanitarian issues?</p>
          <p eId="para_516"> The European Council meeting was about the Single Market, trade, trade deals and how Europe will pursue a robust trade policy. Last week, the Taoiseach referred to global tax reform in his speech. I looked for a reference in the conclusions and could not find anything on it. Maybe it is there somewhere. Likewise, I looked for a reference to the human rights aspect of business and trade. I attended a seminar at the Irish Centre for Human Rights in NUI Galway on the national action plans on business. The point was being made strongly by the speakers that Europe had been a leader on the national action plans, which are about implementing the UN guiding principles on business and human rights. EU leadership is sadly lacking, however, and it is falling behind. It has become somewhat complacent. That was obvious from the European Council meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> Despite all the discussion about trade and the Single Market, there was no discussion on the rights of workers. At the conference, the point was certainly made that there is a need for corporate transparency, corporate liability and access to justice. There is fear that the national action plans on business and human rights are getting lost in the discussion on the sustainable development goals but surely they should be complementary, especially when we are looking at private enterprise being involved in implementing the goals. There is a really serious lack of justice for workers working for European companies outside Europe. It is impossible for them to gain access to justice. We see this particularly in the extractive industries but also in others. There are some victims who have been waiting for 30 or 40 years for justice. That leads to the conclusion that there is a need for mandatory human rights due diligence when it comes to business.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> The European Council condemned the use of chemical weapons and it also condemned the attack on Salisbury but it then agreed with the UK Government's assessment to the effect that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible. That is a very dangerous precedent on which to make decisions. It is extremely difficult to understand why Ireland made the decision it made on intelligence from the UK. Is there some reason we believe the UK rather than anybody else? It has not exactly been telling the truth on many other issues. It is like the saying "Dúirt bean liom go ndúirt léi", which is not a constructive basis on which to make decisions. Perhaps Russia was responsible but there is a need for independent evidence in order to reach that conclusion. What is occurring is damaging the respect afforded to us internationally. Our reputation is being damaged, not to mention what our activity is signalling in terms of our neutrality, or so-called neutrality.</p>
          <p eId="para_519"> One of the conclusions from the Council meeting refers to closer co-operation between EU member states and with NATO. It is not enough to be making speeches about our neutrality that are not matched with actions regarding neutrality. We need only look at the figures we are getting from Shannonwatch regarding the use of Shannon Airport by the US military. We are being pushed, cajoled or lured - or whatever word one wants to use - into the military arena. Ireland will pay a very high price. We will pay a high price, particularly in the context of our reputation for humanitarian activity and securing human rights.</p>

          <from>Deputy Clare Daly<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T14:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_520">I am disgusted to the pit of my being by the stance taken by the Government on the expulsion of a Russian diplomat and our sycophantic fawning behind the British authorities and the European Union regarding the matters in Salisbury. Unfortunately, I could not be here last night but I wish to put on the record, in the strongest possible terms, my abhorrence of the stance being taken by the Government on these matters. I do not believe it reflects the view of the Irish people. I, for one, want no part of it. It is wrong on so many counts that we do not have the time to deal with the relevant matters here.</p>
          <p eId="para_521"> The hypocrisy is beyond belief. We are supposed to be a sovereign, independent and neutral country. That we would take a position based not at all on evidence but on the suspicions of a friendly power is absolutely reprehensible. I do not believe for one moment that An Garda Síochána had any evidence against the individual who was expelled from Ireland. If it had, why did it not act upon it before now? This is an absolutely shameful stance to take. What has gone on will put into the tuppenny-ha'penny place the lies about weapons of mass destruction that were used to justify the Iraq war. Similar circumstances are unravelling here.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> Last night, the Tánaiste said that if we had not rowed in behind the lads, we would be in a very difficult place. The Minister for Finance said we must act in solidarity with our ally. That is just not good enough in a modern climate. The idea that the Russian people, or Russian authorities, could be ganged up on on the basis of a decision to stand behind our friends is exactly the type of ideology we try to warn our children about. We try to teach them that one does not go on with the big boys or gang up on the basis of tittle-tattle and gossip because it is the prevailing thing to do. If something is wrong and one does not have evidence, one should investigate it. One should take a step back and not move along with the pack. As an independent country, we had an opportunity to do something different. I feel utterly embarrassed by the stance taken by the Government. The double standards alone are sickening. There is no evidence whatsoever that the Russian authorities were involved in this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">One contrasts what we have done here with the direct evidence where our own citizens were targeted by a foreign power and had their identities stolen. I refer, of course, to the incidents in Dubai in January 2010 when Mossad agents used forged Irish passports to carry out an assassination. It was an absolute violation of diplomacy. What did the Irish authorities do then? Did we swing into action? The head of the Dubai police at the time said he was 99% sure Mossad was responsible. Did we expel any Israelis? No, we did not. We waited for an investigation to be carried out before we took that stand. That was when one of our own citizen's identity was violated. I contrast that with the suspicion, which has been mooted by the British authorities, and the way in which we have shamefully fallen into line in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_524"> Mr. Craig Murray, the British diplomat and human rights activist, has written a striking précis on this and made comparisons between what has gone on here and the pressure in relation to furthering the subsequently discredited lie on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. He has said it is a scientific impossibility that the UK's chemical investigations unit could have tested for Russian Novichok because it never possessed a Russian sample for the purposes of comparison. The point is made that the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, OPCW, has had full access to all Russian chemical weapons facilities for more than a decade. In fact, last year its officials completed the destruction of the last Russian chemical weapons. I contrast that with the American chemical weapons stockpile, which has five years left to run before it will be eliminated. Israel has a chemical weapons stockpile but it will not even sign up to the OPCW. It has been said that Novichok and the new nerve gas are of a type developed in Russia but no evidence has been provided that it was made there. In fact, the evidence as to whether they existed at all could have been manufactured by anybody else.</p>
          <p eId="para_525"> It is shameful that we have gone down this road. It is part of a Russophobia I want no part of and it is about worthy and unworthy victims and worthy and unworthy powers. If we are talking about extrajudicial killings taking place in other territories, which is reprehensible, let us look at what the American authorities, the Israelis and the Saudis are doing in Yemen. If we want to expel people, why not expel them all given that those crimes are verified and backed up by evidence?</p>

        <speech by="#MattieMcGrath" eId="spk_263">
          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T15:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_526">I am happy to make some comments on the post-EU Council statements. At the European Council, the Taoiseach aligned himself clearly with the position adopted by France's President Macron with respect to the expulsion of Russian diplomatic personnel in what was supposed to be a show of European solidarity. They have not shown us much solidarity in recent times. The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, is well aware of that having been over there. It is a pity the Taoiseach has left the Chamber but we need to get some solidarity from them also. It works both ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_527"> As I said last night on statements on the Salisbury attack, it was a case of Leo the lion attacking the Russian bear. As I also said, it may be Leo the lamb at the end of the situation in which we find ourselves on this Easter week. We normally have lamb at this time. It might be Leo the lamb because he was too quick to rush into it. As Deputy Clare Daly said, we try to teach our youngsters not to go with the mob in cases of bullying and intimidation or to jump in when there is a suspicion of something but nothing has been proven. I have always believed in the premise of "innocent until proven guilty". It looks here as if the Government has found the Russians guilty and hanged them before any specific evidence has been produced or any charges have been brought. I condemn totally the reprehensible attack on that family and the use of that gas but we should get the full facts first. As I said to Deputy Micheál Martin when he was speaking, what about the trade links we have with Russia? Are we going to simply follow the pack? Is that what Leo the lion is doing? Is it the lion hunting the rabbits? That is a bad move for our Taoiseach but this is what he likes to use to distract people from the messes he and his Tánaiste have created at home.</p>
          <p eId="para_528"> I note from the Taoiseach's earlier remarks that he was to meet Chancellor Merkel and discuss and adopt conclusions on jobs, growth and competitiveness, including the Single Market, the European semester, social issues and trade. He was also due to discuss external relations, including those with Turkey and the western Balkans. I understand further from the Taoiseach's remarks that leaders' agenda discussions are intended to facilitate an open and free-flowing exchange of views on the future of Europe and that in his words, "these meetings are not supposed to produce conclusions but rather to unlock some of the more contentious aspects of issues on the EU agenda and to allow each of us to understand the others' positions a bit better". We have had a lot of them in that case and it has all been one-way traffic. I do not see where our views were allowed to be expressed or were listened to. We know that from where we are with Brexit. We know what attitude the European leaders took to the sovereign British people when they voted in a certain manner. They took that attitude to us also when we had the Lisbon and other referendums. Where then was all the free speech and free-flowing engagement to which the Taoiseach referred? We are stuck with our Border up the road with no indication of any flinching or engagement or free-flowing exchanges of views. The Taoiseach came back in December with a bullet-proof deal on the Border but where is it now? It is like the snow we got on Paddy's Day; tá sé imithe. It is gone off the mountain with the first bit of sun. The deal he had was not very solid. If that is what he calls bullet-proof, he is some lion. I would rather call him a mouse.</p>
          <p eId="para_529"> While I welcome the idea of free-flowing discussions, it is a very novel approach from the EU leadership. I do not know if Leo - I should call him "Taoiseach" - is at these meetings at all or if he dreams about them. We have had decades now of leadership from the top with little or no regard for the implications of what European policy means for the ordinary people of Europe. We have seen this quite recently when Donald Tusk and the rest of them bemoaned and attacked the British people for daring to vote out of kilter with their plan, project and vision. We now have free-flowing dialogue, if it happened, as the Taoiseach says it did, whereby issues are sorted out around the table with a chat and a pat on the back. We saw recently in the Italian elections that people at the heart of Europe are almost completely alienated from the European project. What more evidence do we need? All this talk of partnership and alliances rings utterly hollow for many within the European Union, including our own people here as we saw with the banking fiasco. The EU banks were allowed to shovel money in here but when the you-know-what hit the fan, they were gone. They were then our great supporters and gave us a so-called "bailout", which I voted against. I would have voted against it ten times if I could. It was a clean-out. They charged us 6% interest when we got it from the USA and others at 3% and less. They were our friends all right.</p>
          <p eId="para_530"> People have witnessed time and time again an agenda driven solely by the interests of the bigger members, in particular Germany and France. We now have our Taoiseach lining up with President Macron in France. Perhaps the Taoiseach might inform us what conclusions were reached in his discussions on educational and cultural co-operation and, in particular, on migration, institutional reform and the multi-annual financial framework. Tá sé imithe anois. It is a case, as Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan said, of dúirt bean liom go ndúirt bean léi. Dúirt bean leis an Taoiseach ach níl a fhios aige cad a bhí an bhean sin ag caint faoi. These are some of the key concerns many feel are not being addressed adequately. It is obvious to us also but we do not want to listen. Before he left for the summit, the Taoiseach remarked that 19 eurozone members were to meet for a euro summit and that the President of the ECB, Mario Draghi, and the Eurogroup would be present. He said the focus will be on economic and monetary union, EMU, and proposals for a European monetary fund with a banking unit and fiscal policy considerations among others.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">This, as well we all know, is a source of the most profound disagreement. In particular, the concept of banking union is riddled with dangers for ordinary people, given how disastrously things could go wrong, and such is the flowing language in which the Taoiseach talks about it. Our own banking system has been a shining example of how not to manage banking affairs. Why would we have any confidence whatsoever that a European banking union would perform any better? I have serious concerns - I only became aware of it when Deputy Boyd Barrett said it - that we no longer have a printing facility if our so-called friends decide to stand on us, choke us or whatever. They abandoned us in our hour of need. It is ironic that this is Holy Week, with Good Friday approaching. We will not have any access to printing money and we are blindly and stupidly adoring to these big shots in Europe and forgetting our own people, especially the little people.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> While I have mentioned it is Holy Week, Deputies O'Keeffe and Grealish and I had a Topical Issue debate here on Holy Thursday last about the persecution of Christians in the Middle East. Genocide is taking place there. Of course, we went there as well and bombed the hell out of them - we supported it as well. We were told there were weapons of mass destruction and there was nothing of the kind. It was all fiction just to suit an agenda. Those people are being persecuted and abandoned by us, both here in Europe and in the European project, where we seal borders to stop them fleeing from Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. It is a crying shame what has gone on there and how we, in modern democracies around the world, can turn a blind eye to what the Syrians and others are doing. When we had Saddam, bad and all as he was, and Gaddafi and other leaders, at least all denominations were allowed freedom of religion and to practice with impunity. Since this dastardly bombardment took place, the Christians are being persecuted, as are minority Muslim sects, Kurds and others. It is genocide. There is no other word for it. We cannot get any discussion at European level. We tried so hard. It was never raised here in this Parliament, only thanks to the Ceann Comhairle, who gave us the Topical debate last year. Many of us had met the Holy Father, and I welcome the fact that he is coming to Ireland in August. The Holy Father asked us at an international conference - he nearly implored the international delegation of parliamentarians - to go back to our parliaments and raise these issues of the persecution of Christians and minority Muslims and other sects. Was there any debate on it here? Not at all, that might upset our friends in Europe. That might upset Macron, our German friends and everybody else. We all go with the flow here. Where is our sovereignty? Where is our neutrality? Where is our respect for nations all over the world to have their own vision, to have their own autonomy and to be free of outside interference? We just turn a blind eye to that. We are in the European project and it is greater than anything else and we must abandon them. It is time that we paid some heed to the obliteration and genocide being carried out against Christians and minority Muslims in the Middle East and raise that in Europe as well. It might not be a free-flowing discussion for Leo the lion. As I said, he would be Leo an lamb óg ar Dhomhnach Cásca.</p>

        <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_264">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T15:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_533">Politics sometimes boils down to yes-no questions and how one would vote on something. We are not voting on this issue of the expelling of Russian diplomats but, in effect, by setting out one's position, one has to answer in a sense here a yes-no question as to whether we support a particular measure or not. Sometimes one would seek a preferendum where one could have a variety of options but sometimes one cannot afford answering the yes-no question and that is not a bad thing. It brings one to clarity, maybe, on a particular issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_534"> I listened with interest to the comments of Members here and through the past two days in the wider public debate about this issue of the potential expulsion of Russian diplomats and much of what is said strikes home to me as true. First, all sorts of espionage goes on in our world at present and the question is how can one pick out one particular instance or find one particular example of it and take that as one's test case. Particularly in our country one of the biggest issues is that we are constantly under surveillance in all our electronic communications in that all digital material leaving this island via fibre-optic cables is spliced into and is accessed by GCHQ which has the ability to read and see what we are communicating. That is an issue that we, as a country, have never fought strongly enough against and raised the alarm about.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> There are many examples of international incidents. Deputy Clare Daly cited numerous examples one could pick but there is a range of developments in the world today that we should possibly be looking to raise diplomatic concern about. For me, personally, one of the most significant developments has been the development of drone warfare, the development of unmanned far-distant use of military weapons to assassinate people, effectively, outside of any legal order. One could look at others. Commentators are rightly concerned about the issue of cybercrime and the influence of the Internet on our own democratic security, as much as anything else, with the Cambridge Analytica revelations last week. One of the worst such cases was the deployment of Stuxnet malware in a power station by western agencies. There are numerous examples one could pick. Indeed, if one was looking at the Russian examples, we could look at what has been happening in Syria in recent years in terms of the bombing of civilian areas as a clear breach of proper international order. All those arguments make sense in terms of us not living in a fair and right world and there are so many matters on which we must take a particular stand.</p>
          <p eId="para_536"> I am considering my own view on this issue and what the specific approach of the Government should be. I am drawn to what my colleagues in the European Green movement across Europe have been saying. Green MEP Ms Rebecca Harms, the co-chair of the European Green Party, has come out clearly in saying that we are shocked by the offensive use of the military grade nerve agents in this case, that it appears - if it proves otherwise then we will revise - clear it is a nerve agent that has been developed by Russia and that such nerve agents have not been used for over 70 years on European soil and we cannot ignore that fact. As a party, we come rooted in anti-materialisation, CND, anti-nuclear armament and anti-chemical weapons development. There is a convention and a protocol of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and we would support the fact that organisation has being called to carry out an investigation into the attack. We stand up against the use of nerve agents and chemical weapons. That is not in breach of our neutrality. Taking out the international politics of it, are we or are we not concerned about the development and deployment of such weapons? I, for one, am.</p>
          <p eId="para_537"> I also note the concern raised by my colleague, Dr. Caroline Lucas, MP, the co-leader of the English and Welsh Green Party. I understand Dr. Lucas accepts the expulsion of diplomats from the UK. Indeed, she is calling for us to go further, looking for the seizure of some property assets held in London - there are considerable oligarchical profits being funnelled into London - as a signal that that whole system in place at present in the Russian Administration must be confronted. It is that we should not just sit back and accept. Indeed, other colleagues, including Ms Rebecca Harms, MEP, are calling for a boycott of the World Cup as one of the signals and others are calling for us to start addressing our use of Russian oil and gas as the most effective means.</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> Personally, I have good relations with staff in the Russian embassy. We met the officials there and they have come to events we have held. It is no disrespect to the Russian people. Earlier I was having a good cut at the American Administration and what President Trump stands for and it would not be right for us to confront that form of economic nationalism and not also confront the economic nationalism at play in the Russian Administration.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> I do not trust Boris Johnson, who received £150,000 to play tennis with some Russian oligarch. His evidence would not convince me to make my decision. My decision is based on how it seems that this is a case where nerve agents were deployed and that represents a historic step in the wrong direction. Based on the idea that we support international co-operation rather than economic nationalism and oppose those types of tactics by any country, my personal conclusion is that, on balance, we are better off supporting it and sending a signal. No one is saying that we have uncovered some great area of espionage. As Deputy Boyd Barrett said earlier, all sorts of espionage goes on, but this decision can be based simply on Ireland standing up as a country against the deployment of nerve agents. Even if the case is not proved to the nth degree, the urgency and the size of the issue means that we should be willing to take a stand along with 15 other European countries in order to say that there is a line we will not cross. We will not tolerate the use of such nerve agents in any circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_540"> That should spill over to our wider approach in respect of the European Council. This is something I put to the Taoiseach earlier. One cannot take a position against economic nationalism and in favour of international co-operation and simultaneously align oneself with Donald Trump, which is something the Taoiseach did explicitly. He said that Ireland is lining up with the US in terms of low corporate tax and with Donald Trump's approach to tax. We are making a historic mistake at the Council by being seen as one of the states trying to block attempts by the European Union to put a stop to €1 trillion - according to figures arrived at by my colleagues in the European Parliament who have undertaken much analysis in this area - being lost as a result of corporate tax avoidance measures. The consistent position of this Government is that Ireland is on the side of corporate tax breaks and it is being seen as not trying to address this critical and urgent issue. That does real damage to this country and places it in the wrong position. The world is changing from the idea whereby trade is everything, free trade rules, there is free capital movement, the market knows best, the greed-is-good approach of the movie character Gordon Gekko, wear the braces, do whatever trade deals we can and play the system and get as much as we can out of it. That is a form of economic nationalism from which we could move on because it is not in tune with the direction in which the global economy needs to go, namely, an environment where global co-operation takes place.</p>
          <p eId="para_541"> At the same time that we have expelled a Russian diplomat, we should do as I have outlined in order to send a signal about our concerns about the use of Novichok. It would be the same if it applied anywhere. This is an issue which is global in import. If we start allowing the use of such agents to become commonplace, we will step into a future which is too scary to contemplate. On that basis alone, we should, as a country, stand against the deployment of such weapons and material. We should back that up by giving a better example in how we co-operate internationally by not always siding with corporate tax breaks or by lining up with Donald Trump, as the Taoiseach has done, and congratulating him on adopting the same policies as Ireland and then trying to defend those policies at the European Council. We should also change that as we take a stand against Russia.</p>

          <p eId="para_547">There has been much discussion, both yesterday and today, about this European Council meeting. All the issues have been raised. I want to put place on record my position on the backstop. I am concerned that the formulation of a legal text in the context of the protocol seems to have been put back until October at the latest. I hope we can make substantial progress on it by the June summit and it is important that we do so. The tricky issues are always left to the very end. There is a danger, if it is left to the very end, that compromises will be brought forward at late-night meetings in smoke-filled rooms - although perhaps they are not smoke-filled any longer - and that, in the midst of the wheeling and dealing, the outcome on the Irish question might not be as favourable as we would wish.</p>
          <p eId="para_548"> The digital tax was a big matter at the European Council meeting. It threatens our corporate tax base and ability to attract foreign direct investment. I ask that it be dealt with at a global level, through the OECD, and that it would not undermine EU competitiveness in any way.</p>
          <p eId="para_549"> Article 7 has been invoked in respect of Poland. Article 2 of the establishing treaty of the European Union outlines European values regarding human rights, democracy, freedom of speech and so forth, as well as the independence of the judiciary. It seems that the independence of the judiciary in Poland is under threat. I appreciate the separation of powers but it is reasonable to refer to the decision by a High Court judge to refuse an extradition request from Poland pending a review by the European Court of Justice. That is a major case to be dealt with. It does not come within the remit of parliamentarians here; it is a legal matter that was raised by Ms Justice Aileen Donnelly and it must be put in the context of the invocation of Article 7. Can the Minister of State indicate if there is concern about the situation in Poland, the rise of illiberal tendencies in some EU states and how that might threaten the future of the EU?</p>

          <p eId="para_552">There are only two questions and we have a while so we will give plenty of time to the Minister of State to reply.</p>
          <p eId="para_553"> I want to press the Minister of State on the question of the nerve agent and the evidence on which the decision to expel a Russian diplomat was based. It was done on the word of British intelligence services, or perhaps it was that of the British Government alone, and then European leaders. There have been many references to the nerve agent. We all abhor the use of such agents. They are horrendous and the people responsible for their use should be brought to justice and prosecuted to the nth degree. However, what has not become clear - and I am asking the Minister of State if she can clarify the position in this regard - is the actual evidence that has been provided. I attended the Tánaiste's briefing yesterday. He said, frankly, that there is no smoking gun. He actually used the phrase, "There is no smoking gun". That worries me because two and two have been added together and we have got five. We are being told that a nerve agent was used - and we all agree that is unacceptable - and we think it was used by Russia. However, there is no evidence directly connecting Russia to what happened. Can the Minister of State shine any light on this? "Most plausible" or "highly likely" are not thresholds for making decisions that are really very serious for us. Can the Minister of State respond on that point?</p>
          <p eId="para_554"> The other explanation was that it was the only plausible explanation. There are, however, other plausible explanations. This material was produced from the 1970s, often in states that are now not under Russian control. We know that it is very likely that in some areas which broke away from the Soviet Union, central government lost control over materials like that. I am not saying that the Russians did not do it, but to say there is no alternative plausible explanation in the absence of a smoking gun does not add up.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">On the issue of double standards, specifically in respect of Palestine, if our line as an ethical foreign policy is that we are not going to put up with states that engage in behaviour which we consider to be beyond the Pale and that we are going to expel people, will that extend to what Israel is doing in flouting international law in its treatment of the Palestinians? Even when the United Nations is saying and producing reports in the past few weeks to the effect that Israel is doing things that are absolutely in direct violation of UN resolutions and international law, there are no expulsions or talk of sanctions. There is nothing. Is that going to change? Can we at least have some consistency in our foreign policy stances?</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Deputy Helen McEntee)<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_556">I thank all the Deputies for their questions and also for their patience in the Chamber for the afternoon. I will provide further details about some of the external relations issues that were discussed at the European Council in Brussels last week, particularly in respect of Russia and Turkey, and then I will address the questions that have been asked.</p>
          <p eId="para_557"> The Taoiseach has noted that discussions on Russia took up most of the time over dinner. In that regard, I should highlight the unqualified solidarity which EU leaders expressed for the UK. As the conclusions rightly state, the nerve agent attack in Salisbury on 4 March was a very grave challenge to our shared security. Any use of toxic chemicals as a weapon is a security threat to us all. The expulsion of Russian diplomats from several member states is a strong testament to the solidarity across the European Union on this issue. It is also a clear reminder to small countries such as Ireland of the value of EU membership. </p>
          <p eId="para_558"> Once again Ireland utterly condemns this reckless attack. The Taoiseach fully supported the strengthening of the European Council conclusions to explicitly agree with the UK's assessment that Russia was very likely to have been responsible for this heinous crime and that there is no alternative plausible explanation. As the Taoiseach has noted, the Tánaiste has announced that, following an assessment by security services and relevant Departments of the activities of the Russian Embassy, one member of staff with diplomatic status will be ordered to leave the country. Ireland has been very consistent in calling for Russia and the EU to have a constructive and predictable relationship however there is now a very clear onus on Russia to address all questions related to the attack in Salisbury, including providing full and complete disclosure of the Novichok programme to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, OPCW.</p>
          <p eId="para_559"> The European Council also discussed issues relating to Turkey and specifically to its actions in the eastern Mediterranean and Aegean Sea. There was no opposition to the high-level EU-Turkey summit going ahead in Varna on 26 March, although the European Council strongly condemned Turkey's illegal action in the region. These relate to military exercises in Cyprus's exclusive economic zone which have blocked legitimate natural resources exploration and to the continued detention of two Greek soldiers who accidentally crossed into Turkish territory in adverse weather conditions. Ireland recognises that Turkey's relationship with the EU remains under strain. We support continued dialogue with a view to resolving our differences amicably but there is an obligation under respected international law on good neighbourly reactions and it is therefore appropriate that the European Council should remain seized of these matters. While Ireland recognises Turkey's concerns in the wake of the attempted coup in 2016, we have voiced our own concerns about negative developments in respect of human rights, freedom of expression, democracy and the rule of law, and will continue to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_560"> I note that the European Council also discussed the EU-western Balkans summit which the Taoiseach plans to attend in Sofia on 17 May. We support the European perspective on the western Balkans region as is very clear from our support for the EU strategy for the region which was published just last month. It outlines a framework for those aspiring to join the Union in the foreseeable future. This is a priority for the Bulgarian presidency and we will be working very closely with it to ensure the meeting in May is a success. </p>
          <p eId="para_561"> As I mentioned last week, I had the opportunity to visit the region in January to meet with my counterparts, colleagues, members of parliament and the Irish community in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro. I have encouraged them to seize the momentum provided by renewed focus on the western Balkans and have assured them of Ireland's support as they carry out the reforms necessary to meet the high standards expected by the European Union. President Tusk is also expected to use the occasion of the summit to hold a meeting under the Leader's Agenda format. </p>
          <p eId="para_562"> I thank all Deputies for their statements and assure them that the Taoiseach will continue to report to the House in advance of and following meetings of the European Council. I will now speak on some of the specific issues which were raised. First, the social issue was raised during one of the events on the first day, last Thursday. The social fairness package which was launched by the Commission on 13 March sets out a number of different proposals. One deals with social protection for workers and self-employed workers which would ensure sufficient social protection coverage. Another proposal, which Deputy Howlin mentioned, was the European labour authority which would support member states in matters relating to cross-border labour mobility. This would include free movement of workers, posting of workers and the co-ordination of social security systems. A third proposal is a proposed initiative regarding a European social security number. This particular proposal has been delayed until a future date. The package also included a communication on monitoring the implementation of the European pillar of social rights. </p>
          <p eId="para_563"> Following on from the Council meeting last week, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation are looking at these issues before arriving at any detailed national position. I know that Deputy Howlin also raised the issue of the labour authority. We are studying the Commission's proposal on this issue. We have some concerns, as do other member states, as we want to ensure that any kind of new authority does not duplicate or replicate existing structures and will actually make a genuine difference to workers' welfare within the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_564"> A question was asked on the enlargement process and the western Balkans. I would restate that we agree with the Commission's paper and proposal and the fact that it includes a proposal for all six possible new member states and sets out timelines. I hope to attend the summit with the Taoiseach in September. Today, we have heard from our Croatian colleagues that when they host the Presidency in 2020, they hope to host a second summit, which we will support, in order to keep this issue very firmly on the agenda and to work with our possible new colleagues and member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_565"> On digital tax, there were a number of questions as to why there were no conclusions on this issue. There were never meant to be any conclusions on this specifically. It was always to be an informal discussion. While it was a part of the main body of the meeting on Thursday, it was purely because there had not been any update on the US position, which was due to be discussed at that time. Obviously the issue of digital tax and tax in general is something on which we have been very strong and very clear. We very much believe that the reason Ireland is seen as a good place for business is our transparent and reliable tax system. Indeed Ireland has implemented quite a number of the OECD report recommendations on base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, and we have been held as one of the most transparent countries in this regard for some time now. Of course, when it comes to digital tax we agree with the Deputy and believe this needs to be dealt with on a global basis. Companies, corporations and digital companies need to pay their fair share of tax, but it needs to be paid where value is created, not necessarily where transactions take place. Therefore we believe this needs to be dealt with through the OECD process. We had the support of many member states throughout the discussion in which the Taoiseach took part last week. </p>
          <p eId="para_566"> With regard to the backstop position, intensive negotiations have started again this week which are specifically looking at the Irish backstop position. We welcomed the fact that last week Donald Tusk, after the European Council meeting, reiterated and stressed that we needed to see sufficient progress on the Irish protocol by June. We believe that we need to see that sufficient progress in order for us to be able to complete this by October. As we have said many times, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. We have that support and commitment from all 27 member states when it comes to the Irish issue and, indeed, other issues within the withdrawal agreement which have not been finalised or concluded yet.</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> On the concerns in respect of Article 7 of the Treaty on the European Union, particularly in respect of Poland, while this issue was not addressed at the European Council meeting it was raised at the meeting of the General Affairs Council which I attended. As the Deputy has said, the Article 7 process has been implemented. The Polish Government published its response on Tuesday, the day of the meeting of the General Affairs Council, so we did not have full time to respond to it. It had to be translated. Ireland's position is that we have welcomed the re-engagement of the Polish Government with the Commission since Christmas. We feel that the best way to resolve these issues is through negotiations, dialogue and engagement. Of course, we hold the very firm position that we now need to start seeing actions on this issue because any member state that in any way contravenes our key values, including the rule of law, needs to be held accountable. Obviously we are encouraging further engagement and dialogue and the fact that Poland has published its response is very welcome. </p>
          <p eId="para_568"> Specifically with regard to Russia, we are talking about the first time a chemical attack of this kind has happened on European soil since the Second World War. I was not in the room when Theresa May outlined why the UK believes Russia was specifically responsible for this attack. The Taoiseach was, as were other member states including some of the larger states, such as France and Germany, which would have significant intelligence in these areas. It was the view of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, following recommendations, that we would act in solidarity with the UK. If this had happened on Irish soil, would we be standing back and asking member states to support us and work with us or would we be saying that we would go it alone and that we would be able to deal with it ourselves? I do not think we would do the latter. The unity of the European Union in this regard is absolutely paramount.</p>

            <p eId="para_570">I really must raise this issue again. First, I pay tribute to a very sad victim who fell into the river, or was located in the river, in Carrick-on-Suir under the district of Clonmel superintendent Willie Leahy and his sergeant and staff in Carrick-on-Suir. I pay tribute to the public, the Civil Defence and everyone else involved. Carrick-on-Suir River Rescue carried out a huge search for nine days and located her body. The funeral of this little 14 year old from Carrick-on-Suir was today. I salute the Garda Síochána for co-ordinating the whole event, tragic as it was. Thankfully, her remains have been located. The funeral was very sad.</p>
            <p eId="para_571"> I salute the local Garda because they do tremendous work daily under Superintendent Leahy, the sergeant in charge and all the other gardaí. However, the Minister for Justice and Equality has seen the conditions in the station. I hope we will hear good news from him today.</p>
            <p eId="para_572"> In 2012, the then Minister, Alan Shatter, and the then Minister of State, Tom Hayes, announced that there would be a new station and that it was moving to a new site. The old Army barracks was a proud system of defence and served the people in Tipperary so it will be a wonderful location for a new station. The then Minister and Minister of State announced the project at the time and, unfortunately, Mr. Hayes said the funding would be provided in the following round. That was in 2012 under the capital funding project. Nonetheless, we did not see the station open.</p>
            <p eId="para_573"> Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran is now the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW. There is a bundle of stations in Sligo, one in Cork and one elsewhere. There are some technical delays on land issues and disputes over rights of way and so on. However, the people of Clonmel and the Garda Síochána deserve better. Tipp FM recently went into the site and was shocked, as is anyone who visits it. It is a Dickensian building, hundreds of years old, and is on lease from the county council, which incidentally wants the building back. To make matters worse, it is a listed building. I acknowledge the Minister for Justice and Equality has provided upgrades to some of the toilet facilities and some of the cells in recent times and rented another building down the town as well. He had to do so because there is neither the space nor the equipment in the site and it is higgledy-piggledy upstairs and downstairs. It is not in any way suitable for the public or An Garda Síochána. The space in the public office is not as big as the three seats beside me. If a woman with a buggy or a family comes in, they must come in and sign on, get passports stamped, get driving licences or whatever else alongside them. There is no privacy for people to do their business. If there are people there who are out on bail on serious crimes, they could be in the same restricted area. It is unfair and unfit and it has gone on for too long.</p>
            <p eId="para_574"> I do not want any more announcements from the Minister. I do not expect him to make any, in fairness. I want to see the contract signed and the sod turned in order that the Garda can move into the building. Tús maith, leath na hoibre. Let the building proceed. I know it will take some time from the time the builder is appointed and the procurement process is all gone through to the work starting, but we want to see the work start and the contract signed. No one is more anxious about this than me. I have not made announcements about it but I have been on to the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran, and before him the then Minister of State, Deputy Canney, about the matter. We must get this for the public and the Garda Síochána in Tipperary. I salute them and the morale they have maintained as they are expected to go in and work in these conditions. No one, whether us here, factory workers or workers from any other institution, would work in such conditions because they could not. It is totally unsuitable from an IT, personnel and fire safety point of view. They must stand up on a toilet bowl to get out of the window at one of the fire escapes. It is beyond talking about. It is time we moved on and got this modern building to serve modern times to allow all ranks of the Garda Síochána to give the service they want to give to the people of Clonmel and Tipperary.</p>

            <p eId="para_575">I offer my condolences and the condolences of the Government to the family of Elisha Gault, whose body was found in Carrick-on-Suir. I offer my sympathy to her parents, Cameron and Gráinne, and to her extended family and I pay tribute to the Garda Síochána, the Coast Guard and the hundreds of volunteers in the south Tipperary area who engaged in the search. It was a dreadful tragedy for the family and the community.</p>
            <p eId="para_576"> I thank Deputy Mattie McGrath for raising this important issue. As he will be aware, the programme of replacement and refurbishment of Garda accommodation is progressed by the Garda authorities working in close co-operation with the Office of Public Works. Deputy McGrath will also be aware of the significant efforts being made by the Government to enhance the working environment for members of An Garda Síochána and of the major investment that has been committed under the Capital Plan 2016-2021 to upgrade Garda premises. The Garda building and refurbishment programme, an ambitious five-year programme based on agreed Garda priorities, continues to benefit over 30 locations around the country. The programme includes over €60 million of Exchequer funding as well as a major public private partnership to deliver stations in Macroom and Sligo and, from Deputy Mattie McGrath's perspective, more importantly, at Clonmel.</p>
            <p eId="para_577"> Two site transfers are involved in the Clonmel development. It is proposed the new Clonmel development will be built on part of the former Kickham Barracks site, which has been acquired by Tipperary County Council, and arrangements to transfer the appropriate ownership to the Office of Public Works are well in train. In addition, the OPW owns a building immediately adjacent to the entrance and a portion of that site needs to be transferred to the county council in order to facilitate the overall development of the site. An important element of the plan involves the widening of the existing main entrance to the barracks site. The OPW has actively engaged with the council and a revised entrance arrangement solution has been identified. In addition, the council has demolished an existing site hut in order to bring clarity to the site boundary. I was pleased to visit the area before Christmas. The Office of Public Works is engaging with the council in order to complete the necessary legal documentation regarding the two site transfers involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_578"> I understand that acquisition by the OPW of the site for Macroom is complete and that acquisition of sites for Clonmel and Sligo is well advanced. Once completed, the development of the public private partnership bundle will be progressed actively under the auspices of the National Development Finance Agency. Pending development of the new station in Clonmel, a project to upgrade the cells and custody facilities in the existing Garda station is well advanced. This comprises the refurbishment of four cells to modern standards and the installation of a prisoner shower facility. Arrangements to source alternative accommodation for locker facilities during the construction are being finalised by the Office of Public Works.</p>
            <p eId="para_579"> I do not disagree with anything Deputy McGrath has said about the conditions in Clonmel Garda station. I am really anxious that this matter be advanced and progressed at the earliest opportunity. I assure the Deputy that I am fully committed to proceeding with the major investment programme that aims to provide new Garda stations and to modernise older Garda stations at key locations around the country, including Clonmel, in order that we can ensure a safe, modern working environment for Garda as well as fit-for-purpose facilities for visitors, victims, suspects and those engaged in the daily business at a Garda station.</p>

            <p eId="para_580">I thank the Minister for extending sympathy on behalf of the Government to the family of Elisha Gault and saluting all of the emergency people, volunteers and co-ordinators under Superintendent Willie Leahy and Kevin Langton, a good Laois-Offaly man, who is the principal of the secondary school she attended, Comeragh College in Carrick-on-Suir.</p>
            <p eId="para_581"> We know where I am coming from. I am speaking about the conditions and I am glad the Minister accepts it. They are Third World conditions which are not suitable. I worry when I hear about the OPW and the procurement of two bits of sites and widening the entrance. I know how planning permission happens. This has to be done. I accept completely the Minister's bona fides but I want to see procurement of the bundle of the three stations in Sligo, Macroom and Clonmel finalised. It would be a pity for one to hold up the others for so long. If this is the case perhaps we can change bundles. It is so near now and yet so far. For the morale of the force and the public in Tipperary they must see activity on the site. The new site, which was the old Kickham Barracks, is a model site in pristine condition with a huge tradition of service to the public not only in Tipperary but the United Nations and everywhere, at times of flood or emergency. That is gone. It would be nice to see the lights on and a new functioning Garda station. I would go so far as to say, because it is a spacious site, that the Minister should consider locating the horse element of An Garda Síochána there. We have plenty of mountains to train them in the foothills of the Comeraghs and Slievenamon. I am happy with the Minister's reply but I will be coming back to this week in week out because I want to see the documents signed and the preferred contractor for the bundle appointed, and let the work begin. Let An Garda Síochána in Clonmel and Tipperary be in a half respectable position for themselves and their own health, well-being and safety to deliver the top-class service they always do for the people of Tipperary.</p>

            <p eId="para_582">I thank Deputy McGrath for raising this issue. I bow to his superior knowledge in the matter of horse training and the equine division of the Garda Síochána, but I acknowledge the diligence, commitment and very hard work the gardaí in Clonmel and south Tipperary undertake on a 24-7 basis. I would like to see this project advancing at the earliest opportunity. As I mentioned, the preparatory works relating to the new Garda station in Clonmel are progressing well. I am anxious to ensure the OPW engages actively, importantly and urgently with the county council to complete the necessary documentation regarding the two site transfers involved. I visited the Garda station before Christmas. I understand the circumstances in the station and I understand the need for a new Garda station in Clonmel. I assure the House and Deputy McGrath in particular that in conjunction with the Office of Public Works we will do everything to advance this project at the earliest opportunity. I expect the public private partnership project will get under way this year, but I am happy to keep Deputy McGrath fully informed on the technical developments as far as the matter of the transfer of the site is concerned and with regard to the legal documentation to ensure the contract can be completed and the builders can be on site at the earliest opportunity. It is overdue and I want it done.</p>

            <p eId="para_583">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this topical issue for debate because it is extremely important. It might be beneficial for the Minister of State to engage in this debate as opposed to with his colleague.</p>
            <p eId="para_584"> I want to put on record thanks for the invaluable work the community employment schemes do the length and breadth of the country. They are very much at the heart of the community from a social, cultural and environmental perspective. They work in child care facilities, GAA grounds and other sporting facilities. They maintain tidy towns. They support the often unrecognised work of thousands of volunteers throughout the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_586">They have huge difficulty now because the pool of available participants is being squeezed by both sides. On one side there has been an increase in employment opportunities, and that is extremely welcome, but on the other side changes were made to the eligibility criteria for the scheme in April 2017. This is placing a huge burden on participants and many of the schemes. It is putting the long-term viability of many of the schemes in doubt. Just because JobBridge has been introduced and somebody has been moved off the live register and onto JobBridge does not necessarily mean the person will be able to get a job. There are people on these schemes who, for whatever reason, perhaps because of their age or an ability or disability issue, cannot go back into the workforce. What we are telling them now is they are no longer any good or qualified for participation in society. I will give an example. In recent weeks, Moate amenity and heritage park has lost five participants. The local newspaper described it as a devastating blow to the park and rural Ireland. The loss of five employees at a key tourism facility in Moate is a devastating blow according to a local community activist and member of the management committee. The workers have completed their length of service with the scheme and no extension is in sight. They have no option but to vacate their positions. An emotional participant who was interviewed stated he had been there for the past four years and had loved every minute of it. He said his dignity and pride have been taken away. I will not give his name. It is not about the money, it is about feeling part of something.</p>
            <p eId="para_587"> I understand the group met the then Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, who is now Taoiseach. He gave cast-iron guarantees that reforms were under way on eligibility for people on community employment schemes. This has simply not happened. As I said, the future viability of many of these schemes is under threat.</p>
            <p eId="para_588"> My colleague, Deputy Willie O'Dea, has produced a Bill that would tackle this issue. I understand the Minister of State is here representing his colleague the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty. Will he give a cast-iron guarantee the Government will take note and acknowledge that changes need to be brought about, and acknowledge the significant contribution that community employment schemes make the length and breadth of the country in urban and rural Ireland?</p>

            <p eId="para_589">I thank Deputy Robert Troy for raising this very important issue. In the context of the economic recovery, the Department undertook a review of its work programmes in 2016. Arising from the review, the Government agreed to implement changes to the qualifying conditions for community employment in order to broaden access to a wider range of people. These new rules were implemented from July 2017. In general, all placements will now be for one year only. If community employment participants are undertaking training to achieve a major award, their time can be extended for up to two years to allow them to complete the training which will enhance their overall employment prospects. This is a positive development. This also allows for three years' continuous participation in a community employment scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_590"> Those over 55 years of age can also remain on a community employment scheme for three years.</p>
            <p eId="para_591">A six-year participation limit will apply to community employment, or seven years in the case of a person in receipt of a disability payment. A person may re-qualify for participation on a community employment scheme after 12 months, having been in receipt of a qualifying social welfare payment, provided he or she has not reached the six-year overall lifetime limit. Participation on a CE scheme is intended to be for a temporary fixed term. These placements are not full-time sustainable jobs. Participation limits are in place to ensure that as many unemployed people as possible can benefit from the scheme. My Department's priority in supporting work programmes is to provide access to good quality work experience and training qualifications to support the progression into employment of jobseekers and other vulnerable groups. The eligibility criterion for participation on a community employment scheme is kept under ongoing review to ensure the effectiveness of the scheme in targeting long-term unemployed jobseekers and other specific disadvantaged groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_592"> As for Moate community employment scheme, significant extensions of time were previously granted to each of the five community employment workers who completed their participation in the programme with the sponsoring organisation, Moate Heritage Company, on Friday, 23 March 2018. A total of 29 places are approved under the sponsor's current CE contract. As of 22 March 2018, 27 people were employed on the scheme. In the last two weeks, one new participant commenced on this scheme in an administrative role and another commenced work in a general operative role. The Department's midlands community employment service, CES, team and case officers maintain a strong focus on the urgent recruitment needs of Moate Heritage Company and ensure that the promotion of the benefits of participation in the scheme is highlighted at all meetings with eligible customers of the Department. The midlands CES team is also in regular contact with the sponsoring organisation in order that issues with recruitment can be given immediate attention. </p>
            <p eId="para_593"> The Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, has received representations on this issue from the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, Deputies Burke and Penrose and Senator McFadden, all of whom highlighted the needs of the Moate Heritage Company. The Department's midlands CES team and case officers will continue to attend to the urgent recruitment needs of Moate Heritage Company and will maintain regular contact with this sponsor in order to provide assistance with recruitment. I thank the Deputy for raising the matter as it is important that such issues are raised. I hope this clarifies the matter. </p>

            <p eId="para_594">I regret it does not clarify the matter. I am well aware of the eligibility criteria for participation on the community employment scheme, which the Government changed a number of years ago. This change is having a devastating impact on community employment schemes. I am surprised that schemes in the Minister of State's constituency have not contacted him about the impact this change is having on their ability to attract participants to the scheme. The fact that a person might be no longer eligible to participate in a scheme does not mean he or she will find employment outside of it. As I said in my opening remarks, there are people who, because of their age and abilities, are unable to find mainstream employment. The work provided by community employment schemes is hugely rewarding for such people.</p>
            <p eId="para_595"> As I said, the change to the rules is having a devastating effect on communities. If it were not for the work undertaken by community employment schemes - social, cultural and environmental - towns and villages the length and breadth of the country would not be maintained in a pristine condition and many child care facilities would not be able to operate. The change is not working but the Government does not get it. I am delighted that my colleagues are bringing this issue to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty. I am bringing it to the attention of the Government on the floor of the House again today. Not only are the Minister and the Government not acting on these representations they are refusing to acknowledge that there is a problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_596"> My colleague will bring forward legislation this week that will ensure that there can be changes to the eligibility criteria. I hope that it will receive cross-party support. If the Government does not support it, Fianna Fáil will force it to make the changes needed to ensure the long-term viability of critical schemes like this.</p>

            <p eId="para_597">I again thank Deputy Troy for raising this important issue and will make a number of points. First, the CE scheme operated by Moate Heritage Company is not terminating. I take the Deputy's point that these schemes provide valuable work. As I said in my initial response, there are 27 people on this particular scheme and they are making a positive contribution to their area. As I said earlier, a person in receipt of a disability payment is eligible for participation on a CE scheme for seven years, which is positive. I take the Deputy's point in regard to age, particularly those aged 55 and over. While the unemployment rate has decreased to 6%, we would like it to be at 3% because at that point we could tackle a lot of these issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_598"> In terms of my portfolio in the area of disabilities, there are 5,000 people with a disability on the wage subsidy scheme, WSS, under which the Government and the employing company each pay half the salary of the person with the disability. There are other initiatives under way in this space. On the Deputy's point on the need for reform, I will bring his concerns to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty.</p>

            <from>Deputy Martin Ferris<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T17:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_602">On 29 January last, I met the management of University Hospital Kerry. I did so after being contacted by staff members from various departments in the hospital, primarily with regard to morale being low and the lack of resources. I requested the meeting following numerous complaints. I wish to put it on the record that the staff in the hospital are excellent people. They do a fantastic job, as does the management. I met the new manager and I was very impressed by him. They do a fantastic job in very difficult circumstances. They are dedicated professionals who wish to provide the best services possible, but they are unable to do so due to chronic understaffing and a lack of resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_603"> They find their work environment extremely stressful, to the extent that some agency staff are refusing shifts in the accident and emergency department due to the severe and overwhelming workload there. I am also told that several members of staff are out of work due to stress-related illnesses, with more likely to follow. At the meeting, I was given assurances that workplace conditions are being addressed. The reality, however, is that the hospital is so under-resourced and the workplace conditions are so stressful that a serious injection of resources will be required to deal with the problems.</p>
            <p eId="para_604"> In the meantime, the cardiologist, Dr. Louis Keary, has resigned. The Department says he has tendered his resignation but has not resigned. However, I am informed that he has resigned his position at University Hospital Kerry. This means the hospital will be operating with just one part-time cardiologist tending to hundreds of heart patients. Dr. Keary was working in Bon Secours Hospital in Tralee and for two days per week in University Hospital Kerry. It is totally unacceptable that a hospital with a huge catchment area, comprising parts of west Limerick, parts of west Cork and the entire county of Kerry, does not have a full-time cardiologist. That is an indictment of the system. The Minister of State will be aware that there has recently been a review of the 46,235 scans carried out by a consultant radiologist who no longer works at the hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_605"> An investigation of workplace practices is needed now more than ever. This must be dealt with. There must be an examination of the workload of consultants and staff at the hospital. We must ensure there are the facilities and resources to ensure the morale of the staff in the hospital is in a good place. That requires a proactive approach on the part of the Minister for Health and his Department to address the difficulties currently being experienced at University Hospital Kerry. I ask the Minister of State to speak with the Minister and the staff about this. It is something that can be resolved but there must be a political commitment to doing that. The people of Kerry appreciate the work done by the hospital and the staff but the Government, the Minister and the Department must step up to the plate and ensure that they get the resources they require and deserve.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Jim Daly)<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T17:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_606">I thank Deputy Ferris for raising the issue of staffing at University Hospital Kerry. I understand that the Deputy’s concerns relate, in particular, to the provision of cardiology services in the hospital, notwithstanding the wider issues he has raised. He specifically focused on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_607"> The cardiology department in University Hospital Kerry performs a variety of heart tests such as electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, stress testing, Holter and blood pressure monitoring and pacemaker checks. The current cardiology department staffing complement comprises one consultant cardiologist, one chief cardiology technician, two senior cardiology technicians, one basic grade cardiology technician and an electrocardiography, ECG, technician. From a nursing perspective, the department is supported by a cardiac rehabilitation co-ordinator and a cardiology staff nurse. Furthermore, the department is supported by a health care assistant and administration staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_608"> In terms of additional cardiology supports, the HSE has advised that over the past number of months two visiting consultants from the South/South West hospital group have commenced attending the hospital on a regular basis. One is scheduled on a weekly-fortnightly basis and the other is scheduled on a monthly basis. These two consultants run additional outpatient clinics with a view to reducing long waiting times for new patients. I understand from the HSE that these clinics are having a significant positive impact on waiting periods. The HSE has further advised that University Hospital Kerry also has links with the cardiology department at University Hospital Limerick. Consistent with the recommendations in the national acute medicine programme for model 3 hospitals such as University Hospital Kerry, patients with acute coronary syndrome are transferred to the primary coronary intervention centre in University Hospital Limerick. Cork University Hospital is the tertiary referral centre for more complex cardiology patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_609"> I am aware that there have been reports recently about the resignation of the cardiologist from University Hospital Kerry. The Minister, Deputy Harris, has been informed by the HSE that no formal resignations have been received in this regard. The HSE has further assured the Minister that if a formal resignation is received, the hospital will immediately seek to commence the process of recruiting a replacement and will seek to appoint a locum consultant cardiologist in the interim.</p>
            <p eId="para_610"> With regard to the recruitment of medical staff, in July 2013 a working group chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, president of Dublin City University, was established to carry out a strategic review of medical training and career structure. The group made 25 recommendations relating to training and career pathways for doctors with a focus on improving graduate retention in the public health system and planning for future service needs. It is significant that, overall, the number of consultants has increased by 109 in the 12 months ending December 2017 to a total of 2,971 whole-time equivalents and by 415 in the four years since December 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_611"> The Minister for Health is deeply committed to ensuring that we have the necessary resources in place at all times for the delivery of safe patient care, both at University Hospital Kerry and throughout the health services. On the recruitment of consultants in particular, the HSE has streamlined the approval process for consultant posts in our hospitals and, notwithstanding significant recruitment and retention challenges, considerable progress has been made in the past four years in growing the numbers of doctors in the public health services as additional resources have become available.</p>

            <p eId="para_612">I find it difficult to understand how the HSE can say it received no formal resignation, yet it says it has a consultant on a weekly basis and another on a monthly basis treating cardiac patients in Kerry. My information is that a part-time cardiologist comes to the hospital for one day or perhaps two days per week. That is deemed to be sufficient despite the huge waiting lists in the hospital. That is not accurate. Another consultant is on a monthly basis. The Minister of State says they "run additional outpatient clinics with a view to reducing long waiting times for new patients". Somebody is being economical with the truth here. My information is that Dr. Keary has resigned and that nobody has replaced him. Somebody is coming from Cork once or twice a week in order to try to deal with the backlog.</p>
            <p eId="para_613">It also says here that people can go to the hospitals in Limerick or Cork for treatment. We are talking here about a situation where a person with severe coronary attack has to travel by ambulance - if they are lucky enough to survive - and that journey is 65 miles one way and 80 miles another way. That is not acceptable in this day and age.</p>
            <p eId="para_614"> I will now turn to the issues regarding the accident and emergency department in the hospital in Kerry, which was raised in the House during this morning's discussion on promised legislation. People contacted my office at 3 a.m. and described that accident and emergency department as a war zone with so many people on hospital beds and so forth. At 4.45 a.m this morning, a great friend of mine passed away in a nursing home at the age of 90. Three weeks ago he had been on a trolley in the accident and emergency department in Tralee for more than 36 hours.</p>

            <p eId="para_619">I appreciate there is confusion around the current status of that situation. The HSE has informed me that no formal resignation has been received to date from the cardiologist in question in University Hospital Kerry. To avoid confusion, the purpose of the cardiologists who go there weekly, fortnightly and monthly is to deal with outpatient clinics and to reduce the waiting times, whereas the cardiologist who is permanently appointed to the hospital deals with the procedures within it.</p>
            <p eId="para_620"> Deputy Ferris spoke of people having to travel for treatment. That is just a medical decision and a clinical decision. When a patient is triaged and is deemed to require more complex coronary care, better care and more facilities are available in Cork University Hospital. This is why some people have to travel. I absolutely accept that this winter has presented difficulties and challenges to the emergency departments in hospitals and University Hospital Kerry is no exception. There was a significant increase in presentations at the hospital. I believe that 36,000 people presented at University Hospital Kerry this year. These increases are proving challenging. The increases are more than just demographic increases. There are more presentations to our emergency departments and it is quite a significant challenge. This winter has been no exception. The Government has taken a number of measures to try to alleviate this with funding. An allocation of €85 million was made, with €40 million allocated specifically for winter measures this year and an additional €11.6 million was allocated for waiting list initiatives such as opening new beds and transitional care beds. A total of 189 beds have been opened overall in the system but I appreciate there is a lot more to do. We will continue to work with, and keep the pressure on, the HSE try to alleviate those situations of which Deputy Ferris has spoken and in many hospitals across the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_633">I appreciate the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, being in the Chamber for this motion. He could be here for a couple of hours. It is unfortunate that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, could not be here tonight for this debate. I am aware that he is very busy and I understand that. The Minister is aware of this issue. I have spoken with him about it on many occasions. I feel very strongly about it and this is why the Labour Party is using its Private Members' time tonight to put forward a motion to ensure greater uptake of the human papillomavirus vaccine, HPV, in part to protect children but more to ensure the vaccine is extended to boys. It is important that this happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_634"> The HPV vaccine is currently offered to 30,000 girls in their first year in secondary schools. The uptake of the vaccine has been at 50% due to many different reasons but in particular due to unfounded concerns of some parents in recent years, much of which went on social media. I am delighted to be able to say that due to work of the HSE, it is improving. We come in to the House and we criticise each other quite a bit, but in fairness to the Minister for Health, who has just arrived to the Chamber, I compliment him on the work that was done in the last year to increase the vaccine uptake to 62%. We still have a lot of work to do but this figure is very positive. There are, however, more than 11,000 girls who remain exposed to HPV infection and are at risk of HPV-related cancers and diseases in later life. Consequently, approximately 30,000 boys each year are also at risk due not being offered HPV vaccination.</p>
          <p eId="para_635"> There is a significant public health risk associated with not vaccinating both boys and girls against HPV. We need to get to an immunity level of over 80%. We have brought the motion forward because we believe it is a critical issue from a public health perspective and it needs to be progressed. As of March 2018, globally there are 84 government-funded HPV immunisation programmes, 18 of which are now universally vaccinating both boys and girls against HPV. Countries such as Canada, Slovenia, the United States, New Zealand, Australia and Italy are vaccinating boys and girls. Vaccination of boys and girls improves the effectiveness of national vaccination programmes and promotes greater health equality in the prevention of HPV-related diseases. Given the critical role that males play in the transmission of HPV infection, an effective way to achieve the greatest protection against cancer and other HPV-related diseases is to vaccinate adolescent males as well as females.</p>
          <p eId="para_636"> Programmes vaccinating boys and girls have been modelled to be more resilient than gender-specific HPV vaccination programmes, which enables the programmes to protect against a loss of effectiveness resulting from temporary coverage reduction. In the case of a drop-off in vaccination take-up it would be mitigated somewhat were both sexes vaccinated.</p>
          <p eId="para_637"> I draw the Minister's attention to the real issue - about which we have spoken at length - concerning his request to the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, to conduct a health technology assessment, HTA, to extend the HPV vaccine to boys in the current programme. I hope the Minister agrees that this decision needs to happen pretty soon. The current timeframe for the decision means it would not be possible to start vaccinations until September 2019. Nationally, this would leave approximately 30,000 young boys without a HPV vaccination in the 2018-19 academic year. I am aware that HIQA is under pressure with regard to resources but I implore the Minister to use whatever influence he has to ask HIQA to bring forward the HTA as soon as possible. There is a lead time. The Minister and I are aware of this and anybody who follows this is aware of it. The lead time needs to be taken into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_638"> When it first commenced in 2010, the administration cost of delivering the HPV vaccination programme in Ireland was €3,785,000. This cost covered two cohorts - a single cohort in first year and a second catch-up cohort in the sixth year of secondary school. The uptake by young girls in the early years of the programme was extremely positive; we reached almost 82% in one year. Due to campaigns that were launched and targeted with misleading information about the vaccine, these take-up figures have dropped off.</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> Extending the HPV vaccination programme to boys would require an additional vaccinator visit to boys' schools. This visit could be done in conjunction with the programme that is already in place. This would create economies and ensure the programme is cost-effective. If we can get more than 85% of boys and girls taking up the vaccine then the programme would be more than cost-effective. In the long run, it would actually save money. The vaccine will save money once we can get the take up to a certain level.</p>
          <p eId="para_640"> If the Acting Chairman agrees, I would like to share five minutes of my time with Deputy Joan Burton.</p>

It is irresponsible and the targeting of certain schools is not justifiable or fair because, in response, we have seen a difference in the take-up of the vaccine in disadvantaged schools. The HPV vaccine is completely safe and is endorsed by the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, the Irish Pharmacy Union, the Irish Cancer Society and by major medical and scientific bodies worldwide, including the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA, the EU-funded European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics.

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_644">As a Consultant Gynaecologist I see all too frequently the impact of HPV infections and the reality of cervical cancer. The evidence for the vaccine is compelling. We have a very real possibility now of eliminating cervical cancer in future generations of Irish women. But to achieve that we need to maintain our momentum in addressing our uptake rates and continue to restore them to where they were [a number of] years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">We also need to extend it to boys. The universal HPV vaccine will have a dramatic impact on HPV and related cancers in men. HPV causes multiple diseases in males such as genital warts and certain cancers like anal cancer and skin cancers. The vaccination of boys in addition to girls will reduce the HPV-related disease burden in males and would allow a reduction in HPV-related cancer cases in females, compared with vaccinating females only. HPV transmission is higher from women to men than from men to women, suggesting a need for prevention interventions such as vaccination for men. Antibody response to natural HPV infection is lower in men compared with women and there appear to be differences between men and women in the efficacy of this response to protect against future infections.</p>
          <p eId="para_646"> Screening methods for cancers caused by HPV in men are currently not routinely available. The inclusion of boys in a national HPV immunisation programme is likely to reduce the impact of temporary changes in vaccine uptake. Though there might be an increasing HPV vaccine uptake nationally, there are regional variations, which mean that men are particularly vulnerable in areas where female vaccination rates against HPV are low. Mapping vaccinations show these regional differences and if one considers the evidence alongside the misinformation that is being spread across the country, one can see a correlation that is quite disturbing.</p>
          <p eId="para_647"> I have looked at the success of immunisation programmes in other states. Australia introduced its national HPV vaccination programme in 2007 and recent research suggests it will eliminate HPV-related cervical cancers in the future. Over 9 million doses of the vaccine have been given to girls and young women in Australia. There has been a 92% reduction in the HPV types that are responsible for almost 75% of cervical cancers. There has been an almost 50% reduction in the frequency of high-grade cervical abnormalities in girls in the state of Victoria aged between 18 and 21.</p>
          <p eId="para_648"> In Scotland, researchers have found a 90% fall in levels of the human papilloma virus in women since the vaccine was made available. In Sweden, a nationwide register-based study included the entire Swedish population of girls and young women aged between 13 and 29 and showed that the vaccination was effective against high-grade cervical lesions in real-life settings. It has a dramatic impact in the prevention of cancer.</p>
          <p eId="para_649"> We should all support this and be very positive about it, as it can prevent cancer in future generations of girls and boys. We need to improve the rate at which vaccinations are given to girls and we need to extend it to boys in the coming months. Almost every sexually active man and woman in Ireland will get HPV in their lifetime. For many people, HPV clears up on its own but for others it can cause certain cancers and disease like cervical cancer. Ireland has one of the highest rates of cervical cancer in western Europe, and that is the key message we need to take home from this. An estimated 420 cancers were caused by HPV in Ireland each year in the period between 2010 and 2015 and an average of 178 men and women die from HPV-related cancers in Ireland every year.</p>
          <p eId="para_650"> Currently, 18 countries globally, including large countries, provide successful universal vaccination programmes. They are supported and promoted by national organisations and world regulatory bodies. In Ireland, the National Immunisation Advisory Committee, NIAC, recommends that HPV vaccines be given to males as soon as possible. The vaccination of boys is particularly important in the context of herd immunisation, given that the disease can be transferred from male to male, and it will protect gay men into the future. The National Sexual Health Strategy 2015-2020 calls for an extension of the HPV vaccine and the National Cancer Strategy 2016-2025 states that the vaccine should also be available for men between the ages of 16 and 26. It expresses the belief that international evidence supports its roll-out and that it should be done as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_651"> We brought forward this motion to raise the level of awareness of the need for the vaccine to be taken up by more girls in order that we can get back to where we were a number of years ago, at over 80%, and thus to ensure young women and young men are protected into the future. We need to push on with putting the vaccine in place for boys as soon as possible as this can reduce the volume of different cancers that are becoming prevalent in the absence of bringing this in thus far. I implore the Minister to ensure that the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, brings in its assessment on the vaccine as soon as possible because the timeframe is critical. If it does not bring it in until September 2019, as is currently projected, some 30,000 boys will not get the protection, which will ensure men and women will end up with cancers that could easily have been prevented.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Burton<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_652">Approximately 20 years ago, my very beautiful, lovely, happy, first cousin Marie became ill with cancer of the cervix. After what seemed like a very short period, that is, a couple of years, and an awful lot of suffering which she bore very bravely, she died and left her three boys behind to be reared by their father on his own. This is a very common story of what happens to women, particularly women who are younger or in the middle stages of life when their children are still dependants, a time which in many families is probably the best for a couple and their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">As we know, families cope and no matter how awful the situation is, they carry on for the children. It is very hard to lose one's partner, wife or mother to such a killer disease. Although treatment has progressed, as any cancer specialist will tell us, it is still a very difficult disease that no parent would wish their child to be at risk of developing. In all the debate, it may not have really got through just how difficult this cancer can be and how devastating it is for a family to lose usually a mother as a result of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_654"> I did not know much about cervical cancer until my cousin lost her life to it. My aunt Kay, Marie's mother, knew even less and, to be honest, we were all bewildered, particularly her children and her husband. Some 20 years later, we do know much more and we know that it is possible to be vaccinated against this potentially killer disease. While the cure rates and treatment have improved and the hospice service in Ireland has improved, it is far better if we can vaccinate people so that the risk of getting this killer disease is very significantly reduced if not completely wiped out. The vaccine is highly effective, as Deputy Kelly said. If it is made available to boys, this will reduce the infection rate and the death rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_655"> This is not a party political issue of any kind. We are putting this motion forward because I suspect that many of us in this Chamber know at first hand - whether it is a relative, a friend or a neighbour - women who have lost their lives to this very difficult disease. I know that parents worry about their teenage children, particularly nowadays in the context of social media information. The evidence is compelling that using the vaccine will enable the public health system in Ireland, possibly, over a period of time, to almost totally eliminate this killer disease. We know this because it has happened in other countries. To parents who will be thinking about this coming up to a new school year in the autumn, I ask them to please think of all the Maries in Ireland who lost their lives to this killer disease, and to think that 20 years from now, they will want their current teenager to be protected against it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SimonHarris" as="#Minister_for_Health" eId="spk_301">
          <from>Minister for Health (Deputy Simon Harris)<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_656">I thank Deputy Alan Kelly for putting down this very important motion. I genuinely believe it is one of the most important Private Members' motions we have had in this House in long years. As Deputy Burton eloquently said, it is not a party political pop or a motion to score points. It is providing the House with an opportunity to unite and send out a very important, powerful message that all of the people's representatives stand behind our doctors and our immunisation programme, and stand behind debunking the myths. I really hope all Deputies on all sides of this House will unanimously support the Labour Party's motion. The most important line in the motion is the one calling on Dáil Éireann to support unanimously the campaign to encourage parents to avail of the HPV vaccine for their children in their first year of secondary school. I certainly hope there is no Member of this House who would have any difficulty with supporting that call. It is also a very important motion in the sense that it gives me an opportunity to update the House on where we are currently and where we would like to be in the future in respect of boys as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_657"> I thank Deputy Burton for sharing her own family story in respect of her late cousin, Marie. That makes it very real. This is a very real and painful situation that has been experienced by so many families, and we have a way of preventing it. It is so important that we all do everything we possibly can in this regard. I think we all know that immunisation is regarded as one of the safest and, indeed, most cost effective of all health care interventions. It is also one of the most effective ways a parent can protect the health of their child. The childhood immunisation programmes in Ireland have had a huge impact in improving the health of Irish people. Diseases that used to be common in this country and around the world such as polio, measles, diphtheria, whooping cough and many other serious infectious diseases are now preventable thanks to vaccination. I am proud to note that the uptake rates for many vaccines included in the childhood immunisation programmes are close to the WHO recommended uptake target of 95%. However, we must continue to work so that uptake rates for all childhood vaccines do not just meet but exceed the WHO target.</p>
          <p eId="para_658"> It is important that we remember why this issue is so important. Worldwide, cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women and HPV immunisation is an important part of our childhood immunisation programmes, which protects women from developing cancer later in their lives. Cervical cancer impacts the lives of a large number of women in Ireland every year. It is the second most common cause of death due to cancer in women aged from 25 to 39 years. Mortality from cervical cancer in Ireland is above the European average. In 2018, more than 90 Irish women will die from cervical cancer. A further 280 women will need intensive treatment such as surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy to help them overcome invasive cervical cancer. Unfortunately, four in ten of these women will die within five years. A further 6,500 women will need hospital treatment to remove precancerous changes to the cervix. The average age of diagnosis is 46 years and the average age of death is 56 years. </p>
          <p eId="para_659"> Treatment is very dependent on a number of individual factors. Where exactly the cancer is detected, whether it has spread, how abnormal the cancer cells are - these are just some of the factors that a treatment team will have to consider. Doctors can draw on a number of different forms of treatment to treat and manage cervical cancer. If the cancer is diagnosed early, these treatments usually have a good outcome. However, if the cancer presents later or is more aggressive, outcomes can be less favourable.</p>
          <p eId="para_660"> We are all aware of the old saying that prevention is better than cure, and this is especially true when it comes to cervical cancer. That is why in September 2010, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second level schools. In 2011, a catch-up programme commenced for all girls in second level school and was completed in 2014. Uptake rates for this vaccine peaked at 87% in 2014-15 but have fallen since then.</p>
          <p eId="para_661"> There are two licensed HPV vaccines available in Ireland, Gardasil and Cervarix. Gardasil is the vaccine used by the HSE in the schools immunisation programme. It provides protection against two high-risk HPV types that cause 70% of cervical cancers and pre-cancers, and two HPV types that cause 90% of genital warts. It has been licensed worldwide since 2006 and is used in over 25 European countries, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. To date, over 227 million doses have been distributed worldwide. In Ireland, over 730,000 doses of the vaccine have been distributed and more than 238,000 girls have received the full vaccine course.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> The introduction of HPV immunisation has had a significant impact in many parts of the world. Countries with high vaccine uptake rates have obviously seen the highest impact. In Scotland, where 90% of girls have been vaccinated since 2008, there has been a 90% fall in HPV infections in vaccinated girls. Pre-cancerous growths of the cervix have been reduced by more than 50% in countries such as Australia, which is referenced in the motion, Sweden and Scotland. Finland recently published the evidence that HPV immunisation protects against invasive HPV associated cancer.</p>
          <p eId="para_663"> One of the reasons we need this motion is that unfortunately, in recent years, the spread of inaccurate mistruths and misinformation concerning the safety and effectiveness of the HPV vaccine in the media, particularly on social media, has had a significant impact on uptake rates. If parents are worried tonight about getting factual information about a vaccine, I urge them to get it from a doctor. I beg them not to get it from a public representative who might like to be a doctor but is not, or from anonymous accounts on social media.</p>
          <p eId="para_664"> We have a doctor in the House - Deputy Harty - who, I am sure, will tell us that this is a very safe vaccine. It is supported by the medical community. I take my medical advice from doctors and other medical professionals. There is one Irish website that is WHO-accredited for information about this vaccine, and that is <i>www.hpv.ie</i>. Parents requiring factual information should have a conversation with a doctor or check out that website.</p>
          <p eId="para_665"> Misinformation is not harmless. It is not something that is a bit irritating or annoying. It is dangerous; it causes death. It will cause the unnecessary deaths from cancer of Irish girls. The responsibility for that must rest with those in this House who advocate against a vaccination programme. If a person advocates against a vaccination programme, he or she is doing so in the knowledge that all of the WHO evidence suggests that the vaccine is safe and that it saves the lives of girls. That is backed up by our medical community. The fall in take-up rates to 50% in 2016 will result in 1,000 girls requiring invasive therapy, a further 100 developing cervical cancer, which will require life-altering treatment, and the deaths of at least 40 from cervical cancer who did not receive the HPV vaccine. These are numbers, but they represent real girls in parts of this country who are going to require invasive treatment or who will die as a result of not getting this vaccine.</p>
          <p eId="para_666"> It is very important that we passionately unite to fight back and combat the misinformation. One of the most important things we can do is provide accurate and credible information. I am encouraged by the fact that the HSE launched a very effective campaign to raise public awareness in conjunction with the medical community and an alliance of health care professionals. I thank Deputy Kelly for his kind words about the HSE in that regard. As a result, we have seen the take-up rate increase this year to 62%. We have a long way to go to get back to the 87% coverage we previously had, but I welcome the reversal of the trend.</p>
          <p eId="para_667"> Two weeks ago, I had the great pleasure of joining with the HSE to launch phase 2 of the new campaign. I want to pay particular tribute to an amazing girl called Laura Brennan, who has just turned 25 and who is from County Clare. Laura has incurable cervical cancer and she contacted the HSE to say that she wanted to front this campaign and spread the word to girls and women of her age, and to mothers, that this vaccine is important and can save lives. I want to thank Laura and her family for their generosity and for the power of her story, which can be seen via the HSE's social media portals and also through its advertising campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_668"> I am aware that this House is also discussing the matter of extending the immunisation programme to include boys, who are currently not offered the vaccine. It should be remembered that our understanding of HPV as a cause of cancer originally concerned cervical cancer, and that much of the early work focused on the introduction of HPV immunisation programme for this purpose. There was a large amount of evidence at that time to show that HPV immunisation was effective in preventing the development of cervical cancer. However, there was less evidence available at that time that there was a health benefit to boys. Consequently, it was decided that the vaccine would be offered solely to girls. In recent years, there has been increasing evidence to show an association between HPV and other cancers, found both in men and women. Indeed, the evidence of a link between HPV and these cancers has become stronger. I am aware that 17 countries have already adopted a universal, gender-neutral vaccination policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_669"> There is a process in place to enable me, as Minister for Health, to make decisions concerning changes to our immunisation programmes. The national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, makes recommendations on immunisation policy. This is an independent committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and is comprised of experts in a number of specialties. NIAC's recommendations are based on the epidemiology of the relevant vaccine-preventable disease in Ireland. The HIQA conducts health technology assessments, HTAs, to establish the clinical effectiveness of any proposed changes. I have asked that HIQA carries out a HTA. I share the Deputy's view that it should be concluded as quickly as possible and, subject to a favourable HTA, I will prioritise this motion in terms of seeking to extend this vaccine universally.</p>
          <p eId="para_670"> I thank Deputy Kelly and the Labour Party for its leadership on this and I look forward to all colleagues uniting to send a strong, unanimous message in support of this life-saving vaccine.</p>

        <speech by="#BillyKelleher" eId="spk_302">
          <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_671">This is a timely motion because of the efforts of the past number of years to increase the take-up of the Gardasil vaccine in girls due to the fact that there was a major fall-off, as outlined by previous speakers, in recent years. That fall-off happened in large part due to concerns that were raised through social media and by parents of girls with chronic fatigue syndrome and other types of symptoms they associated with the Gardasil vaccine. However, the empirical evidence is quite clear, and we can only make policies in this Chamber that affect not only the health but the lives of people based on such evidence. If one looks at the international reviews of the various HPV vaccines, it is clear that it is very safe and that it saves lives. In this country alone, it will save the lives of 90 women every year. The fact that there was a drop-off in the take-up of the Gardasil vaccine will cost women their lives in the years ahead. We have to be very honest when we say that. Misinformation being put out on social media, for whatever reason, has an impact in the sense that a reduction in the take-up means that there will be severe consequences for a certain percentage of women in the years ahead, as outlined by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_672"> The motion, sponsored by Deputy Kelly, is timely. It allows to us again show our commitment to the vaccine as a public health policy initiative and to encourage the greater take-up of it. We have been involved for a while on an <i>ad hoc</i>, cross-party basis in recent times to help increase awareness levels of the vaccine and to get parents and youth organisations involved in discussing this issue to ensure that there is at least a knowledge of what it is about. We have to let them know that much of the information available on social media describing the damage the vaccine can cause is misinformation, is incorrect, and, in some cases, is being sponsored by people who are opposed not only to this vaccine but to vaccines in general. That issue has to be addressed and challenged on a continual basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_673"> The WHO's commentary on the vaccine demonstrates its safety quite clearly. There have been approximately 200 million doses of the vaccine administered across the globe. It is without question an exceptionally safe vaccine. We have to accept not only the WHO's findings but also the evidence from the vast majority of the countries using the Gardasil HPV vaccine. These are First World countries with First World health systems. There are checks and balances in their health services. The countries using the vaccine include Australia, Canada and most European states. We can be very confident in that context that there are very thorough checks and regulatory assessments of vaccines before they are administered. The context of the monitoring of the vaccines and the impact they have on the impact of the health of the various populations is something we can take comfort from.</p>
          <p eId="para_674"> The reason there was a fall-off was due to a campaign against the vaccine. When there is no proactive response to such a campaign the misinformation becomes the information of the day. If there is no rebuttal, it can gain traction and can take on a certain element of credibility. We have made the point at the Joint Committee on Health and at the cross-party meetings we held to try to highlight the need to increase the take-up of the Gardasil vaccine that said vacuum cannot be allowed to exist for long from a public health policy point of view. I believe that for a period we were lethargic in challenging the particular information that was circulating concerning the impact that Gardasil vaccines have on the health of young girls. There is no doubt that there is a cohort of people who are absolutely convinced that their child was or is damaged because of the Gardasil vaccine. When there is no response to or engagement with that and these particular cases are allowed to come to the fore in social media and then in mainstream media, the public health policy of trying to get as many young girls to get this vaccine is undermined. It was a big mistake, from a public health perspective, not to challenge and not to engage with the individuals who had concerns. The amendment tabled by Deputies Wallace, Clare Daly and Pringle indicates that this is of concern. We should learn the lessons from that particular episode.</p>
          <p eId="para_675"> Reference has been made to the new campaign that has begun. This motion will help that. Laura Brennan's story was also mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">It demonstrates the stark reality that people discouraging the uptake of this particular vaccine, for whatever reason or motivation, will impact on women's heath in the years ahead. It will cost people their lives, and we know that for a statistical fact. When people talk about this particular issue and their concerns, they have to realise at the back of their minds that the empirical evidence is clear and concise. This is a very safe vaccine.</p>
          <p eId="para_677"> The reason for this motion is not only to encourage the uptake of the Gardasil vaccine among the female population, but also among the male population. We all know that herd immunisation is what we want, that is, the point where a critical mass of people have taken the vaccine. I implore the Minister of State, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, and those who are doing the assessment to move quickly to ensure that this is also rolled out to boys throughout the country. Where it has been rolled out in other countries, it has had a meaningful impact in reducing harmful cancers among the male population. As I said, we are aiming for cross-immunisation and herd immunisation. For all those reasons, I compliment and concur with the motion. I urge people to engage positively with the information published by the national and international public health authorities, and accept that this is a safe vaccine and that it does and will save lives. </p>

          <from>Deputy John Brassil<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T18:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_678">I also compliment Deputy Kelly and the Labour Party on bringing forward this Private Members' motion. I hope that they get the unanimous support of the Dáil. Unanimous support is not something that often happens here, so I wish them good luck.</p>
          <p eId="para_679"> When I was first elected, I met with several parents who had genuine concerns about the vaccine because of the chronic fatigue syndrome from which their daughters subsequently suffered. I listened to their case and I was very sympathetic to what they experienced. However, a presentation on the issue was given in the AV room several months later. What got the issue very clearly over the line in my mind was that in Australia and in Finland, studies were taken out on the frequency of chronic fatigue syndrome prior to the human papillomavirus, HPV, vaccine being administered. They were then able to compare data to the vaccinated population. As it turned out, the incidence was no higher or lower. It was exactly the same. As such, there is nothing to scientifically support a link between chronic fatigue syndrome and the vaccine. Moreover, the incidence of chronic fatigue syndrome in males, who do not get the vaccine, is at the same level. The evidence really does stack up.</p>
          <p eId="para_680"> It will save 90 lives per year, and that is something of which we have to be very cognisant. In 2010, when the then Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney, refused to cover the cost of the vaccination programme, I remember calls for her resignation. It is amazing that an entire population can be outraged at the failure to provide funding for a vaccine, but five years or six years later the uptake has fallen from 90% to around 60%. We need to get the uptake to more than 90%. We need to get the male population vaccinated and develop what is commonly called "herd immunity" to get rid of this very serious and life-threatening cancer. Once again, I compliment the Labour Party for putting this forward. It has my full support, and I hope the full support of the rest of the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Niamh Smyth<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T18:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_681">I am delighted to see this motion before the House and I compliment Deputy Kelly. Each year in Ireland more than 6,500 women need hospital treatment for pre-cancer of the cervix. Some 300 women get cervical cancer, and ultimately 90 women die from it each year. Cervical cancer is caused by the HPV and we must trust the full spectrum of Irish health professionals, the World Health Organization, WHO, the Irish Cancer Society, the chief medical officer and the general medical advice which confirms that the HPV vaccine can be used and can save lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_682"> It is clear however, that there is unease about the potential side effects among many parents of girls who are due to receive the vaccine, notwithstanding the absence of any clinical proof of such an impact. That unease needs to be addressed to save lives. Just this evening I spoke with a mum from Ballyjamesduff. Her daughter received the vaccine and she claims that her daughter has acquired chronic fatigue syndrome as a result. If we are serious about saving lives, it is most important that the Minister, the Minister of State and their Department engage in a sympathetic and conciliatory way with those parents who feel that they did not get the correct information at the time, or that they were in some way uninformed about the vaccinations their daughters were about to receive. </p>
          <p eId="para_683"> Countries with high rates of uptake of the vaccine have seen the greatest impact. In Scotland, 90% of girls have been vaccinated since 2008. In Australia, where the vaccine was first introduced in 2007, the vaccine has prevented one in every two new cervical cancers. There has been a 90% fall in HPV infections in vaccinated girls, even better results than were anticipated. Information, and lots of it, along with less misinformation, will be critical if we are serious about ensuring that the girls of the future continue to get this vaccination. I know there is a lot of work to be done in terms of catching up because we have seen a fall-off in uptake. Coincidentally, the mum that I spoke to tonight talked about boys. I know Deputy Kelly raised that point in his initial address and vaccination should be made available to boys. That will also be critical in moving this matter forward</p>

          <from>Deputy Marc MacSharry<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T18:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_684">I support vaccination for the HPV and the benefits it can bring to young girls, young women and boys. My colleague said that we must trust the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, the European Medicines Agency, the HSE and all of our physicians, and of course we want to do so. It is not a case of scaremongering or anything like that, but I remember when many of us here in this House and the Seanad, where I was at the time, as well as wider society, trusted the International Monetary Fund, IMF, the European Commission, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, the ratings agencies, and most economists of the day. We paid a very heavy price in this country for not listening to dissenting voices. While we cannot ignore expertise and knowledge from all of these great organisations, it would be foolish in the extreme for us to effectively dismiss those people who are suffering symptoms which they believe are connected in some way to this vaccine. There are other vaccinations like Pandemrix, as well as issues with Lyme disease and so on, around which we could listen more to dissenting voices and do what we can to embrace the needs of those people.</p>
          <p eId="para_685"> The patient information leaflet which accompanies Gardasil 1 effectively states that 2.3% of patients suffered severe side-effects. For Gardasil 9, which is the newer model, that figure is 2.5%. That proves that there are serious side effects, because their own patient information says as much. Among those serious side effects are swollen glands, joint pain, unusual tiredness, weakness or confusion, chills, generally feeling unwell, leg pain, shortness of breath, chest pain, aching muscles, muscle weakness, seizure, bad stomach ache, bleeding or bruising more easily than normal, skin infection and fainting.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">In Ireland, there have been 1,100 reports to the HPRA of serious side effects. There have been 20,000 reported in Europe and 84,000 worldwide. The people concerned are not dreaming this up. I have outlined the symptoms they are feeling. They are listed in the patient information leaflet for the very drug, yet we are choosing not to embrace the fact that, here in Ireland, approximately 400 young girls are complaining about these issues. As I said, there have been 1,100 cases. We are giving them paracetamol and telling them to go home and that the problem is in their mind. We are telling them to see a physician or shrink and not to be talking down what is, in effect, a very useful and good vaccine.</p>
          <p eId="para_687"> As I said, I am in favour of vaccines and I am in favour of a vaccine for this disease. In Denmark, the authorities have ceased to use the drug in question. In Japan, they have stopped using public vaccination. It is only available privately now. This very week there was a conference on this matter in Japan at which Ireland was represented.</p>
          <p eId="para_688"> Let me return to the dissenting voices. There has been a lot of discrediting by those associated with mainstream medicine. I have been shown tweets, Facebook posts and so on from established names we see on television in this country effectively abusing the people affected and their families, who are struggling in very difficult times.</p>
          <p eId="para_689"> Some of the responses to parliamentary questions that were passed on to me — I am not sure whether this was by the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, or her colleague — state the Government is putting in place an established pathway for the people in question. It is stated the HSE is currently working to put in place a clinical care pathway appropriate to the medical needs of this group. The group is called REGRET, as many will know. What stage are we at in this regard? Are we providing meaningful treatments to those concerned? Are we providing medications to them? Are we providing financial support where some have had to go abroad for treatment, to the Czech Republic and elsewhere?</p>
          <p eId="para_690"> Just because we listen to dissenting voices does not mean we are rubbishing an entire treatment. We have learned our lessons financially in this country from not listening to them in the past. I beseech the Minister of State not to let those dissenting voices fall on deaf ears. As stated in the patient information leaflet, the side effects are real and acknowledged by the company.</p>

          <from>Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T18:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_691">The figures for cervical cancer and the HPV vaccine in this country are quite stark indeed. Every year, over 6,500 women need hospital treatment for pre-cancer of the cervix. We learn that a woman is diagnosed with cervical cancer almost every day. Almost two women die every week from it. Those figures speak for themselves. Cervical cancer is caused by HPV. The HPV vaccine, which since it was introduced has protected girls from developing cervical cancer when they grow up, has done a great job. The HSE has offered the vaccine to all girls in first year in second level schools since 2010 to protect them from cervical cancer in adulthood. Over the past two years, we saw a downturn in the number of girls who took up the offer. This is mainly because of unsubstantiated claims that have been made associating the vaccine with a number of conditions experienced by the group of young women. It is very important to state there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine causes any long-term illness. Reports of such claims led to a significant drop in the uptake rate of the vaccine, from 87% to 50%, meaning that a large cohort of girls is now at risk of developing cervical cancer later in their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_692"> Last week, the HSE launched the next phase of the vaccine information campaign, which aims to support parents in making an informed decision. This coincides with the return of the vaccination teams to second level schools. It is important that parents take the opportunity to listen to the information campaign, which started on 22 March on radio and on digital and social media. It features videos of individuals who volunteered to become involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_693"> When we examine the evidence from Australia, which is one of the first countries to introduce the HPV vaccine, we note it has seen a decrease of more than 50% in rates of pre-cancerous conditions. It is important that we take all this on board and support parents in making the right and informed decision.</p>

        <speech by="#LouiseOReilly" eId="spk_307">
          <from>Deputy Louise O'Reilly<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T18:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_694">I thank Deputy Alan Kelly and Members of the Labour Party for introducing this motion. We will be supporting it.</p>
          <p eId="para_695"> There can be no equivocation. The HPV vaccination programme and information campaign must be supported, and it must be supported by all of us. We have to lead by example on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_696"> Cervical cancer is the second most common type of cancer that affects women worldwide. It is linked to a sexually transmitted infection with the HPV. Ireland sees 6,500 cases of pre-cancer of the cervix each year. The Irish Family Planning Association has shown that approximately 300 women per year are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 90 of these women will die from that illness. Thankfully, many such deaths should become a thing of the past because of the HPV vaccine. It is right that we should extend that protection to boys as well as girls.</p>
          <p eId="para_697"> Owing to the immense dangers of the HPV, the vaccine is offered to girls in their first year in secondary school. The move by the HSE in offering a catch-up facility for girls to obtain the HPV vaccine where they have missed it is very timely, particularly given that we experienced a significant drop in the vaccination rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_698"> The vaccine is the most effective protection against two types of the virus, which cause over 70% of cervical cancers. It also protects boys from cancers and from HPV transmission. The vaccine is recommended by the HSE, the World Health Organization, the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, the National Immunisation Advisory Committee and the Irish Cancer Society, among others. The medical evidence supporting the HPV vaccine is overwhelming. The research is global as well as national. As head of the National Immunisation Office, Dr. Brenda Corcoran said the vaccine is one of the most studied ever and that all evidence shows that there has been no increase in any longer-term illness after the vaccine.</p>
          <p eId="para_699"> For proof of the success of the vaccine, we need only look to Australia, which is referred to in the motion. Australia was one of the first countries to introduce the vaccine and it has seen a 50% drop in the rate of pre-cancer of the cervix over the past decade. In Scotland and Sweden, pre-cancerous growth of the cervix has been reduced by more than 50%. That is the benefit of the vaccine and that is why it should be made universally available.</p>
          <p eId="para_700"> I commend the HSE for working hard to combat misinformation on the vaccine and for the new information campaigns that have been launched. I join others in offering my thanks and praise to Laura Brennan, who has been involved in the HSE's information campaign. Those who may be unaware of Laura should note she is suffering from terminal cervical cancer. She was diagnosed in 2016. In January 2017, she began rounds of radiation and chemotherapy, and tests later confirmed she had the all-clear. Sadly, the cancer returned and Laura said her only option now is palliative chemotherapy to extend her life. Let me quote what she had to say about the vaccine: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_701">I made contact with the HSE after I had been diagnosed with terminal cervical cancer. I'm only 25 but there is no treatment that will cure my cancer, only treatment that will now prolong my life. I didn't get the HPV vaccine – it wasn't available in schools when I was a teenager so my parents didn't have the choice. The reality is that now there is a vaccine that protects girls from getting this horrible disease. No parent wants their daughter to get cervical cancer. If anything good comes from my situation, I hope that parents consider this – get the facts, get informed and make the decision to get their daughters vaccinated. The HPV vaccine saves lives. It could have saved mine.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">The bravery of this young woman is an inspiration. If sharing her story encourages one parent to get his or her child vaccinated, it will be a success.</p>
          <p eId="para_703"> Precaution and vaccination against cervical cancer through the HPV vaccine are very important. It is the best way to protect against cervical cancer.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">It is important that our health system reacts to cervical cancer and has world-class diagnostic services. CervicalCheck Ireland does great work and provides free smear tests in certain categories. It is life-saving work and the doctors and nurses who operate at its coalface deserve great credit for the way in which they have grown and improved the service, in particular over the last decade. I call on the Government to ensure that free cervical smear tests are provided to all women, including those who may not be in a high-risk category. It is important that our system does not discriminate on the basis of age-old preconceptions about sexual activity and risk. Recently, it was relayed to me by a friend that she had been charged €80 for a smear test because she was over 60 years of age. It is important at all ages to keep women informed. The collective measures of vaccination and smear testing are important as they give us the chance to protect women and work towards eradicating cervical cancer. It beholds public representatives to support health campaigns which aim to improve the health and well-being of people across the State. The HPV vaccination programme and its associated information campaign do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_705"> Where the medical evidence as to the benefits of a vaccine are as apparent as they are overwhelming, we must defer to that medical evidence and to the medical professionals. Let us not forget that across this country and the world diseases which used to be common, including polio and diphtheria, measles and whooping cough, to name but a few, can easily be prevented by vaccination. One of the most important things we can do is support the provision of accurate and credible information to enable parents to take fully informed decisions about the HPV vaccine. We know the HPV vaccine works and saves lives. The vaccine not only contributes to cervical cancer reduction, it addresses other cancers associated with the virus which affect both men and women, including anal, genital and throat cancers. The HPV virus is also associated with the development of penile cancer and causes genital warts in both men and women. Therefore, I support the motion's call for the Government to further extend the HPV vaccination programme to include boys in their first year of secondary school. Again, I cite Australia, which introduced the vaccine for boys and girls in 2006. Since then, there has been a 90% reduction in the number of cases of genital warts in men and women reported. Vaccination against HPV can help to prevent these sexually transmitted infections and cancers for boys as well as girls. I am happy to note that Sinn Féin will support the motion. We see support for any public health campaign which aims to improve the health of our people as essential.</p>

        <speech by="#BridSmith" eId="spk_308">
          <from>Deputy Bríd Smith<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T18:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_706">I rise to speak in support of the motion as well as in defence of science. However, I wish also to set out why I think many ordinary people might have a distrust of that science. Vaccination saves lives, as many other Deputies have said. Along with the advent of modern sanitation and access to clean water, vaccination is responsible for saving millions of lives globally. Stephen J. Gould, the renowned scientist, wrote a great essay in which he referred to the death of the daughter of Charles Darwin. Mr. Gould made the point that when people sought to wax lyrical about the golden age of past centuries, he reminded them that, thanks to modern medicine, most of us in the west enjoyed a privilege never before vouchsafed to any human group. He pointed out that our children will grow up; we will not lose half or more of our offspring in infancy or childhood. He said we will not have to sing the song of the death of our children. One sees in old graveyards the headstones of young children struck down in childhood in pandemics and epidemics as well as by diseases of poverty and lack of access to clean water. They died from diseases which today are almost eliminated, including smallpox, polio, yellow fever, diphtheria and measles. We must begin by celebrating the fact that modern medicine has made great strides. We must think before we cast doubt on the efficacy of vaccination what we are actually saying and what the consequences of raising those doubts will be for the lives of people. I start, therefore, by celebrating the fact that millions in this generation do not have to sing the song of the death of their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_707"> The biggest problem we face globally is the lack of access of so many children to medicines, clean water, sanitation, vaccinations and, often, the food which could save millions of lives. According to the World Health Organization, the number of measles-related deaths decreased by 79% in the 21st century up to 2014. Measles vaccination has played a key role in reducing child mortality. As to the HPV vaccine, we know that more than 90% of cervical cancers are caused by HPV, a disease which killed 270,000 girls worldwide in 2012, while 10% of women have required invasive treatment for a pre-cancer over their lifetimes. Numerous studies show that the HPV vaccine is extremely effective against this virus and has the potential to reduce dramatically the incidence of cancer and to save untold lives. One study in Scotland found a 90% reduction in HPV among young Scottish women. The director of Scotland's HPV reference laboratory says these new findings indicate that the positive impact of the HPV vaccine may be even greater then was initially thought. He says the data demonstrate collectively the significance and continued benefit of HPV vaccination programmes in Scotland which have achieved a consistent and high uptake of approximately 90% in 12 and 13 year old girls.</p>
          <p eId="para_708"> While we will support the motion, that does not mean the families of girls who experience the onset of illness and other long-term health problems should be sneered at. As the amendment proposes, the HSE should engage with those families and girls. In all honesty, the HSE should engage with every group of people who have concerns about their health and the health of their children. The HSE should engage and look after those who suffer from disabilities and who need access to proper health care. Witness those who were outside the gates of Leinster House today who have been grossly disappointed by the removal of the protocol from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which we ratified last week. There are huge issues with the way in which the makers of Gardasil Merck have collected reports on adverse reactions as well as with the methodology they have used. There are issues with the European Medicines Agency. People have a right to question big pharma and to seek answers about their children's health.</p>
          <p eId="para_709"> However, people may distrust science and scientists for the same reasons they distrust instinctively many in authority. They distrust the economists who tell them they must accept cutbacks or that a vital public service cannot be funded. They distrust the Ministers who tell them they must accept this or that extra charge on their wages because there is no alternative. Scientists tell those who are disappointed with authority and the misuse of power that they must use this or that vaccine and confusion can easily arise with opposition to authority generally. However, when all of the evidence points to the fact that the vaccine saves lives and prevents suffering, we have a duty to be careful about how we pose questions. My understanding is that much of the illness and many of the effects of which young girls complain can occur in the same age bracket as the age at which the vaccine is administered. This is what parents are concerned about. That does not mean the vaccine caused those ill effects. However, parents might connect those ill effects with receiving the vaccine and they have legitimate questions about the timeframe. We must understand their concerns and answer them without dismissing them and without categorising all of their questions as irrational or anti-science. I have been struck, however, by how sneering and dismissive many who call themselves scientists and defenders of rationality can be. We have a right to question the actions of big pharma and its obsessive drive for profits. We have seen these companies put profits before people's lives and health in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_710"> Telling people to trust scientists who show them contempt and who do not engage is not how we should do this. We can defend science and the advances of modern medicine while pointing out that the pursuit of profit and corporations are at the heart of a lot of these serious consequences. We can point that out and campaign for a better health service, better access to life-saving medicines and better oversight and accountability of corporations. At the same time, we must support and defend the medicines and vaccines which all peer review shows effective to prevent life-threatening illnesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">For that reason, we will be supporting the motion and, indeed, the amendment to the motion that the vaccine should be available to young boys as well as young girls. It has had an amazing effect on reducing cancer in young girls. I welcome the motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_712">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_713">(a) To insert the following words after "decade;":</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_714">“— a number of individuals who have received the vaccine have experienced severe health problems in the time period after receiving the vaccine;"</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_716">(b) To insert the following words after "secondary school; and":</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_717">"calls on the Government to:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_718">— instruct the HSE to engage with those who have experienced health problems in the time period after receiving the HPV vaccine in order to determine the cause of that damage;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_719">— ensure proper medical and other support is available to those who have suffered health problems in the time period after receiving the HPV vaccine, whatever the ultimate cause of that damage;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_720">— fulfil the programme for Government commitment to put in place a scheme, on a no-fault basis, that will respond to the needs of people with disability arising from vaccination;"</p>
          <p eId="para_721">I will concentrate my remarks on the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_722"> I very much welcome the opportunity to discuss this issue today. Like everyone else, I think we must start from the point that vaccinations have made an enormous contribution to public health around the globe. They have transformed the situation for ordinary people, particularly the vulnerable. That is critical. Such recognition does not mean, however, that in the minority of cases where people will have an adverse reaction to a vaccination there is not a certain responsibility to deal with those people. I think there is, and, in fairness, the programme for Government recognises that also when it calls for the long awaited and long-lobbied for national vaccine injury compensation scheme. Let us be clear that if we want people to support vaccination programmes and overcome their concerns, the best way of achieving that is to provide such a scheme. It is proven that it would have an impact on increasing rates of participation in schemes and have a far more positive outcome in that regard than the manner in which much of this debate has been conducted so far not in this House tonight, but in society over the past period. People who have raised doubts, asked questions and have seen their loved ones suffering ill effects having received a vaccination have been vilified and demonised for asking those questions. This is abhorrent, and it is increasingly becoming a mark of discourse in society not only on this issue, but a number of others.</p>
          <p eId="para_723"> My daughter is celebrating her 18th birthday today - I said I would try to get that on the record at some stage. She received the vaccination along with many others but some of those girls, whose parents also trusted and who also received the vaccine, unfortunately, are perhaps not in such good health as they were previously. I am not saying that is connected with the vaccination but nobody can say positively that it is not. What we can say with absolute certainty is that severe health problems exist in those young girls. All the amendment calls for is that the health service engages with them and their families to determine the cause and also to support them in their medical care. Critically, it calls on the Government to fulfil the programme for Government commitment to introduce a no-fault vaccination scheme. If we did that, we would make this society much safer and improve vaccination rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_724"> In 2001, the Oireachtas health committee recommended that such a scheme be put in place. Eight years on, the vaccine damage steering group stated that there is an onus on the State to look sympathetically at the very rare number of cases where children suffer serious adverse reactions as a result of vaccination. The group followed that up by stating that this should be through a no-fault compensation scheme. Such a scheme operates in 19 countries worldwide. It reflects the fact that it is fair and reasonable that a community that is protected by a vaccination programme accepts responsibility for and provides compensation to those who are injured by it.</p>
          <p eId="para_725"> The numbers may be small. Figures from the US no-fault scheme show that for every 1 million vaccine doses eligible for compensation that were distributed between 2008 and 2016, the court compensated one injury. At one in 1 million, the number is small but that does not mean it is non-existent. Depending on the gravity of the disease in question, obviously, receiving a vaccine is far less dangerous than remaining unvaccinated. The tetanus vaccine, for example, causes a life-threatening allergic reaction in at most 0.0006% of those who receive it, while the fatality rate from tetanus is 13.2%. From the point of view of public health, it is far better that people are vaccinated, but some are injured by it and we need to take steps to deal with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_726"> It is inevitable, when one is giving a drug to hundreds of thousands of people, that small numbers will not react to it well. We know what happened in the Pandemrix situation which caused narcolepsy in some recipients. It happened with the three-in-one vaccine administered in Ireland in the 1970s which caused brain damage in a very small number of cases. Other vaccines caused less serious injuries.</p>
          <p eId="para_727"> On the rare occasions where things go wrong, the State has a responsibility to mitigate it. The alternative is that families are forced to slog their way through litigation which drags on for years, at enormous stress to them and enormous cost to the State. We are seeing exactly that happening with the Pandemrix cases right now. There is no argument whatsoever that Pandemrix caused narcolepsy in some of those who received it. There is a proven and accepted link between the two. Despite this, the first compensation claim for damage by the drug, which the HSE continued to administer after knowing there was a proven link between Pandemrix and narcolepsy, has not even been allowed to start in the courts. That is because, 16 months after an order for discovery of documents was made by the High Court in November 2016, the HSE has not yet complied in full. This is outrageous. Individuals debilitated by narcolepsy as a result of being given a drug that the HSE knew caused a serious illness should not have to fight for years to be compensated. It is unspeakable as far as I am concerned. That is why the no-fault vaccine scheme was recommended by so many health committees. That is why, I presume, it is in the programme for Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_728"> Another reason it is urgent is that if one is brought in, it would increase vaccination rates. That will be the positive impact of it. What is happening with Pandemrix will not instil confidence. In fact, it will make parents doubt the HSE and believe the State is circling the wagons and is not taking any responsibility for its action by stating one should trust it and all will be well and good.</p>
          <p eId="para_729"> There is no sin in admitting that in a small number of cases - one in a million or fewer - somebody will suffer damage from a vaccine. I accept people are bad at understanding risk. People are more afraid of flying than they are of driving when everybody knows it is far more dangerous to drive than to fly but that does not mean one denies the small risk involved, and it does not mean one should not drag people through years of litigation. No fault compensation schemes are critically important. They will make it easier for everybody. They will make vaccinations much more acceptable and protect public health in that regard. In that sense, the amendment is an important addition to the motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_731">I am happy to be able to speak on this motion this evening. There has been much controversy over this topic and I have had a number of concerned parents come to me in my constituency clinic in west Cork and here in the Dáil about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_732"> I believe it is up to individual parents to choose whether they want to vaccinate their daughters. It is not fair that the HSE and the Minister for Health are pushing it down their throats. Many parents have genuine concerns but they are being totally ignored. The head of the HSE went as far as calling them "emotional terrorists". Frankly, that is appalling.</p>
          <p eId="para_733"> Many young girls and their families have serious concerns about the reaction to and side effects of this vaccination, but they have been totally ignored.

          <from>Deputy Michael Harty<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T18:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_734">I will speak in favour of this motion. The human papilloma virus, HPV, causes cervical cancer and a vaccine to prevent such a cancer is welcome. HPV is sexually transmitted and, therefore, it makes absolute sense that both boys and girls should be vaccinated against this virus. This would have two effects. First, it would reduce the transmission of the virus; and, second, it would reduce male associated cancers, which are cancers of the rectum, the genitalia, but also head and neck cancers. The incidence of these are increasing dramatically and often are associated with HPV. For those reasons, it is very important that the vaccine is delivered to both boys and girls.</p>
          <p eId="para_735"> The vaccine will not prevent all cancers. It is an important message that not all cervical cancers are related to HPV and it is important that women continue to attend for cervical screening and have cervical smears to pick up cancer.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">Cancer of the cervix is slow-growing. There is a cancer prevention programme for those between the ages of 25 and 60 years. It is very important that, even though they are vaccinated against the virus, girls should continue to attend for cervical smear tests because not all cancers are prevented by this vaccine. The reason is that not all cancers are virus-related and not all sub-groups of the virus are contained within the vaccine. We must be careful that we do not give people a false sense of security.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> There have been reports of side effects or, more accurately, adverse reactions or possible adverse reactions to the virus. They are real and, as Deputy Clare Daly said, we must have a programme to give people compensation if they are deemed to have these very rare side effects. We should not dismiss that out of hand. There is no such thing as never and there is no such thing as always in medicine. We must be vigilant that the vaccine could be related to serious adverse reactions. That said, the HPRA, NIAC and the WHO have cleared this vaccine and we have to accept that. Nevertheless, we do need to monitor any potential side effects.</p>

          <p eId="para_738">Cancer is a desperate disease that affects so many people. Having attended the funerals of so many young women who have passed away because of cancer, I would certainly advise people to have the HPV vaccine. There is a lot of weight behind its approval. I have to acknowledge the people I have met, young girls who have had an adverse reaction to this vaccine. It really did affect them. I met many of them on my travels during one election campaign. Those people have to be acknowledged and their concerns must be addressed. When they present with side effects, they need to be helped. I am asking the Department to ensure that they get help when they present with adverse reactions.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T18:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_739">I am glad to be able to speak to this motion this evening, which I am not supporting. I will be supporting Deputy Clare Daly's amendment to the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_740"> I have concerns about the vaccine as it has been rolled out in recent years. I have met countless families with daughters who have had adverse reactions to the vaccine. They cannot prove it but it is a big coincidence. There are nearly 500 families in Ireland who are very concerned about the state of their vibrant, sporting, capable and able daughters, who, having had the vaccine, are literally lifeless. They cannot say that the vaccine is definitely the cause but it is too much of a coincidence. They are traumatised, have lost out on school, have lost out on friends and participating in activities. I know one girl, Monnie, who was a very able horse rider at 12 or 13 years. She could do anything with a horse she could tackle them, pet them, ride them, jump them and everything else and now she is barely able to walk. She is now travelling around the world to try to find a treatment. There are huge efforts. My wife and I made the decision that we would not allow our daughters to get the vaccine. It is a personal decision for any family. People should tread with caution. We have seen the might of the pharmaceutical companies. I have seen it in Tipperary but it is evident all over the world and it is an issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_741"> Tomorrow, an international speaker will be here to address this matter. The 500 families whose daughters are affected have formed an organisation and are lobbying. They are entitled to do so. Any of us would lobby if our child was very seriously ill. For the people to whom I refer to be told by the CEO of the HSE, Mr. O'Brien, that they are emotional terrorists is outrageous. When I told the Minister that Mr. O'Brien should at least be reprimanded - he should have been sacked - the Minister stood up and said that he was right. How can a person say that about concerned parents? Any of us would die for our children. How could anyone accuse parents of being emotional terrorists. The emotional terrorism is going on day in, day out in the hospital wards, with their queues and the trolleys, as my colleagues alluded to earlier. Sleep deprivation is a war crime. I have said this before. People are denied sleep in trolleys and chairs in emergency departments sometimes for 36 hours or it could be three full days or longer, where they cannot sleep for noise, lights and everything else. If this was a war situation, they would be referred to the Hague for war crimes. For the Minister to stand up in the Chamber and say that Mr. O'Brien is right is outrageous. If he had any moral respect, he would also resign. The 500 families are just concerned and raising issues. They are not well-off or well resourced, and they are entitled to have their concerns without being described as emotional terrorists. It is outrageous and I hope that the Minister of State will correct the record this evening and perhaps give them some solace.</p>

        <speech by="#JanOSullivan" eId="spk_315">
          <from>Deputy Jan O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T18:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_742">I thank Deputy Kelly for drafting the motion on behalf of the Labour Party and I acknowledge the widespread support of practically everyone in the Chamber who has spoken. It was almost everybody, which is very welcome. That is really important. As Deputy Bríd Smith observed, the concept of vaccination has saved millions of lives around the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_743"> The motion relates specifically to the HPV vaccine and its extension to boys. The background is that the percentages of take-up among girls who were being offered it in schools had fallen to 50%. Thankfully, it has now increased back up to 62% but it needs to be much higher. Examples from other countries show take-up rates high as 90%. We have to continue that we ensure that we get the rate up as high as we possibly can in this country and that we extend the vaccine to boys.</p>
          <p eId="para_744"> Deputy Harty just gave very strong medical evidence for why we should extend it to boys. The fact is that boys get cancers that are preventable through use of the HPV vaccine. They also transmit cancer to girls and women in later life. The importance of extending the vaccine to boys is very scientifically evident and I am glad the Minister has accepted that on behalf of the Government. However, we do need to address the issues which have been raised here by some Deputies here in respect of adverse reactions. I hope I am quoting Deputy Fiona O'Loughlin correctly when she said that there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine has long-term adverse effects. People acknowledge that there are a small number of adverse reactions and we need to be respectful of the parents who have recognised adverse reactions in their daughters. However, difficulties arise when that becomes a lobby which actually discourages people from having the vaccine. It is at this point that we must be clear and unequivocal that we advocate and encourage parents to ensure that their girls are vaccinated and, when the programme is extended, that their boys are vaccinated too. That is why I am very disappointed by Deputy Mattie McGrath indicating that he will not support the motion. One can be respectful and recognise parents who have concerns but when one transfers that into advocating for people not to be vaccinated, then one does a really strong disservice.</p>
          <p eId="para_745"> Several speakers referred to Laura Brennan who has cervical cancer which has no treatment, or rather she cannot be cured of it but treatment could prolong her life. She is a very vibrant young woman who should have a whole life ahead of her but the vaccine was not available when she was of the appropriate age. She was quoted in full earlier but I want just read one sentence into the record, namely, "If anything good comes from my situation, I hope that parents consider this – get the facts, get informed and make the decision to get their daughters vaccinated". People have quoted facts from the various bodies, including the Irish College of General Practitioners, the Irish Pharmacy Union, Irish Cancer Society, the HPV Alliance, major medical scientific bodies worldwide, including the WHO, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the EU-funded European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">They are just some of the bodies that have endorsed the vaccine. It is therefore quite clear that the scientific evidence for the positive effects of this vaccine is overwhelming. That is the message we need to get out there. As public representatives we have a very strong duty to encourage parents in every way we can to take the positive approach to this, to get the vaccine and to prevent the spread of cervical cancer. We know that 300 people per annum are diagnosed with cervical cancer. That is one of the highest rates in the world, so we clearly have a problem. While I welcome the progress that has been made, we need to make an awful lot more.</p>
          <p eId="para_747"> I also support those who have talked about other screening. Deputy Harty talked about the need to continue to have cervical screening even when one has had the vaccine. I have had cervical, breast and bowel screening myself and I encourage everybody to do so. We need to encourage people to take up offers of screening. The extension of these various screening programmes over recent years is very positive and we need to continue that extension.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> People have talked about the eradication of disease. There are people living in this country who have what is called post-polio syndrome, but there are not people with polio because of vaccination. There is also vaccination for other diseases such as diptheria, tetanus and so on. The measles, mumps an rubella, MMR, vaccine has also been the subject of some controversy. In my constituency there is an outbreak of measles. It is in one particular part of the city and it is affecting quite a large number of people. The HSE has now extended its vaccination clinics. I attended a briefing a couple of days ago at which public representatives raised the issue of extending the clinics to after office hours and the HSE has agreed to do so. That is happening because of this outbreak of measles. This outbreak is a direct result of people being discouraged and not taking up the MMR vaccine. Measles is a serious disease. Public campaigns against general vaccination have serious consequences. I believe "herd" is the word used, but there certainly needs to be a broad uptake for there to be a public health benefit that saves people's lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_749"> The most important thing is obviously saving people's lives and giving people quality of life, but preventative medicine such as this, and public health in general, also prevents people taking up space in hospitals. We all know the problems of overcrowding. The whole argument around preventative health measures has to be constantly on the agenda because it is probable that not one of us does enough to ensure that we stay as healthy as possible. One of the most effective and in some ways easiest way in which to do that is to ensure that we avail of all of the various screening and vaccination programmes that are available.</p>
          <p eId="para_750"> Ultimately we have to depend on the scientific evidence. Deputy Daly raised issues of previous controversies around vaccinations, but the message today in respect of this particular vaccine and the associated public health programme has got to be absolutely unequivocal and clear that this vaccine has a positive effect and that it saves lives. It saves a very large number of lives when one considers the number of people who contract cervical cancer in Ireland. It is really important that we send out a positive message in that regard. That is why I welcome the very broad support for our motion today and the public health campaign that the Department and HSE have been continuing with. It behoves all of us in political life to support that and to continue to speak out on these issues.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Catherine Byrne)<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T18:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_751">On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Harris, and myself I thank all those who contributed to the debate on this motion. I also thank Deputy Alan Kelly for bringing this very important motion to the floor. As a mother and grandparent I am very conscious of the fact that I have four daughters, four granddaughters and two grandsons. I want what every parent and grandparent wants, to make sure that their children and grandchildren get the best of what our health service can offer and that includes vaccination and everything else. I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan on what she said at the end of her contribution about it being so important that women and men avail of the services that are there, particularly the screening services for breast cancer and bowel cancer and even smear tests. As a mother and as somebody who has had most of the tests available to me I know how important it is to continue to make them available to people.</p>
          <p eId="para_752"> A number of issues were raised. I cannot comment on some of them because I do not have the reply in front of me. I will comment on two of them. Deputy Kelleher raised one issue. I remember that, at the time when Deputy Kelleher and myself were on the Joint Committee on Health, we met parents who said that their children had been affected by the vaccination. It was very emotional for everybody on the committee to listen to the stories that were told. All of us who are not medical professionals, GPs or otherwise in the business of health have to rely on what is being said by the professionals, who are the GPs, and on the scientific evidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_753"> Deputy MacSharry and Deputy Daly raised the issue of the clinical pathway care approach to the medical needs of this group. I have no further update on this but to say that the HSE is definitely working on it at present and as soon as some information becomes available to the offices of the Minister, Deputy Harris, and myself, it will become available to all the Deputies here. </p>
          <p eId="para_754"> I will continue on with some of the notes which I have been given. I know that the Minister, Deputy Harris, covered some of them in his opening statement but I will go back on some of them myself. Cervical cancer impacts the lives of almost 7,000 women in Ireland every year. In 2018 more than 90 Irish women will die from cervical cancer; a further 280 women will need intensive treatment, such as surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy; and another 6,500 women will need hospital treatment to remove precancerous changes in the cervix. Some 99% of cervical cancer is caused by persistent infection of certain high-risk types of human papilloma virus, HPV, which is acquired during sexual contact. HPV vaccination prevents this.</p>
          <p eId="para_755"> In September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second level schools. In 2011 a catch-up programme commenced for all girls in second level school and this was completed in 2014. Gardasil is the vaccine used by the HSE in the schools immunisation programme. It provides protection against the two high-risk HPV types that cause 70% of cervical cancers and pre-cancers and the two HPV types that cause 90% of genital warts. In Ireland nearly quarter of a million girls have received the full vaccine course. However, uptake rates for the HPV vaccine peaked at 87% in 2014-15 and have dramatically fallen since then. The main focus of the programme is to increase HPV vaccination uptake rates in girls.</p>
          <p eId="para_756"> One of the most important things we can do is to provide accurate and credible information to enable parents to make a fully informed decision concerning HPV vaccination. The HPV vaccine information campaign helps parents access trusted sources of information. The initial evidence suggests that this campaign is having a positive effect with provisional figures showing uptake rates having increased by 11% to 62%. I concur with the many Deputies who have said that this increase is not enough. Many spoke about herd immunity. Until a few weeks ago I had never heard how important it is to reach 90% to ensure that people are covered. It is important that we, as public representatives here in the Dáil, do everything we can to promote that fact and to encourage parents to continue to have their children immunised.</p>
          <p eId="para_757"> I know that many parents have concerns, as did I when I was having my children vaccinated, but we depend on our GPs and the medical professionals around us at the time. We had an incident in my family in which one of my family members had a severe reaction to a vaccine but thankfully that family member has recovered and is now living a normal life. That does not always happen and I share the concerns which some parents raised at the Joint Committee on Health when I was on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_758"> In recent years, increasing evidence has shown an association between HPV and other cancers found in both men and women. The evidence for a causative link between HPV and cancer has become stronger. The process to enable an informed decision concerning the extension of the current HPV immunisation programme to include boys, underpinned by objective and scientific evidence, is already under way. HIQA is undertaking a HTA, at the request of the Department of Health, on extending the national immunisation schedule to include HPV vaccination for boys. The HTA will establish the clinical basis and cost-effectiveness of providing the vaccine to boys. I hate to use the word "cost-effectiveness", but I understand things are already beginning to happen in this area and we must wait until the evidence is back. The Government is supportive of the intentions of the motion but, as has already been said, we await the completion of the HTA later this year, which is the appropriate way to approach this.</p>
          <p eId="para_759"> The HSE immunisation teams have started their second round of visits to secondary schools. I again encourage the parents of all eligible girls to ensure that their daughters receive this important vaccination. I thank all Deputies for the varied contributions they have made this evening. It is unfair of anyone to come into this Chamber and make - I will not say an accusation - a comment that we do not care as parents. I certainly care as a parent but I also care as a politician about what we put in place.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_317">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T19:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_760">I thank all the Deputies who contributed to what has been a really important and powerful debate. I thank my colleague, Deputy Kelly, for drafting the motion on behalf of the party and placing it before the House. It is my hope and expectation that it will pass without dissent, and perhaps that will still be the outcome of the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_761"> One of the greatest advances by humanity was the harnessing of the power of vaccination to combat disease. Throughout our history, the scourge of viruses and bacteria has devastated people across the globe. Epidemics and plagues were a constant fear. Through the application of centuries of scientific research, we, as a species, have been able to combat dozens of diseases that once routinely killed millions. The success of these efforts should not be forgotten, and we will continually search out new ways to defeat diseases that so often were a constant threat to our very survival as a species. However, in some ways the success of vaccination has inured us to how radical a development it still is in preventing disease.</p>
          <p eId="para_762"> This history is important for us to remember. When Edward Jenner used cowpox material to inoculate against smallpox in 1796 and publicised his findings throughout the then known world, he began the process of eradication that officially achieved, in 1980, the eradication of the once dreaded disease of smallpox. It was the first disease to have been fought on a global scale, and millions of human beings have been spared the horror of smallpox as a result. In 1885, Louis Pasteur's rabies vaccine added to our arsenal against yet another lethal disease. Progress accelerated in the 20th century with Salk's vaccine for the debilitating polio virus, while vaccines were developed to combat tetanus, anthrax, typhoid, tuberculosis, diphtheria and more. Even in our own folk memory, we can recall the horror of the word "tuberculosis". Generations of Irish people were horrified by the notion of tuberculosis and those who suffered from it were avoided.</p>
          <p eId="para_763"> One of the greatest successes has been in combating childhood diseases such as measles, mumps and rubella, dangerous diseases that have nearly been eradicated in many areas. However, the false concerns raised about a link to autism saw rates of vaccination plummet. The consequences of this have been, as my colleague, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan said, renewed outbreaks of a potentially lethal disease in our country. Therefore, we really must be vigilant and clear about these matters. To quote the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, "It is tragic and unacceptable that 49 children and adults in EU countries have died from complications of measles infection in the past two years, while safe and effective vaccines are readily available." Despite Andrew Wakefield's 1998 report linking MMR and autism being disproved, surveys have shown that up to a third of parents still automatically link the vaccine with autism.</p>
          <p eId="para_764"> People will always be concerned about the risks of vaccines, or indeed the risks of any medicine or treatment. As Deputy Harty rightly said, there is no such thing as completely risk-free treatment of any kind. However, the risks must be constantly balanced by the enormous benefits that can come from proven treatment. Millions of people are alive because of vaccination.</p>
          <p eId="para_765"> The 2008 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was jointly awarded to Harald zur Hausen for his work on identifying HPV as a cause of cervical cancer. His discoveries in the 1970s and through the 1980s were groundbreaking as they went against the dogma of the time on how cancer was caused. There are more than 100 types of HPV, 15 of which put women at a high risk of cervical cancer. More than 5% of all cancers worldwide - I ask the House to think about this - are associated with HPV. On foot of the fact that HPV is the most common sexually-transmitted disease, affecting anywhere from 50% to 80% of the population, it was this pioneering work to link it to cancer that gave us the real chance to protect us against all these cancers. Science builds on the work of others, and from that original research a vaccine was developed. That vaccine now provides greater than 99% protection from infection from the most high-risk strains, namely HPV 16 and HPV 18, as well as two others.</p>
          <p eId="para_766"> This means that the vaccine as used in Ireland, Gardasil, is effective, as my colleague, Deputy Kelly, said, against seven out of ten of all cervical cancers. Deputy Burton indicated how awful a disease cervical cancer is, how cruel a disease it is for young women in particular - for all women - and asked why, if we have a method of preventing it in seven out of ten cases, we would not advocate it from the rooftops. The more people who are vaccinated, the lower the levels of cancer and the lower the risk to the population as a whole. In populations among which the vaccine has been widely adopted there has been, as speaker after speaker has indicated, a major drop in the levels of cervical cancer. The most progressive countries use it and have proven its effectiveness. We want the vaccine extended to boys in their first year of secondary school because they too can develop HPV-associated cancers in later life. Extending the HPV vaccine to boys makes common sense and medical sense. The evidence for this is to be found in analyses carried out across the globe in countries such as Australia.</p>
          <p eId="para_767"> The HSE campaign to promote the HPV vaccine is under way. I welcome the take-up figures. They are slowly rising, with an 11% increase, as the Minister has said, to 62%, compared to 51% last year. The figures on HPV and Ireland are stark. Speaker after speaker has told us this. Some 300 women in Ireland will be diagnosed with cervical cancer this year, 90 of whom will die. These are enormously tragic occurrences for all the families involved. I urge all those concerned to consult the HSE website to ensure they get the facts that are grounded in medical truth. Misinformation must be tackled. The brave personal testimony by Laura Brennan, who has terminal cervical cancer, should be listened to by all who are concerned or worried about the vaccine. She is taking part in the HSE's campaign, as others have said. Her bravery should be acknowledged and her words listened to.</p>
          <p eId="para_768"> Our objective in putting this motion before the House is certainly not party-political.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">There is no party-political advantage in this. That is because we really regard it as one of the major health issues of our time. If we can succeed in winning over the vast majority of the people to accepting this, we can put a lethal disease into the category of smallpox and largely eliminate it. We will not eliminate it entirely because we do not have a vaccine that is 100% effective yet, but we can reduce it in so many cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_770"> Earlier, I referenced the 2008 Nobel Prize. That same year, the scientists who discovered the link between HIV and AIDS were also awarded the Nobel Prize. As of yet, science has not been able to develop a vaccine for that dreaded disease and it remains a serious health challenge. We can hope that a both a cure and a vaccine can be found in the future as medicine and medical research advance, a lot of it now, thankfully, in our country. Where we can tackle disease and where there are vaccines we should do everything possible to promote them to eradicate disease and illness and ensure, as far as possible, our people are protected. This is why the Labour Party is calling for unanimous support for the HPV vaccination programme, and its extension to boys so the greatest possible number of our population can be protected against HPV.</p>

          <p eId="para_774">Ar dtús báire, ba mhaith liom mo bhród a chur in iúl as an obair atá Fórsaí Cosanta na hÉireann tar éis a dhéanamh thar na blianta leis na Náisiúin Aontaithe agus thar ceann na Náisiún Aontaithe. Is obair ríthábhachtach é agus tá siad tar éis clú agus meas a tharraingt ar Éirinn atá as cuimse don oileán beag sin. Tá sé tábhachtach go leanfaimid leis an obair sin agus go ndéanann muid é sin seachas bogadh i dtreo airm Eorpach ar aon bhealach.</p>
          <p eId="para_775"> The Irish Defence Forces have been involved in UN operations for many generations and their contribution constitutes a very honourable tradition. The reputation and goodwill they have brought to Ireland is well beyond the size of the country. We should never do anything that would endanger this, and I will return to the specifics on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_776"> The report details a number of areas in which Irish troops are still involved in UN missions. UNIFIL in Lebanon is one of these, and it is one with which Ireland has been longest associated. As I said, it stands to our credit and, in particular, I credit those soldiers who have stood as peacekeepers in the face of provocation, often by Israeli soldiers and others in the area. Regrettably, Irish soldiers have died in the course of their duties in the area in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_777"> There are other areas where Irish soldiers are still helping the UN, including the Golan Heights, which the Minister of State has visited. Another area, and a mission about which I have concern, is in Western Sahara. One of the problems I have with the mission there is that it does not have the same human rights role as other UN missions. Only recently, I was contacted about a delegation from one of the committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas visiting Morocco. I stated that my party could not take part in such a delegation if the visit did not have a component of reaching out to talk to representatives from Western Sahara and some type of connection with the Irish soldiers who are still stationed in the area. Regrettably, it could not be accommodated so we will not be taking part in any such delegation at the behest of the Moroccan Government. I do not think we should do so unless an outreach to Western Sahara is a component of it. The President has done this in the past by meeting representatives from Western Sahara.</p>
          <p eId="para_778"> There are other areas about which I have major concerns where the missions are basically sponsored by NATO, such as that in Afghanistan. I do not think Ireland should play any role in it. In terms of the mission in Mali, I have major concerns about the exact nature of the role involved. Some of these missions have some type of UN imprimatur, but it is not in the proud honourable tradition of UN missions we have been involved in, such as that in Lebanon.</p>
          <p eId="para_779"> Other issues, which I do not have time to discuss and on which the Minister of State and I have argued previously, include the move towards sending Irish troops on European missions by means of the European battle groups rather than as part of UN operations. I hope this will not come to be in future.</p>

          <p eId="para_780">I echo the sentiments of the Minister of State to the effect that 2018 is an opportune time to acknowledge the six decades of commitment to Irish Defence Forces participation in UN missions. Our tradition of peacekeeping is rich and proud. Ireland has always been a staunch supporter of the United Nations peacekeeping philosophy and has played a primary and active role in keeping vulnerable people safe around the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_781"> In 2016 alone, our forces were involved with the UNIFIL mission in Lebanon, a United Nations disengagement observer force in the Golan Heights and a UN truce supervision organisation in Syria, Golan and Israel. Our troops also took part in the UN mission for the referendum in Western Sahara, a stabilisation mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo and as observers to the Ivory Coast. We had people in Kosovo, Afghanistan, Bosnia and Mali and, while not UN mandated, we continued to lead in the protection and rescue of migrants in the Mediterranean.</p>
          <p eId="para_782"> We are present at all levels of the Defence Forces, from troops to military advisers, in many of the conflict and post-conflict theatres around the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">Our record is superb and our international reputation is as good as that of any other country. I am proud that we have Defence Forces representing Ireland which promote, protect and deliver peace in some of the most dangerous and vulnerable places on Earth. We are proud of our Defence Forces' relationship with the United Nations for 60 years and I know we will continue to experience that pride for another 60. However, the men and women who serve in our Defence Forces are not fatigue-wearing superheroes. They are ordinary individuals who have families and commitments and many of them are suffering through financial hardship. That needs to be remedied.</p>
          <p eId="para_784"> It would be remiss of me not to state that, along with rightly commending the Defence Forces on their work, commitment and excellence on these missions, the Government needs to improve the conditions of serving personnel. The Government needs to improve their pay and to ensure that the standard of barracks accommodation and quarters is of an acceptable level. The Minister can start this process by enforcing the European Committee of Social Rights ruling which upheld the entitlement of the Irish armed forces to better collective bargaining and negotiating rights. The work of the Defence Forces is unique. Peacekeeping missions abroad are not the average day's work for the vast majority of people but it is the job of these workers. Defence Forces personnel should not have the unique nature of their work used as a reason to not allow them bargaining rights to improve their conditions. We need to review the allowances Defence Forces personnel are paid for their overseas tours of duty. These tours take them away from their families and loved ones for months at a time, at great sacrifice to themselves and their families; they put them in harm's way and in very real and, sometimes, mortal danger and, as the Minister said, they make us very proud of our Defence Forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_785"> Let the 60th anniversary of our work with United Nations be the real starting point for the Government to modernise its approach to our Defence Forces personnel. Let us value them with more than statements and platitudes in the Dáil. After all, such things do not protect our men and women when they are abroad and they do not pay their light and heat when they are at home.</p>

          <from>Deputy Bríd Smith<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T19:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_786">The UN forces are deployed on nine missions in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, the Golan Heights and Lebanon. When travelling abroad, I am often struck by the sense of pride people have in Irish troops and members of the Defence Forces in general. I want to acknowledge the role of many soldiers from Ballyfermot, where I live, in Lebanon. I have often heard them talk warmly about their experiences there. People in the area are very proud of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_787"> It must be acknowledged that many of the missions undertaken by the United Nations in the name of peacekeeping and humanitarianism are often problematic interventions that back-up the imperialist ventures of one or other country. It strikes me as ironic that we send our Defence Forces to places such as Lebanon and the Golan Heights while, at the same time, we, as a Parliament, sit back and allow the Israeli state to continue illegal settlements and annexations. With their malign influence in the region, the Israelis continue to inflame matters and cause instability and conflict. The greatest thing we can do to support our troops who are at the heart of peacekeeping missions is to support the Palestinian people. I would like to put on the record that People Before Profit Alliance will be supporting the Great March of Return in Gaza which commences on 30 March and finishes on 15 April. During this time Palestinians from all regions of the Middle East will go to Gaza with the keys to their homes. I have one such key in my home which was given to me by a Palestinian family I helped. It is a big, rusty key and on it is written "This is the key of my home in Palestine". Many Palestinians had to flee their homes under persecution and they took their keys with them. The keys are symbolic. The march, too, is symbolic but it is also about standing up to forced settlement in the Israeli occupied territories.</p>
          <p eId="para_788"> On the report, our Defence Forces comprise many magnificent men and women who have been doing a great job in the Middle East and in the Mediterranean. We are very proud of them but they are some of the lowest paid public sector workers in this country. During the recession, they were subjected to many cutbacks and many of them are still claiming family income supplement owing to poor pay levels. As set out in the report compiled by the University of Limerick, members of the Air Corps and the Naval Service are subject to the same pay and conditions. This report looked at a sample of 603 officers, non-commissioned officers and lower ranks and it shows that poor pay is the key issue. Poor working conditions and low morale is a brain-drain within our Defence Forces. Soldiers have nicknamed Cathal Brugha Barracks in Rathmines "Hotel Rwanda". However, I welcome the announcement that the barracks is to be refurbished.</p>
          <p eId="para_789"> After ten years of pleading and fighting and more years of families campaigning for increased pay, we must address this issue. We should allow men and women of the Defence Forces to join legitimate, collectively-organised trade unions in which they are given the power, freedom and recognition to bargain with the Government on their terms and pay and conditions. I look forward to the next report having written into it some progress on this issue. The hands of the Defence Forces are tied behind their backs. They cannot fight for these rights or protest but their families, wives and husbands, and retired officers and soldiers are to the fore in saying to the Minister of State and the Department that they deserve trade union recognition and the right to decent pay and conditions. To get those decent pay and conditions they have the right to organise collectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_790"> I welcome the report and I look forward to better news being contained in the next and future reports.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mick Wallace<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T19:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_791">I welcome the opportunity to debate the report on Ireland's Defence Forces' involvement with UN missions. Our peacekeeping forces have a great reputation internationally and we are supportive of their work. However, concern has been growing in recent years regarding how and where they are being deployed. We now often find that the diplomatic alliances and decisions of the Government work against the stated spirit of some of the missions and in some cases contribute to the danger in which our forces sometimes find themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_792"> First, there is the vexed issue of the mission in the Golan Heights, which the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, is at pains to point out is an observer rather than a peacekeeping mission. The rationale behind the original UNDOF deployment to the Golan Heights in 1974 was to maintain the ceasefire between the Israeli and Syrian forces and to supervise the implementation of the disengagement agreement. Today, we are facilitating the ongoing illegal occupation of the Golan Heights by Israel. The Israeli Government recently called for an increase in settlements by 100,000 over the next five years. In September 2016, the Israelis began demolishing houses in the town of Majdal Shams near the Golan Heights for the first time since Israel occupied the Syrian territory following its capture in 1967. Syrian communities in the Golan Heights are also being squeezed by Israel’s expansion of Hermon National Park. Authorities have moved to appropriate 20,000 acres of land used by Majdal Shams and other communities for agriculture and housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_793"> The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia published a report which concluded that Israel is guilty of the international crime of apartheid against the Palestinians and that many of the report’s findings could equally apply to Israeli policy in the Golan Heights and be consistent with apartheid, as Israel has used Jewish settlement to stake a claim to the land and the population of the four Druze villages there live in conditions of relative deprivation. At the same time as we are observing this illegality in action, our forces are in increasing danger from extremist jihadi militias that are being armed by Israel.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">The Tel Aviv newspaper <i>Haaretz</i> reported last month that at least seven, "Sunni rebel organizations in the Syrian Golan are now getting arms and ammunition from Israel, along with money to buy additional armaments". We are overseeing the establishment of another illegal apartheid regime by the Israelis, while they arm anti-Assad forces and ensure that the war in Syria is prolonged for as long as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_795"> There are planned consecutive deployments this year of two Naval Service ships as part of Operation Sophia in the Mediterranean. Last year, a House of Lords inquiry found that Operation Sophia's policy of destroying smugglers' boats has meant that refugees go to sea in unseaworthy vessels, leading to more deaths. On top of this, as part of Operation Sophia the so-called Libyan coast guard is being trained to intercept refugees at sea and bring them back to Libya. We know from multiple reports from aid agencies that these are nothing short of pirates and have been responsible for increasing the number of refugees drowning at sea. The refugees who are intercepted are brought back to the place of violence and human rights violations that they fled, where they face arbitrary detention, torture and rape, often to extract a ransom from them when they are detained in detention centres run by the Government. Last year, Amnesty International called out the EU for its complicity in the evolving Libyan slave trade, where people are being sold at public auctions. That we would take part in and facilitate this criminal enterprise through our role in Operation Sophia is to undermine the reputation of our peacekeeping forces. Nothing but human suffering will come of this mission.</p>
          <p eId="para_796"> If Ireland really cared for the refugees we would stop allowing Shannon to be used as a US military air base from which untold destruction emanates. This is 2018 and after the invasion of Afghanistan, which was followed by the invasion of Iraq 15 years ago last week, it beggars belief that we still see fit to allow any military nation to use an airport in Ireland to cause destruction in another country. We are throwing out a Russian diplomat yet we are still prepared to allow the US military use one of our airports for this. It is too bad.</p>

          <from>Deputy Lisa Chambers<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T19:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_797">I welcome the opportunity to have this debate on the participation of our Defence Forces with the United Nations in 2016. It is important that we regularly have debates in the House on the activities of our Defence Forces, what they are doing and why they are doing it. We have a job to do in terms of keeping our citizens informed of the value of our Defence Forces and the fantastic work they do, as well as showing our appreciation and support for those serving in the Defence Forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_798"> Yesterday, I and a number of other members of the committee on foreign affairs and defence visited the air base in Baldonnel. We met Brigadier General Seán Clancy, the General Officer Commanding of the Irish Air Corps. I commend him for the fantastic work he and the men and women serving with the Air Corps are doing. The base is in tiptop condition. We visited the workshops and saw where the parts are sprayed and where parts of the aircraft are fixed and maintained. We visited the hangars and saw the aircraft. We also visited the stores and looked at the personal protective equipment, PPE. We saw and discussed the systems in place for health and safety. We had PowerPoint presentations and discussions with the safety officers regarding the work they are doing to continue to improve health and safety practices at the Air Corps base in Baldonnel.</p>
          <p eId="para_799"> I am sure this was also true for the others present but I was very impressed by the work they are doing. I was very impressed by the equipment, the state of the base, the practices and procedures in place and the fact that they are continuously checking, assessing and rechecking themselves. There is encouragement of what they refer to as a just culture. Serving members are encouraged to come forward when they identify possible breaches or areas for improvement, and the officers will work with those members to try to make those improvements. We have come a long way when one considers the debates that were held in the House on health and safety legacy issues in the Defence Forces. We are still dealing with them and they have not been dealt with fully, but we have come a long way in terms of making the Air Corps a safer place to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_800"> Our participation in the United Nations represents collective security. We are part of a team and proud to be part of that team. As has been mentioned by other speakers, people in this country are proud of the participation of our soldiers in overseas missions for peacekeeping and peace enforcement. We are very proud of the work our soldiers do and the huge sacrifice they and their families make when working in our Defence Forces and going on overseas missions. It is important to appreciate that when our troops go overseas they are putting their lives at risk. They do so to help some of the most vulnerable people across the globe in the most heinous conditions. They represent our country with distinction every time they do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_801"> The UN force in Lebanon was established in 1978. The Irish Defence Forces served there until 2001, from 2006 to 2007 and again since May 2011. It is a long-standing overseas mission in which our forces have participated with distinction. The Defence Forces also serve in the Golan Heights. I am glad the Minister of State referred to Operation Pontus. While it is not an operation with the UN it is important to note the participation of our Defence Forces in it. Defence Forces personnel also operate in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mali, Western Sahara, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Côte d'Ivoire. We have a permanent mission in New York as well. There are many ongoing missions across the globe which perhaps our citizens are not fully aware of, so Members of this House can do a great deal to highlight the fantastic work of our UN peacekeepers and peace enforcers.</p>
          <p eId="para_802"> Participation in overseas peacekeeping missions is a key element of Ireland's foreign policy and has been for many years. I hope it will always be a key part of our foreign policy. We must meet our international obligations as members of the UN, members of the EU and members of the global community. This is about collective security and working with other like-minded countries and member states to ensure peace and security across the globe. We depend on the ongoing commitment of our Defence Forces personnel to serve to allow our country to contribute to international peace and security. This makes a difference to the lives of many people across the world who are living in extremely hostile and dangerous conditions. We must do all we can to value our personnel. In that regard, as has been said many times in the Chamber, we must examine the pay and conditions in the Defence Forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_803"> It might also be worthwhile, as I mentioned to the Minister at the committee, to consider erecting a monument in the capital to our UN veterans. We should consider what type of monument we could erect, possibly incorporating the blue helmet which is easily identifiable. It would be a monument to those who have served and will serve. It might serve as a focal point for our communities and help us to better inform our citizens about the fantastic work our Defence Forces have done, continue to do and will do in the future.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T19:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_804">I am happy to speak on this motion. I welcome the annual report on the Defence Forces activity with the United Nations. My home town of Clonmel has a long and noble tradition of having Defence Forces members on active duty overseas. It was a tradition we were all sad to see end with the closure of Kickham Barracks some years ago by the Government. That barracks was a prime location in Clonmel and people took pride in driving up to it to see the Tricolour flying and the troops on duty. Indeed, any time they were called on to help with an emergency due to snow, flooding or anything else, not only in Clonmel but throughout the county and into County Waterford, they were always ready, willing and available.</p>
          <p eId="para_805"> Like the Minister, I acknowledge the sheer professionalism and bravery of the Irish Defence Forces personnel who deploy with UN missions. Indeed, Deputy Grealish referred to Jadotville on Leaders' Questions in the House some time ago. I was proud to attend five or six St. Patrick's Day parades and every one of them included retired veterans. They are so proud of their flag and their country. They added panache and military style to those parades in Tipperary and probably throughout the country as well. I specifically salute the work of the Defence Forces personnel who are deployed on humanitarian missions and those involved with the three Naval Service vessels in the Mediterranean.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">Almost every night on our television screens we see the heroic work they do, the desperately dangerous situations for them and the perilous situations that unfortunate refugees find themselves in. These refugees scrape together some savings to pay people, many of whom are gangsters, to get passage on all kinds of unsuitable vessels, and then tragedy occurs. Thankfully, our vessels and personnel were there to rescue some of them. They should be rewarded for that. Every day we see the great work they are doing to assist the Italian authorities with the migrant crisis in their seas.</p>
          <p eId="para_807"> As the Minister of State has previously noted, Irish participation in the humanitarian missions has resulted in the rescue of more than 8,500 migrants, which clearly demonstrates the value of Ireland’s involvement in this important humanitarian response. Unfortunately, there were many more who were not saved, but it was not for the want of heroic effort by our personnel.</p>
          <p eId="para_808"> The Minister of State has also noted that Naval Service crew on the <i>LÉ James Joyce</i> played an outstanding role in saving the lives of so many men, women and children, many of whom were fleeing desperate circumstances. I spoke today about the persecution of Christians and minority Muslim sects in the Middle East, and we have refused to have a proper and meaningful debate in the House over the years. In fairness, tomorrow - Holy Thursday - it is 12 months since the Ceann Comhairle gave Deputies Noel Grealish, Kevin O'Keeffe and me a double Topical Issue debate to discuss the issue. That is all. We are denying it. The Minister was also in the House to listen to that today.</p>
          <p eId="para_809"> Defence Forces personnel have also served as part of a UK-led joint inter-agency task force that is tackling Ebola in west Africa. Ireland is up for any challenge and is ready, willing and able.</p>
          <p eId="para_810"> I was surprised to read that the current contribution to overseas missions is a very significant 585 personnel. This is a huge number. We are punching above our weight, as we always are in Éire. This demonstrates Ireland, relative to its size, is making a very large contribution to the international peacekeeping effort. This should be noted.</p>
          <p eId="para_811"> It is my concern, and hope, that we can maintain that noble tradition without risk to the integrity of our neutrality and that we will not end up being drawn into armed deployment either through the back door or the front door of a broader EU policy of increasing militarisation. We must guard against that outcome. I am aware the Minister of State appreciates this, but then we see our Taoiseach acting as Leo the lion with the French Prime Minister. He had a rush of blood to join up with his friends, counterparts and Germans to blame the Russians without any investigation or knowledge or proof of anyone being tried. It was a case of being guilty before anything is proved. We had a premise of being innocent until proven guilty. This is also damaging to the morale. I am aware that the Minister of State has visited the personnel during St. Patrick's Day. I wish the forces a safe Easter - I cannot say enjoyable - away from their loved ones. I salute them and their families. I hope they will have a peaceful Easter, although not at home with their families. Go n-éirí an t-ádh leo go léir.</p>

          <p eId="para_816">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_817">That Dáil Éireann:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_818">(1) notes the agreed Report of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government under Standing Order 114 on the Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the quality of water intended for human consumption - COM (2017) 753, which was laid before Dáil Éireann on 27th March, 2018, in accordance with Standing Order 114(3)(<i>b</i>);</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_819">(2) having regard to the aforementioned Report, and in exercise of its functions under section 7(3) of the European Union Act 2009, is of the opinion that the Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the quality of water intended for human consumption - COM (2017) 753 does not comply with the principle of subsidiarity for the reasons set out in section 4 of the Report; and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_820">(3) notes that, pursuant to Standing Order 114(4), a copy of this Resolution together with the reasoned opinion and the aforementioned Report shall be sent to the Presidents of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">As Chair of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government, which is a very cohesive and hard-working committee, I am pleased on its behalf to move the motion for a reasoned opinion on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the quality of water intended for human consumption. Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union, introduced by the Lisbon treaty, provides for national parliaments to ensure that draft EU legislation complies with the principle of subsidiarity. The protocol on the application of the principles of proportionality and subsidiarity annexed to the treaties lays down the procedure by which national parliaments can fulfil their responsibility of ensuring that the EU institutions respect the principle of subsidiarity and gives national parliaments a formal and treaty based role in the EU’s legislative procedure. Under its provisions, national parliaments have a right to object to EU draft laws in the form of a reasoned opinion. This power must be used by national parliaments within eight weeks of the publication of proposed new EU legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_822"> Subsidiarity is the principle which regulates the exercise of EU powers. It determines whether the EU can intervene or should let member states take action. It ensures that powers are exercised at the appropriate level. The subsidiarity principle acts as both a check on the need to take action at union level and ensures that, where it is needed, effective action is taken at the EU level. Judgments on subsidiarity compliance essentially require political rather than legal judgment. Each sectoral committee is delegated with the power to conduct subsidiarity checks on behalf of both Houses on all draft legislative Acts within their remit. If the committee considers that there is a subsidiarity infringement and agrees that a reasoned opinion should be prepared, it adopts a report containing a reasoned opinion and the Chairman tables a motion in the House. I am therefore introducing this reasoned opinion as Chair of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_823"> On 1 February 2018, the European Commission published a proposal for a recast of the current drinking water directive, the ultimate purpose of which is to ensure the provision of high-quality drinking water in light of the latest scientific advice and to help customers access this water and to find reliable information about its supply. The proposal is a response to the successful European citizens' initiative, Right2Water, which received the support of 1.6 million Europeans. The initiative was submitted to the Commission in December 2013 and urged in particular that EU institutions and member states be obliged to ensure that all inhabitants enjoy the right to water and sanitation and that the EU increase its efforts to achieve universal access to water and sanitation.</p>
          <p eId="para_824"> The revision is also part of the plan to transition to a circular economy and to help reduce bottled water consumption. The committee first considered this proposal on 8 March and agreed that the proposal required further scrutiny. The committee considered the proposal for a second time on 21 March when it held a very productive meeting with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Federation of Group Water Schemes and Irish Water. Each of the witnesses before the committee raised valid concerns regarding the proposal. The committee supports the overarching goal of the proposal, especially the aim of improving standards of drinking water and improving the monitoring systems for the quality of drinking water.</p>
          <p eId="para_825"> The committee, however, has had specific regard to the treaty provisions and is of the opinion that the proposal does not comply with the principle of subsidiarity, and I shall now outline the reasons. The committee believes that the proposal unnecessarily limits the provision for national decision-making. Consequently, the scope for member states to choose how to implement the proposal’s objectives at national level and in accordance with established national systems is constrained. The committee believes that the actions in this proposal do not sufficiently restrict themselves to those necessary to fulfil its stated objectives and, therefore, are not proportionate to the objectives of this proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">The committee does not see the necessity for diverging from the recommendations of the World Health Organization in regard to the parameters for monitoring the quality of water for human consumption. The committee is further of the opinion that this proposal does not adequately take into account local and regional considerations and has the potential to have far-reaching implications for well-established national arrangements in place in Ireland. The committee is satisfied that the above points, taken together, clearly demonstrate that the proposal does not comply with the principle of subsidiarity. The committee, pursuant to Standing Orders, recommends the reasoned opinion contained in section 4 above, for agreement. If this draft reasoned opinion is agreed by the Dáil, it will constitute the House’s formal response under the Lisbon treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_827"> I thank the committee for its robust questioning, the detailed meetings we had with the relevant stakeholders and the speedy way in which it dealt with the issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_828">I join with Deputy Bailey, the Chairman of the relevant committee, in offering and committing our party's support for the committee's contention, and I hope and expect that others will do likewise. The drinking water quality directives have not been updated in 20 years and we acknowledge the need for an update to ensure the quality of our water is in line with relevant standards across the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_829"> At last week's meeting, Irish Water, the Department and the association of group and private schemes informed us that the directive went way beyond the recommendations of the WHO and this sounded alarm bells for everybody, despite the Government's policy commitment and the capital programme of Irish Water to repair leaks and to improve the quality and delivery of water to various parts of the country, particularly Dublin, in view of what has happened in recent months. Any expectation over and beyond what is reasonable places a huge strain on Irish Water and the State in terms of their responsibility to group and private water schemes and would render Irish Water unable to adhere to its capital programme to maintain and upgrade its existing systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_830"> I understand that four countries out of six have voiced similar concerns to our own. Members of the committee are of the view that subsidiarity means that, if 16 nations raise questions, a directive has to be redrawn and that approach would receive unanimous support from my party. I urge the Minister to converse with his counterparts across the EU to ensure other states agree with us that the directive goes far beyond the requirements for safe water delivery, despite the fact it is well meaning. The quality has improved over the past 20 years and we accept that it has to improve more. We would support the allocation of funding to do it but it has to be done within the context of existing commitments to repair and maintain the system. It has to be borne in mind that there has only been adequate investment in the past ten or 12 years. I ask for the Dáil to ensure the right action is taken on this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_831">I add my support to that of committee colleagues, Deputies Maria Bailey and Barry Cowen, in respect of this issue. For those Members who were not part of the committee's deliberations, it is important to be very clear about the purpose of the revised directive. It is about improving the quality of drinking water and increasing access to good-quality drinking water in member states where that is a problem. We all share that objective, as do all the organisations which presented to the committee, including the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, but there were a number of concerns which were shared unanimously by the organisations in question. The fact that the European Commission has chosen to go beyond the recommendations of the World Health Organization is very significant and while some people might be suspicious or sceptical of Irish Water or the Government not wanting to go beyond WHO recommendations, the fact the EPA also voiced concerns demonstrates that all of them had bona fide reasons for expressing their difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_832"> Irish Water made very clear that, on the basis of the current draft, the capital expenditure required to meet the suggestions of the Commission would be between €200 million and €300 million, with an extra €100 million in annual operational expenditure. These are very significant sums of money and, when all the key organisations tell the committee they are not convinced of the merits of the details of the directive, it would be remiss of us not to give a reasoned opinion in response.</p>
          <p eId="para_833"> It was also significant that the National Federation of Group Water Schemes presented to the committee and expressed significant concerns about how it would cope with the additional requirements for upgrading treatment and drinking water facilities. It was not that it did not want to provide its members with the best quality drinking water but it had genuine concerns about the cost implications and made a compelling case for more thought on the issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_834"> I thank the Labour Party for requesting a debate on this matter. The role of Oireachtas committees in scrutinising draft EU directives is very significant but it does not get a lot of attention. Given the fact that this is about something that goes into every household in the country, and has such a potentially large cost, it was right to have some debate on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_835"> This is part of the Lisbon treaty changes to member state scrutiny. I was a very strong critic of that treaty and I do not think these measures are strong enough but they are there and we should use them when they come up. If one third of member states submit a reasoned opinion, the Commission is forced to review its draft, although it is not forced to take it off the table. If one third of member states shared our concern, it would send a very important signal to the Commission at this early stage. If a majority of member state parliaments and upper houses, if they have them, submit a reasoned opinion the Commission would have to take it off the table and start again. My understanding is that the water section of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government believes that the fact we have done this will strengthen its position in its negotiations with the European Commission so it is a very worthwhile thing to have done. On the basis that it was a unanimous decision of the committee, I urge all Deputies to support it.</p>
          <p eId="para_836"> I thank the committee clerk, Ms Fiona Cashin, and Padraig Grant, who drafted the report. They deserve the thanks of the committee and the House for producing this report in an incredibly short period of time - from last week to yesterday when we agreed it. I also thank the Chair, Deputy Bailey, for chairing the session very well and allowing us to come to this conclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">This is a really important motion and I hope everybody will support it. We have certainly given a commitment in the committee to continue to track it, irrespective of what happens with the recent opinions and the yellow or orange card. It is of great significance to the Oireachtas, water services delivery and citizens across the State.</p>

          <p eId="para_838">As Deputies will be aware, it was the intention on the Order of Business yesterday to have this process seen through without debate, but the Labour Party sought a debate on it. Normally, when somebody seeks a debate, it is because he or she has an issue and wants to raise certain concerns, but that is not the case on this occasion. On the Order of Business yesterday there was no report available to us at the time. We were asked to agree to a proposal without any visibility of it and, because of the nature of this Dáil, the Labour Party is not represented on the committee. The Minister who was present in the Chamber was not in a position to throw any further light on it because he had not seen the final report either. Deputy Brendan Howlin said that, in the circumstances, the safe thing to do, to allow agreement on the Order of Business for today, was to allow time for debate on the matter, if necessary. It was my intention to come into the House today and say at the outset that we had seen it, did not have an issue with it and that there is no need for a debate. Having seen the report from the committee, we are happy for the motion to proceed without major concerns. On behalf of the Labour Party, I congratulate the Chairman and the two members of the committee who spoke, who have studied the matter and done the work required to bring us to this point. I understand the process, having been on previous committees, in terms of what is to be done in respect of subsidiarity. The Labour Party is happy with the opinion of the committee which was outlined in detail by its Chairman, Deputy Maria Bailey, and we have no concerns. We are, therefore, happy to support the motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_841">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_842">In page 5, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_843">“ “Act of 1991” means the Child Care Act 1991;”.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">Amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, are technical drafting amendments which are required as a result of amendment No. 14 which seeks to amend the Child Care Act 1991 to enable the regulation of school-age childcare services. As a result of amendment No. 14, there will be more than one reference in the Bill to the Child Care Act 1991. Therefore, amendments Nos. 1 and 2 are needed to the interpretations in section 1 of the Bill. Amendment No. 3 is required to ensure clarity on the meaning of "school". The amendment specifies that, for the purposes of the Bill, "school" has the same meaning as it has in the Education Act 1998. This is of particular relevance in the context of amendment No. 14, which amends the definition of school-age service in the Child Care Act 1991 in order that it refers to "school" rather than "a recognised school". The Education Act 1998 states "school" includes both primary education and post-primary education. It is broader than the term "recognised school" as it includes schools which do not receive State funding. This is important as it is intended that the affordable childcare scheme should be available on the same equitable basis to school-age children in registered childcare settings, regardless of whether they attend a recognised school. Equally, it is not intended that certain school-age childcare services will be exempt from registration simply because they are providing services for children enrolled in a school that is not a recognised school, as this would not be in the best interests of children.</p>
          <p eId="para_845"> Amendment No. 14 provides for a number of related amendments to the Child Care Act 1991. The amendments result from my decision to introduce the regulation of school-age childcare in advance of commencing the affordable childcare scheme. This will allow school-age childcare providers to take part in the affordable childcare scheme while providing for quality assurance of all providers who take part in the scheme. The amendments address a small number of anomalies in the 1991 Act in respect of school-age childcare. With the regulation of school-age childcare to be introduced shortly, several amendments are required to ensure the legislation underpinning the new regulations will be clear and robust. The amendments will provide for three sets of changes to section 58 of the Child Care Act 1991. </p>
          <p eId="para_846"> First, the current definition of "school-age service" in section 58 of the 1991 Act refers to children enrolled in a primary school, whereas the affordable childcare scheme will provide subsidies for children up to the age of 15 years. Accordingly, the amendments extend the definition to refer to both primary and post-primary education and include services provided for children up to the age of 15 years. The amendment also broadens the scope of regulation and funding of school-age childcare to services that cater for children under 15 years who are enrolled in any school providing primary or post-primary education, not just recognised schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_847"> Second, the amendments clarify the overarching purpose of school-age childcare and, while quality school-age childcare should provide a range of activities that are developmental, educational and recreational, their primary purpose is to care for children where their parents are unavailable. It is not and never was intended that the definition should include either school completion services or services that solely provide activities related to religious teaching such as Sunday schools. Accordingly, it is proposed to amend the definition of school-age service in section 58(<i>a</i>) of the 1991 Act to explicitly specify the primary purpose of school-age services and exclude services solely focused on religious teaching.</p>
          <p eId="para_848"> Third, amendments are needed to the exemptions from the regulation set out in section 58(<i>c</i>) of the 1991 Act. Section 58(<i>c</i>) exempts childminders from registration if they care for three or fewer children. This provision is interpreted by Tusla as referring to preschool children only.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">Once registration of school-age services commences, it will mean that all childminders caring for more than three children, whether preschool or school age, will be required to register. Unless section 58L, as amended, is amended the regulation of school-age childcare will bring a large number of childminders within the scope of regulation, including, for example, a childminder who cares for three preschool children and just one school-age child. While it is my intention to move progressively towards the wider regulation of childminding, we are still at an early stage in this process. It is not my intention, in bringing school-age childcare into the scope of regulation, to also require the regulation of childminders. Indeed, I am conscious that there may be negative, unintended consequences if we were to require the regulation of childminders before strong supports and a proper pathway have been put in place. That said, the exemption must specify a limit in terms of the number of children. Childminders caring for a large number of school-age children are, in effect, school-age services, even if operating within a childminder's home. I therefore propose to amend the 1991 Act so that it exempts childminders who care for no more than six children at any one time, of which no more than three can be preschool children. Childminders who care for seven or more children of any age, or those who care for four or more preschool children, will then be required to register.</p>
          <p eId="para_850"> In the medium term I plan to move progressively towards the wider regulation of childminding, and I will be developing supports for this purpose, having regard to the expert group report on childminding that was submitted to me in January. In addition, the amendment I am proposing today will allow registered childminders to remain registered in situations where a change in the number of children they care for or the transition of one of more children from preschool to school would suddenly and arbitrarily exclude them from registration. If we fail to provide for this amendment anomalies may arise where childminders, through no fault of their own, finds themselves deregistered. It could happen, for example, if a child leaves a childminder, causing the number of children to fall from seven to six. In such a case, as registration is a requirement for participation in the affordable childcare scheme, the loss of registration would cause the ending of subsidies under the scheme for all children in the care of that childminder. We do not want that to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_851"> The amendments I am proposing to section 58L, as amended, of the 1991 Act therefore allow childminders who have been continuously registered for at least a year to remain registered, even if they no longer meet the minimum requirements in terms of numbers of children, provided they wish to remain registered and that they continue to meet regulatory requirements.</p>

          <p eId="para_858">I move amendment No. 4:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_859">In page 6, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_860">“(2) In this Act any reference to a partner of a person shall apply only if the person is a member of a couple.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">Amendments Nos. 4 and 11 respond to a concern raised by Deputy Rabbitte on Committee Stage on provisions for lone parents. Amendment No. 4 provides clarity throughout the Bill that any reference to a partner in the Bill does not apply if the applicant is a lone parent. While it was always the intention that one-parent families would benefit fully from the scheme - and there is no flaw in the Bill - this amendment removes any risk of misinterpretation. The amendment therefore provides assurance that one-parent families are recognised and reflected in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_862"> Amendment No. 11 provides for up to 40 hours of financial support each week, at a maximum, to be paid on a temporary basis during transitions into or between periods of work and study. This amendment addresses the scenario to which Deputy Rabbitte referred on Committee Stage of a lone parent who is temporarily out of work following the completion of a training course and prior to commencing employment. Such a person may be out of work for only a short period of time. However, a temporary drop in child care support from 40 to 15 hours per week could disrupt the stability of child care arrangements, which might make it harder for the lone parent to return quickly to the labour market, as the Deputy has ably argued. In such a case, a strict application of the link between hours of subsidy and participation in work or study could potentially have negative effects on both child outcomes and labour market participation. The amendment I am proposing would avoid this consequence by allowing for the continuation of the maximum hours of subsidy on a temporary basis. </p>
          <p eId="para_863"> The amendment refers to the commencement, interruption or cessation of work or study. Regarding commencement, the amendment would, for example, allow the maximum hours of child care subsidy to be awarded to a parent who had been offered a job or a place on an education or training course and who wanted to help his or her child to settle into a new child care setting in advance of commencing the new job or the new education or training course. In relation to interruption, the amendment would allow maximum hours to continue, and a child to continue in his or her child care setting, for a limited period of time if a parent has to step back from his or her work or study temporarily. Regarding cessation, this amendment would allow the maximum hours of subsidy to continue after completion of an education or training course or the ending of a period of employment to provide stability in child care arrangements for a person who takes up another employment within a short period of time. This approach will allow the scheme to support parents during all critical bridging periods, when they are entering or moving between employment or educational opportunities, including the particular scenario outlined by Deputy Rabbitte on Committee Stage. </p>
          <p eId="para_864"> I would like to emphasise that, as the proposed amendment would allow enhanced hours subsidies while parents are temporarily transitioning into or between different jobs or education and training courses, it should not undermine the basic labour market incentives that are built into the scheme. Rather, it should in fact further reinforce and bolster them. More broadly, I can reassure Deputies that the affordable childcare scheme will provide a high level of support for one-parent families. First, the scheme will be open to separated parents to make separate, parallel applications for support. Second, because the average income level in one-parent families is lower than in two-parent families, one-parent families will on average be awarded higher subsidy rates under the scheme. Third, while the maximum hours of subsidy each week will only be awarded to a one-parent family if the parent is taking part in work or study or transitioning into or between periods of work or study, maximum hours will only be awarded to a two-parent family if both parents are taking part in work or study. One-parent families will therefore not be placed at any disadvantage. </p>
          <p eId="para_865"> I would like to thank Deputy Rabbitte for raising this important issue. By taking it on board via the present proposed amendment I am confident that we are strengthening the affordable childcare scheme and its supporting legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_866">I thank the Minister for taking on board what was discussed on Committee Stage. I also thank my colleagues from Sinn Féin who supported the discussion throughout Committee Stage. The Minister has understood where I was coming from on this issue, as has the Department. A large number of representations were made by lone parent families to me regarding that particular amendment. It is greatly appreciated. The Minister has addressed us in great depth tonight as to how the amendment will support the transition periods and bridge the gap between education or training and re-entry into the workforce. In a two-parent family there is always one parent who can provide support, but in a lone parent family one parent has to do 100% of everything all of the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">It would be regressive to think that we had educated or retrained people, given them the second chance or even got them back into the workforce, when all of a sudden on finishing their training they would be back to 15 hours, without flexibility. As such, I welcome this and I will totally support it. Again I thank the Minister, her Department and my colleagues for getting this over the line. I was very passionate about it. I felt very strongly about bridging the gap and looking at this in a timely manner and supporting families that really need it. I welcome this.</p>

          <p eId="para_868">Again, I thank Deputy Rabbitte for raising it and my Sinn Féin colleagues for supporting it. I know that everyone brought that interest and concern for lone parents to this discussion. There were areas where the Bill could be improved on in that regard, and that is what this amendment addresses "to be sure to be sure", to bridge the gap, as Deputy Rabbitte said. It is a great privilege to be able to ensure that the law does that. As Deputy Rabbitte mentioned, I acknowledge the hard work of my officials in wanting to find the most creative and effective ways to ensure that the law, particularly through these amendments, will respond to the concerns of lone parents. That is, of course, such a huge part of the Bill, certainly where my own vision is concerned. In putting in place an affordable child care scheme, I am keen to ensure that it is as affordable as possible for people from different income categories as well as being there to support parenting of different forms.</p>

          <p eId="para_869">I move amendment No. 5:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_870">In page 7, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_871">“(5) The scheme shall operate on a 52 week basis, such that listed weekly subsidies shall reflect the value of one fifty-second of the overall annual subsidy that is payable.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">The Minister is nodding and knows exactly where I am coming from on this. As opposed to the current 48-week outline, the subsidy would be outlined on a 52-week basis. This issue was brought to my attention by several child care providers. They identified it in the Bill and requested that, working with the Minister's Department, we amend the Bill to acknowledge the 52 weeks.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KatherineZappone" eId="spk_343" as="#Minister_for_Children_and_Youth_Affairs">
          <from>Deputy Katherine Zappone<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_873">Again I appreciate the concerns that are expressed by Deputy Rabbitte. It is really important that we have the opportunity to clarify this. The Bill, as published, sets no limit to the number of weeks of child care support per year. I can assure Deputies that regulations to be made under the Bill will provide for payment of child care support for up to 52 weeks per year.</p>
          <p eId="para_874"> The policy paper published in October 2016 proposed limiting subsidies under the scheme to 48 weeks per year. However, on foot of feedback received during consultation on the policy paper, the policy position was reviewed. The heads of Bill and general scheme published in January 2017 subsequently proposed paying subsidies up to 52 weeks per year. That remains Government policy. I, therefore, do not believe there is a need for an amendment that states the scheme will operate on a 52-week basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_875"> Furthermore, it would not be appropriate for weekly subsidies simply to be determined by dividing the level of annual subsidy by 52, for two reasons. Firstly, a child who is at school or taking part in the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme may need more hours of child care each week during holiday periods than during term time. To ensure that subsidies during holiday periods are adequate, it will be important that the level of weekly subsidy differs between holiday periods and term times. Secondly, a child care provider may choose to offer child care only during term time periods, and some parents may only want child care during term times. As such, dividing annual subsidies into 52 parts and paying one part each week, which is outlined in the Deputy's amendment, would unfairly limit the amount of subsidy paid in such cases. For these reasons, I am not accepting the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_876">In the amendment I sought reassurance for child care providers. While I accept what the Minister said, that it was part of the policy review, they seek reassurance that they have guaranteed income for 52 weeks. In other words, any provider that has signed up to the various subsidies will have that income to count on. When they are preparing their budget, it will not vary much. That is the concern of the child care providers, which I am trying to echo on their behalf. We can talk about flexibility within the scope of the Bill, but the payment is key. Pobal makes the payments on a week-by-week basis. In the beginning, the affordable child care scheme was administered on the basis of half days, partial days, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_877"> While I accept what the Minister said, I am still not convinced that the 52 weeks are captured in this provision. While there is flexibility, it is not borne out, to be quite honest. I am trying to ensure that a child care provider can prepare its budgets week in, week out, and can depend on income from Pobal for 52 weeks.</p>

          <p eId="para_878">I understand exactly what Deputy Rabbitte is raising and I thank her for doing that on behalf of the providers. I can say to her and to the providers that the Bill does not set a limit to the number of weeks of child care support. The regulations that will be made under the Bill will provide for payment of child care support for up to 52 weeks per year. Deputy Rabbitte's amendment seeks to ensure that the payment operates on a 52 week basis. It can do so, if that is what is desirable for an individual provider and family. However, if it is not desirable in the individual context, it can be done in another way, rather than nailing down a 52 week basis for payments. If we did that in the Bill, there would be unintended consequences. Instead, the Bill does not limit the number of weeks of child care support per year, and the regulations will provide that payment can be made up to 52 weeks per year.</p>

          <p eId="para_879">I thank the Minister for clarifying that issue for me. If a child care provider wishes to have payment made 52 weeks per year, it can have this. However, if there is another way of doing business, which will be best advised by Pobal, which is a part of that conversation, that is its choice. There is the option for payments to be made over a 52 week period if the provider so desires. Am I hearing the Minister correctly?</p>

          <p eId="para_889">I move amendment No. 7:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_890">In page 10, line 20, to delete "section," and substitute "section.".</p>
          <p eId="para_891">Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 follow legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General. They relate to an amendment passed on Committee Stage that introduced an explicit reference to the participation of registered childminders in the affordable childcare scheme in section 8 of the Bill. The intention of the Committee Stage amendment to section 8, to allow for the participation of registered childminders, is one that I fully endorse. I assure Deputies that registered childminders will be part of the affordable child care scheme. The reason I argued against the amendment on Committee Stage was that the Bill already provided for the participation of registered childminders.</p>
          <p eId="para_892"> Section 1 of the Bill defines "childcare services provider". This definition encompasses any provider who is on the register of providers under section 58(c) of the Child Care Act 1991, which is the register maintained by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_893"> Section 8 requires that, in order to be part of the scheme, a child care services provider must sign a contract with the Minister. Therefore, any childminder who is registered with Tusla and has signed a contract with the Minister may take part in the scheme. I understand the intention of the Committee Stage amendment was to make the inclusion of registered childminders more explicit, but I have received legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General that any such amendment may reduce the clarity of the Bill or even undermine the inclusion of childminders.</p>
          <p eId="para_894"> First, as worded, section 8(2)(i) which contains the amendment made on Committee Stage describes what may be included within a contract rather than determining who is eligible to sign a contract. Second, none of the terms "Tusla-registered", "centre-based" or "childminding" is defined in statute and, as such, they have no legal status. Third, the Parliamentary Counsel has explored the possibility of changing the position of the clause and the formulation of words. However, the Parliamentary Counsel has advised that any statement in section 8 that specifies the inclusion of childminders within the term "childcare services provider" risks implying that references to "childcare services provider" in other parts of the Bill where there is no explicit reference to childminders may be interpreted not to include childminders. I acknowledge that the intention of Deputies Kathleen Funchion and Denise Mitchell in introducing the amendment on Committee Stage was to ensure registered childminders could be part of the scheme. I fully support them in that intention. For that reason, I must take care to avoid language in the Bill that unintentionally creates any uncertainty about whether registered childminders can be part of the scheme. I am sure the Deputies will share my concern in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_895"> Following on from the advice of the Parliamentary Counsel, the best way to ensure the inclusion of registered childminders is to define child care services providers in section 1 of the Bill in such a way that the definition includes registered childminders. That has already been done. At the same time, I stress that I will ensure public communications on the affordable child care scheme are clear on the fact that the scheme does include registered childminders. That is really important. I fully support the intention of Deputies Kathleen Funchion and Denise Mitchell and the other committee members who voted in favour of their amendment. However, in the light of the legal advice, I propose the deletion of section 8(2)(i).</p>

          <p eId="para_901">This is a minor technical drafting amendment. Section 9 specifies the process by which parents may apply for financial support under the scheme and the details they must provide. One such detail is the name and address of the parent's employer or education and training provider, as appropriate. In order to allow verification of this information, the Bill requires applicants to authorise the scheme administrator to contact their employers or course providers to confirm the information provided on the application form. However, the word "education" which is included in the reference to an employer or education and training provider in section 10 and section 9(3) is accidentally omitted from section 9(4). The amendment simply rectifies that omission to ensure consistency throughout the Bill.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_909">"(3) In specifying the terms and conditions of an agreement under this section, the Minister and the statutory body concerned shall have regard to the objective of the provision of stability for children attending childcare services.".</p>
          <p eId="para_910">Amendment No. 13 addresses concerns raised by Deputies Kathleen Funchion, Denise Mitchell and Anne Rabbitte during Committee Stage about the operation of section 14 in supporting vulnerable children and their families. The Deputies pointed to the importance of stability in child care arrangements, for vulnerable children in particular, and noted the risk that child care support for these children could be withdrawn too suddenly or at a time that impacted negatively on a child. I agree with them that this would not be in the best interest of the children.</p>
          <p eId="para_911"> As highlighted on Committee Stage, the intention underlying the Bill is that section 14 agreements will allow for a planned and graduated withdrawal of support. Nonetheless, given the importance of the issue, I am proposing the amendment to ensure the agreements that underpin section 14 referrals will attach significant weight to the need for children, especially vulnerable children, to have stability in their child care arrangements. The intention of the amendment is not to prolong the section 14 arrangements unduly where the original purpose of the referral has already been achieved but rather to enable and ensure a planned and reasonable withdrawal of section 14 support, having regard to the best interest of the child. For example, the amendment might result in a Minister and the relevant statutory body agreeing not to end section 14 support until the end of a term. The amendment will not, therefore, alter the underlying policy intention but rather copperfasten it.</p>
          <p eId="para_912"> I thank Deputies Kathleen Funchion, Denise Mitchell and Anne Rabbitte for raising this very important issue.</p>

We were particularly pleased to see a clear reference to stability for children attending child care services. We did not want supports to end suddenly down the road.

          <p eId="para_915">I also welcome the amendment. While amendment No. 12 was ruled out of order, I agree with what I see in amendment No. 13. There was a great deal of debate on this on Committee Stage. Deputy Mitchell used the serious word "stability" which is what I was looking for when we sat on Committee Stage. I wanted to ensure that children could complete their term time. I spoke about Halloween, Christmas and Easter and the need for children to feel they reached a conclusion and were the same as everyone else if situations changed and they had to leave a service where the section 14 time was up. In child care settings, it is all about the annual celebrations during term time whether that is Halloween preparations for witches, Christmas preparations for Santa or Easter preparations for the Easter bunny. Child care providers create that setting so well and children participate in it. Every child needs to feel included because that is what providers work for through the Síolta and Aistear schemes. It is all about completing the programme of work. They always finish it with a bang or a party so that children feel into it. That is what I wanted to express in my contribution on Committee Stage. I felt very passionate about children getting the chance, regardless of circumstance, to complete. I thank the Minister of State for acknowledging it and including it. There was a robust debate on Committee Stage. I thank the Minister's colleagues in the Department who came back with this amendment. It is welcome from a child's perspective and a useful one to make.</p>

          <p eId="para_944"> Amendment No. 15 provides for a review of the scheme 12 months after the first payment of financial support under the scheme. The amendment is intended to address the issue raised by Deputies Funchion and Mitchell on Committee Stage of the importance of assessing the operation of the scheme, in particular section 13, at an early stage to allow any necessary policy adjustment to be carried out promptly. The amendment previously proposed by the Deputies focused on section 13 and its associated regulations in recognition of the fact that the section provides for the scheme's rules on income thresholds, subsidy rates, maximum hours of subsidy and definitions of "work" and "study". While I agree with the Deputies that section 13 is of central importance, it cannot be reviewed in isolation from other sections. For example, section 13 provides for a maximum income threshold to be prescribed for receipt of income-related financial support. However, section 10 determines what is assessable income. As such, section 13 cannot be reviewed in isolation from section 10. Therefore, the amendment I propose requires a review of the whole scheme. For such a review to be meaningful, however, it is essential that the scheme would have been operational for a certain minimum duration to ensure that sufficient data are available to inform the review process. For that reason, amendment No. 15 stipulates that the review shall begin 12 months after financial support payments start. This will allow for data to be available which cover a full annual cycle of income assessments, subsidy warrants and financial support payments.</p>

We appreciate that, as we appreciate Deputy Rabbitte's support on Committee Stage. Many schemes could learn from this and other committees could learn that including provision for a review makes sense. The six-month requirement was perhaps a little short and 12 months makes a great deal more sense in order to have the proper data available. We are very glad this has been included. It really is a progressive step. We are often talking here about issues where schemes were not reviewed and did not operate very well. If there is a review after 12 months, we will at least be able to see what is and what is not working. We welcome the amendment.</p>

The amendment may seem like a small one but, going forward, it will make a huge difference. Previously, the Bill provided that Tusla could authorise additional supports if a child was not receiving adequate care and protection. People in the sector, including me, were worried that the wording implied that there needed to be some form of parental failure before protection would be implemented. The new wording proposed is much more positive. It encourages Tusla to promote the welfare of children who are in need of additional care or protection. It is much more wide-ranging and represents a more proactive approach. As such, it is good to see it included.</p>

          <p eId="para_960">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_961">I am pleased to bring the Industrial Development (Amendment) Bill 2018 before the Dáil. This short, but important Bill addresses the implications of a 2015 Supreme Court judgment and will ensure that IDA Ireland can continue to purchase property for the purposes of industrial development. This is essential if the agency is to have the continued capacity to provide the property solutions to companies that will help attract future investments to Ireland, particularly to the regions, and therefore generate jobs throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_962"> I intend to begin by explaining how the need for this Bill has arisen, then describe its provisions in more detail, and finally provide further context as to why the legislative amendments are important to IDA Ireland's ongoing work to increase foreign direct investment in Ireland. Let me start by explaining the genesis of the Bill. In 2011, IDA Ireland sought to acquire land in County Kildare, by compulsory purchase, for industrial development purposes. It is important to note that this was the first and only time IDA Ireland had ever sought to purchase property compulsorily and, in doing so, the agency relied on the existing compulsory purchase powers it had been furnished with in legislation. The landowner concerned, however, successfully challenged the compulsory purchase order by way of judicial review.</p>
          <p eId="para_963"> There were two key findings in the Supreme Court judgment. First, the Supreme Court determined that the agency had acted <i>ultra vires</i> because the legislative provision on which it relied in this instance, namely, section 16 of the 1986 Industrial Development Act, does not empower IDA Ireland to acquire property for future, as opposed to immediate, use. The court also set aside the compulsory order because IDA Ireland did not, as per the terms of that legislative provision, identify a specific company for which the property was being acquired. The court made clear that both of those determinations would apply equally to instances where property was being acquired by agreement. While the facts of the case concerned a compulsory acquisition, the court's judgment also, therefore, had implications for IDA Ireland's purchasing-by-agreement powers. Second, the court determined that current legislation does not provide for an independent body, such as An Bord Pleanála, either to affirm any proposed compulsory purchase order or to adjudicate on any objections to such an order. It followed from the judgment, therefore, that it is necessary that an appropriate independent body be legislatively designated to fulfil that particular role.</p>
          <p eId="para_964"> The Industrial Development (Amendment) Bill 2018 that I present to the House addresses each of those issues in full, as I will shortly explain in more detail. I want to be clear as well, before moving on, that while this Bill addresses those issues raised by the court, it does not equip IDA Ireland with strengthened powers. The aim is simply to put in place an updated and modernised process that incorporates a full role for An Bord Pleanála in compulsory acquisitions so that IDA Ireland retains its current industrial development property purchasing powers. This Bill's provisions do not, therefore, represent a policy shift in terms of IDA Ireland's approach to purchasing property.</p>
          <p eId="para_965"> I will now give an overview of the Bill to the House, bearing in mind that I have already explained that this is a relatively short and technical Bill. First, the Bill ensures that IDA Ireland will continue to have the capacity to acquire property compulsorily on an exceptional basis in very limited circumstances and subject to strict requirements. Any such compulsory purchase will be subject to far more stringent requirements than those for standard purchase by agreement, namely, that it must be for immediate industrial development use and that IDA Ireland will need to have a specific client in mind to use the property.</p>
          <p eId="para_966"> As per the terms of the Supreme Court judgment, provision has been also made in the Bill for an independent body, which is An Bord Pleanála, to undertake a full adjudicatory role in the process, a role that is very much aligned to its existing role in compulsory purchases carried out by other State bodies. Second, the draft bill will ensure that IDA Ireland can continue purchasing property by agreement, even when it is for future use and no specific company has been identified as the beneficiary of that acquisition. </p>
          <p eId="para_967"> I will now describe how these amendments will function in more detail. In summary terms, the Bill amends section 16 and the Second Schedule to the 1986 Industrial Development Act and also applies certain provisions of the Housing Act 1966 in relation to compulsory purchases, and certain provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000 in respect of the role of An Bord Pleanála. Sections 3 and 4 of the Bill amend section 16 of the Industrial Development Act 1986 and make it very clear, for the avoidance of doubt, that IDA Ireland can continue to acquire property by agreement, that is, not compulsorily, in circumstances where the property is not for immediate use, and whether or not a specific industrial undertaking has been identified in advance. Many Members will be aware that the agency has always operated on this basis when purchasing land by agreement with landowners, so this does not represent a change or a new departure in any respect. Sections 5 and 6 of the Bill provide that IDA Ireland will only be permitted to purchase land compulsorily in circumstances where it is required for immediate, as opposed to future use, and a specific undertaking has been identified. Section 6 provides that the compulsory purchase powers are to be used in accordance with the existing and well-established compulsory purchase processes set out in the Housing Act 1966. The Bill also provides that compulsorily acquired land can only be leased, as opposed to sold, by IDA Ireland to an industrial undertaking. This important safeguard serves to ensure that land that has been compulsorily purchased is put to immediate industrial development use, whilst ultimately remaining in State ownership. Section 7 of the Bill applies some of the existing provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000 as it provides for a full role for An Bord Pleanála as an independent body to affirm compulsory purchase orders made by IDA Ireland. In addition, the legislation provides an adjudication role to An Bord Pleanála with regard to objections related to a compulsory acquisition. As I emphasised earlier, the role assigned to An Bord Pleanála in any future IDA Ireland compulsory purchase closely mirrors its existing role in compulsory purchases earned out by a wide range of other State bodies. </p>
          <p eId="para_968"> I will now finally expand further on the policy and operational context to the Bill. Given the critically important work IDA Ireland carries out, particularly in terms of trying to support regional development, it is essential that no legal uncertainty, no matter how small, attaches to its property purchasing powers. Otherwise we risk diminishing the agency’s capacity to attract further foreign direct investment and generate new employment opportunities across the country. The availability of industrial property in suitable locations is, of course, a key factor in encouraging multinational companies to locate here. A vital aspect of IDA Ireland’s work therefore remains, as has been the case for many years, connecting those firms with property solutions. To be able to do that effectively, IDA Ireland needs the continued capacity to purchase properties so that they can be offered to potential investors. This means that IDA Ireland must have the capacity to buy property, for the purposes of industrial development, in situations where it may not be required for immediate use and where a specific company has not yet been identified as the ultimate beneficiary. This is especially important in the context of the agency’s work to increase foreign direct investment in rural and regional locations, given that the vast majority of IDA Ireland property purchases are outside of the country’s main urban areas. </p>
          <p eId="para_969"> As regards the compulsory purchase element, while IDA Ireland very rarely employs its compulsory acquisition powers - as I mentioned earlier, it has only ever done so once - it is important that it retains its statutory power to do so if the agency is to be able to meet its mandate. Without compulsory purchase powers, IDA Ireland could potentially miss out in the future on extremely significant investment opportunities that could have a transformative impact or effect on a local community in terms of jobs created. </p>
          <p eId="para_970"> I will close by emphasising again that regional development is one of the key priorities of this Government, of my Department and of IDA Ireland. We are committed to doing everything we can to both sustain and create employment opportunities all over Ireland and IDA Ireland has a huge role to play in that work. That is why this Bill is particularly important and I am therefore asking this House to support this legislation.</p>

        <speech by="#FrankORourke" eId="spk_376">
          <from>Deputy Frank O'Rourke<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T21:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_971">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill this evening. Fianna Fáil supports the Industrial Development (Amendment) Bill 2018 in order to ensure continued foreign direct investment and jobs growth in Ireland which is hugely important to this country and its economy. The Bill enhances IDA Ireland's power to compulsorily purchase order land for immediate industrial use. That is only to be welcomed. It will help reduce and eliminate the barriers we have seen in recent cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_972"> Foreign direct investment is pivotal in providing over 200,000 IDA Ireland-supported jobs in our economy. IDA Ireland estimates that for every ten jobs generated by foreign direct investment, a further seven jobs are generated in the wider economy. In my own constituency in Kildare North, one can see the success stories of Intel and Hewlett Packard, and there are many other examples throughout Ireland. This is the reason we must eliminate what barriers exist in order to make Ireland a more attractive country for foreign direct investment. </p>
          <p eId="para_973"> At a time of increased global competition, we need to ensure that we have a planning system which enables this continued investment in a timely manner, when companies wish to establish themselves or to expand their Irish operations. We must look at the context in which that happens. We must be attractive as a country to come to and do business in. We have an exceptionally talented workforce. It is very highly skilled, extremely flexible and is acknowledged as having a very positive and can-do attitude. Workers are self-motivated and self-driven. There are many positive reasons foreign companies wish to set up in our country and our workforce is pivotal in that decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_974"> The Government has to deal with a planning system that is not fit for purpose, which has detrimentally influenced foreign direct investment. It is important that that is dealt with swiftly and properly. The long-running saga to get planning approval for the €850 million Apple data centre in Athenry is a case in point. It is a good example of how our out of date planning laws proved a barrier to this company setting up in Athenry, which would be of massive benefit to the local area, the wider region and everyone who lives there. It is very concerning that this huge investment will not now proceed, and that the company has now decided to build a second data centre in Denmark. During his visit to California, the Taoiseach was unsuccessful in securing a commitment on this project which was unfortunate for Ireland and the region. This Bill addresses one part of the issue there. It is important that when the issues are highlighted and identified that we move swiftly and correctly to deal with them in a practical, pragmatic and rational way for the benefit not only of Ireland and everyone already in it but also for those who come here to work. </p>
          <p eId="para_975"> Fianna Fáil has introduced legislation in the Dáil to fast-track the planning process for large-scale IT infrastructure projects such as data centres. The Government must work with us and with others to secure further job growth in this sector because it is a sector that will develop further and be very big in future. We can see how much it is already growing.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">The Bill addresses the legal difficulties encountered previously by the IDA in acquiring land for the Intel corporation in Leixlip, County Kildare, in my own constituency. This transpired in what was known as the Reid case, in which the IDA tried to purchase a 72 acre farm next to the Intel plant from the farmer Thomas Reid. While the High Court approved the compulsory purchase order, CPO, in 2013, Mr. Reid claimed that this had breached his property rights under the Constitution and European Convention on Human Rights. On referral to the Supreme Court in 2015, the court ruled in his favour that the IDA has exceeded it power and declared that the agency's CPO mechanisms were outdated. That is another backdrop as to why we are speaking on this Bill and supporting it here this evening. </p>
          <p eId="para_977"> This is a recent example, along with that of the Apple data centre in Athenry, of our out-of-date planning system which has the potential to prevent foreign direct investment into Ireland. As I have said, when foreign direct investment companies set up in any region it is a positive and brings jobs. It brings a buzz, action and activity to the local area, which might not see employment or activity otherwise. That is part and parcel of the need to develop infrastructure to support foreign direct investment outside of Dublin and the greater Dublin area and to bring it to the midlands, the north west, the south, the south east and all of the different areas. We need to make these areas attractive for foreign direct investment so that it can assist positively in those local economies by giving employment locally in the regional economy. This of course feeds back positively into the national economy. It is important that we work on the basis that such investment be based in all areas and all regions. We need to work in a way that allows that to take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_978"> Concerns have been expressed by landowners regarding compulsory purchase of land by State agencies. The new powers conferred on the IDA in this Bill will only allow it to compulsorily purchase land for immediate use. That is important for people who might have an interest in this and who might have concerns. It is for immediate use rather than for use for industrial development. It is not for forward planning, it is for immediate use. Land acquired by CPO can only be leased while An Bord Pleanála, as an independent body, will confirm IDA CPOs and arbitrate on objections related to any compulsory acquisition. There is an independent process there. It is important that landowners are not fearful of this. It is for positive and immediate use.</p>
          <p eId="para_979"> The objectives of this Bill address, in our view, the issues raised by the judgment in Reid <i>v.</i> IDA and Ors. and the Bill ensures that IDA Ireland has a sound legal basis to continue to carry out its property functions, which is very important. The Bill seeks to apply certain provisions of the Housing Act 1966 and the Planning and Development Act 2000 in order to provide for An Bord Pleanála to affirm a compulsory purchase order and adjudicate on any objections which might arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_980"> Intel's plans for expansion in Leixlip are a perfect example, as we have discussed. Intel is a fantastic success story for both my own constituency of Kildare North and for Kildare generally. It has firmly put Ireland on the map. It employs 4,500 people on its site in Leixlip. That is a major contribution and a major asset locally. Since the 2015 Supreme Court ruling, Intel has lodged plans for a massive 90,000 sq. m expansion at the Leixlip plant which could create a further 850 full-time jobs and which would lead to 3,000 construction jobs. That is the benefit of having proper plans and legislation in place to allow for the expansion of existing companies, but also to alleviate barriers to further foreign direct investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_981"> The development was given the go-ahead last October by An Bord Pleanála. The suggested project could soon get the green light with refurbishment work planned for parts of the plant. An Intel spokesperson, however, recently said that the go-ahead for the extension was yet to receive final approval, although it is there in principle. We all await that with optimism.</p>
          <p eId="para_982"> Fianna Fáil will be supporting this. We are encouraged by what is there and by the reasons behind it. It is important that the motivations are positive and that it is being done for the right reasons. Ireland, as a small economy with a small population, needs to be looking to attract foreign direct investment and to sustain the current employment that is there. We need to continue to advocate our workforce which is very talented, very flexible, very well-educated and very highly skilled and to ensure that we are competing at the highest level without any barriers to attracting further foreign direct investment into our country.</p>

        <speech by="#MauriceQuinlivan" eId="spk_377">
          <from>Deputy Maurice Quinlivan<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T21:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_983">Sinn Féin will be supporting this Bill, the Industrial Development (Amendment) Bill 2018. We agree with the thrust of the Bill. I thank the Minister of State for outlining the provisions of this Bill. As mentioned, it stems from the Supreme Court decision in Reid <i>v</i>. IDA, where Mr. Justice McKechnie set aside the first compulsory purchase order made under section 16 of the Industrial Development Act 1986. The case in question concerned a farmer in County Kildare who successfully challenged the State and the IDA over a compulsory purchase order in respect of his farm which is located next to a major multinational in Leixlip.</p>
          <p eId="para_984"> The great work of IDA Ireland should be acknowledged here as this Bill is primarily about its functions and powers. I met with Martin Shanahan, the CEO of IDA Ireland, recently. He runs a really impressive organisation that succeeded in attracting 19,851 new foreign direct investment, FDI, jobs to Ireland in 2017. IDA Ireland currently supports over 210,000 employees in FDI companies across Ireland, including 10,677 in my own county of Limerick. I hope this success can continue and if this Bill will help provide the tools to achieve that then that is a good thing. </p>
          <p eId="para_985"> I will always take the opportunity to mention the need for continued efforts to locate FDI companies and jobs in rural areas and regional Ireland. It is also very important to get more jobs to the regions, especially FDI jobs. My analysis of the FDI jobs generated in 2017, which I highlighted at a committee yesterday, indicates that some areas are still faring very poorly on this front. The ratio of FDI jobs to the local population is, unsurprisingly, best in Dublin, with one IDA-backed job for every 15 citizens. In Laois, however, it is 712 citizens to every one job and in Monaghan it is 408 to one. Other counties perform poorly too, with Meath having a ratio of 131 to one and Kilkenny a ratio of 127 to one. </p>
          <p eId="para_986"> While we clearly need new initiatives focused on getting more FDI companies to these counties, I appreciate that it is the companies' decision at the end of the day and that other factors will affect that choice. The Government should be considering investment in infrastructure and facilities to aid this. We need to prioritise that instead of trying to outdo the Government's friends in Fianna Fáil with tax cuts. The recent collapse of the national broadband tendering process is obviously not the way to encourage multinationals to locate to rural Ireland, so I encourage this Government to get a handle on the situation and to ensure regional Ireland can benefit from FDI. </p>
          <p eId="para_987"> Turning to specific provisions of this Bill, section 4 sets out that an immediate use and existing tenant is not required for IDA Ireland to purchase land. This is fair as the nature of the decision by companies who locate here can be sudden and require lands immediately so only permitting the purchase and development of land when a company is waiting to locate here would not be feasible due to the possible delays and could jeopardise the investment. Section 5 sets out that lands acquired compulsorily may only be leased and not sold. This is appropriate given how the lands would have been obtained by a CPO. Section 6 sets out in detail the new compulsory purchasing power to be exercised only by IDA Ireland, and outlines that such powers may only be used to compulsorily purchase land where an industrial undertaking has been identified. This section also adapts and applies provisions of the Housing Act 1966 to give IDA Ireland compulsory acquisition powers on par with those of a housing authority. Section 7 gives An Bord Pleanála powers to assess and, if necessary, confirm compulsory purchases by IDA Ireland. This is also a good check on the new powers to be bestowed on IDA Ireland to ensure they are exercised as envisaged. </p>
          <p eId="para_988"> Although FDI jobs and investment is one vital component to our economy, we should not lose sight of the fine balance that must be achieved to ensure land and property owners are not adversely affected in the pursuit of suitable sites for multinational companies. In that regard, I am satisfied that the tests laid out in this Bill are fair and will achieve that objective. However, we must never use CPOs unless all other options are exhausted. The Minister of State may have read a recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i> about Thomas Reid and the fight he had in the courts over a compulsory purchase order for his County Kildare property. The article described a documentary called “The Lonely Battle of Thomas Reid”, which I understand had its Irish premiere at the Dublin International Film Festival last month. Obviously this highlights some effects that CPOs can have on property owners and the reason CPOs must be used only ever as a last resort.</p>
          <p eId="para_989"> We have just one question about the Bill which perhaps might be worth considering. If, for instance, IDA Ireland finds that it no longer has use for land that was compulsorily purchased, could an option be included in the Bill to allow the land to be sold back to the original owners? I will take as an example the case that led to this change, that is, the case of the farmer in County Kildare. Let us say, for example, IDA Ireland uses its powers under the Bill to buy a farm to enable a company to expand but the company then decides to leave Ireland or goes bust, with the result that the lands are no longer needed for their intended purpose. Will IDA Ireland be in a position to sell the land back to the original owner as it is no longer needed? This could be of particular relevance where land was held by a family for generations, as in the case in County Kildare. It is just a thought I had about the Bill. Perhaps the Minister of State might clarify whether he has an answer to the question today. If not, he might come back to me on it. Otherwise, I welcome the Bill and restate my party's support for it and my appreciation of the work IDA Ireland does in marketing Ireland all over the world to bring jobs to these shores.</p>

          <p eId="para_990">I, too, am delighted to speak on Second Stage of the Bill. I am a big supporter of foreign direct investment and IDA Ireland which has been out there since the very start. Mr. Padraic White was one of the first IDA Ireland men with whom I remember working. I commend the work IDA Ireland does in attracting business and especially jobs to Ireland, specifically County Tipperary. We are proud of the nearly 5,000 jobs which are the result of foreign direct investment in the greater south Tipperary area. There are another 1,000 or 2,000 jobs in Dungarvan síos an bóthar in Contae Phort Láirge.</p>
          <p eId="para_991"> I had the privilege last year on Lá Fhéile Pádraig, or an oíche sin, of meeting the head of IDA Ireland in Washington DC. American ambassadors and the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, were present. Obviously, being a Tipperary man, I was looking for more jobs and industry for the county. Any of us would do the same for our constituencies in which we are privileged to be elected and of which we are so privileged to be a part. I asked the head of IDA Ireland why we could not attract jobs to County Limerick, County Tipperary or anywhere else. My wife was there with me. The head of IDA Ireland told me that he could not get companies to locate outside Dublin. It is a pity, given that everything seems to be Dublin-centric, that they will not even consider locating in Galway where there are universities, Limerick, Port Láirge or aon áit mar sin. We have a problem with which must deal.</p>

          <p eId="para_1001">I missed the Minister of State's comment, but perhaps it is just as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002"> To get back to the substantive issue dealt with in the Bill and CPOs, I remember Schering-Plough. It was a long time ago. I was a buachaill óg in school in An Chathair. Schering-Plough was to locate in Cahir, but the next thing was there were objections and it never came. I do not know whether it located in the Ceann Comhairle's county, but it went somewhere else in the country. I did say a CPO was necessary in many areas, but it is a dangerous, powerful tool. Without proper respect for it and its use, it can be a devastating weapon with which to deal, as I saw in many areas. There are many areas where I want to have a bend on the road widened or something dangerous rectified. However, the county council will never invoke an CPO when it should do so. I am talking about life-saving measures and saw this happen again when the motorways were built. The trouble now is that the roads running through the Ceann Comhairle's county are being widened and we cannot fit in them while the works are being carried out. There is bedlam. I stood in yards, fields and haggarts and houses with farmers and their wives and families and could not stop CPOs, although I was not against progress. We cannot stop the building of motorways which we need. However, a CPO is a crude tool, but thankfully the motorways are now in place. However, we then started to put up fences. It was fascinating to see and great. However, the next thing was we came to an old hut which used to be a byre in the early 1900s. There was ivy growing around it and, lo and behold, a bat inside it. At least, that is what we were told it and the whole thing had to be ring-fenced and could not be touched. A roof was put up around it for about 15 months. It was hilarious. They then went somewhere else and found a frog and another big encampment was built around it. It was like something one would see in outer space. It ran all along the perimeter of the motorway and all the while development work carried on, with bulldozers and so on. A new bungalow that had been built about eight years previously - I was involved in the planning process - was demolished. It was got rid hastily and money was received - I know that - but that is neither here nor there. I am just saying a CPO as a tool of engagement is crude. It is needed in certain areas, but, as I said, councils will not use it when they have to clean rivers and free bridges. However, they will use it in the case of big projects. </p>
          <p eId="para_1003"> I noted the case in County Kildare. I do not know anything about it, but I watched reports on it on the news and so on and felt sorry for the man involved. In respect of the same motorway, the senior engineer at the time, a Mayo man, Mr. O'Malley, made a promise to me. We had a fierce problem at the time with Traveller encampments on the outskirts of Cahir. We were told it was because we had had the experience of leaving open spaces and that they would not leave space anywhere for a caravan. Instead, swathes of ground and green areas had been left and we have had problems ever since. However, lo and behold, in the areas they did not use there are now 2, 3 and 4 acre sites. There is actually a very good community project which offers air support to bring people in an emergency to hospital by helicopter. Doctors are delivered by helicopter to the site of an emergency in remote areas which cannot be reached by ambulance. We are looking for a 3 or 4 acre site in Raheen, near Cahir, but we cannot deal with the county council or the National Roads Authority, NRA, which is worse than the IRA. We got rid of and decommissioned the IRA. Former Senator Martin Mansergh-----</p>

There will be also a mart and an after-mart. This wonderful community project is located in Cork and serves all of Munster and Leinster. It wants to have a base somewhere in east Cork or south Tipperary, but it cannot secure engagement with the buachaláns and the Travellers. The land is useless and no rent is accruing from it, although the horses among the buachaláns are shaded from the heat on summer days. There is not even a water supply. It is an ideal site, but we cannot secure engagement. Therefore, I am urging caution because this is a problem with the agencies. When they have too much power, they get an inch and take a mile. It is crude terminology, but they have the courts system behind them. That is why I am opposed to the Bill and I am supporting Deputy Clare Daly. I think she has tabled an amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010"> We need to make hay slowly. We need to understand the little people - na daoine beaga - who back in the 1900s - in 1918, 1920 and 1921 - fought to free this country. They also fought in the War of Independence for our young democracy. We cannot have these powerful agencies that have no respect for people's rights. Land use is a very emotive issue. I have no problem with progress, but we must have full respect for people's rights. As I said, when birds, bats and frogs have more autonomy than householders, it is a sad day, especially now when we have a housing crisis. The houses to which I was referring, including the new bungalow that had only been built ten years previously, had to be flattened. The people who owned them were compensated and relocated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011">The Government will pass the Bill, based on the comments I have heard, but we might regret it. We cut our cloth according to measure and pay the bridge as we go over. This is serious and I am not making light of it. I am just saying I am opposed to giving IDA Ireland more powers without restrictions and accountability. We have no accountability from TII and we did not have it for the NRA. We do not have it for so many other agencies, such as the HSE, and the mess we have with €17 billion being spent with no accountability. All of these agencies are a buffer zone between Ministers and Teach Laighean anseo. When we table a question to a Minister it is passed on to these agencies and they are not accountable. They tell us it is not in their remit to answer questions to a Dáil Deputy or anybody else. Where are we going? By all means have this but have curtailments on it and, above all, have respect and understanding for the ordinary little people. I am not happy with the Bill because it needs to be teased out further and examined carefully.</p>

          <p eId="para_1012">I want to make a couple of points on the Bill, and I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to contribute to the debate. As my colleague has already outlined, Fianna Fáil will support the Bill because we support its main content. The Bill provides IDA Ireland with the power to acquire strategic sites for industrial development where it has identified particular undertakings to use them. The Bill also updates IDA Ireland's statutory powers to acquire land by compulsory purchase. The new provisions are modelled on those used for the housing authorities under the Housing Act 1966. IDA Ireland may use them only where it has identified a suitable industrial undertaking to use the land.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013"> This is very welcome, and I accept that in certain areas and certain developments IDA Ireland needs these powers, but I do have a concern. I acknowledge the good work of the CEO and all of the officials who work on the international stage to ensure they do their best to attract foreign direct investment to our island. My colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, outlined the spin-off generated in a particular area by foreign direct investment, but we still have an issue. A few moments ago, the Minister of State told Deputy McGrath that 45% of the jobs created last year were outside Dublin but they are still predominantly in certain areas along the east coast.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014"> Look at a town such as Mullingar, which is only 50 km from the capital city and has a motorway right to an IDA Ireland park. IDA Ireland acquired a 58 acre park more than a decade ago. It has been built and infrastructure is in place, with roads, broadband, sewerage services and bus stops but, with the exception of one business that relocated from another park in Mullingar more than four years ago, nothing is in it. It does not even have a proper entrance. What I am saying is that without question IDA Ireland needs the powers, but it should also be looking to market areas that have been critically lacking in foreign direct support in recent years. This evening I am speaking specifically about Mullingar. Why does IDA Ireland not go into a park, such as that in Mullingar and put units in place? When people come to invest in Ireland they want to see where they can move into now and not where they can acquire a site, do up plans, apply for planning permission, go to tender and construct our building. They will not wait for 18 months or two years. IDA Ireland needs to be ambitious and bold. It needs to come into areas such as Marlinstown Business Park and put buildings in place. Then we would have a much greater advantage and incentive for companies relocating and investing on this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015"> I did not want to let the occasion go, as we discuss giving IDA Ireland greater powers, without stating it has obligations. I am being very parochial, and I do not apologise for it, with regard to Mullingar. I am sure if I speak to other colleagues right across the political divide they would be able to identify locations where IDA Ireland has land which has been paid for and the State has made an investment in terms of the necessary infrastructure in roads, sewerage and broadband. The parks are there and they are not being fully utilised. I ask the Minister of State to accelerate the efforts and work with IDA Ireland to ensure it is given targets to bring companies looking to invest on our island to areas outside of Dublin and the east coast and to consider areas and towns such as Mullingar.</p>

          <p eId="para_1019">Maybe he will come in afterwards. I thank Deputy McGrath for stepping into the breach when I thought I would be late. I certainly did not want this discussion to be collapsed because, I have to say, it is one of the worst pieces of legislation I have ever come across. While I have not tabled an amendment on this Stage I certainly will do so, although the Bill is probably not amendable and I think I will end up voting against it in its entirety.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020"> It is appropriate to start by looking at what got us here and looking with a bit of depth, and maybe with a bit of a different slant from some of the other Deputies who spoke earlier, with regard to the backdrop to this. On 14 November 2012, IDA Ireland served Thomas Reid with a compulsory purchase order, CPO, for his home and lands at Blakestown in County Kildare. It wanted the lands for Intel, which wished to expand its operations in Ireland and it wanted to do it on the land owned by Thomas Reid. Three years and one very lonely battle against the State later, on 5 November 2015 Thomas Reid won a stunning Supreme Court victory against IDA Ireland. Let us remember it was a unanimous verdict. The five judge court ruled that IDA Ireland had acted <i>ultra vires </i>in terms of the Industrial Development Act 1986 and was objectively biased in its quest to CPO Thomas Reid's home. On the day when he came out of the court, he was asked whether he was happy and he made a very profound statement when he said he was sure they were rearranging themselves behind closed doors, and so they were. The fruits of that rearrangement lie in the Bill before us today.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021"> What the Bill does is simply an end run around the Supreme Court judgment in the Thomas Reid case to ensure never again can IDA Ireland be stopped through a legal challenge from acquiring people's lands for use by US multinationals. We have to be clear about what the Bill is about and what it is not about. On my way in, I listened to speakers from the Government, Fianna Fáil and, even in some ways, Sinn Féin stating this is in the public interest and about job creation and that we have to see it in this way. This is not what it is about. It is about facilitating and smoothing the expropriation of lands and homes to gift them to US corporations that could well afford to buy land from people who are prepared to surrender that land voluntarily. Let us be clear about it. This is not about CPOs for schools, hospitals or roads. It only deals with CPOs for foreign industry. In fact, Enterprise Ireland has been specifically excluded from the Bill. Lest anybody be in any doubt that this is about helping IDA Ireland acquire premises for small and medium-sized businesses, it is not. It is purely for foreign direct investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022"> Looking back at Thomas Reid's case can give us some idea of what is down the tracks, if the Bill is passed, the next time a US multinational, with a bit of help from this Bill, decides to build. In 2011, when land prices were at an historic low and emigration figures were at a depressing high, Intel approached Thomas Reid looking to buy some land from him. Thomas refused, as was his right. Intel was not interested in taking "no" for an answer and, with the assistance of IDA Ireland which was right there to help it, within six months of his refusal to sell, IDA Ireland started the process of acquiring his lands against his will. It was not for a school, hospital or motorway.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">Intel did not have to build its new plant on the land owned by Thomas Reid. It wanted to do so because his land was beside Intel's Leixlip campus and it suited it to expand sideways because it was the cheapest and easiest option. For a multi-billion euro multinational doing things cheap and easy is how to get ahead. What I find utterly shocking is the role played by the IDA in the Reid case. It effectively was the muscle for a multi-billion euro multinational in its fight against an Irish landowner, which is unacceptable. For me, this raises serious questions about the role of the IDA, in that its role as a State body with the remit of securing foreign direct investment meshes into it being a chief lobbying arm of multinationals in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024"> What happened in the court is the backdrop to this situation. The IDA was exposed as giving falsehoods because it was on the court record as denying that it attempted to use its extraordinary powers for the benefit of a specific identifiable corporation. It was only when it was before the Supreme Court that it realised it was running out of options and it admitted that Intel was one of the potential parties interested in the land. This failed endeavour cost the State in the region of €2 million in legal fees. It did not cost Intel anything. It must also be said that the chairman of the IDA at the time of the compulsory purchase order, CPO, was also a non-executive director of the PM Group, a consultancy firm that chose Thomas Reid's site as the most attractive for Intel from a survey conducted in west Dublin. The Supreme Court found that this individual had participated in two key decisions relating to the lands at Blakestown: the original decision to initiate the CPO and the crucial final decision in making the CPO in November 2012. Mr. Justice McKechnie found that a reasonable observer might doubt whether the chairman would be in a position to remain as objective as he might have been expected to be in the circumstances. I think Mr. Justice McKechnie was pretty judicious in his comments. A less kind commentator might say that it was a massive and insurmountable conflict of interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025"> When one looks at the literature on CPOs globally, they are always referred to as a last resort. There is no mention of the State expropriating private land for the benefit of private multinational corporations. They are normally talked about as being required for infrastructure projects, which is fair enough, and, occasionally, for public private partnerships, which is unsurprising in the neoliberal world order in which we live. While I might not agree with this, I can see a certain logic in it but forcibly expropriating land for the benefit of a private multinational is rare. No other country in the world, with the exception of Israel, does this. In that case, it is more a compulsory bulldozing than a compulsory purchase of land owned by citizens in a sovereign State. Interestingly, up to 2010, Intel's only other plant outside of the United States, other than the one in Ireland, was, coincidentally, in Israel.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026"> A review of compulsory purchase law by a World Bank senior counsel states that an over-arching principle in most cases is that a Government's taking powers are extraordinary powers that are intended to meet public needs that are not well addressed through the operation of the market and, hence, it is not typical for laws to allow Governments to use compulsory acquisition as the normal means of assembling land for purposes that are clearly for commercial, industrial or other profitable private uses alone. The World Bank is not exactly an entirely radical organisation. This premise operates the world over, except now it seems in Ireland. On my way here I listened on my phone to Fianna Fáil Deputies' speaking about the data centres, Apple, Google and Amazon. I do know how I managed not to crash. Data centres are not public goods. Their only strategic function is the bottom line of the multinationals which own them. In terms of climate change and our energy commitments, and with very few jobs delivered, these will cost us millions of euros in carbon fines in the next few years. What we are looking at is tin pot stuff in terms of this legislation. I find this shocking. We give over our airports to the US for use and we give over our taxation to Apple. We tell multinationals not to worry, they will not have to pay tax here. We are all aware of NAMA and the great vulture fund sell-off and what is happening now with the data centres. If this was not enough, we are now flogging thousands of properties to vulture funds at knock-down prices and we now propose to take land from under the feet of landowners who do not want to sell. I am gobsmacked that this legislation is being put forward. If it is passed, this will be a free-for-all and I am very concerned about that. </p>
          <p eId="para_1027"> It is ironic that we had to listen at the weekend to the protestations of the new Attorney General, who presumably was the individual who proofed and legally advised the Government on this CPO process. It is not accidental, I think, that down the Wicklow way we have had a long running saga regarding lands at Charlesland and the highly questionable deals done by council officials there in terms of the abuse and use of CPO powers to benefit private developers. The case in Wicklow raises very serious questions about the exercise of CPO powers by State agencies and the transparency of the whole process. I commend the dogged and tireless work of councillors like Barry Nevin and Thomas Cullen, without whose work many of the very serious and troubling questions around this process would not be in the public domain. These men were democratically elected to serve the community of Wicklow and they were stopped at every turn from getting information to allow them to fulfil their statutory duties when a deal was done by the former Wicklow county manager with development companies in order to use the CPO process to acquire land for their private gain, land which had been in the ownership of the local authority for housing purposes. I mention the Attorney General because in his former life he was the senior counsel called in to review the process of the proposal by Wicklow County Council to CPO these controversial lands. It is regrettable that in the course of the successful defamation case taken by those heroic Wicklow councillors evidence was produced which showed evidence of shortcomings in the review conducted by the Attorney General, which is worrying given this is the individual who is legally advising on this CPO process. He had in his possession information which showed that the manager's order, put forward by the Wicklow county manager, stating the reason the council had to CPO these lands was because they were needed the land for social housing as the council had an acre or half an acre of land for social housing purposes. In the review which the Attorney General saw at the time the evidence showed that the county manager knew that Wicklow County Council had more than 20 acres for land for social housing purposes such that the basis on which they CPO was sought was a demonstrable lie because the manager's order was false and flawed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">That was in the possession of the Attorney General but he never made that point or brought it up. It is shockingly worrying that this individual, who obviously did not understand and played a less than welcome role in that CPO process, is advising the Government on this. It is clearly not just judicial appointments about which this gentleman is not keeping up to speed. He is very much behind the ball in terms of his knowledge of what is going on in this House and the legislation before it. For me, it is not the first time his judgment has been seriously called into question. We will be hearing a lot more from him if he keeps it up.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029"> The provision in the Bill which deals with an appeal to An Bord Pleanála is highly unsatisfactory as the board invariably approves the CPOs. It does not investigate adequately. It generally simply accepts the assurances of the organisation seeking the CPO. Any statistical analysis of appeals and cases that have gone before the board would verify that. However, even if that was not an issue, An Bord Pleanála's remit is not to investigate shady dealings, potential bias or whatever one wishes to call it. The key issue in the Wicklow case, and a potentially huge issue with regard to the IDA's CPO powers, is an area that the board is not called in to question.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030"> The Minister implied that IDA Ireland lost the Reid case more or less on a technicality and that the principle of IDA Ireland being empowered to take lands to gift to multinationals is one that is enshrined in Irish law since the 1980s. That may or may not be the case, but what certainly is the case is the fact that the principle underlying this Bill is repugnant as far as I am concerned. The principle of expropriating land and property to line the pockets of private business is repugnant to most citizens in this State. It is clear from the Wicklow case that there is insufficient scrutiny or oversight of the process. When elected county councillors are denied information and information is deliberately withheld from them, one can say there is considerable scope for questionable dealings. When a semi-State agency is to be given these unfettered powers, we should all be worried based on what has happened already.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031"> We will probably deal with it later on Committee and other Stages, but there is much to be answered for already with regard to the CPO processes in this State. The manager's order in Wicklow, for example, was shown to be false and misleading according to the court. It is a very serious matter. It is interesting to note that the Tánaiste, in his previous role as Minister in that Department, agreed to have an investigation into the process there. That must be done because the review that was carried out fell well short of what was necessary. In 2015, one of the individuals who acted as a whistleblower in that case submitted 44 questions to the then Minister with responsibility for local government, Deputy Alan Kelly, about the goings on between senior members of Wicklow County Council and the Dunne and Mulryan group about the Charlesland land. It is interesting that the former Minister, who now has a profound interest in whistleblowers and matters of justice, had a less than enthusiastic approach in his ministerial position when whistleblowing councillors, some of whom were in his own party at the time, came forward with serious evidence of wrongdoing. That wrongdoing was subsequently exposed, to an extent, in the successful defamation case they had to take to defend their good names.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032"> I salute the efforts of the Wicklow councillors. I compliment Thomas Reid. In many ways he has been inspirational, a lone wolf taking on a giant single-handedly and winning, with five Supreme Court judges agreeing with him. However, that was not good enough. A multinational had to be given the land from under him and the law had to be changed to facilitate it. One can talk about selling and prostituting ourselves and giving it away, but today is a new low in that regard. The legislation is incredibly regrettable.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Pat Breen)<recordedTime time="2018-03-28T21:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1036">I listened attentively to all the speakers in the debate. I thank everybody for their engagement, particularly those who supported the Bill, and for their comments and observations on the Bill. I look forward to working positively with the Members as the Bill progresses through the Houses in the coming weeks and months.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037"> Deputy O'Rourke obviously is aware of the importance of foreign direct investment in his constituency for the creation of jobs. That is also the case in the Ceann Comhairle's constituency, as well as in Deputy Quinlivan's. Deputy Quinlivan is supporting the Bill. Foreign direct investment is important in those constituencies and it complements the indigenous industries. Foreign direct investment played an important role in our economic recovery and in job creation. Consider the high unemployment rate we had in 2008. It is now 6%, which is almost at full employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038"> I note Deputy Clare Daly's comments as well. I wish to reiterate that the IDA certainly does not rely on compulsory purchase orders to acquire land for industrial development purposes. That will not change and there are strict regulations in the Bill to ensure that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039"> In response to Deputy Mattie McGrath's comments on foreign direct investment, it is clear from the IDA's annual end of year returns that 45% of the jobs created are outside the Dublin area. In the case of Enterprise Ireland it is 65%. Jobs are being created in every region and county. I wish to correct the Deputy in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040"> With regard to Deputy Troy, I visited Mullingar recently. For a few hours in the afternoon I visited the Mergon Group. It is an indigenous company but it has spread its wings into Germany and the US. It is a very good company and employs many workers, particularly in the robotics area. That is the type of industry we want for the future and I was very impressed by its works. I also visited the former Imperial Tobacco factory and saw the work taking place there. There is potential to create jobs in that area as well. I hope we will continue to invest in Mullingar. As the Deputy said, it is almost in the middle of the country and there is a good road network into it. We will certainly encourage the IDA to ensure that places such as Mullingar are included in future job creation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041"> I mentioned earlier that the IDA has no additional or strengthened property powers. In fact, in many respects the IDA's compulsory purchase powers will be far more restricted by this Bill and the clearly defined constraints in the legislation. In practical terms, in the unforeseen event of the IDA pursuing another compulsory purchase order, the only thing that will change on foot of the legislation is the process the IDA will be required to use. That process is closely aligned to the well-established existing process that applies to local authorities under the Housing Acts and is a far more open and transparent process than what is currently in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042">The introduction of a full role for An Bord Pleanála provides an additional air of oversight and brings the whole process into line with those that apply in other State bodies. Foreign direct investment helps to generate and drive economic activity in Ireland. Statistics show that it also plays a key role in boosting regional development, as I have outlined.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043"> The Government, my Department and IDA Ireland are doing everything possible to create and sustain employment opportunities and this legislation will remove any potential barrier in that ambition. This ambition for the success of our economy is shared by most Deputies in the House. Without foreign direct investment and without the work done by our agencies, we would not be in the position today of being the fastest growing economy in the EU. This is why I dispute some of the comments made by Deputy Clare Daly.</p>

          <p eId="para_1047">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_1048">I thank the Ceann Comhairle and the House for the opportunity to present this Bill here today. This is a specialised and technical Bill, which is necessary in order to meet obligations entered into by Ireland under EU measures known as the Prüm decisions. These decisions are named after the town in Germany where the principles behind them were originally agreed, and address the need to share certain kinds of information between member states to combat terrorism and other serious crime. They require member states to share DNA, fingerprint, and vehicle registration data. Legislation to share DNA and fingerprints, which is the responsibility of the Department of Justice and Equality, was passed in 2014. This Bill will provide for the sharing of vehicle registration data.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049"> The Prüm decisions were originally reached in 2008. At that time member states had a choice of whether to opt into them and Ireland did so, by votes of both Houses of the Oireachtas. Once we opted in, the decisions became mandatory for us under EU law. Compliance with the decisions means not only passing the necessary legislation. We are not deemed to be compliant until we actually begin sharing information with other member states. Under an agreement reached by the EU in 2009, data will also be shared with Iceland and Norway under the decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050"> The legislative aspect of giving effect to the decisions has proven to be very complex. The legislation to give effect to the sharing of DNA and fingerprint information was passed in 2014, six years after the decisions. As this constituted the major part of the decisions, legislation for sharing of vehicle registration data was to be dealt with only after the DNA and fingerprint legislation. A number of legal difficulties had to be resolved, and it is only now that we are in a position to bring forward the necessary legislation to allow for exchange of vehicle registration data as required by the decisions. Due to these delays, as well as technical delays to the sharing of DNA and fingerprint data, the EU has begun the initial stages of action against the State for possible infringement of EU law. I understand that the technical processes necessary for arriving at actual sharing of DNA and fingerprint data are well advanced, with the crucial stage of EU evaluation visits to assess readiness being completed in February, in the case of fingerprinting, and scheduled for April in the case of DNA. Vehicle registration data cannot be shared under the decisions until the Bill is passed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051"> Once this Bill is passed, we will proceed to the sharing of data under it as quickly as possible. We are in a fortunate position for rapid implementation in one respect. Vehicle registration data is already being shared with other member states under a separate EU instrument dealing with the investigation of serious road traffic offences. This is being done over the same network as will be used for Prüm so that the technical measures required to implement the Bill are mostly in place. Speedy implementation will enable us to end EU infringement proceedings and avert the risk of reputational damage and financial penalties which the State might incur in the case of being found to have infringed EU law. With regard to reputational damage, Prüm is rightly regarded as an important law enforcement tool by our EU partners, and particularly by those who have suffered in recent years from terrorism. I need hardly stress the importance of retaining goodwill at an EU level in the present climate of negotiations on Brexit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052"> Before I set out the details of the Bill I will explain what we are talking about in practice. Imagine that a car involved in a serious crime in France such as a terrorist incident or an armed robbery, for example, was registered in Ireland. Under the Prüm decisions, it would be possible for the French authorities to send an electronic request to check Irish records to see who was the registered owner of the vehicle. Equally, if a French-registered vehicle was used in a serious crime in Ireland, An Garda Síochána would be able to find out the identity of the registered owner by checking the French data.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053"> The contents of this Bill may be described as falling into four areas: general provisions for sharing of vehicle registration data under the decisions; specific provisions for sharing Irish vehicle registration data with other member states; specific provisions for Ireland to access vehicle registration data held by other member states; and data protection provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054"> The decisions require each member state to designate a national contact point for the sharing of vehicle registration data under the decisions. As the statutory holder of the information in question is the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Bill will name the Minister as the national contact point for the purposes of sharing this data. The decisions also require that persons involved in the actual processing of data exchange under the decisions should be authorised, named individuals. The Bill will allow me, as Minister, to designate individuals as the authorised persons to process data under the decisions. These may be either officials of my Department - the people who already manage the data - or members of An Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055"> The second area in the Bill sets out specific measures relating to access to Irish data for the national contact points of other member states. In line with limits and safeguards set out in the decisions, a search of the Irish data may be made only with a full registration number or a full vehicle identification number, VIN. The purpose for which a search may be made is limited to prevention and investigation of criminal offences. The Bill also sets out the content of any reply, and limits its use by the receiver to the purpose for which it was supplied and to keeping records of data sharing under the Prüm decisions. The keeping of such records is a requirement to enable examination and verification that data protection rules are being respected.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056"> The third area of the Bill involves searches by Ireland of vehicle registration data held by other member states. It applies much the same rules; conduct of searches by full registration or VIN and use of the data solely for the purpose for which it was supplied or for keeping records of data-sharing. In this case, as we consider searches which are part of investigations of crimes in Ireland, the Bill allows the sharing of the data with the courts, An Garda Síochána and the Director of Public Prosecutions, or other appropriate bodies but only with the consent of the State, which supplied the data. As will be clear to anybody who looks at the Prüm decisions, data protection must be at the heart of any process such as this. Those familiar with EU data protection law will be aware that the current EU legislation on data protection - reflected in Irish law under the Data Protection Act 1988 - is due to be replaced in May of this year by a new legal framework. This new framework consists of the general data protection regulation and the Policing Directive. As Prüm is a law enforcement measure the Policing Directive is the part of the new legislative framework which would naturally apply. In preparing the new legislation, however, the EU decided specifically to exclude Prüm from the new framework and require the continued application of existing data protection law. The Policing Directive, therefore, explicitly states that it does not apply to Prüm and that existing legislation will continue to apply. The practical effect is that the Bill must and does state that the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1988 apply to data sharing under Prüm. This is not all. The Prüm decisions themselves impose specific obligations on the data protection authorities of member states. These relate to monitoring of data sharing under the decisions and to processing of complaints from individuals who may believe that their data should not have been shared or that data shared may have been inaccurate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1057"> Additional measures include the requirement on the national contact point to maintain records of data sharing under the decisions for two years and then delete such records, to carry out random checks on those records, and to produce the records of such checks on request by the Data Protection Commissioner, DPC. There are specific provisions for the correction of inaccurate data and the deletion of data which should not have been supplied. The DPC is also given specific responsibility for monitoring data sharing under the decisions and for carrying out random checks on such data sharing. Individuals may ask the DPC to investigate the legality of the sharing of their data, and the DPC is also empowered to engage with the data protection authorities in other member states to ensure proper investigation of complaints, whether those complaints emanate from within the State or from another member state.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058"> The provisions of this Bill have been carefully examined and drafted to ensure that they meet the requirements of EU law, both in terms of the decisions made and in the context of data protection. We need to pass this Bill into national law to enable compliance with EU law and to proceed to data-sharing under the decisions and thereby avoid being found to have infringed EU law. I appreciate that this short Bill does not make for easy reading. It is a Bill, however, that will be beneficial to law enforcement in Ireland, as well as in the rest of Europe, and it is important for that reason. It is a requirement of EU law and is something our EU partners are eager to see completed. I thank the House again for its consideration and I would appreciate the passage of this Bill as soon as possible in order to enable us to comply with Ireland's EU obligations.</p>

          <p eId="para_1060">The Minister concluded by asking for the support of the House for as swift a passage of the Bill as possible. We will not be found wanting on this side of the House. We support the Bill and we see it as a common-sense approach to cracking down on crimes in our State and in other member states. Ireland was supposed to implement the Prüm decision by August 2011, so it is well overdue. Despite purporting to be the party of law and order, Fine Gael has sat on its hands for almost seven years and failed to implement what is needed. Rapid improvement in road and other transport infrastructure has made it easier and easier for criminals to move within and across jurisdictions. Within Ireland, there has been a large spike in the number of travelling criminal gangs using the motorway network to move quickly between parts of the country. It is vital, therefore, that we make every effort to keep pace with criminals who are exploiting every available technology and opportunity to prey on innocent citizens. We need to be proactive and innovative in our fight against crime and this ratification represents just one step we need to take to keep our citizens safe.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061"> The Prüm decisions allow authorities in each member state, and Iceland and Norway, to search each other's national databases of vehicle registrations, DNA fingerprints, information to the EU's vehicle and transport network. I understand from the Minister's speech that DNA and fingerprinting will come on board at a later stage and we are only dealing with vehicle registration today. Perhaps he could clarify.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062"> The Bill designates the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport as the national contact point for receiving and processing requests for vehicle registration data and it designates the authorities with the power to conduct the searches of databases, which will be selected members of An Garda Síochána and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. Many of the provisions of the Bill relate to ensuring that the data supplied in this database is protected and correct. Member states must make all reasonable efforts to identify incorrect data and amend it. It must also delete any data that is received erroneously, for example, in cases where a search is conducted for a mistyped vehicle identification number. Searches may be conducted for the following purposes: the prevention and investigation of criminal offences; dealing with other offences coming under the jurisdiction of another member state; and maintaining public liability.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063"> As regards dealing with other offences in the jurisdiction of certain member states, courts or prosecution services, it states that transport and driving regulations in some EU member states are treated as administrative, rather than criminal legal matters but breaches can, nevertheless, be punished as offences. Can the Minister clarify what member states this relates to for traffic or driving regulations? According to Oireachtas research, certain EU member states' transport and driving regulations are treated as administrative rather than criminal legal matters. Can the Minister clarify whether, in certain member states, driving offences will be covered under this?</p>
