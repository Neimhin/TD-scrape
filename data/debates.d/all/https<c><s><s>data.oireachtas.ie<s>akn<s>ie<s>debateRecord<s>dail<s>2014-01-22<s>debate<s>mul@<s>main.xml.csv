#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	0	I ask the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform the actions he is taking to ensure all top-up payments over and above taxpayer funded salaries paid by agencies contracted by the State are ceased. The Minister will be aware that ten months ago the HSE produced a report on 44 organisations, which his Department received last July. To date, only eight of the 44 organisations are compliant with public sector pay guidelines. What has the Minister been doing for the past ten months?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	Government pay policy is clear that remuneration rates for public servants must be appropriately approved and sanctioned in advance of payment. Pay policy is underpinned by administrative and legislative requirements. In the majority of cases remuneration rates for public servants must be approved by the relevant line Minister, subject to my consent as Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. It is a matter for each Accounting Officer to ensure only those remuneration rates which are appropriately sanctioned and approved are in payment in Departments and agencies under their aegis. In regard to the recent revelations on additional unsanctioned payments being made in the health sector, to which the Deputy referred, my Department has supported the work of the Department of Health and the HSE, as well as the work of my Oireachtas colleagues on the Committee of Public Accounts, in addressing the payment of unsanctioned amounts in the section 38, Health Act, agencies and will continue to do so, as appropriate. While my Department creates the policy on payments and sanctions the salary rates within the health sector, it cannot monitor implementation or audit compliance. It is properly a matter in the first instance for the Department of Health and HSE to ensure Government policy on pay is being complied with. I am aware also that the Deputy has a particular interest in two agencies under the auspices of my Department - the Economic and Social Research Institute and the Institute of Public Administration - about which he asked me last week and which are in receipt of additional non-Exchequer income. These bodies have confirmed that no additional top-up payments are being paid to employees in these organisations.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	2	I thank the Minister for his short reply. Essentially, he has passed the buck. Everybody is responsible and nobody is responsible at the same time is the response of his Department. He has said he sets a policy but that it is not up to him to implement it. There is no point in having a policy if there is no mechanism in place to implement it. It is just words on paper if it is not implemented. As the Minister knows, the internal HSE audit report on the 44 organisations was published in March last year and went to his Department over the summer, but he did nothing about it until the matter came up at the Committee of Public Accounts. His Department was aware of it. The Minister should have been making the line Department deal with the issue. That is his function. It is not his job to involve himself in the 44 organisations, but it is certainly his job to make the Department of Health do so. That Department has not got to the bottom of this issue. This is not just a matter for the HSE in that we have seen top-up payments and salaries exceeding pay policy in third level institutes and in various other bodies.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	3	This is the first Government to establish a clear pay policy which is undoing the ad hoc policies of previous Administrations over decades, Administrations which did not know or certainly did not care who was paying what to whom. That is now being rectified, but it cannot be done overnight. My Department which is new is responsible for setting the pay norms. However, there are 30,000 public servants and there is a variety of line Departments with their own Accounting Officers who are statutorily and constitutionally charged with doing this job. Unless the Deputy wants all of them to be set down and my Department to run every aspect of the public service and every agency of the State, we will have to do this in the systematic way we have set out. The Deputy is quite wrong in his assertion that everybody is responsible and nobody is responsible at the same time. We are getting to the bottom of this issue. The lines of responsibility are clear in unveiling it. The HSE and the Department of Health are pursuing the matter actively with my full support. Of course, there is a role for the committees of this House and the Committee of Public Accounts which is doing a good job in ensuring public pay policy is implemented.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	4	Every Member of the House agrees that there should not be top-up payments. The policy is not being implemented and it will be a very difficult process to get to the bottom of this issue in every line Department. I know it is not the Minister's job to micro-manage Departments, but it is his job to ensure their Accounting Officers are doing theirs. The Minister has said that in the past people did not know or care. A week ago at a meeting on the Estimates I asked him about possible top-up payments in the Institute of Public Administration and the Economic and Social Research Institute. I never suggested there were; I just wanted confirmation. However, the Minister did not know or care and could not answer the question. It has taken him eight days to answer it. He did not know or care about his own line Department until I put the question to him last week.  Does the Minister agree that we need legislation to deal with this matter to put it to bed once and for all?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	5	We have an array of legislation dealing with these matters. What we need is full transparency and that is what we are trying to achieve. A particular issue has arisen in regard to the section 38 and 39 agencies under the Health Act. There was an opaqueness in the degree of oversight and transparency with which these agencies which were independent but contracted to the HSE to provide services operated, but that day is over. We need to know exactly on what they are spending the money and what people are being paid in order that we can evaluate whether value for money is being achieved for the State. That process is well in train.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	6	My question refers to the ban on performance bonuses for the chief executives of commercial semi-State companies which has been in place since 2011. It also asks straightforwardly whether the Minister has lifted that ban or whether it continues. He might enlighten us on how long he envisages the ban continuing, if it is still in place. Will he refer, in particular, to Irish Water and the considerable public controversy surrounding the bonus payments proposed in that company?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 4 together. I thank the Deputy for the question. In 2012 the Government reviewed the position on the payment of performance-related awards or bonuses for chief executive officers in commercial semi-State companies and agreed, on my recommendation, to continue with the policy we had introduced in 2011 of requesting the State companies concerned not to award such bonus payments in the light of the serious state of the public finances.Furthermore, the Government agreed to continue the practice of excluding the payment of bonus provisions in the employment contracts of any newly appointed chief executives to such state companies as well as in respect of contract renewals for incumbent chief executives. The requirement to cease such forms of bonus payment, together with other basic salary reductions introduced by the Government in respect of the chief executives of state companies, was necessitated by the difficult financial and economic circumstances we have faced. Accordingly, the Government will continue to consider future policy developments on performance-related pay to chief executives in the light of prevailing circumstances. I have no role in the performance-related award schemes for staff below chief executive level in commercial State companies. It is expected that the boards of these organisations act responsibly in designing and implementing a pay structure that drives performance while ensuring they are fully compliant with Government pay policy. It is a matter of Government policy that performance-related award schemes continue to be suspended on an indefinite basis for the non-commercial state companies. Access to such schemes is no longer included in the employment contracts for newly appointed chief executives or in contract renewals for incumbent chief executives of non-commercial semi-states. It is a matter for parent Departments in the first instance to ensure that all bodies under their aegis are compliant with the set-out Government policy.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	The Minister has repeated the fact that he has no role in bonus payments to people in roles below that of chief executive. I wonder out loud whether the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, are aware of that, because they had a good deal to say on the matter on the public airwaves. Perhaps the Minister said it and I missed it. Will he confirm whether it is his intention, notwithstanding the change to contracts for incoming chief executives, to continue this ban on bonus payments for current serving chief executives? If it is to continue, then for how long? The figure of €7,000 as an average proposed bonus payment to workers in Irish Water has gained considerable traction in the media. I note this is an average payment. Has the Minister more information on where exactly these specific bonus payments might fall? What might be the maximum bonus? What might be the minimum bonus anticipated for the workforce?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	There are two questions. The first question was on chief executives. The policy we introduced in 2011 not to give performance-related pay to chief executives stays in place. I promised the Cabinet that I would review it annually. We reviewed it in 2013 and there was a determination that we continue with it because of economic circumstances. We will continue to review it periodically. I believe we should get back to performance-related pay but we should have clear commercial targets set for the commercial semi-State companies. Where those targets are exceeded there might be a bonus remuneration added to chief executives' pay. A question was asked about Irish Water. Bord Gáis Éireann and the staff group of unions have delivered on a transformational programme on pay, pensions and allowances under a programme that aims to save a total of €12 million in payroll costs. One element is allowance reform - that is, the discontinuance of legacy arrangements and allowances that used to be paid. This was implemented by the company throughout 2012 and delivered an estimated saving of €2.3 million to the company last year.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	I thank the Minister for the background information on Bord Gáis Éireann. However, I am asking specifically about Irish Water. It is necessary to have clarity in the public domain on this matter, because a figure of €7,000, as an average, has been cited. Perhaps the Minister does not have the detail today and, if not, I am asking him to get it as soon as he can and to report it to us. What is the envisaged maximum payment under the scheme? What is the envisaged minimum payment? No more than anywhere else, in Irish Water not every staff member is on the same salary level or arrangement. If there is to be a public discussion on bonuses in the new utility, it is only fair, rather than giving an average figure, that we have clear information on the maximum and minimum. If the Minister cannot answer me today, he might give an undertaking to get that information for us. Does the Minister envisage that the ban on bonuses for chief executives would come to an end in 2016? I note that is the timeline referred to by the chief executive of Irish Water in respect of what he called a pay freeze at the utility.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	There are several questions. The questions the Deputy asked about Bord Gáis Éireann are more appropriate to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. He is the line Minister with responsibility in that area and he has the detailed knowledge. I set Government policy on a cross-sectoral basis. As I have indicated to the House, I do not have responsibility for commercial semi-State company staff below the level of chief executive. Deputy McDonald is right: we need to have a debate about this. We need to decide whether we want commercial semi-State companies. I do. We need to allow them to operate in a commercial way and to structure performance-related pay in a way that delivers best for the company and, ultimately, for the shareholder - that is, the taxpayer. There is an issue in respect of transparency and that should be examined. Anyway, the company is migrating from bonus payments or increment payments to a performance-related payment on a commercial basis.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	I understand that. I am simply looking for information on the average payments of €7,000.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	As I said, the detailed information would be properly provided by the line Minister responsible, in this case the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	What about the 2016 issue?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	Sorry, we are over time.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	16	I do not know about the other question. That was the agreement reached in Bord Gáis Éireann on the pay freeze. In fact, I am told the pay freeze will last until December 2015 in BGE. I presume that was simply a three-year horizon, similar to the negotiations on the Haddington Road agreement. One must take a horizon of a reasonable period. I hope our economy will have improved at that stage to allow for consideration of wages in the economy generally.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	17	Is that a "Yes"?
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	18	I asked the question because recent events have demonstrated that there is an urgent need for total quality management and more productive and efficient outcomes in State and semi-State bodies.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	19	I thank the Deputy for the question. There have been major efficiency and productivity gains in the public service in recent years. New working arrangements have been introduced, including longer working hours, new rosters - some of which have not been changed in 30 years - and standardised arrangements for annual leave and sick leave. The numbers working in the public service have been reduced by over 30,000 since 2008. At this stage, the public service is at 2005 staffing levels, while the Exchequer pay bill has been reduced from €17.5 billion in 2009 to an estimated €13.5 billion for 2014 net of the pension-related deduction. These and other areas of progress were set out in the detailed progress report on public service reform, which I published last week and circulated to all Deputies. Public service reform will remain a key element of the Government's strategic response to the ongoing challenges we face. It is in this context that a new public service reform plan 2014-16 was published last week. Again, I have sent a copy to everyone in the House. The next phase of reform will continue to focus on cost reduction. However, it will also focus on better outcomes for service users and on delivering real improvements in how citizens and business customers interact with public services. Under the new plan the reform agenda will be about protecting and improving public services. Over the period of the plan there will be an emphasis on savings to invest. This is about freeing up resources by making existing processes more cost-effective and efficient and using the savings to invest in new and improved services. I have classified this as the reform dividend and it will underpin and sustain the reform agenda beyond the current crisis. We will be taking steps to ensure that the public service makes maximum use of digitisation and open data to deliver services. My time is almost up but I would be happy to deal with any supplementary questions the Deputy may have.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	20	The matter has been exemplified in the recent past with regard to the formation of Irish Water. We have a farcical situation whereby it will take a transitional period of 12 years to bring it to formation.Ireland is regarded as a First World country. The objective should be to reduce the period to three years. With the most modern technologies and with the experience and efficiencies at the disposal of councils, more responsibility should be given over to all local authorities. There is currently a surplus of engineers and crucial staff and such staff would be able to reduce it to a much shorter period of perhaps three years.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	21	I understand the Deputy's concern, but Irish Water will be the biggest utility and the biggest State company to be established in my political lifetime. Nothing like it has happened since the establishment of the ESB. A similar process in Northern Ireland on a much smaller scale took the bones of 20 years to fully implement. We want to ensure that the services are not discommoded. That is the reason we have arranged for service-level agreements with every local authority. Some would say we should have been more robust in negotiating those agreements, but we wanted to bring a harmonious migration of local authority employees under the wing of this new important utility. There is a convincing case - not for me to make now - for establishing a proper utility to ensure we have a safe water supply. The nexus of the Deputy's question is transformational focus on efficiencies within the public service. I refer to the reform agenda and the progress report which we published last week on shared services, procurement, property management, downsizing and changes in rosters and sick leave. These measures have been transformational and of significant benefit to the State.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	22	I believe we are wasting a fortune in this exercise. I reiterate my point about the bonus systems which has been raised by other Members. Because of the culture in this country we would not have the integrity or the competitiveness to control bonus systems in the first place. Who will adjudicate such a system for top-up payments if it is put in place? We must face the reality that this country is bankrupt and we cannot afford a figure of €85 million in consultancy costs. I note the revelations about Coillte and the row about a top-up payment for the outgoing chief executive officer. In defiance of ministerial orders they have given a very substantial sum, in the region of €56,000. We need to put a stop to this immediately.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	We need to have a debate about performance-related pay. It is easy to talk about the notion of bonus payments as being unacceptable. Performance-related pay is the norm in the commercial sector. All commercial companies set targets and reward people who over-achieve and there are consequences for those who under-achieve. A fortnight ago I published a new performance analysis document for public consultation to establish accountability in the public service for performance, to set targets, to have a fair and objective monitoring system for those targets and to remunerate public servants appropriately. We need a debate about performance-related pay, not to say that performance-related pay should never be given. I have made it clear that we cannot afford such pay now and it is not provided for in the Civil Service nor in the non-commercial semi-State sector. I have indicated to the Deputy previously that at the moment it is not provided for with regard to chief executive officers of commercial semi-State companies.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	24	Question No. 4 is in the name of Deputy Sean Fleming.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	25	This question relates to bonus payments in the commercial and non-commercial semi-State sector. The Minister has dealt with the issue of payments to chief executive officers but I ask him to say what approval is given by his Department to the line Ministers to approve schemes in organisations under their remit. I refer in particular to State monopoly companies such as Irish Water, Iarnród Éireann and EirGrid.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	26	I answered Questions Nos. 2 and 4 together. I will not give the Deputy the same answer that I gave to Question No. 2. I suggest that I will not read the reply again but I will be happy to answer supplementary questions. The position I set out is that chief executive officers are not given performance-related pay. This was our decision in 2011 when we came into government. As I have indicated, it is not fixed in stone forever. Because of the current pressures on the public finances we cannot accede to payments, but we will review this policy. I am pleased to have this opportunity to explore the implications. For example, there are people who would be immeasurably beneficial as chief executive officers of commercial State companies who are paid much more in the private sector. We must ensure we can attract people who will perform well into semi-state companies with a commercial mandate. Such people may bring multiple benefits to the company and to the State. We must use methods that are measurable and reasonable. Unfortunately, it is not possible in the current economic climate to breach the reduced pay levels we have set in the revised pay rates since 2011, as I have indicated to Deputies. That will remain the situation until our financial circumstances improve a great deal.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	27	At the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts last week it was made very clear that the bonus scheme in Irish Water was part of the Bord Gáis bonus scheme, which was approved by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, and which had been notified to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The Minister's Department is in the loop. The cuts under the FEMPI legislation are in place. It in incongruous that civil servants are still suffering cuts under the FEMPI legislation while various line Ministers are approving bonus schemes for other public servants in the commercial semi-state sector delivering public services. The issue of the State monopoly companies should be examined separately as the Minister regards them as a different case from the other commercial semi-state bodies.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	28	The Deputy has asked a number of relevant questions. The FEMPI legislation applies to public servants on the public payroll, Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Judiciary, teachers, nurses and civil servants alike. Under the most recent FEMPI legislation, those earning over €65,000 took a pay cut. That was necessary in order to reduce the public pay bill. The Deputy asked why I would not apply the same logic to the commercial semi-state companies; it is for the very reason that they are commercial companies. We have to set standards of moderation in pay across the economy as best we can. This is normally done by means of taxation policy. I have given an indication of moderation through the cap on pay for chief executive officers that we imposed from 2011. However, companies must have the flexibility to make pay arrangements that meet their commercial needs. I will give an example in my reply to the next question.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	29	I did not say they were directly comparable; rather, I think it is incongruous. I understand the differences. Employees of local authorities are subject to FEMPI cuts. If you have now gone on secondment to Irish Water, you can get a bonus and migrate back to your local authority in a year or two depending on your secondment arrangement. There is a difficulty there. We talk about transferability of people not just within the Civil Service but across the broader public service. That issue needs to be examined.  I come back to the issue of the monopolies. Irish Water is a monopoly. While it must operate on a commercial basis, I would hope every Government Department and non-commercial semi-State body operates to good commercial practices. We should not to mix up achieving value for money and being in the competitive commercial world. Could the Minister address the issue of State monopolies that are not really out in the commercial world. 
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	30	We expect all State companies to operate in a commercial manner. These are technical deliverers of services. We have a very ambitious programme. It is not for me to give the Deputy the case for the creation of Irish Water but I am very strongly in favour of it. We have a situation where 18,000 individuals are on a "boil water" notice. There are a million households whose water is vulnerable because of inadequate supply. A third of wastewater plants are subject to concerns of the EPA and may fall foul, if I may use that phrase, of the European Commission. We need to invest in our water treatment and water provision system in an integrated way like the rest of western Europe so we need to have this. Irish Water is unique in terms of pay because it is migrating from a number of local authority entities to one State entity and there is a transition that makes it unique. We need to have regard to that and also to the general principle that all companies in the State sector are expected to operate in a commercial way.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	31	My question refers to the Minister's stated intention to reduce public sector staff numbers by 10,000 whole-time equivalents by 2015. Could the Minister set out how he intends to progress this commitment regarding these public sector worker reductions. Could he tell us how many of these he envisages coming from the health sector and whether he intends to initiate another incentivised redundancy scheme in the lifetime of this Government? Could he provide details of any new hires that are envisaged, when they will be brought into the system and where they might be targeted?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	32	Budget 2014 sets out a revised target for public service numbers of 287,000 by the end of this year. With serving numbers already below 289,000, this is a lower net reduction than in previous years, reflecting the fact we have already downsized a huge amount and the public service is now almost 10% smaller than it was in 2008. The appropriate path beyond 2014 will be considered as part of this year's comprehensive review of expenditure, which will examine public spending and resource issues in the context of the fiscal parameters, service demands and the reform and efficiency opportunities arising from the new public service reform plan, which I launched last week. With regard to the health service, it is required to deliver a modest 1% reduction in head count during this year, which reflects a significant readjustment of the previously set target. In education, in acknowledgement of the growing needs in the classroom, serving numbers are actually profiled to increase by over 1,200 posts in 2014. As part of this, provision was made in the last budget for 960 additional resource teachers by the end of 2014. As I mentioned, public service numbers have been reduced by almost 10% in the last five years. The approach to public service numbers reduction has been informed by financial necessity, of course, and also by recognition of the significant opportunity to reform work practices and business processes to rationalise the number of State agencies and to introduce money-saving initiatives such as shared services. As a result, the public service today is more efficient and effective than before the crisis and for that, the contribution of those working across the system must be acknowledged. I acknowledge the work of all public servants who are valued.  The new reform objectives will also help drive change in the way the public service is organised and how it delivers its back office functions. To give just one example, PeoplePoint, the HR and pensions shared services centre, became operational last March and is now servicing over 15,000 employees across 13 organisations. When fully operational, PeoplePoint will provide services to 40 organisations with savings estimated at €12.5 million annually. This example, and there are others, shows how service levels cart be maintained, and in some cases improved, with reduced numbers. I have made reference to the idea of a reform dividend. I had a chance to begin discussion on that at the committee last week. I will be happy to expand in response to the Deputy's question.

It is about understanding that reform and efficiency drives are about improving public services, not reducing them, and that the dividend comes from identifying and tackling waste and inefficiency and making savings - savings which can then be used to invest in areas that work best for the citizen. What is important over the medium term, therefore, is to continue to introduce new ways of doing business and to make the best use of new technology and of shared services so that we have a public service that is affordable, that is consistent with a sustainable fiscal position and that works for our citizens. This is the best way of protecting front-line services in health and education and right across the public service.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	33	I note that the public service reform plan, which is the most recently published document from the Minister, cites an OECD study from 2010 which reflects the fact that prior to all of these cuts in the public sector, this State was beginning from a very low base in comparative terms in respect of the numbers of public sector employees. It is a point I made to the Minister very many times - a point that he rejected very many times - but I am very happy to see that this thought and analysis have found their way into his current thinking. The Minister has reduced his target of the number for reduction within the service by year end, which is welcome. In respect of the health service in particular, could the Minister be a bit more specific in his answer? At the Oireachtas Sub-Committee on Public Expenditure and Reform, I raised the fact that there is a crisis in the service, which is reflected in the trolley count numbers and many other indicators. Could the Minister be more forthcoming on that?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	34	When I spoke to the committee last week, I indicated that I was not fixated on numbers. Numbers were an instrument we had to employ to bring down costs. It is happening across every sector of the economy. People are not providing services in the same way. If one checks in with an airline, one does not normally do so in a queue with an array of people checking you in. One does so online or at a terminal at the airport. We are now providing more than 400 public services online and will greatly increase that number. The public service card is being rolled out this year. A total of 500,000 were offered last year and an additional 900,000 will be issued this year to make it much simpler and easier for citizens to access State services. That will reduce the necessity of having a huge number of people processing material that will be done electronically. That will allow us to do what I have described as having a reform dividend. We are not simply going to bank all the savings. We will re-invest a portion of them in better front-line services.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	35	The Minister has drawn that analogy with checking in with an airline many times but the simple fact is that the majority of public services are not comparable to checking in with Aer Lingus or any other airline operator. No offence to the Minister but I do not think that is a good comparison to draw. The fact is that front-line services are under huge pressure and that although the Minister now says he has no fixation with numbers, he and his predecessors have had an absolute fixation with numbers. I take it that he has moved from this target of a reduction of 10,000 whole-time equivalent posts by the end of 2015 and envisages a cut of 2,000 posts this year. I do not know what figure he envisages for next year. How is that to be done? I initially asked him about an incentivised redundancy scheme. Is that in his thinking? When would it come about and would it be targeted?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	36	Again, the Deputy has asked a number of questions. She disputes the contention that the majority of services are analogous to checking in with an airline. There are front-line services that are not analogous but there are many process services that are such as renewing a driving licence and all the other things one does automatically that can be done much more effectively and efficiently. We are doing that. That gives us the capacity to supplement the front-line services.Having that capacity has allowed me to sanction the recruitment of gardaí again this year. We will increase the number of gardaí. The general number of workers in the public service will not diminish this year by the volume we initially outlined. We will utilise the reform dividend - the savings we are making by providing general services more efficiently - by churning it into better front-line services. There will be more teachers in schools. As I said, we will have an additional 1,200 resource teachers this year and there will be more gardaí on the streets. I have mentioned that we are beginning to recruit gardaí again after many years of not being able to do so. That is the approach I want to take. I do not want to take a crude approach.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	37	It has been reported that officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are helping to oversee the budget and expenditure of the Department of Health. If that is the case, perhaps the Minister might take the opportunity to give us some details. How many officials are involved? To whom do they report? Will they publish reports?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	38	I thank the Deputy. One principal officer, two assistant principal officers and two administrative officers are assigned to the health Vote section within the labour and enterprise division in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The Vote section is managed by an assistant secretary as part of his overall brief.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	39	Is the Department of Health being treated differently from other Departments? Are the officials mentioned by the Minister working full-time in the Department of Health? Will they report to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform? When did their oversight start and will the results of their work be published?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	40	No, this is not unique to the Department of Health. An assigned individual or group of civil servants from the expenditure division of the old Department of Finance used to monitor the Vote of each line Department. That has always been the way it has been done. Every year Departments and offices set out their expected profile of expenditure on a month by month basis. During the course of the year each Department and office reports monthly to my Department on the actual performance against the expenditure profile set out. I bring these to the Government which now looks at departmental expenditure on a monthly basis. It does not take a huge amount of time for us to do this. The bigger spending Departments such as the Department of Health take up more time than smaller spending Departments in terms of the focus of my Department. Although a Supplementary Estimate of just under €200 million was needed by the Department of Health, I am gratified that the out-turn figures for last year's general overall performance of all Departments show that we spent less than we had profiled. This singular achievement reflects well on line Departments and the monitoring of expenditure generally.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	41	Are these officials involved in making decisions? What authority do they have to make decisions or changes? Are they involved in macro-managing or micro-managing the expenditure and the budget of the Department of Health? In the energy expenditure area, for example, are they considering a move to combined heat and power plants in hospitals, a move which I understand would save approximately €20 million? At what level of detail are they looking?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	42	The specific work referred to by the Deputy is not carried out by the Vote section of my Department. It is carried out by the reform section. As the Deputy will be aware, we have reviewed how we procure across the public service. We decided last year to establish a centralised office of Government procurement. We have set a strict and specific target of €127 million across all sectors for procurement savings this year. A large chunk of that saving which will be made by means of better procurement models relates to the Department of Health. We have a target of saving €500 million through better procurement in the next three years. These ambitious targets will be driven by a different section in my Department - the office of Government procurement - which will work out a procurement plan across all Departments.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	43	As the Minister knows, the Opposition in this House refused to take part in the debate on the establishment of Irish Water because of the absolute dearth of information on this Government initiative. We found out a few days ago that as part of the expenditure of more than €200 million on the establishment of Irish Water, some 300 workers at Irish Water had been taken to a yoga laughter therapy workshop. Many citizens feel the people and this House are being laughed at. There is no accountability for this body through parliamentary questions, the freedom of information regime or the Comptroller and Auditor General. I would like the Minister to explain what he intends to do on the freedom of information front.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	44	As the Deputy knows, I have responsibility for the area of freedom of information. He is also aware that I indicated last December during the Committee Stage debate on the Freedom of Information Bill 2013 that it was my intention that Irish Water should be made subject to freedom of information legislation at an early stage following the enactment of that legislation. On the basis of recent developments instanced by the Deputy, following the commencement of the Irish Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 and taking into account the likely timetable for the enactment of the new Bill I am progressing through the House, I have concluded that arrangements should be made as expeditiously as possible for Irish Water to come under freedom of information legislation from its legal establishment date in 2013. Rather than awaiting the enactment of the new freedom of information Bill, I have decided to utilise the powers under the Freedom of Information Act 1997 in respect of Irish Water. The Act provides that in these circumstances a positive resolution of both Houses is required before an order can come into force and freedom of information legislation actually applies to the public body concerned. I propose, subject to the approval of each House of the Oireachtas in due course, to give Irish Water 30 days following the making of the order to make the administrative arrangements required to be fully compliant with freedom of information legislation.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	I welcome this announcement by the Minister. There is a sense of tremendous outrage. People feel that when the Government was deciding on the road it was going to go down, it adopted the wrong model by choosing Bord Gáis as the lead organisation in this regard. It is a question of a certain kind of semi-State culture. In fairly recent times we saw Pádraig McManus and other executives in the semi-State sector being paid more than €600,000 per annum. Will the freedom of information measure announced by the Minister be retrospective? Will Deputies be able to delve into spending already taking place such as the €86 million being spent on consultants and the €15.7 million being spent through the local authorities, as we heard last night? Will we know whether the local property tax has been utilised to fund this vast expenditure on the part of Irish Water? Will this measure be retrospective? Will the applicability of the freedom of information regime to this organisation be confined to a limited period? Some reports have suggested it will not extend beyond 2017. Will we be refused access to information on the affairs of Irish Water after that date on the basis of commercial sensitivity, etc.?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	46	The Deputy's first question was related to whether this would be retrospective. It is my intention to provide for the inclusion of Irish Water in the freedom of information regime from its date of legal establishment as a subsidiary of Bord Gáis Energy - 17 July 2013. I have instructed my officials to prepare an order to that effect. I hope we can provide time for it to be considered next week, if the House is agreeable and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government has cleared the drafting of the order.  The Deputy's second question was related to whether Irish Water would be covered by the freedom of information regime for a temporary period. When I was asked the same question at a press conference last week, I indicated that I did not think the freedom of information regime should be like the hokey cokey, with people stepping in and out again. Once it is in, it will stay in, unless, of course, there is some issue to be dealt with in the future. It is certainly not our intention that there would be a competition.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	48	As long as it remains a monopoly - the absolute decision of the Government is that it will remain a State monopoly - it should be subject to freedom of information legislation.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	On the related matter of parliamentary questions in this House, we are familiar with the very unsatisfactory performance of Departments like the Department of Health when we inquire about HSE matters and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport when we inquire about Irish Rail matters.Deputies who inquire about matters related to State or semi-state bodies, such as the Health Service Executive or Irish Rail, are referred to the relevant organisation, which will then provide some fragmentary information after a long period has elapsed. Given his responsibility for reform of the public service, is the Minister also interested in doing something to address this matter?  I note the clár features a Bill in the name of the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts which relates to accountability to the Comptroller and Auditor General. Will the Minister also pursue this matter?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	50	The Deputy's first set of questions, which relate to the processes of the House, are more appropriate to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or Oireachtas Commission, probably the former. While I will be mindful of any recommendation emanating from the House, as a member of the Government I should not dictate the manner in which people are held to account in the Houses. We have had solid evidence in recent weeks that the new committee system is working effectively and there is growing confidence that State companies can be brought before the line committee, whether in the area of the environment, health or anything else, to be asked probing questions. This should be the norm in terms of parliamentary activity and I suspect that will be the case.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	51	As Deputy Lucinda Creighton, who tabled Question No. 8, is not present, we will move on to Question No. 9.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	52	The purpose of the question is to elicit the Minister's views on whether the State is achieving value for money for taxpayers from the current privatisation programme. I refer to the sale of Bord Gáis Energy, a number of ESB power plants for which payment to the State will be made by way of dividend, and the national lottery licence. I also ask him to outline the use to which the funds raised will be put, including whether they will be used for debt reduction purposes. The Government spoke of using the proceeds from the privatisation of State assets for job creation. I understand the Government is considering using some of the proceeds for a redundancy programme - in other words, to pay for job losses. I ask the Minister to comment.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	53	As I informed the House on a number of occasions, in disposing of State assets it is a primary concern of the Government that value is secured for the Exchequer and fire sales are avoided. As we demonstrated at an earlier stage of the Bord Gáis Energy transaction, Ministers are fully prepared to stop a transaction process if we consider that bids received are not delivering acceptable value.   That said, I am happy that value is being achieved in the transactions that have been completed or brought close to completion. Subsequent to our decision that value was not apparent in the Bord Gáis Energy transaction, revised bids were received which offered materially increased value for the company.  A consortium comprising Centrica plc, Brookfield Renewable Power Inc and iCON Infrastructure has been selected as preferred bidder for Bord Gáis Energy on the basis of its revised bid, which has an enterprise value of up to €1.12 billion. Furthermore, ESB's sale of its 50% shareholding in Marchwood Power in the United Kingdom in November achieved a price in excess of expectations, which should realise €140 million in dividends for the Exchequer this year. As to the use to which these funds will be put, the Deputy will be aware of the Government's consistent position that the funds released from asset disposals should be used, in one form or another, to support job-creating initiatives in the economy. At budget time, I factored a total of €110 million into the Estimates for 2014 in respect of projects supported from the sale of State assets. Of this sum, €45 million will fund part of the advance works associated with public private partnership projects. Specifically, €25 million will be spent on the Grangegorman project and €20 million on road public private partnerships.  The remaining €65 million will be spent on the continued roll-out of the additional Exchequer investment projects announced in 2013 in energy and schools.  Additional elements of this stimulus plan will be rolled out as the various asset sale transactions are completed and the proceeds are realised.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	54	Will the Minister provide a timetable for the receipt of €1.2 billion from the privatisation of Bord Gáis Energy, the parent company of Irish Water? The Government has demanded a dividend of €400 million from the ESB, of which €140 million has been achieved through the sale of a plant in the United Kingdom. I understand the company has decided to sell two power plants in the midlands to achieve the balance of the dividend. What are the expected proceeds from the sale of the national lottery this year? Until last year, the Government insisted that half the proceeds from the sale of State assets would be used for debt reduction. Now that the troika is no longer in town, will the Minister confirm that is no longer the case? Perhaps he does not wish to say that loudly as he did not refer to it this morning. I would welcome his views either way. I am concerned that the Minister is saying there are people on the public payroll with no job to do who should perhaps move on. He also stated he would consider using the proceeds of sales of State assets to pay for a redundancy programme. Using this income to eliminate rather than create jobs is new to me.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	55	I did not say that in any reply this morning. I will try to deal with the series of questions the Deputy asked. As to when we will receive the money from the sales of assets, the sales must first be signed off and concluded. Bids have been accepted but there is a process involved. For example, as we saw in the case of the national lottery licence, a secure transition of staff is required. This often requires the intervention of the Labour Court, ballots by staff members and so on, and takes a little while. For this reason, in the case of the national lottery, the issue has not yet been fully nailed down. While I cannot say definitively when the various transactions will be completed, the transactions involving the national lottery, Bord Gáis Energy and Marchwood Power should all be concluded this year. We must adhere to a process. As I have explained previously, we cannot bring all the money in the energy sector onto the public balance sheet in one year. We must comply with EUROSTAT requirements on such matters. As a result, the revenues will have an impact on more than one year's Exchequer returns.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	56	The Minister is essentially saying he wants to stage manage the timing of receipts from the sale of State assets to assist the budgetary process next year. There is an unexplained figure here. Despite the requirement for an adjustment of €3 billion last year, the Government announced an adjustment of €2.4 billion on budget day. Some of the balance of €600 million was made up using the proceeds from the sale of State assets. The Minister indicated previously that these proceeds would be used for a particular purpose. He now says some will be held off until next year to help the budget next Christmas. Perhaps the adjustment in next October's budget will be very light given that the Government proposes to deliberately hold back proceeds from the sale of State assets to help meet deficit targets next year. I ask the Minister to address redundancies in the public service, an issue to which he did not refer. The Minister for the Environment, Communications and Local Government has spoken in the House about leaks, boil-water notices and vulnerable water supplies. Why not use the proceeds from the sale of the parent company of Irish Water, Bord Gáis Éireann, to fix water problems, rather than wait for water charges to be introduced to every household to fund such works?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	57	The Deputy has asked a number of questions and put a twist on what I said. Legally, I cannot transfer all the money from sales of State assets to the balance sheet this year. It is not a matter of choice but a requirement under EUROSTAT rules. On deficit reductions, some countries - I will not refer to individual states by name - proposed an enormous sale of state assets as a bookkeeping exercise to balance their books. The problem with this approach is that while balancing the books in one year through income from such sales is well and good, what does one do the following year? EUROSTAT requires states to use a mathematical formula based on the dividend paid by the State company in question as the maximum a country can account for on its books on an annualised basis. We must comply with European regulations in these matters. The proceeds from the sale of State assets will give us the capacity to introduce a further stimulus plan. Some of the very good projects cited by the Deputy could be considered when we receive additional Exchequer moneys to spend on capital works.

The Minister will be aware that serious difficulties that arose in Waterford are being replicated across the country as the rates revaluation process is rolled out nationwide. Businesses do not have the ability to meet the demands being placed on them. The purpose of Question No. 11 is to ascertain the Minister's views on the issue.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	63	The Government published the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 as part of its legislative programme. The Bill proceeded through Second Stage in Seanad Éireann in October 2012. Let me state the Bill will not change the basis of valuation for rating purposes. This will continue to be net annual value, NAV, the hypothetical rental value of a property as assessed by reference to a specified date. This is a long-standing principle of the rateable valuation scheme in Ireland and ensures equity and fairness in the values of commercial and industrial properties across local authorities. The main purpose of the Bill is to accelerate the national programme of revaluing every commercial and industrial property in the country which is being undertaken by the Valuation Office, as the Deputy stated. The Bill amends several provisions in the Valuation Act 2001. These amendments include a number of technical changes to Part 5 of the 2001 Act which deals with how valuations, including revaluation of entire rating authority areas, are carried out. The Bill also proposes to amend Part 6 which deals with the carrying out of revisions of the rateable valuation of individual properties within rating authority areas. I am mindful of the concerns and have met people from Waterford regarding this matter. The difficulty is that there has not been a revaluation in such a long period of time. We need a quick and expeditious revaluation, regular valuation after this and a robust appeals process to ensure that where anomalies arise, they are addressed.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	64	I accept that there has not been a revaluation in some time, but in 2013 the rates for one business in Waterford were €2,963. In 2014 this figure will increase to €7,647, a difference of 158%. For another business the amount payable was €4,373, which will increase to €10,080, an increase of 131%. One gets nothing for this any more because one must pay extra for water, the refuse service and in car parking charges. One cannot ask a business to sustain this increase. The business community does not understand the process or how the Valuations Office has reached these new NAV amounts. Transparency needs to be improved. Appeals take more than 12 months to complete and they involve delays and hassle. We have tried to curtail costs in many areas of business, but this is a cost over which businesses have no control and for which they get nothing in return. They face increases of 158% and 131%. A survey of 60 businesses in Waterford showed the average increase was 62%.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	65	The Deputy will only hear complaints from those who properties have been valued upwards, not downwards. There is an anomaly in the case of people who maintain a high rate of valuation which cannot be justified. One cannot collapse everybody down because that would hollow out the rateable base of the local authorities and impoverish them. I will give specific examples. In south County Dublin 49% of ratepayers had their rates reduced, while 39% had them increased. In Fingal County Council 65% were reduced, while 30% increased. The Ceann Comhairle might be interested to hear that in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown 54% were reduced, while 46% were increased. We need a balance. The dilemma was that there had not been a revaluation for so long. We had anomalies whereby the properties of some businesses were completely overvalued in the current climate, while some were completely undervalued. Migrating to fairness is difficult because those whose properties have been revalued downwards want immediate action, while those whose properties have been revalued upwards-----

Businesses cannot afford to lose at this stage. I wish to come back to the point on transparency on how the NAV is reached in various areas. Does Minister have plans to increase staff numbers in the Valuation Office, particularly to deal with appeals?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	67	We have halted the Bill to engage in extensive consultation. We have engaged in more consultation on this legislation than on any other legislation with which I have been charged since coming to office. It is in the Seanad and it is my intention to bring it to this House during this session when we will be able to answer all of these questions in detail. There is no simple solution because we are trying to address an historical legacy in terms of inaction in this area by having a proper rateable valuation system, including self-assessment and independent evaluation spot checks to ensure it is reasonable. We also want to have a robust and transparent appeals mechanism. It is my intention to put this in place.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	69	I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 25 together. Gross voted expenditure has been reduced from its peak of €63.1 billion in 2009 to €54.6 billion in 2013. This represents a reduction of approximately 13.5% between 2009 and 2013. Estimated Voted expenditure for 2014 will be in the region of €53 billion, with a targeted general Government deficit of 4.8%. We have made remarkable progress. This radical improvement in the sustainability of the public finances has helped to achieve our successful exit from the EU-IMF programme of financial assistance. It has been delivered through the efforts of all Ministers and Departments and their agencies to seek savings, pursue efficiencies and manage within constrained budgets, often while meeting increasing demands for the public services they deliver. In this respect, the public service reform plan has been an essential part of the Government's approach in addressing the challenges posed by reduced resources. The reform plan requires a refocus on business processes and adjustments to the way all public bodies use available resources. It promotes changes to the way individual public servants go about their daily work and greater flexibility in the way services are provided, for example, with greater use of technology and shared services. The Government is committed to making fundamental changes to the way the public service operates to safeguard the delivery of essential services in a way that is in keeping with the needs of a modern society, while driving and maintaining value for money. Managing the delivery of public services within its budgetary allocation is a key responsibility of each Minister. Several measures are in place to help ensure these budgetary targets continue to be met I have referenced some of them. The Department is in regular communication with all Departments and offices to ensure expenditure is controlled and we monitor their draw-down of funds from the Exchequer against the published expenditure profiles. Where necessary, the Department regularly meets line Departments to review financial management. There is regular reporting to the Government on these matters and we publish information monthly as part of the Exchequer statement. On the reform front, the Deputy will be aware of the public service reform plan published last week, together with a review of performance to date under the original plan. This shows the strong progress made to date by each Department and agency in pursuing the reform plan. Following last week's publication, Departments and offices are preparing new integrated reform delivery plans which comprise central cross-cutting reforms, as well as organisational and sectoral reforms, and outline the progress made in the implementation of the Haddington Road agreement. The plans will maintain a particular focus on increasing efficiency and improving outcomes for service users. Progress will continue to be monitored by the Department and reported on regularly to the Cabinet sub-committee.

Given that some Departments and services are demand-driven, is there particular recognition of their respective positions and those of the subsidiary bodies? To what extent do particular Departments receive unfavourable mention in this regard, notwithstanding what the Minister has just stated?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	71	In shaping the overall initial estimate we have regard to projected demand. It is part of the normal process and provided for.At the end of the day, if unavoidable demand has to be met, for example, in a 24-7 area such as the health service, we provide a Supplementary Estimate at the end of the year to meet the shortfall. Despite the best efforts of a Department, if it does not have the capacity to meet demand and we need to provide for it, additional resources must be allowed. We have done that each year we have been in government. However, there is a finite amount available to the State in terms of resources and in terms of what taxpayers can pay and their resistance to additional taxes that are imposed. We are always striking a balance and driving efficiencies is what people demand because the public hate waste. That is why there is always controversy when there is a perception we are not getting value for money.

Do the various bodies under the aegis of Departments continue to comply with Government policy in this regard? Are there obvious exceptions?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	73	No. With regard to pay, all the non-commercial State bodies are fully adherent to policy and we drive that. They are subject to FEMPI and so on. We have had a long debate regarding commercial semi-State bodies and they must operate in a commercial way but all the other agencies and bodies are carefully managed and scrutinised now by Departments and we have also implemented a strong rationalisation programme of State agencies over the past three years.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	74	There is general agreement there should be more openness about this process. We should agree on it and it is a question of how we go about making this happen. Some positions are referred to Oireachtas committees, for example, chief executive officer posts but we need to be more broad ranging and perhaps more people should be eligible for these posts and should apply through public advertisement.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	75	As the Deputy will be aware, open publicly advertised competition is a key principle of senior level appointments to posts across the public service reflecting the Government's commitment to ensure such posts, which are central to the effective performance of our system of public administration, are filled by high calibre candidates.  In my area of direct responsibility, recruitment into the civil service, including senior appointments, is by way of open competition and all recruitment competitions held by the Public Appointments Service, PAS, are advertised in one or more of the national papers or on the PAS website at: www.publicjobs.ie. Application forms, together with all relevant details, are made available when competitions are announced. Potential candidates can register their interest in a position on the PAS website and will then automatically be notified by e-mail when the competition is announced. With regard to senior level appointments to the Civil Service at above principal officer level, the Top Level Appointments Committee, TLAC, holds competitions for and advises Ministers and Government as appropriate on appointments to civil service posts at Secretary General, deputy secretary and assistant secretary and equivalent levels. Since early 2007 the policy has been that open competitions are held for assistant secretary and deputy secretary and equivalent posts and more recently this policy has been extended to Secretary General posts. With regard to recruitment to the wider public service, various Ministers, in accordance with the legislation setting up public service bodies or agencies under their aegis, are responsible for matters relating to senior appointments in those bodies. Clearly, the public interest is usually best served by opening public service posts to the widest pool of candidates. The Deputy will recall that the recent appointment of an Ombudsman was made following an open and public request I made for expressions of interest from appropriately qualified candidates.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	76	I thank the Minister. We are agreed on the principle but it is not being applied. The Minister mentioned his Department. Following Question Time, we will debate his appointments to the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO. I never saw the advertisements seeking people to be appointed as an ordinary member or as the new chairperson in the newspaper. The appointments were made in secret behind closed doors and we will rubber-stamp them in the House in a few minutes. I do not object to those who will be appointed but the process was not as outlined by the Minister in reply to this question. Where is the breakdown between his stated policy for his Department and his motion to appoint people to two senior State appointments? He flouted everything he said in his reply to make them. The board of Irish Water has been appointed. I did not see advertisements for board members. Fine Gael got a councillor on the board. I do not know whether the Labour Party gets a nominee but the Minister might inform us where all these advertisements were placed.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	77	We will debate the SIPO appointments in a minute. As the Deputy will be aware, these are restricted appointments. He has read the Act. The chairperson has to be a serving or former member of the Supreme Court or High Court. I received two formal applications from such qualified people and I recommended one for appointment. The other appointee must be a former or serving Member of the Oireachtas but not of the European Parliament. The outgoing appointee was a distinguished member of the Fianna Fáil Party and his predecessor was a distinguished member of the Labour Party. The nominee I propose is a distinguished former Member of the House representing the Fine Gael Party, which is the largest group in the House. That is a reasonable way of progressing such an appointment.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	78	I appreciate the Minister received applications. However, members of the public watching these proceedings heard the Minister refer to advertising posts but then he qualified that by stating these are restricted posts under legislation.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	79	That is the law.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	81	There are not many former Supreme Court or High Court judges.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	82	I have no objection to the gentleman and I will have no issue with the appointment. However, the impression the Minister gave is that all these posts are publicly advertised and when I pressed him on a particular post, he replied it was an exception under legislation. The public hear the good news but when the issue is teased out, that transpires not to be the case when one delves into particular appointments. I refer again to the most recent appointments, which were to the board of Irish Water. I never saw advertisements for this. That was a closed shop. Many of those on the board are Bord Gais employees or connected to political parties. The Minister will say this does not relate to his Department but we all agree on the principle of public sector reform and reform of the political system. Perhaps he will reinforce what he believes in discussions with his ministerial colleagues.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	83	I am restricted regarding the appointments that will come before the House shortly. However, I am reviewing the base legislation and we will debate that. I must be careful not to show disrespect for high office but I am not sure that the chairman of SIPO should necessarily be a former judge of the Supreme Court or High Court. We can examine that when we review the legislation. I am glad we have two distinguished and honourable representatives to fill the vacancies under the current legislative provision.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	84	I wish to advise the House of the following matters in respect of which notice has been given under Standing Order 27A and the name of the Member in each case: (1) Deputy Michael Moynihan - the need to protect public health in the locating of power lines; (2) Deputy Denis Naughten - the need to reinstate the acute psychiatric beds from St. Luke's acute unit Ballinasloe, County Galway; (3) Deputy Seán Ó Fearghaíl - a new strategy for the Abbey Theatre; (4) Deputy Charlie McConalogue - the latest developments surrounding reform of the junior certificate; (5) Deputy Pearse Doherty - the delay in determining a foreshore license application in respect of a proposed development project in Burtonport, County Donegal; (6) Deputy Áine Collins - the need to set up a banking system in An Post; (7) Deputy Shane Ross - the lack of premises for Gaelcholáiste an Phiarsaig, Dundrum, County Dublin; (8) Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett - the lack of premises for Gaelcholáiste an Phiarsaig, Dundrum, County Dublin; (9) Deputy Finian McGrath - new evidence on the Stardust fire tragedy; (10) Deputy Brian Stanley - the 2014 budget for local authority housing; (11) Deputy Patrick Nulty - the changes for the eligibility for new applications for housing adaptation grants and housing aid supports; (12) Deputy Billy Kelleher - overcrowding in hospital accident and emergency departments; (13) Deputy Mick Wallace - the financial difficulties faced by hauliers as regards the back taxing of vehicles; and (14) Deputy Thomas P.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	85	I move:That, pursuant to subsection (2A) (inserted by section 2 of the Standards in Public Office Act 2001 (No. 31 of 2001)), of section 21 of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 (No. 22 of 1995), Dáil Éireann recommends the appointment of Mr. Justice Daniel O’Keeffe, a former Judge of the High Court, by the President on the advice of the Government to be the chairperson of the Standards in Public Office Commission.That, pursuant to subsection (2)(b)(v) (inserted by section 2 of the Standards in Public Office Act 2001 (No. 31 of 2001)), of section 21 of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 (No. 22 of 1995), Dáil Éireann approves the proposed appointment by the Government of Mr. Jim O’Keeffe (being a former member of Dáil Éireann and not being a member of the European Parliament) to be an ordinary member of the Standards in Public Office Commission.I thank the House for the opportunity to debate these motions regarding the appointment of the chairperson and ordinary member of the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO.The Standards in Public Office Commission was established under the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995, as amended by the Standards in Public Office Act 2001. The standards commission supervises the operation of the ethics legislation, provides guidance and advice on compliance with it and investigates and reports on possible contraventions. The commission also has a supervisory role under the Electoral Acts in regard to political donations, reimbursement of election expenses and Exchequer funding of political parties and under the Oireachtas (Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Act 2001 it has a supervisory role regarding payments to the leaders of political parties. In response to the findings and recommendations of the final report of the Mahon tribunal, a project is being progressed by the Department to develop an integrated ethics Bill which will consolidate, modernise and simplify the existing legislative framework. The end result will be a much improved anti-corruption system in respect of ethics matters which will both control and regulate conflicts of interest in public life in Ireland. Substantial progress has been made to date on the project and development of draft heads of an integrated ethics Bill is well advanced. Further work and consultation with the Standards in Public Office Commission, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Oireachtas on the proposed approach are necessary. I will shortly be bringing proposals to Government on the general scheme of an ethics Bill. I will update the Government on progress made on the new ethics framework, including implementation of the Mahon tribunal recommendations in that context. The commission has six members. Four members are specified in the legislation, namely, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Ombudsman and the Clerks of the Dáil and Seanad. The chairperson of the commission is appointed by the President on the advice of the Government following a resolution of each House of the Oireachtas. An ordinary member is appointed by the Government following a resolution of each House. It would be remiss of me not to mention the outgoing members of the commission. Mr. Justice Matthew Smith was appointed Chairman in 2001 while still a High Court judge and was reappointed for a second term in 2007, having retired as a judge at the end of 2004. He served the country well in this important role and I would like to take this opportunity to thank him and wish him well in his retirement. I also thank the former Minister, Mr. Michael Smith, who served as an ordinary member since December 2007. The legislation requires that the chairperson of the commission be a judge or a former judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court. I am very pleased that Mr. Justice Daniel O'Keeffe, who retired from the High Court in 2008, has agreed to be nominated for appointment by the President as chairman of the commission. He is highly qualified and has extensive experience in statutory and corporate governance matters. When the standards commission was being set up in 2001, a provision for appointing a former Oireachtas Member was introduced following a recommendation by the Dáil Select Committee on Members' Interests. This recognises that the commission needs not only legal and administrative expertise but also the expertise that comes from service as a public representative. The Government is, therefore, very pleased that Mr. Jim O'Keeffe, who has long experience both as a Member of the Dáil and as a Minister of State, has agreed to be nominated for appointment by the Government as an ordinary member of the commission. Having worked with Jim on constitutional and law reform matters, I am sure his personal qualities and experience will be of great value to the commission. These appointments are an important measure in ensuring that the commission can continue its work and I have no hesitation in asking the House to approve the appointment by the President of Mr. Justice Daniel O'Keeffe as chairman of the Standards in Public Office Commission and the appointment by the Government of Mr. Jim O'Keeffe as ordinary member of the commission.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	86	I support the proposal to appoint Mr. Justice Daniel O'Keeffe as chairperson of the Standards in Public Office Commission and the former Member, Mr. Jim O'Keeffe from Cork South-Central, as an ordinary member of the commission. I know Mr. Jim O'Keeffe as a man of absolute integrity and I think everybody will be happy with his appointment. I cannot speak personally about Mr. Justice Daniel O'Keeffe but his name does not spring to mind for any particular problem and, as a former High Court judge, I am sure he is a man of good repute. The Standards in Public Office Commission currently deals with the ethics legislation, the Electoral Acts in regard to donations and the leaders' allowance, in respect of which legislation is forthcoming, and it will have a new role in auditing the allowances for Independent Members of both Houses. I do not think the public are fully aware that Independent Senators receive what is colloquially known as a leader's allowance. It was one of our best kept secrets but it will be dealt with under the new legislation, which we support. It was reported recently that the commission wants access to all party records not just those of head offices. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has one role in this, while the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has another. I understand certain branches of Fine Gael received €30,000 in donations in a particular year and that the money was kept in their accounts rather than going through head office. The commission has complained that it cannot get access to these accounts. Other parties in this House receive considerable amounts in funding from outside this State, including from across the ocean. I do not believe politics in Ireland should be paid for by people who are not resident here and on the register of voters in Ireland, irrespective of whether they are former friends in Russia or current friends in the United States. As a democracy, political parties should be funded by the people who live in Ireland. I take the black and white view that people from other continents should not fund what happens in this House. The fundamental principle is that people should be able to know who is providing funds to political parties. Mr. Liam Kavanagh, Mr. Michael Smith and Mr. Jim Keeffe are former Members of this House. As such, they bring pragmatism and practical experience to the commission. Some of the members of the commission whom I met previously did not really realise what politics is like on the ground. They did not understand why we would put ourselves to all that trouble or allow constituents to contact us at the weekend. I am pleased, therefore, that a former politician is being appointed to bring practical experience to the commission. However, I wish to raise something that the Minister appears to have overlooked. The chairperson of the commission and the ordinary member will be men. The Comptroller and Auditor General and the Ombudsman are men. The Clerk of the Seanad is a lady. I do not know who is representing the Clerk of the Dáil on the commission given that a vacancy currently exists for that position. If someone is temporarily filling that position, what mechanism was used to allow this to happen? Of the six members of the board as currently constituted, one at most is a woman. It is not gender balanced. I support the Minister's nominations but I ask him to think about this issue for future reference. We want to attract more women into public life but the body overseeing standards, ethics, donations and transparency in public life is male dominated. Perhaps it is an accident but I ask the Minister to consider the issue with a view to addressing it in some way in the future.

It is, however, unfortunate that the Minister did not ensure the appointments were made in a more timely manner. As people will recall, it emerged just days before Christmas that the commission would not be able to advance current investigations or initiate new ones without its full complement of board members. Two of the positions became vacant in early December.

We all agree that SIPO is one of the vital checks and balances to this institution and as such it is important that the Government not only supports its work but is seen to do so. Appointments to the board of the commission are made by the Oireachtas, as the Minister stated, on the Minister's recommendation. This failure to appoint the new board members in a timely manner resulted in headlines which feed into a public mistrust of politics and politicians. I understand that we cannot control the headlines but in this instance, the Minister was the instigator and author of this bad press. The appointments should have come before the Dáil in advance of the Christmas recess-----

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	91	-----or when the controversy arose the Minister could have given a commitment that the issue would be dealt with on the first day back. Instead, the Government was cranky on the issue. The Minister seems to be a little cranky still. Whether this was intended or not, the message went out that politicians took a view that if SIPO's work was delayed or hindered, it was really no big deal. That is not a helpful message to go into the public domain. There is also an undercurrent or a sense that there is a strange relationship between the Government and SIPO at present and this was underpinned by the public spat regarding local party funding disclosures. It is one matter whether there was a difference of opinion which arose between the Minister, in particular, and SIPO and Government, but the Government's response to this issue was unnecessarily defensive and, as I stated, did the body politic no favours. The Minister made reference to the appointment of a former Member of the Oireachtas to the board. I understand the rationale and the current legislative provisions in respect of that, but it is something that needs to be revisited. I am not convinced that it is necessary to have a former Oireachtas Member as part of this and I am not sure that it is entirely helpful. As we engage in the debate the Minister outlined, we should go back to that issue. On the appointment of the chair, in particular, I warmly welcome the proposed appointment of retired High Court judge, Mr. Justice Daniel O'Keeffe. I wish him well and every success in his new position. I would extend those sentiments to Mr. Jim O'Keeffe who, notwithstanding my reservations on the role of former Oireachtas Members in SIPO, I also wish all the best. Finally, merely for the purposes of clarity, it is not possible for moneys raised thar sáile to fund political activity in this jurisdiction. In fact, the guidelines are strict. I understand that Deputy Sean Fleming's musings as regards the United States were clearly sent in my direction and I want to assure him of that position, that the reporting requirements stateside are extremely rigorous and the rules and regulations in this jurisdiction are extremely tight. I would say to his party that I am aware that there were efforts made by Fianna Fáil to instigate fund-raising in the United States which did not go terribly well and I am not sure whether that is the real motivation for the Deputy raising the issue. I am curious to know who is fund-raising in Russia.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	94	I welcome the making of these appointments. SIPO must now be at its full strength and the media focus before Christmas drew strong attention to that. A lesson should be learned for the next time when there will be replacements that it will be done in a more timely way. I welcome the Minister's statement that there will be more work done in this area because where politics is funded from is incredibly important. We need only look at what has happened in this country to realise that. On the issue of a former politician being a member of SIPO, there are pluses and minuses in that regard. Whereas he or she may well bring expertise, it certainly is coming from the established political parties. From 2002 to 2012, the years for which I have figures, not one single solitary donation has been disclosed by Fine Gael. The Labour Party disclosed figures in three years, Fianna Fáil did so in five or six years, and Sinn Féin did so every year. It is not believable that there are not donations, particularly in years where there are elections. That kind of practice undermines considerably the confidence in the governance required on the area of ethics. There are large sums expended in this country under the Electoral Acts for the large political parties where the funding comes from the taxpayer, but there is this other income as well which it is not possible to stand over. It is not only political parties that are funded. I made a complaint to SIPO last year around the time of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 about a number of groups which had not registered as third parties. It is really a big gap that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency because there were obviously large sums of money being spent with vehicles driving around with advertising hoardings, etc. In reply, SIPO stated that, in relation to the five groups mentioned, the Pro Life Campaign is registered as a third party, that Life House Ireland is not registered and that SIPO contacted it recently and asked it to consider if it required to register. SIPO continued: In relation to the other 3 groups, Youth Defence, The Life Institute and Family and Life, they are not registered as third parties with the Standards Commission. In this regard the Standards Commission has been in correspondence with all of them and asked them to consider whether they are required to register as a third party. All eventually responded and stated that they do not have a requirement to register as a third party. The Standards Commission remains firmly of the view that the activities of these groups comes within the definition of political purposes and that they are required to register as a third party.All that SIPO could do was write and warn them. The fact that there was no sanction, at a time when there was an important debate going on, there was a great deal of money being spent on that debate on one side which was not being declared and we did not know who was interested, draws attention to the kind of shortcomings there are, and with which we must deal. I echo the point made that it is quite fragmented. I understand to an extent why that is so - in the case of elections, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will have a responsibility for local government elections - but a more consolidated approach would be better where there would be one point where decisions are made and where the legislation covers all of this. While I welcome, and certainly do not dispute, the appointment of Mr. Jim O'Keeffe, with whom I was a Member in this House some years ago and who is a capable and honourable man, I raise a major question mark over having somebody who is a former Member as a member of the Standards in Public Office Commission. Despite the fact he or she may hold some information that can be useful, on balance that may well present other problems as well. Those of us who would be non-aligned would certainly feel that we may well have a different viewpoint which will never really come to the fore.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	96	I did not realise that I had a right of reply and I did not take up my notes. I want to make a few points. On the general point about gender balance made by Deputy Fleming, I am obviously mindful of that in terms of State appointments, but since four of the six are by definition ex officio, I cannot demand under equality legislation that the Ombudsman be a woman or that the Clerk of the Dáil or the Comptroller and Auditor General be a woman. Everybody is entitled to apply for those particular jobs. The outgoing Ombudsman was a woman and the current one is a man; that is the way it works. We are now improving the likelihood of a former judge being a woman because we have appointed a number of female High Court judges in our term of office, thereby greatly increasing the number, and we have also increased the number of female Supreme Court judges. When we came into office there was only one and that judge had been appointed by us the last time we were in office. Therefore, we have increased the gender balance significantly. On the general charge made by two Deputies that there was some tardiness in the appointment, we must have a little bit of respect for senior office holders. It would have been quite wrong to announce an appointment before somebody's term of office had been completed. I heard on a radio programme criticism of the fact that we had not appointed a replacement on the Sunday after the term of office had ended on a Friday. One single working day had not expired and there was a complaint, but that was odd, and it was the week before Christmas. There are the normal procedures of having to bring a proposal to Cabinet and ensure there is consent from the people involved, and then I wanted an opportunity to have a conversation to at least inform representatives of the Opposition before I tabled a resolution. Based on these considerations, I believe it was done extremely expeditiously. I wonder at the motivation of whoever decided it was a news story at the end of last year. The Standards in Public Office Commission is a very important organisation and part of a suite of legislation we brought in to achieve much greater transparency. I take on board many of the points made by the Deputies opposite. We need to have clarity in regard to how politics works and who funds it, and expenditure limits so that we cannot buy votes. In jurisdictions such as the United States people are in permanent fund-raising mode and one's capacity to raise money determines one's ability to stand for public office. We should never be in that space. One of our responses as a Government and as a Department to the Mahon report and other reports was that we would examine root and branch the overarching legislative provision for ethics, because it is layered, and see if we could consolidate it in a more useable way. We can address some of the issues raised by Deputies opposite in that discourse. I am not sure if one of the Deputies has a formed view on the inclusion of a former Oireachtas Member. That came from a recommendation of this House on an all-party basis for the very reason cited by Deputy Fleming. One needs to have a practical understanding of politics. One would not have a group overseeing doctors in the medical profession without having a doctor involved. We must have somebody with practical experience. One would not establish a teaching council without having a teacher involved. Somebody has to understand the nuts and bolts of it and be able to say "It does not work like that; this is how it works." I thought it was a good recommendation that we should maintain, but we can debate these matters in the future.  I welcome the support across the House from all parties and from Independents for the two nominees and I look forward to working closely with the existing SIPO in the challenging and demanding work that it has before it.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	104	I would like to refer briefly to the context of today's debate. This local government reform legislation has been a major undertaking involving many areas of my Department and other Departments, with input from a range of sources and impacts on an extensive body of other legislation. It has been undertaken with a relatively short timescale and, in view of this, I indicated at the outset that additional provisions would be introduced during its passage through the Oireachtas, which has happened, with a substantial number of provisions having been added on Committee Stage in the Dáil and on Committee and Report Stages in the Seanad. It is quite common for Bills initiated in the Dáil to go through the Seanad with little change, almost as a procedural exercise, but this has not been the case with the Local Government Bill; more than 120 amendments were made to the Bill in the Seanad. Therefore, we have an example of the very active involvement of both Houses in the development of this legislation. This seems particularly appropriate given the special link that exists between the Seanad and the local authorities in electoral terms. Many of the provisions that were added to the Bill in the Seanad were ones that had not been fully drafted for inclusion at an earlier stage, and many of the amendments that are being dealt with today involve relatively minor corrections or technical drafting changes. Others were in response to issues that were raised during the course of the debates. Today's session enables the Dáil to consider and affirm these changes, beginning with amendment No. 1. These are a series of technical and drafting amendments to section 1 and Part 6 of Schedule 2 to the Bill. Amendments Nos. 1 to 4 and amendment No. 8 amend a number of the collective citations provisions in subsections (2), (4), (6), (8) and (13) of section 1. These amendments are necessary because the phrase that is to be included in the collective citation was used in 2013 collective citations at the time of drafting. This text was used because the Acts in question had already been given a 2013 collective citation by another Act earlier that year - that is, they are references to an existing citation for the year concerned. However, as the Bill will now be enacted in 2014, these citations will have to be amended to read "may be cited as" rather than "shall be included in". In other words, the new citation will be referenced in 2014 rather than 2013.  Amendment No. 5 provides for the insertion of a collective citation in subsection (12) of section 1 in respect of the Education and Training Boards Acts 2013 and 2014. This arises from amendment No. 107, which makes a number of amendments to the Education and Training Boards Act 2013 in Part 6 of Schedule 2, consequent on structural reform at county and city level. Consequential amendments are also made to the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts 1995 and 2006 in amendment No. 107. Amendments Nos. 6 and 7 correct an existing collective citation contained in section 113 to the Health Acts, which needs to be updated to include the reference to the Health Acts 1947 to 2014 within the collective citation. Amendment No. 10 is a drafting amendment to subsection 21 to replace the word "fixed" with "appointed", which will bring the text into line with a wording used earlier in the subsection.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	106	Amendment No. 67 amends section 1 of the Bill by providing for the insertion of a new section 149A in the Local Government Act 2001. It is required in order to provide a definitive legal basis for one local authority to carry out executive functions such as back-office support services on behalf of one or more local authorities. It will apply to County Laois in respect of shared services and procurement. The amendment will facilitate the implementation in the local government area of Government policy for the operation of shared services across the public sector. To give effect to the policy in the local authority sector, a lead local authority model has been agreed whereby a single local authority will deliver the shared services on behalf of all local authorities. Shared services should be a win-win situation for local authorities and citizens as they reduce costs, improve service and increase standardisation while allowing local authorities to focus on core citizen-facing activities. Laois County Council will deal with shared services in respect of payroll and superannuation, which will lead to a saving of €4.3 million per year and 70 staff over time. Amendment No. 9 is a related amendment to section 1(21) of the Bill and provides for section 51 in so far as it relates to the insertion of 149A into the principal Act, to be commenced on the enactment of the Bill.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	107	I had understood that shared services was something that could happen under previous legislation. Extensive procurement goes on in terms of services. Is there no question of local authorities having to go through that process before sharing services?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	108	Government policy is for the implementation of shared services across the public sector. In the local authority sector, the oversight group looking at these matters has identified a number of areas where we can make substantial savings through efficiencies in the delivery of services. The local government efficiency review group has made €238 million in savings in the past two years, with an ambition of €350 million achieved over a three-year period. In the waste management area, Offaly County Council is the lead authority in permitting and in respect of payroll Laois County Council is the lead authority. There are various suggestions and proposals being put forward and evaluated to see how we can get value for money and that savings can be put into other services.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	109	There is an extensive procurement process for almost everything and it absorbs a huge amount of administrative time. Is there no question of these services having to go through the process?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	110	No, but in order for a local authority to achieve the status of being responsible for the entire local government system, it must undertake a bidding process. There is a competitive process that happened in 2013, with Laois County Council providing the shared payroll and superannuation service on behalf of local authorities.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	111	Sinn Féin does not have a problem with the concept of shared services. The example has been given of Laois County Council in respect of payroll and pension services being combined. That certainly makes sense. The concern I have about services and procurement is that other European countries try to keep contracts in small, manageable pieces to escape the binds of e-tendering. I want the Minister and the Department to take this on board. Over the past few years, VECs and local authorities find that procurement is squeezing out small suppliers and local businesses. Many of the contracts awarded could be broken down into smaller chunks and we could be more creative about that. It is simpler to hand over a contract to one company but, given the shape the domestic economy is in, one way of trying to resuscitate it is to break down contracts into small chunks so that companies can successfully tender for them. That way, we can avoid the rigours of the e-tendering system.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	112	I share Deputy Stanley's concern about the fact that we cannot exclude small businesses from contracts and opportunities at local level. There is a balance to be struck between savings on particular contracts without depriving people of the opportunity to bid in the procurement process. We did that for the water metering programme, where there was a much higher threshold for subcontractors to come in and provide services for the main regional contractor. A figure of €1 million was initially proposed by the group drawing up the proposal and I reduced it to €400,000. I am conscious of the point about including people as much as possible and I will convey this to the national procurement office.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	115	The Bill provides that a local authority may, by resolution, delegate any of its functions to municipal district level and may also revoke such a delegation. The purpose of the amendment is to add a requirement on the members of the overall local authority to consult with the municipal district members for the district concerned before deciding by resolution to revoke, under section 131A(2)(b) of the 2001 Act, a delegation of the function to the municipal district members concerned, which had previously been made by the local authority under section 131A(2)(a). During the debates on Committee Stage and Report Stage in the Dáil, Deputy Catherine Murphy tabled amendments to section 21(3) of the Bill which inserts a new section 131A in the Local Government Act 2001, dealing with the performance of reserve functions at municipal district level, including the procedure for revocation of a delegation to the district level. During the debate, I indicated that I would bring forward an amendment in the Seanad providing for consultation with municipal district members prior to any decision to revoke a delegation order. This amendment provides accordingly. It enhances the status of the municipal district members and ensures their views are canvassed and taken into account in advance of any decision being taken at plenary level. The elected members for each district will perform functions of the local authority on a devolved basis for the district, thereby increasing subsidiarity and making local government more responsive and as close as possible to local communities. The Bill specifies in the region of 70 reserve functions assigned to the elected members at municipal district level. The municipal districts will operate as distinct decision-making components within an integrated local authority structure.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	116	The amendment I tabled related to the European charter for local self-government and went quite some distance further.Having said that, I welcome the fact that the amendment has been tabled. It is going to be down to the culture within the local authority as to what consultation means as in some cases it has become a very discredited word, where people are told what will be done rather than having a dynamic of consultation in the real sense of the word, which implies a two-way process. I will watch the issue and although I would have liked to have gone further, I acknowledge the inclusion of the matter.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	117	I share completely Deputy Murphy's opinion on the cultural changes required to be inclusive, not just with the members of the local authorities but with the community structures we are setting up as well. Inclusivity and the culture around it has not always been right and we hope to get to a position, certainly after the local elections in May 2014, to see with this legislation that the management and members of local authorities will embrace all the various community interests in a more structured way. They should listen to people and take on board their views, as far as possible, in the delivery of core services over the next few years.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	118	I thank the Minister for the insertion of this amendment. Is the method of consultation at the discretion of the local authority council? For example, should it be an agenda item on a meeting of the municipal authority for ultimate forwarding to a local authority? This would record consensus or otherwise being sought rather than a case, as outlined by Deputy Catherine Murphy, where it is explained for information purposes what is being done.

In page 36 of the Bill, line 6, the reference to section 24(1)(a) should be changed to section 24(1). There has been a request for a clerk's correction in this regard and I am glad to relay it.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	122	Is it agreed? We are still dealing with amendment No. 12.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	123	Seanad amendment No. 12 is to be taken with Seanad amendments Nos. 13 and 95. These amendments deal with the issue of the ordinary day of retirement for outgoing elected members following the 2014 local elections in the context of the dissolution of the old and establishment of the new structures at county and sub-county levels. These are important technical amendments to the Bill to allow for the smooth transition to the new regime following the 2014 local elections. Seanad amendment No. 13 inserts a new subsection (3) in section 28 of the Bill, which provides in paragraph (a)(i) that in the case of all local authorities, including those to be amalgamated in Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford, the ordinary day of retirement will be linked with the 2014 establishment day for the new merged authorities. This will allow for the synchronisation of the date for the retirement of outgoing members, the date on which persons elected in 2014 come into office and the 2014 establishment day, which I anticipate will be 1 June 2014. Paragraph (a)(ii) of the new subsection ties in the provisions of paragraph (a)(i) in a situation where a poll is countermanded or adjourned. In such circumstances, the ordinary day of retirement will be the seventh day after the poll is completed or the fresh poll is held, or the 2014 establishment day, whichever is the later. Subsection 3(b) provides that the date of retirement for members of town councils will be the transfer date, or the date on which the town council will be dissolved, to be determined by the Minister by order under a new section 24(1), to be inserted by amendment No. 12. Section 24(1) of the Bill empowers the Minister to make an order specifying a date to be the transfer date for the purposes of the dissolution of town councils, and the date from which relevant county or city and county authorities will become the successors to these town councils. Again, I anticipate this date will be 1 June 2014. Seanad amendment No. 95 is consequential on the insertion of a new section 24(1) of the Bill and the proposed addition to section 17(1) of the Local Government Act 2001 originally provided for in Schedule 1 will no longer be required if the amendment for section 24(1) is accepted.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	129	Again I would like to request a clerk's correction to the text of Seanad amendment No. 121 in order to correct a drafting error. In the proposed new item 12 to be inserted into Schedule 3 by Seanad amendment No. 120, the text of column three incorrectly refers to the Local Government Act 1941, and this should be corrected to state "Local Government Act 1946". Following the restructuring of the local government sector, there will be in each local authority area a single rating authority and a single valuation list, with a single unified annual rate of valuation, ARV. The power to determine the annual rate and valuation will rest with the plenary council. With regard to Seanad amendment No. 14, I am aware that the harmonisation of ARVs in a ten-year period could potentially increase rates in a few cases. For example, a base year adjustment applied as a levy of more than 20 could not be reduced incrementally to zero within ten years without sizable annual increases in rates for rate payers in relevant areas. This amendment allows a local authority in this specific circumstance to apply to the Minister to extend the adjustment period that will apply in the former rating authority area to beyond ten years. It will be a reserve function of a local authority to apply for the extension, and amendment No. 121 provides that this new reserve function be listed in Part 3 of Schedule 3 of the Bill, which sets out the reserve functions of the local authority. These amendments provide that I may make an order that can allow the adjustment period relevant to the area to be extended beyond ten years but no longer than 20 years. Seanad amendment No. 15 provides that a local authority subject to an order under this provision will be permitted to increase its ARV despite the harmonisation of all areas within the county area not having been completed. However, this is only possible when all other ARVs other than that to which the order applies have been aligned in a county. I stress again that it is not the intention for ARVs to increase and I will continue to stress to local authorities the need for restraint, and where possible, reductions, in setting ARVs to support business and enterprise generally. It is my strong view that the elected members at plenary level should have full control over the setting of the ARV as quickly as possible, which is why I am bringing forward this provision of circumstances where harmonisation in a specified area can extend beyond ten years.
#JohnDeasyFG	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-party	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-dob	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	130	This is probably the third time I have raised this issue with the Minister over the past year. Seanad amendment No. 14 deals with allowing the adjustment period to be extended beyond ten years and Seanad amendment No. 15 allows the rating authority to determine an increase in the annual rate of valuation. With regard to what we have spoken about over the past year, the Minister consistently gave assurances that he would try to bring the ARV to the lowest level in Waterford and Dungarvan was home to the lowest level. The Minister did as he said and I thank him for following through. I am not saying I did not believe the Minister but I kept a close eye on the issue for the past year. The Minister was consistent and in the case of the city, there has been a really excellent result when one considers that rate payers received a reduction of 20%, and in the county the reduction was 5%. The Dungarvan level remained as it was and some people in the town think that unfair. For the most part, the feedback I received was that people expected the rate to increase. People were consistently told over the course of a year that there was a good chance the rate would increase. It is worth acknowledging the direction given by the Minister, and everybody is taking credit for this in Waterford, including councillors and officials.The Minister said that if he could put more money into the local government fund and direct that it be used to secure a reduction during amalgamation, it would and should happen. That is what has happened. I acknowledge what he has been saying in the past year and what actually did occur. I acknowledge the work of Waterford Chamber, including that of Nora Widger and Nick Donnelly. I acknowledge also the work of Dungarvan & West Waterford Chamber, including that of Jenny Beresford and Colette Bannon.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	131	Understandably, with any amalgamation this kind of issue will arise. The areas subject to the greatest attention will be Limerick city and county and Waterford and Tipperary. The urban councils will have had variations in rates also; therefore, this will be a factor and there is likely to be resentment. I heard the point on Dungarvan, where people are paying increased commercial rates with fewer services, for example. Was any work done on this? Did it arise as an issue in the consultation?

There will be areas where what I describe will be the case. I imagine that there will be some backlash where people see they are paying more than in other areas that may be receiving better services. Was any evaluation made? Resentment would be understandable in such circumstances. It would be useful to know the position considering the amalgamation process.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	134	The objective is to allow further devolution of responsibility to elected members in order that they can decide on their priorities. In the next while I will be trying to get Departments and agencies to devolve an increasing number of functions to local government, in addition to the ones we are creating in this Bill. It is a matter for the elected members to decide on their priorities regarding whether they want to increase or reduce commercial rates, just as they always have done. I hope elected members will not impose additional burdens on employers and realise, based on their seeing competitive circumstances in neighbouring counties, that doing so would not be in the best interests of employment creation. After the local elections in May, democratically elected members will, in deciding the budget for 2015, have to make difficult decisions on their priorities. However, they will have discretion in putting commercial rates up or down and they will have discretion in the case of other charges also.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	135	I acknowledge the efforts of the Minister to address issues raised on this very matter on Committee Stage, notwithstanding the fact that Deputy John Deasy said obvious examples throughout the country were given to the Minister. There is a mechanism by which a special case can be made for an extension of time. I thank the Minister for his commitment in that regard and hope he will be amenable to such requests from various councils throughout the country. What consultation has the Minister had, if any, with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform? Has he discussed with him or the Government as a whole the possibility of considering a complete overhaul of the rates valuation system? It is and has been a crushing tool for many businesses throughout the country during their efforts to get back on their feet and retain business. As we said on many occasions during various debates, in committee rooms and the House, the valuation system and mechanism used are archaic, to say the least. Rents have decreased by up to 70% in many locations throughout the country, yet rates have not decreased to that extent. One would be doing well to have experienced a decrease of 5% in the past five years because of the fall in regular revenue from local authorities' traditional sources. I will not get into the debate on the funding of local authorities; we will do so on another day. Considering the unfortunate fact that the Minister could not honour his commitment on rent reviews, a concerted and more determined effort should be made regarding commercial rates. What preliminary discussion, if any, has the Minister had with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform? Has the Cabinet discussed this issue? Is it the intention of the Government to overhaul the commercial rates system?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	136	I totally agree with the Deputy's sentiments on the valuation system. The current system is certainly not in keeping with the financial and economic reality in many areas. There is a danger that we will have two Irelands in regard to economic activity, particularly in town centres. Some of the suggestions made by the party opposite in its Private Members' legislation have certainly been considered by my Department and others to determine how we can further promote activity in town centres. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, is very conscious of the need to overhaul the valuation system. There is a Bill before the House and this matter will be brought to the Dáil shortly. It has been dealt with in the Seanad. It is urgent legislation to have fairer criteria available to the Valuation Office in order that we can be mindful of and more responsive to current economic and financial needs, particularly in provincial areas.
#JohnDeasyFG	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-party	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-dob	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	137	I must agree with Deputy Barry Cowen on the system being archaic; it is and the Government acknowledges this. On three or four occasions friends of mine went out of business when competing against a business operating over the Internet. The latter type of business is run from the home and pays no rates. On a couple of occasions my friends said to me that the next time they went into business, they would compete on a worldwide level over the Internet. They said there was no future in paying rates and trying to compete against individuals who had a warehouse somewhere from where they shipped their product. We need to start taking this into consideration because the world is changing. Our system is not changing quickly enough. Since I started examining this issue, one point comes across to me time and again. A number of Departments have a stake in commercial rates valuation and there is insufficient co-ordination. The commercial rates valuation issue is like the unwanted child for the Government. One needs to start considering putting responsibility under one roof. The responsibilities of the four relevant Departments, the Department of Finance, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, should be consolidated. There is a singular lack of co-ordination throughout government. If addressing this issue means giving responsibility to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, it might be a good first step to take in this area. The Minister alluded to the Valuation (Amendment) Bill. It limits the criteria according to which somebody can make an appeal. It introduces a system of self-assessment, but the key question which has not been answered and on which the Valuation Office was very unclear is whether those being given new valuations, as in Dublin, Limerick and Waterford, will be able to self-assess under the new system when the legislation comes into play. People want to know this. One might ask oneself whether it would be wise to have two systems in operation next year once the Bill is enacted. These are some of the questions with which we will have to deal. Consider the issues concerning the Valuation (Amendment) Bill and the Valuation Office. Until recently the Department of Finance was the umbrella organisation or Department. Now responsibility has transferred to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. I know there is a chance responsibility might be transferred to the Department of Justice and Equality, but I get the feeling nobody wants this. Somebody must step in and take ownership of commercial rates valuation. That would be a good first step.
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	138	This is a matter which I raised with the Minister previously on Committee Stage. I also raised it with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. There is much concern on the ground among business people whose rateable valuations are currently being reviewed. This is happening in Waterford at present. I agree with those of my colleagues who have argued that the current system does not reflect the modern economic challenges out there, including the decline of city and town centres and the increase in online trade. Following the recent revaluations in Waterford city and county, the rates for some industries, mainly multinationals, fell but I would argue that such industries can well afford to pay higher rates to the local authorities. In the retail sector, however, which is seriously challenged at the moment, rates have increased, in some case by up to three times the original amount. Leaving that issue aside, the revaluation process is almost ten years behind as we speak. There is a need for an urgent review of the entire rateable valuation system. While I acknowledge the system's independence, it must take account of the modern economic challenges that exist. Modern technologies are challenging businesses, as Deputies have already said. The issue of self-assessment must be examined too. There is a need for self-assessment in this area and I hope we will get an opportunity to discuss this further when the Valuation (Amendment) Bill comes before the House under the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. I ask that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government also take account of the concerns being expressed here today.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	139	The big weakness in the rates system at the moment, even with the changes being proposed, is that no cognisance is being taken of ability to pay. There are many small businesses from which people are not even getting a week's wages at the moment. Some sole traders and those employing three or four people are not even getting a half-week's wages for themselves from their businesses. Consideration of ability to pay has to be built into the rates system. It could be based on the profits for the previous year. Some recognition must be given to this issue. This is a constant complaint that I have heard during my entire time as a public representative. It is what drives small businesses to the wall in many instances. It tips the balance and the businesses go from being in the black to being in the red. I know there is no easy solution to this problem because if we build in some provision, it may have a knock-on effect elsewhere. However, my party believes that some measure must be introduced into the rates system to take account of ability to pay.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	143	Section 31(b) of the Bill originally amended section 14 of the Local Government Act of 1946 to the effect that vacancy refunds in authorities where the 1946 Act applies would be reduced to 50%. I previously signalled during our last debate in this House that I intended to consider this matter further. Amendments Nos. 16 and 120 specifically provide that elected members in all local authorities can, as a reserved function, decide on an electoral district or districts within the administrative area of the county or city where a differing rate of refund may apply. Councils can decide on the appropriate refund, being any proportion downwards from 100%, that should apply in each individual area and the Minister may make regulations setting out the administrative and financial procedures to apply in relation to the taking of those decisions. The underlying objective of these provisions is to allow the elected members to respond to the realities of economic circumstances in their local areas. Amendment No. 147 amends Part 3 of Schedule 3 to provide for this new reserved function. Related amendments are also being made to the Local Government (Dublin) Act of 1930 and the Cork City Management Act of 1941 to provide for local discretion there. In both cases, the prevailing refund regime of 50% as provided for in the respective Acts, will remain but, as I have already explained, provision is now being made to allow local authorities to provide for a different proportion of refund in specific electoral districts within the authorities' administrative areas. It would, of course, be open to the elected members in Dublin and Cork to apply a 50% refund regime to all electoral districts in the relevant cities, thereby maintaining the present position if they wish to do so.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	144	I acknowledge again the commitment of the Minister to rescind what was contained in the legislation initially, which caused great consternation, fear and worry for many people throughout the country and, most particularly, for the members of local authorities who felt that they could judge and reflect the situation on the ground in the context of refunds for vacant units. The Minister is to be commended on listening to the concerns, fears and worries that were obvious when the legislation was published initially.
#JohnDeasyFG	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-party	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-dob	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	145	I echo what Deputy Cowen has said. When this legislation was first published, many people got a bit of a fright. Having spoken to the officials since then, I understand the logic of this and Waterford serves as a very good example. I spoke to a senior official in Waterford city who made the case to me that the authority needed to apply sanctions in some cases because people were holding on to properties and sites. The authority wanted to have a sanction to deal with that so that people would move the properties or sites on. Then, in another part of the county like Dungarvan, for example, it made absolutely no sense whatsoever. To have a blanket 50% rate which applied to everyone in the country made absolutely no sense. There has been much talk about a two-tier economy in this country, which does exist. In the case of Dungarvan, for example, the fact that premises are vacant is not a matter of choice and Dungarvan is not the only place in the country where that is the case. There are many places that simply cannot get tenants and to apply a 50% rate would have been madness in this economic climate. The solution, in the form of a variation on the amendment tabled by myself and Deputy Dowds, is reasonable. It talks about the rates being set at district level within a particular local authority to allow for the differences between an urban area and a rural one. I thank the Minister for taking our amendment on board and tabling a variation on it. We appreciate the work done by departmental officials in this regard too.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	146	I welcome this change and commend some of the Members on the Government benches who put forward amendments on this issue. It is important to see Government Deputies contributing amendments. That is a positive development. In fairness to the Minister, he listened to the issues that were raised in this regard. He acknowledged the concerns and made the necessary changes, for which he is to be commended. I have a number of questions and I ask the Minister to clarify a number of points. The legislation refers to refunds. Does that mean that the owners of vacant properties must pay the commercial rates and then apply for a refund? That may not be feasible for some who have cash flow difficulties. The amendment also provides that the reduction can be from 100% down. Can it be down to 0% or must there be at least a minimum rate charged on the refund? I accept the logic of this and it makes sense in the context of some vacant properties in some parts of the country. However, there is a difficulty with the logistics involved in operating in a rural local authority - for example, in County Roscommon. If one were to break it down into electoral areas, if there was a dilapidated part of one town, the measure would have to be applied across the entire electoral area.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	147	Yesterday I asked the Taoiseach questions about the establishment of Irish Water, particularly whether he could confirm that senior members of local authorities had left their positions in local authorities with very generous pension lump sums - in one case totalling up to €340,000 and in another case €270,000 - before moving seamlessly to Irish Water, where they will again receive very high salaries and top-up bonuses as well. The Taoiseach refused to answer the question yesterday. Irish Water also refused to answer the question or to confirm or deny the allegation. Does the Taoiseach accept that this has happened - that very senior members of local authorities who have received very generous packages, totalling up to €340,000 with pensions, are being employed by Irish Water? Does the Taoiseach consider it right that this should happen and that such staff should move into positions where there will be top-up bonuses in addition to what they already have? Does he think it is fair or right and does he stand over it?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	148	First, I did not refuse to answer Deputy Martin’s question at all. I said that the detail of the question asked was not available to me and I confirmed that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government had formally written to the chief executive of Irish Water seeking all aspects of the remuneration policies in respect of the people who work for Irish Water, and I said that when the information was supplied to the Minister it would be made public. As I said to Deputy Martin last week and the previous week, Irish Water is a public utility and it will be subject to the Freedom of Information Act. It will also be subject to parliamentary questions in the House. The information Deputy Martin requested in the interests of the public will be published. I do not have the answers to the question he asked yesterday.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	151	The Taoiseach does have the answers and he does know the story. What I have said is fact. I asked the Taoiseach whether he thinks it is right, given where we are, that people can leave with very generous lump sums and huge pensions and move seamlessly into a new operation where they will enjoy top-up bonuses in addition to high salaries. This is a very important issue for a lot of people watching. There are many young, talented people who are specialists in water who did not get a look-in when it came to recruiting senior personnel to Irish Water. More than half the staff are from local authorities, Bord Gáis and other State agencies or from companies that had strong connections with these. Young, talented, qualified persons with considerable experience did not get a look-in. That is what has happened in this case. The perception is that there was an inside track - a club of sorts - operating in terms of recruitment practices.

It is my contention that this State has failed since its inception to provide services that would be afforded to every citizen if this were a real republic. The gap has been filled by charities. I wish to praise the work they do. Since the foundation of the State, however, charities have not been regulated, and that is now doing untold damage - I am sure the Taoiseach would agree - both to the charities and to those citizens who depend on them. Recent scandals such as that surrounding the CRC and now the major question mark over fund-raising by Rehab are causing enormous disquiet. Tá a fhios ag an bpobal nach bhfuil rud ar bith chomh dona leis an saint agus sílim go n-aontaíonn an Taoiseach le sin. In 2009, Fianna Fáil passed legislation to regulate the charities sector but never implemented the legislative provisions. In February 2012, my colleague Deputy Mac Lochlainn asked the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, why the Act was not being implemented. In his reply the Minister said it was not practical to proceed with the full implementation of the Act at that time given the financial and staffing resources that would be required. Hence, he said, the implementation of the Act had been deferred. He went on to claim that it was not a fact that charities in Ireland were devoid of oversight. We know that there is not enough oversight. Yesterday, Sinn Féin introduced a Bill that seeks to ensure that all the provisions of the Charities Act 2009 are fully enacted by 31 May 2014, but the Government opposed it.Will the Taoiseach reconsider that position? We welcome some of the steps taken by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, but all provisions of the Act need to be enacted. Will the Taoiseach support Sinn Féin’s Bill to implement all provisions of the Charities Act 2009 which has been sitting on the Statute Book for the past five years, including the three years of this Government’s term?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	192	This Government is in the business of clearing up a legacy of untold proportions. We are now into section 38 and section 39 bodies. I assure the Deputy, the House and the public that, after what is happening in the charities area, the sector will come through to a much safer and a more justifiable, accountable and transparent system. It will be the case that everyone who donates to the charity of their choice can be comfortable in the knowledge that the accounts will be audited and published and the charities regulator will have endorsed charity X or Y as measuring up to criteria set out in the Charities Act 2009. We want a system in which all charities are treated the same, that they be transparent, accountable and the public can be comfortable in that the moneys they gave from their hard-earned pay are going for what they were intended. I am sure Deputy Adams supports this too. This process has started. I commend the members of the Oireachtas committees who have been involved to this point and will, obviously, have a great deal of work ahead of them. This is in everybody’s interest. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, has set out that the interim regulator will be in place by Easter and a regulatory board will be established soon after. From a different perspective, the Health Service Executive, HSE, is following through on examining section 38 and section 39 agencies. It is in the public’s interest that all these matters are cleared up. We have had a number of mountains to climb over the past three years. Unfortunately, as we move along, we discover there is more work to be done in several areas. The charities regulator will be in position by the end of February, a board will be in operation and we will move to a point that section 38 and section 39 organisations will be dealt with. There are many charities that are well run and can put absolutely everything out in front of people. That is the way it should be for them all. That is the way it will be.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	193	Not all the charities fall foul of whatever may be happening with some of them. They all fall foul, however, of the fact there is a lack of public confidence because of the lack of regulation in the sector. We know this lack of regulation across many sectors has been at the core of the toxic culture in this State for a long time. I asked the Taoiseach a straight question. There is a Charities Act in place since 2009. While the Minister’s recent measures in this regard are welcome, they do not include the full implementation of the legislation. They are only small piecemeal measures, brought about because of an ongoing scandal in the sector. Will the Taoiseach support the legislation which is now up for reimplementation? As this is above party politics, I am disappointed at his refusal to support our Bill. If the charities legislation were fully implemented, it would protect charities and restore public confidence. I know the Government has been extremely busy but it has had three years during which to act on this. Last night’s revelations by the justice Minister about Rehab, information which he has had for some time, have shocked citizens and reinforced the urgent need to fully implement the Charities Act 2009. On top of all this disquiet, does the Taoiseach also agree that the refusal, thus far, by the chief executive officer of Rehab to declare her salary, as well as the general lack of transparency about remuneration in this and other sectors, need to be addressed and rectified?

The regulatory authority will be in place by Easter. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform sanctioned the appointment of an interim chief executive officer. That position will be filled by the end of February. One of the early priorities will be the publication of a statutory register of charities, so people will know what is involved. That will obviously have its own implementation to bring about transparency and accountability.

When the Charities Bill was published in 2007, the then Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Pat Carey, said: ... the Government is committed to protecting both charitable organisations and the public interest by reforming the law to ensure accountability and to protect against abuse of charitable status and fraud through the Bill ...While that was a valid comment, it was clear following the appointment of this Government in 2011 that the full implementation of this Act was not possible, given the financial circumstances that applied.

Arrangements for the implementation of the Act had to be examined in detail and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, has brought forward his proposals on how best to implement them. A consultation process was carried out between the Department of Justice and Equality, the public and the charities sector on the Charities Act last year. The Minister published that report last July. Now, we move on to the section 38 and section 39 organisations. We cannot have a position where unsanctioned pay from the public purse is being paid in such a manner. We will rectify that. All charities will be subject to the same transparency and accountability. I agree with Deputy Adams that the many people who give selflessly because of their belief or dedication to charities, as well as their service-users, want this matter sorted out. Sorted out it will be. I paid a private visit to the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, last week. Many of the young professionals working there were distraught at the nauseating spectacle they had seen unfold. For them, and for the people who use the clinic’s services and for those who make charitable contributions to it, and in the public interest, we must clear all of this up. The process is now in train to see that will happen.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	199	Yesterday, I received a distressed call from a constituent, Annie from Ballyfermot, an old age pensioner aged 79, who is in receipt of a widow’s contributory pension. Her husband died in 1977. On Friday, she went to the post office to collect her pension to discover it had been cut off. The reason was that she was subject to a random controlled check by the Department of Social Protection. She was very upset she had to prove again her entitlement to this miserly pension of €12,000 a year while watching recent scandals hitting the TV news every night and in the newspapers. In her view, she has worked, paid her stamp, reared nine children and is, accordingly, entitled to her widow’s contributory pension. To my mind, this is a story of two worlds. There are those on State pensions who have to prove and reprove their eligibility to their entitlements - prove they are not spongers, criminals or defrauding the State. This is contrasted with those at the top of our society, with an unlimited and boundless sense of entitlement, in the health services and the top of charitable organisations, who have salaries of up to €100,000 a year, ten times the State pension.

#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	201	This sense of entitlement among the latter means their salaries have to be topped up by raiding funds donated by the public to provide services for people with disabilities and sick children, as well as raiding the shop at Crumlin children’s hospital. Of course, these same individuals also expect hugely inflated pensions when they leave their positions. This sense of entitlement we have seen exposed in the CRC scandal and top-up payments for hospital executives. They did not lick this sense of entitlement off the stones.According to Social Justice Ireland, the pay of Ministers increased by €1,500 a week between 1986 and 2011. The former Taoiseach, Mr. Brian Cowen, walked away from the mess in which he had left us with an entitlement to €310,000. In addition to his Deputy's and Minister's payments, he received a lump sum pension payment, a termination lump sum and a termination payment. Of course, he was not the only one to do so.

Does he believe the actions of the Department of Social Protection were protecting the most vulnerable in society? Will he ensure the widow's contributory pension of the lady in question is reinstated immediately while the case is being reviewed?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	205	I will be very happy to take the details of the pensioner Deputy Joan Collins has mentioned. Someone who has earned a contributory pension has paid for it and it is his or her entitlement. In dealing with the massive expenditure in the Department of Social Protection the people in it have a duty to see to it that the payments made are in order. That is the reason this year it is expected that between 800,000 and 900,000 public service cards will issue. There has been a consistent pattern of scams within the Department, that is, of individuals scamming the Department in which fraud has applied. Because of the changes made by the Minister and the introduction of advanced technology, a stop has been put to a great deal of this, rightly so. I do not know the details of the pensioner mentioned by the Deputy, but if she gives them to me afterwards, I will be happy to follow through on the issue for her. I do not know the reason a contributory pension would be cut off unless there was some reason for it to happen. Even in the case of a random check, it still should have shown up that a contributory pensioner should continue to receive her pension. Consequently, I will be happy to take the details from the Deputy and discuss the matter with the Minister for Social Protection. In general, serious changes have been made in the system of payments to cut out fraud and the abuse of public moneys. This is the right and proper thing to do and the Government will continue to support the Minister in that regard.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	206	I resent that remark in referring to fraud and scams in respect of the woman in question. She is now part of what is called the scam book, about which the Taoiseach was talking, which gives the Minister for Social Protection her reason to have random checks. The facts of the matter are very straightforward. This is a 79 year old woman who spoke to them on the telephone. She was asked whether she had remarried and whether her name was still in the name of her husband. It was obvious that she was still alive and that the box should simply have been ticked to the effect that she was who she had said with was with regard to her pension. However, this was not done; the pension was cut off on Friday and now she has no money. This pertains to a pension of €230 and a fuel allowance of €20. This should never have happened and it never should have been necessary to raise the matter in the Dáil. Moreover, the Taoiseach is still standing over the culture of ex-politicians in the Dáil who still are getting these massive "we are worth it" pensions, with the others. Why does he not introduce a special public sector pension tax on their super pensions? Easy. The universal social charge was brought in and if the Government was willing to do this, it would be tackling these pensions, but it will not. Were it to do so, it would not be taking on people's contracts but would be introducing a tax to deal with the issue. I seek the immediate reinstatement of the pension of the woman concerned, followed by an examination of the issue. At least then the matter could be resolved because this is a genuine case that should never have happened.

I am interested in the case mentioned by the Deputy of the good lady who has been in receipt of a contributory pension for a considerable time. If I understand the Deputy correctly, the lady in question was contacted by the Department to verify that she was still in receipt of her pension. The question is: why, following that intervention, was her pension cut off? This must be and will be found out. She has been entitled to her pension all these years and assuming this is correct, the Deputy should give me the details. She will be aware of cases that have been before the courts - I do not suggest anything is wrong - in which pensions were drawn on other persons' names long after they were deceased. That is not right either and such elements must be and are being rectified. I am sorry for any distress caused to the good lady who has been in receipt of her contributory pension and if the Deputy gives me the details, I will contact the Minister for Social Protection immediately.

Fianna Fáil is opposing No. 24a in the first instance which relates to changes to Standing Orders, the first of which deals with priority and ordinary oral questions from spokespersons which I believe presents difficulties for Independent Members and the Technical Group, in particular. Second, I refer to the proposal regarding identical or substantially similar Bills which provides that Private Members will be prevented from initiating Bills that are identical or substantially similar to Bills already published or which have reached the Ceann Comhairle's office first. Members' experience has been that in successive Standing Orders the outcome in practice has been the concentration of even more power in the Government's hands. I refer to the dictating of what happens in Parliament, again strengthening the Government's hand and its capacity to dictate what happens in Parliament and, in essence, to suppress proper power of initiative and debate in Parliament. That is my genuine view. I remind the Taoiseach that it was only before Christmas when the entire Opposition was obliged to walk out because of the suppression of the debate on Irish Water within four hours.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	287	That matter has been discussed and agreed, and I am now putting it to the House. Deputies Martin and Adams have made their points and they are in disagreement with what the Government is saying, so I am now putting the question.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	289	Yesterday, when speaking about the health service, the Taoiseach said that, overall, the service provided had not diminished in its impact or effect and that while costs had been extracted from the delivery of health services, there had been no diminution in their quality. He said this on the very day the Irish Emergency Medicine Trainees Association sent a letter to HIQA stating current conditions in emergency departments were unequivocally dangerous for patients and staff, that mortality would rise and that we would see poorer patient outcomes as a result of the cuts in emergency medicine alone.We also know what Tony O'Brien, the director of the HSE, stated about the 2014 service plan - that it would not be possible to meet fully the growing demands being placed on the health service. We are only nine days into the health service plan for 2014 and dire warnings are already emerging from a range of sectors in the health service. With regard to promised legislation, when will the Health Service Executive (Financial Matters) Bill come before the House? Is there any prospect whatsoever of a change of stance from the Government in terms of its endless attack on front-line health services?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	290	The Bill has already been published and is waiting to come into the system here.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	294	They are not very happy with a lot of stuff going on in here. We cannot do everything together and we must have a structure to fit Bills into the system so they can be debated. The Whip will arrange it. We will have a full debate in the House next week on the Health Service Executive plan, as I committed to in the House. Everybody will have their say on it and any other issues they wish to raise.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	295	Tá dhá cheist agam faoi reachtaíocht atá fógraithe, the sale of alcohol Bill and the health reform Bill. Yesterday the Taoiseach may have noted reports that there has been a considerable increase in the number of deaths involving cocktails of anti-anxiety drugs and alcohol. The figures from the health research board's national drug-related deaths index are for 2011. The index gives us the latest data on the nature and extent of premature death due to problem drug and alcohol use in Ireland. When can we expect the publication of the sale of alcohol Bill? With regard to the health reform Bill, yesterday I raised with the Taoiseach the unacceptably high number of patients on hospital trolleys and particularly the alleged failure of some hospital management teams to fully implement the HIQA Tallaght recommendations. When will the health reform Bill be introduced? Will the Taoiseach assure patients and those who care for them that its provisions will address the unacceptable systemic challenges?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	296	The reform of health Bill is this session. The sale of alcohol Bill is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, and there is a great deal of work to be done on it. The public end of the Bill is being worked upon by the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy White. We have had discussions on it and it is coming to a conclusion. There are many complications and technicalities. I agree with the Deputy about the situation on the streets, where unfortunately and tragically it seems that a mixture of alcohol and substance abuse leads to the most horrendous situations. This is a matter of concern to everybody in terms of public behaviour and access to substances and alcohol where it applies to excess. The Minister, Deputy Shatter, is dealing with the sale aspects and the Minister of State, Deputy White, is dealing with the public area. It will be the first time a Bill of this nature is published.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	297	Is there an indicative timeframe?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	301	The EirGrid Bill is not due to be published until next year, but this does not mean that issues of concern to many people will not be the subject of some serious discussion and analysis.

Everybody is aware of the programme arising from each Whips' meeting so it is a case of management. We have a short enough time in the week to get all of these things in line. It is not the first time this has happened. Chairmen should be cognisant of the outcome of Whips' meetings, which are the conclusion of discussions between the Whips of the parties.

#AineCollins	unknown-#AineCollins-party	unknown-#AineCollins-dob	unknown-#AineCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	326	I ask the Minister for Finance to clarify his plans to move towards processing most of the State's business electronically. This issue arose previously in the context of social welfare payments. It will not be possible to achieve this aim unless all citizens have what is known as a standard bank account. This will only be feasible if An Post establishes a banking system. I have asked An Post to examine this issue but I am somewhat concerned because it has not yet responded to me. The traditional banks are not interested in setting up standard bank accounts and I expect that many of these banks will pull out of rural Ireland over the next several years. With developments in information technology and electronic banking, we will have less access to face-to-face services. We need to have a conversation on who will operate the standard banking system. Given that issues arise in regard to fraud in social welfare and tracing payments, I would like everyone to have a standard bank account through which payments would be processed. In the context of banks gradually withdrawing services from smaller towns and rural areas, standard accounts are targeted at people who have traditionally dealt in cash and who do most of their business through the post office network. If the Minister is to be successful with his reform package, An Post will have to get its banking act together and facilitate these customers by developing a structure for opening standard bank accounts. This would also make rural post offices more viable and give them a chance to maintain their central role in small towns and rural communities. These post offices are much more than a place to conduct transactions. They are meeting places and focal points for the communities they serve. This is not solely a rural issue, however, because a considerable number of citizens in urban areas are also reluctant to engage with a banking system that is growing ever more aloof.  An Post has not yet replied to my inquiry as to the progress it is making on establishing a banking system. The Government has an opportunity to advance this reform package, while at the same time strengthening the role of post offices in rural Ireland. It is vital that we develop a plan which offers people a lead-in time to become aware of their options. Furthermore, if we do not have as many rural banks, issues will arise in respect of access for older people. If older people are able to lodge or withdraw money through An Post, it would be beneficial to them. It is important that we plan for this before it is forced on us.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	327	I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Finance, who is unavailable to respond to the Topical Issue raised by Deputy Áine Collins. The Deputy's suggestion may arise from the recent publication by the Minister of the report on the standard bank account pilot project. That report noted that the view of the stakeholders was that one of the key elements that will have to be part of the preparations for a successful national roll-out of a standard bank account is greater involvement by An Post and the credit unions. The report also noted that An Post and the credit unions are the best possible channel for reaching the target cohorts but pointed out that barriers of existing infrastructure had prohibited this to date. The financial inclusion working group, which is chaired by the Department of Finance, includes An Post and stakeholders from other Departments, the Central Bank, retail banks, the National Consumer Agency and voluntary sector organisations. The members of the group will work closely together on the finalisation of preparations for the standard bank account, which is expected to be rolled out during 2014. The role of An Post is one of the issues which will be dealt with in the preparations for the roll-out of the standard bank account. The Deputy will be aware that while An Post is not part of the clearing system operated by the retail banks it none the less provides a range of banking services to those who do not have a bank account, including facilities for paying bills and operating savings accounts. An Post is also the main outlet for the State's various savings schemes, such as post office bonds and savings certificates and the national solidarity bond. The Deputy will also be aware that in order to mitigate certain AIB branch closures, AIB intends to strengthen its long-standing relationship with An Post and at the same time is also launching a new mobile banking service to provide certain banking services to customers in remote locations.The mobile service will allow customers to make lodgments and withdrawals, pay bills and order foreign exchange. AIB banking services are available in more than 1,100 An Post outlets nationwide. The current services at any An Post outlet allow AIB customers to make cash lodgments for personal and business customers, avail of cash withdrawals up to a certain limit per day, pay their credit cards bills and use any of An Post's own brand services, including bill payments, postal drafts and foreign currency. In addition, AIB plans to build on this successful relationship with An Post and has arranged for additional banking facilitates to be available in more than 90 selected outlets. AIB and An Post management are working together at local, regional and national level to ensure the successful launch of this enhanced service. An Post staff will be fully trained to offer this new service in advance of the branch closure dates. I am satisfied that An Post is providing a valuable service for its customers in the financial services area. However, I am sure it can make an even greater contribution in its involvement in the financial services working group. I hope this involvement will assist in the roll-out of the standard bank account and thus expand the banking services offered by An Post, especially to those with limited access to banking services. I ask that the report the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications launched in October 2012 also be looked at. It dealt with the future of the post office network across the country and indicated some obvious ways in which the network could be used.
#AineCollins	unknown-#AineCollins-party	unknown-#AineCollins-dob	unknown-#AineCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	328	I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply. It is welcome that the standard bank account will be available in 2014. If we are to be more IT friendly and include rural areas in the process, that is an important step forward. An Post has an important role to play for many reasons. As the Minister of State said, we want to have the standard bank account, the service available in the community and to keep post offices open. The post office is probably one of the last links in rural areas and it is important that we keep them open and make them viable. I am delighted to hear that AIB is strengthening its relationship with An Post. I ask about the other pillar bank in the State. Will there be engagement between An Post and the other banks or will it be left to AIB? Will An Post be part of the clearing system? Is this seen as the way forward to enable it to operate bank accounts or can it operate as it is whereby an AIB customer can use An Post to carry out some of his or her transactions, as the Minister of State mentioned?
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	329	The Deputy has made some valuable points. On the issue of the consequences of many shops and Garda stations closing in rural areas, we must look at a model that will keep rural areas alive. The post office network contributes a great deal in that regard and will play a strong role in the future. As I said, in the document the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications published some two years ago on the future of the network, it was indicated An Post would need additional services, of which banking would be part. One needs banks and people need to be able to access money. This impacts on rural areas, whether it be tourism, agriculture or people bringing their children to school. The Deputy's points are well made. I agree that we need such infrastructure. There is no point in allowing the post office network to close down. We must give them something to do and offering banking and financial services would be really good for them. I take the Deputy's point on AIB. I am not aware of the position on other banks. There should be some communication with the banks that are working with businesses in Ireland and such banks should not forget rural areas in this context. If they close down some of their branches in rural areas, like AIB, they should provide services for customers to make them more amenable. On the point made about the clearing system, I will certainly have the issue raised with the officials.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	330	I raise this issue because of a letter written by the Irish Emergency Medicine Trainees Association to HIQA and the HSE. By any stretch of the imagination, it is extraordinary that people would go to these lengths to highlight difficulties in emergency departments. We have a situation where up to 400 patients can be waiting on trolleys at certain times in emergency departments throughout the country and the Irish Emergency Medicine Trainees Association has highlighted that this is an unsafe practice. The Minister has made great claims about the success achieved in dealing with the numbers of patients in emergency departments, but there is still a problem with overcrowding in emergency departments throughout the country. It is simply not the case that there has been a significant decrease in the number of patients on trolleys. There are still up to 400 patients at some times waiting to be transferred from the emergency department to a proper ward in the acute hospital setting or referred on to somewhere else. One of the Minister's stated claims in his "FairCare" document was that the abolition of long waiting times on trolleys, how we dealt with emergency medicine and how we provided safe treatments in emergency departments throughout the country would be a central tenet of his policy. Even though, as I accept, there has been a reduction, after three years of the Minister's administration, it is the case that there are escalating trolley counts in emergency departments throughout the country. In addition, we now have the most senior clinicians in the country stating there are unsafe practices which pose a threat to patient safety in emergency departments throughout the country. Only before Christmas the CEOs of major tertiary hospitals were highlighting the fact that they were in the position where they could no longer guarantee patient safety. The Minister has put great store in the fact that he is a GP, but he should be conscious of the fact that senior clinicians have highlighted issues about patient safety and the transfer of infectious diseases and viral infections because of overcrowding and the fact that staff are under such pressure that it is, to quote the letter, "unequivocally dangerous for patients and staff". At some stage he must accept this fact. He is the last person in denial about this issue. He established the special delivery unit which was going to solve all of the problems in emergency departments throughout the country. There was going to be a sustainable and dramatic decrease in the numbers of patients waiting on trolleys. What we have found out since is that while it made inroads at the start, it is falling back quite rapidly to a point where this month there have been spikes of up to 400 patients a day in emergency departments throughout the country. If one couples this with the Minister's other claims about outpatient and inpatient appointments, by any stretch of the imagination, these do not meet the aims of his document, to which I referred, which states:ACCESS is a right - not a privilege In health, delayed treatment can lead to pain, complications and even death. More than 150,000 people are currently waiting for an outpatient appointment...Some 340,000 people are now waiting for an outpatient appointment.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	348	There has been no spike of up to 400 people on trolleys in emergency departments this year. The Deputy opposite should get his facts right. What has happened here includes ward watch figures, which we accept and acknowledge, where people are on trolleys elsewhere up through the hospital, but there has never been 400. The Deputy should get that right. Ward watch came in during the course of last year. Therefore, it is very difficult to compare what is happening this year with last year and certainly impossible to compare what is happening this year with what happened in 2011 when we know there were 569 people on trolleys in one day and that was in the emergency departments. That did not include ward watch or how many people were inappropriately placed throughout the system. There has been a massive improvement. I have always regarded trolley waits to be an unacceptable feature of the Irish health system, which is the reason I set up the special delivery unit in 2011. Since then we have a 33.8% reduction in the number of patients waiting on trolleys, that is, 29,200 fewer people waiting. While such improvements are significant, I accept the challenges continue, particularly in the early part of the year. It is more than unfortunate but not unanticipated that a number of our hospitals have been experiencing pressures since last week. Many hospitals are coping well with the demands arising from emergency department pressures and the main difficulties are concentrated in a relatively small number of hospitals and I will outline those in the course of my response. The trolley counts of the last few days are disappointing and both I and the HSE acknowledge the distress and discomfort for patients so affected. This is, in part, as a result of the seasonal flux in hospital activity that traditionally takes place after Christmas and the new year. A similar pattern has been occurring in emergency departments across Northern Ireland and England, with a large surge in activity and waiting times since the start of the year. Many of our hospitals are reporting increased admission rates with higher acuity of presentations noted, particularly among the frail elderly. In response, there has been an intensive engagement between the special delivery unit and the hospitals affected, concentrating on those with the most pressures particularly in recent days. Hospitals are working with the special delivery unit to ensure they balance the demand for scheduled and unscheduled care, maximise discharge planning and take additional measures to relieve pressures as required.  Additional funding has been provided for enhanced home and community care packages. Funding has also been targeted to address areas of acute services which are likely to experience increased service demand.  In regard to the implementation of the HIQA report on Tallaght hospital, work is well under way to implement all of the recommendations in hospitals. In line with established HSE policy on the implementation of major reports, the HSE established an implementation oversight group to progress the report's recommendations, which reports to HIQA on its progress regularly. Updates on progress are available publicly on the HSE website.  In all there are 17 recommendations which relate to unscheduled care of the 33 total recommendations in the HIQA Tallaght report. In general terms, there is strong evidence of progress in key areas such as the completion of early morning ward rounds, the application of the Manchester triage system and the robust review of waiting lists. This progress is indicative of the strong national leadership and levels of local engagement around these critical issues. The implementation of the national early warning score and maternity early warning score have also added significantly to the care of patients.

We had a case of 426 people on trolleys on the 6th, 461 on the 7th and 467 on the 8th. Whether they are in the emergency department or in a ward, the fact remains that they are on trolleys and it is not considered good medical practice to have people parked up on corridors throughout a hospital.

There was a case recently of ambulances waiting outside CUH in Cork because they were unable to discharge patients due to the emergency department being overcrowded. Ambulances that were required elsewhere were waiting because the hospital could not discharge the patients. The Minister is trying to tell me that after three years he has achieved an awful lot in terms of addressing the trolley counts, but that is simply not credible. The letter from the Irish Emergency Medicine Trainees Association highlights the fact that after two years the HIQA report into Tallaght hospital, which made recommendations, has not been acted upon.

This is utterly unacceptable but we get surges of activity and we take action. Today that number has fallen to 30 and it will fall further as we open more beds in the Merlin Park hospital and take other actions as well.It is the same in Cork. The system experiences surges in different parts of the country at different times and I have already pointed out that this happens in the North of Ireland and England. We take action to address it. Deputy Kelleher mentioned my raising the figure of 56,000 people waiting for outpatient services. The Government of which he was part never bothered to count the number of people waiting for outpatient services. We were the first Government to do so and tomorrow we will release figures showing a massive improvement in the number of people who have had to wait over one year. It is well over 100,000 people; that is the legacy left by Deputy Kelleher's Government. I am reminded of the words of Bill Clinton when he said that what was really annoying people was that it was taking him so long to clean up their mess. The bottom line is that there have been 29,200 fewer people on trolleys in the past 12 months since we took over. That is progress and is attributable to the men and women who work in our health service. I want to commend them at every opportunity. Despite the January we have had, the figures are still lower this year than this time last year. No amount of finger-wagging and head-shaking from Deputy Kelleher-----

The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, have also responded. During the Fianna Fáil Administration, Deputy Eamon Ó Cuív responded to parliamentary questions on it. The story originates in 2003 and has gone on for over a decade. Donegal County Council was charged with dredging the channel at the harbour at Burtonport in 2003. The council ran into difficulties regarding the disposal of the spoil, the dredged material. It reached an agreement with a local family, the Boyle family, to use some of the Boyle lands, comprising a small number of islands adjacent to the harbour, as a solution to the dumping problem in removing the silt. It was agreed to use the rock contained on the small islands owned by the Boyle family as a bund and to store the dredged material within the bunded area. The result from the point of view of the council is a saving of over €500,000. I have access to letters from council officials to this effect. That was the value of the quarried rock at the time. The result of this work was a new plot of land consisting of Mr. Boyle's original islands and the new reclaimed foreshore. The agreement with the family was that the new piece of land, the reclaimed foreshore, and the original land owned by the family would be transferred to him by the council as part of the original agreement. The intention of the family was to build commercial, community and retail units and a marina that would create dozens of jobs and kick-start the local economy, not to mention bringing in taxes to the local exchequer and rates to Donegal County Council. Part of the agreement was that the Boyle family would transfer to the council part of the land to assist the council with car parking. What has happened in the past ten years? The harbour has been dredged, the infill has happened and the rock owned by the Boyle family was used by Donegal County Council, saving the council over €500,000. However, the transfer never took place because it was caught up in some legal wrangle, according to answers to parliamentary questions from Deputy Coveney, Deputy Hogan and Deputy Ó Cuív. It is now over four years since Donegal County Council paid €130,000 as the agreed fee for the transfer of the foreshore licence. The Boyle family was chosen as the preferred partner to develop the marina project and a grant of €465,000 was allocated for the project. Unfortunately, the grant was lost and it is claimed it was lost because of the delays in the project. As entrepreneurs, the Boyle family have come up with another proposal to develop the area to enhance it in respect of tourism. This is all dependent on the transfer of the foreshore licence. I ask the Minister of State to outline why agreement was reached between the local authority, the State and the family. The family lived up to its agreement and there was a huge benefit to Donegal County Council. However, 11 years on, the State has not lived up to its part of the agreement. How are we supposed to create employment? I invite the Minister of State to visit Burtonport and see what was once a thriving fishing community on its knees. When local people come up with initiatives and want to create employment and enhance the community, red tape at official level stalls the process. How has it taken 11 years when a foreshore licence agreement has not been implemented, despite the fee having been paid over four years ago by the local authority?

I know of his interest in it. He referred to a number of parliamentary questions on it. Proposals for activity and development on the foreshore vary greatly in terms of their nature, scale and complexity, and the time required to determine applications varies accordingly. There is a long and complicated history to this. The Burtonport foreshore consent application on hand with my Department has two aspects. First, it involves an application for a lease for an area of reclaimed foreshore at Burtonport Harbour by Donegal County Council. Secondly, it involves a proposal by Donegal County Council to sublease a portion of the reclaimed foreshore concerned to a third party. There is a long and complex history to this particular case. At the time of the original application, Donegal County Council wanted to purchase the foreshore in question. However, the position of the then Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources was that a lease should instead be granted for the maximum term of 99 years. As a matter of routine, sanction from the Department of Finance, now the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, is required for lease terms in excess of 35 years. Sanction was secured in October 2007, subject among other things to a valuation being obtained and agreed by the council. After a series of negotiations, the valuation was finally agreed with the council in October 2010. The council elected to lodge payment in respect of the leasehold premium in October 2010, in advance of any request for payment from my Department or any lease agreement being in place. Over time, the nature of the proposal for which the council had originally intended to make the third party sublease changed substantially. This gave rise to a number of legal issues, on which my Department needed to seek legal clarification. My Department has been engaging with the Chief State Solicitor's office on this case since November 2010. The present position is that legal advice is awaited from the Attorney General's office and, until this advice is received, it is not possible to indicate when this matter will be concluded. My Department's legal advisers have been appraised of the pressing need to resolve legal matters relating to the case. My Department is in regular contact with the county council to ensure it is aware of the position, with the most recent contact taking place in December 2013.I realise it has been going on for a long time and we will seek to expedite the issue.

My colleague in the local authority, Councillor Marie Therese Gallagher, has been pursuing the issue at a local level with the local authority for many years. I should reiterate that this started in 2003; we have had a boom and bust since then, along with a banking expansion and collapse. We also had the imposition of a troika agreement, which we have since exited. Banks have been nationalised and liquidated. We have had all of these issues, which I am sure are more complex than fulfilling a legal agreement between a local authority and a person who wants to create jobs in an area of significant deprivation. I have dealt with four Ministers on this issue and I have spoken with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor. It is simply not acceptable that 11 years later the best legal brains in the country cannot come up with a solution or draw a line under this project one way or another. How can it take years for the Chief State Solicitor or the Attorney General to give advice on the issue? My view is that because the project is located in Burtonport, it is not a priority. There is no way legal teams are sitting around in the offices of the Chief State Solicitor or the Attorney General with the Burtonport file day in and day out; it is simply not happening. The issue is at the bottom of a pile because it has not been prioritised. It should be prioritised, as this is about creating jobs, but it is also a breach of an agreement which was of significant benefit to the State. The Boyle family have been penalised and have lost nearly €500,000 in grant aid to build a marina that would have been successful at the time. Yet they have not sat back; they have decided to look at a tourism-oriented caravan project that will bring people to an area in west Donegal to experience the rich culture and beauty of the area, with Arranmore and other islands just off Burtonport. That would bring some tourism potential to an area that is screaming out for it. I appreciate the Minister of State's final comments, but something must be done. A Minister must see that enough is enough, as this family has been treated shabbily for one reason or another. It should not have taken 11 years for this to be dealt with, so a deadline should be set so that the issue can be resolved.

It is important to remember what happened in the early hours of 14 February 1981, when a catastrophic fire swept through the Stardust disco in Artane, which is in my constituency. There were 850 people present and most were between the ages of 18 and 25. Sadly, 48 people died and 128 people were seriously injured. The nightmare continues today for the families affected, who seek the truth, facts and, above all, justice. We should remember that the Stardust fire remains the greatest disaster to have occurred in the history of the State, so these families deserve our support, compassion and, above all, justice. I have supported these families for many years and now they want the truth, so surely they are not asking for too much. I urge the Minister seriously to consider the new evidence put together by Robin Knox & Associates, fire and building regulation consultants, and the legal team for the Stardust families. I raised the issue with the Minister for Justice and Equality on 10 December 2013 and in response the Minister indicated that no new grounds were put forward. He also stated that there were no plans to reopen the inquiry. Today I ask the Minister to examine the new facts and evidence. The transcripts of the 122 days of evidence to the 1981 Keane inquiry referred to over 500 photographs of the incident scene. The photographer selected and presented approximately 100 prints to the inquiry. There were no photographs of the kitchen, the remains of the first floor store, the lamp room, the purported basement, the cold room, the ground floor stores or the ground exit passage to the door below the first floor exit and the external escape stairway. This is new evidence not considered by Keane. Researchers asked in 2006 for a photograph of the firefighting water-filled basement that Mr. John Gallagher, senior counsel for the independent examination, and later Mr. Paul Coffey, senior counsel, were offered. The families knew at the time that there was no basement, and that is also new evidence. Both of the Coffey independent examination reports from 10 December 2008 and 7 January 2009 include the first and second floor plans prepared by the researchers at the request of Mr. Gallagher, which also show new evidence. The plans were prepared by the families from facts garnered in their own investigation and knowledge, and without the advantage of the 1981 transcripts of evidence. The Coffey reports do not mention the basement, and this is new evidence. The Coffey reports mention a cold room that was not mentioned by the Keane inquiry, and this is new evidence. At the European Court of Human Rights, an observation relating to the Stardust families was that the "applicants noted in their observation that they did not receive a copy of the letter of 14 February 2008", which was after the Coffey review. However, the applicants did not indicate how this letter, which explains some of the reasons the police did not pursue prosecutions in 1982, could constitute "new, relevant evidence". I call on the coroner to revisit the issue and reopen the incomplete inquest into the cause of death for each victim. We should hear the new and truthful facts.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	415	On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. The Minister regrets that he is unable to be present due to other business this afternoon. The Minister would like to again emphasise that irrespective of any differences of opinion, nobody disputes the magnitude of the tragedy or the impact it had on the families concerned and on the wider community. We are all conscious that the anniversary of the fire is approaching and that this must be a particularly difficult time of year for all affected. The Minister has previously set out the background to the examination of the issues surrounding the Stardust fire, but it is necessary to summarise them again here so as to respond properly to the Deputy. As he will be aware, following a long campaign on the part of the victims, Mr. Paul Coffey, senior counsel, was appointed in 2008 by the then Government, with the agreement of the victims' committee, to review the case made by the committee for a new inquiry into the fire. The committee argued the original tribunal was flawed and that it had new evidence concerning the fire, which supported an alternative explanation for its cause. Mr. Coffey publicly invited submissions from all interested parties and the committee gave extensive oral evidence and made written submissions as to the case for a new inquiry. Funding was provided to assist the committee with the legal and expert costs of participation in this process. Mr. Coffey's report was published in January 2009. He concluded that the original tribunal finding of arson was hypothetical only and that nobody present on the night could be held responsible.He further concluded that in the absence of any identified evidence as to the cause of the fire, the most another inquiry could achieve would be another set of hypothetical findings which would not be in the public interest. The new and other evidence relied on by the committee, according to Mr. Coffey's analysis, at its highest merely established that the cause of the fire was unknown, a finding already made but not properly acknowledged by the original tribunal. The then Government accepted Mr. Coffey's findings and introduced motions in the Oireachtas in 2009 endorsing his conclusions and expressing sympathy with the affected families. These motions were passed in both Houses. By endorsing Mr. Coffey's conclusion that the finding of arson was hypothetical only and that no one present could be held responsible, the motions also addressed a long-standing stigma of suggested criminality which some of the victims and bereaved felt hung over all who had been in attendance on the night. Mr. Coffey's findings were widely welcomed and many Deputies and Senators spoke in support of the motions to which I have referred. Over time, however, there has continued to be dissatisfaction which has given rise to extensive correspondence from the committee and its representatives to the Minister's Department and various agencies, including correspondence referring to possible legal action. Throughout this correspondence, the committee continued to argue for the validity of its alternative hypothesis as to cause of the fire. Issues have been raised by members of the committee about the Coffey report. There has been an entirely unfounded suggestion that attempts were made to influence its drafting or conclusions. The Minister has previously made it clear, for the avoidance of doubt, that no such influence was brought to bear. Unwarranted significance has been attributed to changes between a draft report and the final report. Of course, the nature of draft reports is such that they do change and the Government must rely on the final report submitted by Mr. Coffey. Mr. Coffey's conclusions and advice were entirely independent and, as I have said, widely welcomed on publication. The Minister has the greatest sympathy for all those affected by the fire and understands those involved in the committee remain convinced that their explanation for what happened on the night represents what did occur. Nothing he has seen in the extensive correspondence to date, however, would be grounds for his taking a different view from the conclusions set out in Mr. Coffey's findings and endorsed in both Houses. The Minister is aware from recent reported statements that the committee intends to present a submission on the cause of the fire on the occasion of the forthcoming anniversary. At that or another time, he will, of course, arrange for the examination, as appropriate, of any such submission and for a response to be issued to the committee in due course. He feels, however, that it would be unfair to those who have suffered so much to raise unrealistic expectations about what can be achieved or to suggest what Mr. Coffey found can be set aside simply on the basis that his conclusions are not accepted by some. It is right, of course, that concerns about this dreadful and tragic event should be raised in this House and I thank the Deputy for raising the matter at this time.

I wish to focus on a number of points he made. The families' position is quite clear. They are seeking an independent expert to examine the new facts I have presented to the House today. They do not want a lengthy tribunal – I accept that this is not what they are seeking – and would prefer to have somebody who would go through the new evidence, link it with the previous reports and deal with particular issues that arise. It is important that we take cognisance of the fact that 48 young people died in this horrific tragedy and that 128 were injured, many of whom are still suffering today. There is much hurt and sadness. I appreciate the Minister of State's sympathy for the families, but I feel very strongly that we need more than sympathy. We need to be compassionate, but we also need to be open to the idea of getting the truth and the facts. I welcome the Minister of State's comment that no one present on the night can be held responsible. This is one point we got out of the way earlier. There is one chink of light in the Minister of State's response, namely, his statement that the Minister is aware from recent reported statements that the committee intends to present a submission. He said, "he will, of course, arrange for the examination, as appropriate, of any such submission and for a response to be issued to the committee in due course". That is the chink of light I would like to see. I would like to see the Minister examine the report which we have sent in. I have also sent in some of the evidence to the Minister in the past week because I met the families on a number of occasions recently. He should examine carefully what he sees in front of him. Of course, he should respond, but the bottom line is that the families are seeking a quick independent re-examination of the evidence. Even if the concerns of only a few families are at stake, we owe this to them. As I stated before, this was the worst tragedy in the history of the State. A total of 48 young people between the ages of 18 and 25 years died and 128 were injured. Many of the survivors still have the scars today. The State could be a little more flexible. I, therefore, urge the Minister to reconsider his position.

We all recall it so vividly, even after so many years, and I thank the Deputy for raising the matter again. I assure him that the points he has made will be brought to the attention of the Minister who is aware that there is dissatisfaction that it has not been possible to determine the true cause of the fire with certainty. He entirely sympathises with the frustration of the victims' committee in this regard. He sympathises with all those who continue to be affected by the tragedy. However, the position is that an independent examination by Mr. Coffey was carried out to assess the committee's case and substantial assistance was provided for the committee to participate in the process. Mr. Coffey's conclusions led to a motion of great significance being passed by both Houses clarifying the record as to the cause of the fire. Mr. Coffey also concluded that there remained no actual identified evidence as to the cause of the fire. In that context, in line with the motions, the best another inquiry could produce would be another set of hypothetical findings which would not be in the public interest. However, as I have said on behalf of the Minister, if a submission is made, it will be examined, but nothing raised in the correspondence to date would be grounds for him taking a different view from that set out in Mr. Coffey's findings. I again thank the Deputy for his continued interest in this terrible tragedy.

#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	419	As I was saying earlier, I have a number of questions on this amendment. The Minister in his contribution earlier said that it was within the remit of a local authority to set a refund rate from 100% downwards. Is it possible that a local authority would allow for a full refund of rates and that it could be set at zero? My next question relates to how the legislation is written. The Minister can correct me if I am wrong, but my understanding is that the owner or occupier of a premises would have to pay the rates and then claim the refund, which has big implications in the context of cashflow for businesses. If that is the case, it is a weakness in the way the Bill is drafted, because I know that is not the Minister's intention here. I can see the merit in this provision, which aims to release property back onto the market. Local authorities do not want people holding on to premises and letting them go into disrepair, thus dragging down the whole streetscape, but how would it work in a rural electoral area or division? In my own county of Roscommon, each electoral division covers a massive geographical area. While the issue may be relevant on one particular street in one particular town, it may not be applicable anywhere else within that electoral division. Is flexibility afforded to local authorities to designate a particular area within an electoral division? It seems that the way the provision is drafted at present makes it suitable for cities but not necessarily for rural areas. Indeed, it may even be a problem within cities, depending on how the electoral areas are divided. If, for example, the main thoroughfare is the dividing line, with a very dispersed area on one side and a highly commercial area on the other side, the local authority might decide to apply different refund rates in each area, which would mean different rates would apply to either side of the street, which would not make sense. I ask the Minister to clarify the situation in that regard. More flexibility and discretion needs to be given to individual local authorities in terms of how they apply business rates in particular circumstances, especially in the current economic climate. One issue that is particularly relevant to a county such as my own and to other rural counties is the need to be able to vary the rate based on the size of premises. To give an example, in County Roscommon, 5% of ratepayers pay 50% of the rates. A 1% reduction in the rate to those ratepayers would give them a saving of €653 on rates that are in excess of €20,000 per annum, which is a minuscule saving to them. However, a saving of €653 to the 95% of ratepayers who pay the other 50% of the rates collected would make a significant difference to those businesses in terms of their longer-term viability. A scheme in place in the United Kingdom since 2005 called the small business rate relief scheme allows for rate relief for businesses up to a certain threshold. I believe the threshold is currently £5,000. Could the Minister investigate the feasibility of doing something like that here? We know that the biggest difficulties are faced by the very small retailers who are being squeezed by the major retailers in the towns. If one wants to see good footfall on the main streets in towns and commercially viable town centres, those small businesses need support, because they encourage people to come in and walk through towns. I ask the Minister to examine that issue further. We need to do more to encourage small business start-ups. Many Deputies would have come across situations in which an individual wants to set up a new business but finds that there is a significant overhang of a rates bill on a preferred premises. That usually comes up when a property is being sold. The overhang is carried with the property. I know this issue has been raised previously and it is addressed in the legislation-----

The other issue is the possibility of giving a rates exemption to new businesses which do not have an impact on an existing business within the catchment area. The term "displacement" is used by the Department in the context of Leader funding. Leader programmes can fund a particular project if it does not have an impact on another project within the same catchment area. I suggest that a similar provision should be put in place for rates. Let us say, for example, there is a town which does not have a shoe shop. The local authority for that town could decide, in conjunction with the retailers, to exempt for two years a shoe shop established on the main street, which would increase footfall - literally - into the town and would also benefit the other businesses. That would help to alleviate some of the pressures on businesses. I hope the Minister will give it some consideration.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	422	As other Deputies have said, this particular provision was introduced in Dublin, Limerick and Cork with the objective of mobilising properties where landlords were sitting on them. There is a difference of opinion on this, and the circumstances of each of the local authorities will determine how they might implement such a scheme. There is a provision in the development contribution scheme which allows for derelict sites to have a lower or higher development contribution rate applied if a local authority wants to enhance development. Obviously, if the rate is lowered, this incentivises people to develop sites. Such an incentivised scheme under the development contribution scheme might apply to people who receive grant assistance from Enterprise Ireland, the IDA or the local enterprise board and could be targeted at particular areas.There is discretion for local councillors to do this under the existing development contribution scheme. I am conscious of what Deputy Denis Naughten said about rural areas where it would be ideal to have a targeted response to commercial rates. The Deputy will have an opportunity to discuss that issue in the debate on the valuation Bill because commercial rates can only be applied based on the overhaul of the valuation scheme. Committee Stage of the Bill will be taken in the Seanad next month. I have no difficulty with the sentiments expressed, but I cannot deal with them in the context of the Bill under discussion.

In practice, there will be engagement with local authority officials where there is no difficulty in entering into arrangements with the landlord in question in the event of difficulties with cashflow or where he or she may not have the money, depending on circumstances. We can specify a pragmatic approach in the guidelines we will lay down in order to address a situation where one will not have a cheque coming in one door and another going out the other on the same day. In practice, local authorities will have discretion to enter into arrangements. A refund could range from nil to 100%. It is up to the elected members to decide on a local electoral area basis or a combination of local electoral areas. I have ensured as much discretion as possible under the scheme and it is entirely up to elected members to decide on a reserved function basis.  That summarises the position. A number of other matters were raised by the Deputy in terms of varying the rate and targeting responses. All of these issues will be matters for discussion in the debate on the valuation Bill.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	425	This is a significant improvement on what was contained in the original Bill, which specified that it would be 100%. The Minister clearly accepted the point, as most of us argued that it was likely to be unworkable because there would be huge variations in letting a premises in Dublin city centre as opposed to somewhere in the midlands or west. We should acknowledge the significant change that has been made. One of the positive aspects is that it is not a one-size-fits-all approach. Individual local authorities will have discretion because there will be wide variations, including within counties and cities. I presume it will work in the same way as the current system whereby some local authorities give a refund to a premises occupied by an entity with charitable status. In fact, no money changes hands. While a bill is issued, the amount is written off at the end of the year. I presume that is the way the system will work. The Minister mentioned development contributions which will be changed significantly following the setting up of Irish Water. According to the delegates who appeared before the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht in recent weeks, there will be a rationalisation of development contributions. We have heard that a uniform approach will be taken and that the money will go from local authorities which collect it to Irish Water. A sizeable amount of the development contributions collected will be for water and wastewater. Apart from change of use, the bulk of the development contributions will be paid for new builds. Payments based on change of use will account for a small proportion of the overall amount. Very often development contributions are not even levied where there is a change of use. A case in point would be a premises used as a hairdresser’s where a lot of water is used as opposed to a sweet shop. I do not understand the Minister’s point on the impact of development contributions because we are talking about premises already in place. He referred to rebates being given for unoccupied premises. I do not understand the relationship with development contributions from that point of view. The Minister has said rates will be levied at county or city level, as opposed to municipal level. He has also said the refund will be decided at municipal level as opposed to local electoral area level. How does that match with the construction of the rate at plenary level, for want of a better term? Will this be decided at municipal level before one strikes a rate? Will it be decided once a year? How does the Minister anticipate that the system will work in practice?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	426	It is a decision made by the council which might decide to change it on a reserved function basis from year to year or every couple of years or it might not decide to change it at all. It is a matter for it to decide. I want to give maximum discretion to the elected members to decide the matter for themselves. It will be done on a local electoral area basis, namely, a county basis. There is a slight difference between the municipal district and local electoral area. That is the basis on which rates will be decided. It could also be done by a combination of local electoral areas. I wish to provide for the maximum discretion in order to cover the issues raised by Deputy Denis Naughten which might be more applicable to his constituency than to Deputy Catherine Murphy’s. There will still be variations under the refund scheme. If one gives discretion to councillors and each local authority can apply the maximum discretion, there will be variations. I hope the rates will be more reflective of local circumstances on the basis that one size does not fit all, as Deputy Catherine Murphy correctly pointed out. Councillors make decisions on the development contribution scheme. There is provision, for example, for derelict sites, a point made by Deputy Denis Naughten. The rationale behind the scheme was to deal with commercial rates on the basis that a premises might be abandoned because a business might not be able to pay the rent or it could fall on difficult financial times and the site might be empty for some time before a new tenant could take over. There is provision in the development contribution scheme for derelict sites. If a property has not been occupied for a considerable time, it will fall into disrepair. Councillors have discretion to address the issue. The provision could be seen as an incentive, on the one hand, and a disincentive, on the other, through the commercial rates mechanism. The background is that maximum discretion is provided in order to mobilise property and put it into commercial use or give it an enterprise function. Deputy Catherine Murphy should examine the rates and the development contribution scheme in their totality in terms of incentivising properties to be put into use and generate economic activity.

I welcome the amendment which was discussed at length on Committee Stage when concern was expressed by Members across the board about the original proposals. Some local authorities were happy to retain the 50% refund which had been in place for many years. The Minister referred to Dublin, Limerick and Cork in that regard. They might have become accustomed to the revenue stream, while others might have been lobbying for this. It is definitely not a case of one size fits all. The rates refund is directly related to demand which is substantially different in city centres compared to towns and villages. The Minister has listened and shown that there is an economic difference between some of the cities I mentioned and towns and villages. It is important that councillors will have the power and discretion to judge for themselves and be accountable for whatever rate refund measure they implement in their local authority area. Everything is related to demand. We have many vacant properties in towns and villages and especially in rural areas. The Minister will be aware of this in his own constituency. We must try to do all we can to incentivise town and village centre renewal. Measures have been taken to encourage residential use over shops and increase footfall in towns and villages.Any action we can take to incentivise this must be taken. I am concerned that some local authorities might use the power for another revenue-raising stream without taking any cognisance of the economic challenges faced by many towns and villages. There are reasons certain properties are vacant. We certainly do not want landlords squatting on them. If that is the case in certain urban areas, it will give councillors the power to address this issue. However, there could be towns and villages where property is vacant simply because the demand is not there. It would be unfair to impose another burden on these properties in such circumstances. We need to strike a balance in this regard and I hope the amendment will give discretion to local authorities which are better placed to measure the needs and economic activities in their respective areas. I welcome Seanad amendment No. 16.

I notice the Minister’s two party colleagues from Waterford are in the Chamber. The statement springs to mind about the 20% reduction in rates in Waterford thanks to the Minister’s grant.

It is important that the Minister’s Department feed into it. He referred to the concept of flexibility. I have spoken to county managers, many of whom do not want flexibility in the area of rates because they believe they would be under pressure from councillors, Deputies or Ministers as a result. It is important, however, that there be a rate-setting mechanism that meets people's requirements and that is practical and pragmatic. While the Minister has reiterated that it is not an issue for today, it is important to realise, while having a rate set on a premises based on square footage, that turnover could vary year in and year out. Such a model is not fair, sustainable or practical. Deputy Denis Naughten has pointed out that 5% of businesses in Roscommon pay 50% of the rates. Local authority management has used this as a mechanism not to reduce rates, with the argument being that the ones that will benefit will be the larger firms which can easily pay. There should be a tiered mechanism for rates. It is important that the Department feed into the valuation Bill with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. If the issue comes up on the floor of the House when we are dealing with that legislation, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will probably be reluctant to take any amendments on it. I know the Minister does not like to get involved with independent bodies, but some decisions taken on the breakdown of different local electoral areas, to the man on the ground, have no pragmatic basis. In some cases, there is not even a mathematical basis to the divisions. It may be no harm to look at this in an objective way in order that when the next revision of local authority boundaries happens, the same mistakes will not be repeated. It is my understanding - the Minister can correct me - that the local area authority will set the rate and that the moneys raised will go into the county pot. The kernel of the issue is vacant properties. In Greystones, for example, there is a limited number of commercial units. Accordingly, owing to high demand, if one were empty, it would not be for long. Today it was pointed out to me by the president of Arklow Chamber of Commerce that there was not the same demand in that town. The local authority in Arklow will, therefore, pitch a zero rate for a vacant property. In Greystones the local authority might be anxious for the premises to be occupied, as there is a demand for it. Accordingly, it could pitch the rate at 50% or 100% for a vacant property. The difficulty arises when it comes to the moneys raised in this manner going into the county pot. If the rate were zero in Arklow, pressure would come on councillors in Greystones in asking why the moneys raised by way of a 50% rate in that town should go into the county pot. Is there merit in subdividing the moneys based on empty premises that come from a local electoral area? Should Greystones, in the example I have just used, get back the moneys raised on empty premises to be put into its own area pot as opposed to a wider county pot? Accordingly, if councillors in Arklow, Wicklow or Baltinglass decide to have a zero rate, they should get back zero moneys. The danger in all of the money going into the county pot is that the lowest common denominator might win out and there would be pressure in the Greystones area to set the rate at zero.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	431	Deputy Paudie Coffey was concerned about the fact that this provision could become a revenue-raising mechanism for local authorities. That is the price one pays for democracy when devolving functions. It is up to the local authority membership to decide, most of whom I expect to be pro-enterprise and practical individuals elected by the people to present initiatives that will be pro-employment. This is an important vehicle by which we can meet the objective of mobilising property into employment creating opportunities. The commercial rates refund scheme is not a revenue-raising mechanism but a policy instrument to meet certain objectives in local authority areas. The valuation Bill is on Committee Stage to be taken in the Seanad next month. I have fed into that Bill as I agree with having a joined-up approach to these issues. It is critical legislation in meeting some of the targeted responses for small businesses that Deputies Billy Timmins and Denis Naughten have mentioned. All of us will be keeping an eye on that legislation’s progress. On the examples of Greystones and Arklow given by Deputy Billy Timmins, it must be remembered that these are difficult decisions that councillors in each municipal and local elected area need to make. It will depend on the budgetary arithmetic in each county. I am sure one will have a different view on this issue at the plenary sessions in the local authority areas in County Wicklow. That is the way it is. One has to argue the point and get the majority on side for whatever devolved responsibilities and reserved functions I will give to councillors to allow for maximum discretion in dealing with this issue. I am delighted some Deputies referred to the difficulties one might have with devolved responsibilities because on Second Stage I was told there was not much in the Bill on devolving functions at local level. It is gratifying to hear the concerns Members have about giving too much power to local councillors.

I agree with him as there are particular instances in this regard that we both share.

I am sure there would be a fair amount of activity on all sides of the House about where one should draw any line in terms of political interference.

Deputy John Deasy, on his own initiative, started working on this issue. As I agreed with his proposal, I began working with him. We recognised that what was appropriate in one area of a county would not necessarily be appropriate in another. Being able to give a refund on a vacant premises should be allowable in some places but not in others. It is also appropriate that councils should have discretion in this regard because, after all, local authorities should be much more familiar with the situation on the ground than central government. I thank Deputy John Deasy for initiating this amendment and the Minister for listening to our suggestion.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	437	As Members are aware, rates are a stable source of financing for local government and make an important contribution for the provision of local services. I have been concerned with an aspect of rating legislation that in my view gives rise to an unfair burden on new occupiers of rateable property, be they companies that wish to expand, relocate or start up. The subsequent occupier provisions contained in the Poor Relief (Ireland) Acts 1838 and 1849 determine that occupiers can be held liable for up to two years' worth of unpaid commercial rates of the previous occupier. I am taking the opportunity in amendment No. 111 to repeal those provisions and eliminate this financial burden for new occupiers to ensure that any possible barriers to enterprise development are removed. Removing this liability offers the possibility that property that may otherwise have remained vacant and unoccupied can now be re-let, thus improving opportunities in the property market and reducing the incidence of vacant commercial properties. The amendments to this effect are set out in Part 4 of Schedule 2. At present, there is no requirement for property owners to notify the local authority of a change in property ownership or when a new tenant takes up occupation of the premises. This can create a difficulty for local authorities in establishing who should be liable for commercial rates and often can lead to costly legal cases and an additional burden on staff resources. Short-term lettings also contribute to the challenge with both issues, resulting in a loss of income to the authority, which is passed on indirectly to other ratepayers in the form of higher local authority charges. It is in this context that I am taking the opportunity in amendment No. 17 to introduce a new duty to inform the local authority of the transfer of rateable property, be it a change in ownership or tenancy, in order that the local authority is in a position to ensure liability can be established as soon as it falls due. The amendment details the nature of these requirements and the penalty for non-compliance. Subsection 2(a) places an obligation on property owners to notify the local authority of a change in interest within two weeks of the transfer. This includes a transfer of ownership or tenancy where the person to whom the interest transfers will become liable for rates. This therefore applies in circumstances where the new owner takes up occupation of the premises or a new tenant is moving in. It does not, therefore, apply where ownership of the property is changing and there is no changing occupancy, that is, the change in ownership does not affect the existing tenant.

I thank the Minister and his officials for dealing with our amendment and the variation that has resulted from the amendment we tabled. The reason we tabled an amendment was very simple. We both had spoken to local government officials who were being placed in an invidious position. In many cases, they approached us and told us that while they really should not be writing off any arrears on rates, they could not afford not to. They needed to keep money moving within the local economy and while on the one hand they endangered themselves because the local government auditor could have told them that what they were doing was completely wrong, on the other hand they believed themselves to be in no position to try to stop sales or leaseholds from going through because there were arrears of rates on particular properties. There is a sense of inevitability about this clause and this amendment the Minister has introduced today. For a long time, local government officials have been anxious to deal with this issue because they did not wish to hold up a sale or a leasehold. However, there is a flip side to this, namely, that approximately €300 million to €400 million is owed in arrears at present. In this context, the Minister must keep an eye on officials and there must be checks with regard to the writing off or writing down of arrears, once this provision goes through. It is a matter about which I have spoken to the departmental officials and obviously, the State must be conscious that a significant change is being enacted into law as a result of this amendment and that it requires monitoring. The reasoning as to why arrears are being written down from henceforth by local government officials must be examined. Again, there is an inevitability about this. The key point for Deputy Dowds and me was that many parts of the country are going through desperate economic times and in some cases, the arrears on a particular premises were holding up its sale or leasing and this needed to change. The reason for this is that local government officials were going by the book, which did not make sense. I am glad the Department and the Minister have examined this issue and the change has taken place. The Minister mentioned devolution when responding to a number of Members and I note that one criticism, which I had come across in the past year, has been addressed holistically in this legislation, which is that local authority officials really believe the Valuation Office does not listen to them. The officials do not believe that the office takes into account the local knowledge they possess and when contact or communication is made, by and large the Valuation Office invariably tells them that it is none of their business. There is a weakness in the system but as far as this legislation is concerned, it deals with it. For the first time, it actually hands back discretion, to a great extent, to the local authority officials and councillors, which is a good thing. It is a start and is a significant step towards shifting the balance from Dublin to the local authorities, wherever they may be.

Representatives of new businesses came to my office to raise concerns about how they had moved into premises and were being held liable for the rates that had built up on them. This was becoming a barrier to new businesses regenerating themselves in towns and villages. Subsequently, as the Minister is aware, I published the Poor Relief (Ireland) (Amendment) Bill 2013 to try to address this problem. The Minister mentioned the Act that has been in place heretofore goes back as far as 1838, which has no meaning in the modern economy. I welcome the efforts made by the Minister to address this problem. Many local authorities subsequently voted to support my Bill and I understand they also have written to the Minister's office. I certainly am satisfied there now has been movement in legislation to address this anomaly or barrier, as I would describe it, to allow new businesses to open on the high streets and main streets of villages, towns and cities and that those who are trying to start afresh will not be held liable for rates that have not been discharged by the previous occupiers. It is welcome that the Minister again has listened and this will help many new businesses as they try their best to start up in the current climate.

This is even more the case for the permanent government, because anyone who is Minister must listen to his or her electorate and so on. As a result, Ministers receive representations whereas the permanent government can be quite removed from what life is like on the ground. There is a message for Members here.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	441	In response to Deputy Dowds, I note that Ministers make decisions based on advice from all sources, political and otherwise. I will take responsibility for my actions in respect of the contents of this Bill. Certainly, I seek to ensure that discretion is given to local authorities as far as possible and that barriers to economic activity are removed, wherever they may be. This was highlighted by Deputy Coffey's Bill but other people also have been in touch in respect of these matters. However, I agree with Deputy Deasy that there is a need for monitoring to ensure the local government auditor ensures this provision is not being abused.An unintended consequence of that might be a reduction in local government income arising from the fact that certain managers might feel much more discretion than was the intent and purpose of this provision. This is a provision for the purpose of enhancing the opportunity for economic and employment activity. It is in the spirit of what I am trying to do in a number of the amendments we have seen in the last hour.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	442	This is a technical amendment that addresses an omission in the list of consequential provisions in Schedule 4 to the Bill that shall not apply in the case of the dissolution of county and city development boards. Schedule 4 is primarily designed to provide for transitional arrangements as between local authorities that are being dissolved, such as town councils, and their successors regarding matters such as transfer of assets, liabilities, staff, etc., and the continued effect of certain matters decided by the dissolved bodies. This amendment is for the insertion of paragraph 14(4) dealing with local authority housing to the list of excluded provisions that are already set out in section 34(4)(a), as this relates to an area in respect of which the development boards had no remit.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	444	The amendments to be taken in this grouping relate to the establishment and functions of the local community development committees. Amendment No. 19 addresses an omission in the published Bill. It proposes that section 45 of the Local Government Act 2001, relating to the attendance of the media and public at local authority meetings, shall not apply in the case of local community development committees. Although the LCDCs will be local authority committees, their roles and functions will differ considerably from those of other local authority committees. A significant element of the LCDC work will be the consideration of funding applications. This work will involve confidential and commercially sensitive information which it would not be appropriate to discuss in the presence of the media and the public. Amendment No. 22 proposes to include youth organisations within the meaning of "representatives of local community interests" set out in the Bill. Specific provision for youth organisations reflects the Government and EU priority of focusing on supports for young people, particularly in the area of training, upskilling and employment supports. Through Amendment No. 31 I seek to clarify at section 128B(1)(g) that the aim of the Bill is to optimise the use of public funding as it relates to publicly funded local and community development supports. As currently drafted, 128B(1)(g) might be interpreted as charging the committees with improving the efficiency with which all public authorities use the full range of the resources, not just local and community development supports. This would go beyond the proposed remit of the committees and, accordingly, the provision has been amended. Amendment No. 37 provides that when the chief officer is seeking nominees for the local community development committee, he or she shall do so in consultation with the corporate policy group. This will provide for an important input into the process for the elected members via the CPG. The focus would be on identifying the sectors to be represented on LCDCs rather than selecting individuals. In practice, nominating organisations will select their own nominees and submit them to the chief officer. He or she will have no role in selecting the individual nominees, nor will the members of the CPG, and this will be provided for in regulations. I seek to make two minor amendments in this grouping. Amendment No. 50 addresses an omission from the original Bill, which did not provide for guidelines of a general policy nature to be issued in respect of the local community and development committees. Amendment No. 52 corrects an incorrect cross reference at section 128G(1) in the published Bill.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	445	I received some communication from the local development consultative groups, or members of them, who had various protracted negotiations and discussions on the alignment process. They had hoped some of their recommendations would be considered in the amendments here today. There is some disappointment in that regard. Would the Minister comment on those issues and the submissions made by various civil society organisations that are not specifically provided for in the make-up of the local development companies into the future? The Minister has inserted youth groups to cater for them, but there was an understanding that there might be representation of some minority groups such as women's organisations, Traveller groups or migrants' groups. The other issue was that the groups would remain at arm's length or autonomous in their own right. I am conscious that the mechanism of auditing must come from Europe and I wonder how their wishes can be adhered to in this regard. It may be difficult, but could the Minister comment on that? Could he elaborate on their recommendations? The communications I received last week came from 14 or 15 groups. The process that was put in train was welcome at the time, and I would have hoped its recommendations might have been implemented. Are there any legacy issues from that process regarding industrial relations? Is there any carry-over there or any issues that are left behind and have not been resolved? What process is in place to address any existing differences in industrial relations?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	446	Some groups expressed concern that because they are not listed in the Schedule to this Bill they were being excluded. That is not the case. All we have on the Schedule is the people with whom we are contracted. That does not exclude anybody in the future in terms of the relationships that will be developed between the community and voluntary sector and local government. We have the Father Seán Healy recommendations on that and the alignment process is ongoing in how we align the EU programmes and the local development company work with local government. I expect all this will conclude very shortly regarding the EU programmes, but we must comply with the bottom-up approach regarding EU programmes, and that is why a majority on the LCDCs must be from the community side. Just because a group is not in this particular Schedule does not mean we are excluding it. We will have the opportunity to bring people together, but they will have to make choices between themselves. We cannot put every representative group on all these committees or we will have a very unwieldy structure, but we will do our best to put down guidelines for local authorities to comply with. The legacy issues will have to be dealt with by the private companies. All of these local development companies have private company status now and all I can do is say what their overall financial provision should be. We had a debate last week about micromanagement. In this instance I have to leave it to the private companies to decide their priorities and how they will allocate the moneys and for what programmes. The completion of this programme means that a new programme will come into effect in 2015 and we will have to wait and see what the outcome will be in terms of the administrative and financial support they will have left during this year to see whether they will cease operations under this contract before we transfer the contract to the LCDCs. We will work through those issues with the people involved.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	449	I take the Minister's point about the groups not being named, but the correspondence we received was from approximately 12 groups including the Community Workers' Co-operative, the National Women's Council of Ireland, the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, Pavee Point and One Parent Exchange Network. I presume they will be included. The points they made were about more than just not being included in the Schedule. They said the Bill would legislate for significant levels of control over community development.They are concerned in regard to their involvement or participation. They feel distanced from the democratic process as it stands and this will make things worse. They also believe there is a significant enhancement of ministerial powers, but I would like to hear the Minister deny this is the case. The report of the working group on active citizenship is imminent, but the community sector is concerned that the working group did not consult with it. The group may have consulted in some areas, but not with them. These community groups are the most vulnerable and I would like confirmation from the Minister that the community sector has been properly considered in regard to this initiative and how the relationship between local government and the sector can be improved.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	450	I am trying to bring the community and voluntary sector into line with the democratic structures at local government level. For the first time, the community and voluntary sector will now have a statutory remit and relationship with local government, which it does not have currently. Companies operate on a stand-alone private company basis or they expect to get money from various Departments, irrespective of what their work is. They will certainly go through difficult circumstances if they do not know what funds they will have from year to year. They cannot plan too far ahead. The organisations that are listed in the Schedule are those which are existing contract holders with the Department. This does not mean that the people who have written to Deputy Murphy, to me and to Deputy Cowen will be excluded in any way. That is the reason I asked Fr. Seán Healy to bring a representative group together and to come up with recommendations that will feed into the process of creating the necessary structures of engagement that will report to a democratic process, not to central Government. It will report at local level as far as possible - as close as possible to the citizen. This legislation is not about vested interests, no matter whether they are community, industrial or farming interests. This is about the overarching legislation that is required that will help decisions to be made at local level as much as possible. It relates to the general community and economic development of the areas. There will be more opportunities available to these groups and these will be provided in a structured and democratic way.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	454	Amendment No. 61 is the most crucial amendment in the grouping. Under the new section 66A to section 66H provisions, local authorities and the local community development committees are to be tasked with preparing integrated local economic and community plans for their areas. These plans will have economic and community elements, which will be prepared separately but in parallel. The local economic and community plan provisions will ensure that balanced local economic and community development will be undertaken in accordance with the principles of sustainable development and that this development will be led and co-ordinated by the local government system. This function will be central to the new functions of local authorities. It will add to the current function in promoting the interests of local authorities, and in that context I propose amendment No. 60. Amendment No. 20 provides for definitions of both community and economic elements of the integrated plan to be added to section 128A and, through amendments Nos. 21, 23 and 24, Nos. 26 to 30, inclusive, and Nos. 53 to 56, inclusive, for specific references to the plan in section 128B to be replaced by reference to the community elements of the plan or those elements of the plan, as the case may be. Amendment No. 25 will enable the plan and provide for harmonisation of the planning period of the community elements of the local economic and community plan with other local authority planning processes, including the economic elements of the plan and the new regional spatial economic strategies. Amendment No. 32 will provide a role for the LCDC in the development of the economic elements of the local economic and community plan. Amendment No. 34 deletes from section 128C of the published Bill the references to the local and community plan, as the new provisions of sections 66A to 66H will now provide for the local economic and community plans. Amendment No. 40 follows from the proposals for the making of the local economic and community plan, including the making of regulations in regard to the new integrated plan. Accordingly, the provisions of section 128F(2)(c), covering the making of regulations for the stand-alone community plan, are now not required. This amendment also provides for the making of regulations in respect of administrative arrangements for the LCDC meetings, such as scheduling and notification of meetings. This had not been provided for in the original Bill. Amendment No. 42 makes a minor adjustment to the provision for making regulations relating to local and community development committees by removing the power to make regulations on reviewing the plan, as this will now be covered in the new section 66H. As a consequence of these deletions, technical amendments to renumber the provisions being inserted by section 35 of the Bill are covered by amendments Nos. 33, 35 and 36, Nos. 38 and 39, Nos. 42 to 49, inclusive, and Nos. 51 and 57.

#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	465	Will it be like the old development plan, within which there were development plans for towns of a certain size and beyond, or will it be the municipal district in its entirety? Leading on from this, may I ask a relevant question regarding the status of county development plans? In regard to the Westmeath and Offaly plans, Westmeath recently varied its development plan and Offaly has begun the process of initiating a new development plan. Both counties are specifically looking at the wind energy strategies of their development plans. They are seeking expertise within the local authority and assimilating that with councillors' knowledge and previous experience and have seen fit to propose a draft plan. This process would involve the engagement of the communities, the county and those within them. Particular attention is being given to the area of wind energy, particularly in view of the efforts being made by many companies to progress agreements with landowners in the expectation of making planning applications to An Bord Pleanála. Based on the fact the applications are for permission to export under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act, these permissions can be applied for directly from An Bord Pleanála.This being the case, many see fit to make overtures to owners of land outside that designated in existing or proposed development plans. One cannot stand in the way of how people go about their business, but the Minister must refute the suggestion by some that a moratorium can be placed on the planning of such developments. My understanding is this would be unconstitutional and I need someone in authority to confirm this. The Department is an authority obliged to be informed of the process and therefore is entitled to make submissions, as is any member of the public. Various bodies such as An Taisce are informed of the planning process of making a development plan. Submissions in Westmeath and Offaly have indicated the provisions in the draft plans in both cases are at great variance to the understanding and direction given in guidelines, whether statutory or otherwise. This is quite worrying and I understand the frustration of many councillors in both authorities who, despite their best intentions, the engagement they pursued with local communities and various groups, and trying to act in accordance with the wide-ranging opinions therein, state they feel they were then rubbished by the Department's submission. Will the Minister confirm the hierarchy of development plans and guidelines? Councillors need to be mindful of these when they meet again to discuss the issue. They need direction from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in the process. I am also conscious of the fact a national guideline consultation process is under way, as are separate processes for developments for home produce and developments for export. I am also conscious of reports today that the EU stated our targets on wind energy and other forms of energy are reduced compared to what they were previously. It gives the impression there is no uniformity, direction or path on which everybody understands the process will travel. There appear to be many tributaries coming into the path, but no organisation or methodology behind the various strands being brought together. We have national guidelines, which have not yet been put in place, to take account or cognisance of the advancement of size and technology in the area, development plans which are making every effort to get up to date, and those drawing up the plans and public representatives are making every effort to accommodate the opinions and views of those they represent and, having assimilated all of this, bring about a development plan which can be workable. However they are then told by the Department they have wasted their time. This creates great confusion and I would like the Minister's opinion on it.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	466	Amendment No. 61 is very comprehensive in that it covers everything from the economy to community development and upskilling. I realise this is local government legislation as opposed to planning legislation but they are intertwined. There is ongoing criticism that development plans are, in the main, physical and there is an expectation of delivery of items included in them which often does not happen with regard to facilities essential to the development of a community. I have been through numerous development plans and it takes quite a sizeable effort to construct them. We do not want legislation which states very good things but does not deliver in practice. I accept the Minister is doing workforce planning in the Department, but if these plans are to be constructed in a real and comprehensive way that add the layer we need so the local government system is a facilitator of the community and voluntary sector which is so successful in the country it will require people to put them together. In some local authorities this might be possible but others are very deficient in terms of numbers relative to the population they are trying to serve or may not have the disciplines within them. I am very interested to hear what the Minister has to say. What we do not want is a great debate on the issue and for the Minister to have worked on a lot of detail and then for it to fall by virtue of the fact there is no prospect of its implementation because of insufficient staff. There are wide variations in staffing. Meath County Council has half the staff of Kerry County Council but 30,000 or 40,000 more people live there. These variations make a difference to the delivery of services and to the depth and quality of what can be delivered at local government level. If we are to get beyond the point of only speaking about physical plans and building communities as opposed to buildings and structures this aspect will have to be facilitated by way of ensuring it is capable of being delivered in terms of having staff to do it.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	467	There will be no change in the status of the county development plan and local area plans will be done at district and municipal level. We have the national spatial strategy, regional planning guidelines, the county development plan process, local area plans and municipal level. The hierarchy is familiar to everybody. Local elected members will have a more devolved say at local area plan level, without reference at plenary level to other parts of the county or city. These amendments are with regard to community and economic plans and not on county development plans. They consider how we will set in train specific provision for the community as well as an economic plan. There will be economic plans in the future but they will not be merely spatial or physical development plans. It will be an integrated approach to take account of the economy, the environment and the community. It will be drawn up in parallel and integrated and subsequently approved by local elected members. With regard to the specific concerns expressed by Deputy Cowen on what is happening in the midlands and wind energy, we are conscious of the fact all local policy must be underpinned by national policy. This is why national and regional guidelines which have been laid down must be adhered to by local elected members and local authorities in the context of their development plans. With regard to wind energy, work is being done by the Department and Minister with responsibility for energy on a national policy on renewables and general energy. I understand local authorities will consider varying the plans on wind energy when they know exactly the national policy which will underpin it. It does not affect or provide any moratorium on existing development plans; it is in the context of plans being drafted or examined at present which have not been adopted yet.There will be no moratorium on existing planning applications going through Offaly County Council or Westmeath County Council, most of which I presume will subsequently end up before An Bord Pleanála or if there are major projects that are before the board in terms of the strategic infrastructure that they have indicated in their application. However, it would make sense in the context of the development plans that are being examined currently for the elected members to be mindful of the fact that work is being done on a national basis and they can vary their wind strategy accordingly when they see how it fits in with national policy that is likely to emerge in the autumn of this year.Seanad amendment No. 25:Section 35: In page 46, line 12, to delete “5 calendar years” and substitute “6 calendar years”.Seanad amendment No. 30:Section 35: In page 46, line 35, to delete “the Plan” and substitute “the community elements of the Plan”.Seanad amendment No. 35:Section 35: In page 49, line 17, to delete “128D.

Separately, through Seanad amendment No. 63, I will delete the requirement that the LCDC be represented on the corporate policy group. There was a concern on the part of elected members that an external member or an unelected member could be on this group and, therefore, I am responding to those concerns and deleting that requirement. In lieu, this amendment provides that the guidelines governing membership of the strategic policy committees will be amended to enable the Minister to require the LCDC to be represented on the economic development and enterprise strategic policy committee. In the normal course, the guidelines will provide that this representative will be chairperson of the LCDC but if the chairperson is an official of the local authority, the representative will be another nominee of the LCDC. Amendment No. 59 is a drafting amendment to correct the title of the strategy to Regional Spatial and Economic Strategy. The word "regional" was inadvertently omitted from the Bill as agreed by the House previously. Seanad amendment No. 59:Section 40: In page 59, line 5, after “regard to the” to insert “regional”.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	471	These amendments are reflective of the recent discussion we had about how people at community level would participate in the new local government mechanisms. This amendment replaces section 127 of the 2001 Act with a new section providing for extensive and diverse input by local communities in the decision-making processes at local government level. The new section provides that local authorities should take all appropriate steps to consult with and promote effective participation of local communities in local government. One of the principal provisions to do this will be the adoption by each local authority of a framework for public participation in local government, which will set out the mechanism by which citizens and communities will be encouraged and supported to participate in the decision-making processes of the authority. Seanad amendment No. 97 deletes an amendment that had been made to the text of section 127 of the principal Act. These changes are being incorporated into the new text of amendment No. 90. Seanad amendment No. 123 is an associated amendment providing for the new service function - in other words, the adoption of a framework of public participation in local government - to be listed in Part 3 of Schedule 3 as a reserve function of the elected council. I hope that gets over the concerns expressed by Deputies Cowen and Murphy earlier that people feel excluded because they are currently not included in the Schedule. This provision resolves that issue. The existing arrangements to promote citizen and community engagement with local government have generally not proved satisfactory or effective. I am satisfied the amendments will give scope to local authorities to develop arrangements to enable them to build more effective and inclusive relationships with all sections of society and ensure proper consultation and participation as part of the overall reform to be at the heart of our local government system. At the end of the day, the democratically elected members of the local authority will make the final decisions. These amendments refer to the level of participation and consultation required before such decisions are made.I am very anxious that people understand that the democratically elected local representatives are the people who will make the final decisions. I am also aware that mechanisms to facilitate greater public engagement, such as digital media, are under consideration in other countries, and we will be looking at these developments. The Fix Your Street initiative, which started out in south Dublin and which is being extended to many local authorities, is a very practical example of where the new digital media can be used and is an approach that is finding favour with many local authorities across a number of areas of activity.

The section makes clear that consultation is not mandatory because it states that the local authority may decide to consult or hold information meetings. Consultation means different things to different people. If what we are looking at here is the type of consultation initiated by EirGrid in respect of the pylons or Dublin City Council on the incinerator at Poolbeg, consultation is not about telling people what will happen. Consultation should be about allowing people who are to be affected by decisions having an actual genuine impact on those decisions. I see nothing in the section that would satisfy me that there is a requirement for local authorities to engage in real active consultation with local communities. It needs to be beefed up.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	473	I do not agree with the Deputy, because this is a big improvement on the current position. We are putting mechanisms in place to ensure people have information meetings and properly structured consultation on the issues of the day. Ultimately they will be able to meet their local elected representatives and make those concerns known to each individual local authority member in Leitrim or anywhere else. Following this, the councillors who are democratically elected - it is important to emphasise the phrase "democratically elected", meaning elected by all the people in each of the local authority areas - will be better informed and able to come to an informed decision. Obviously, all the views they would have heard from the public can be taken into account by the local elected member before coming to a final decision, and he or she can make that decision accordingly.

The word "may" refers to the structures. I want to provide for flexibility in respect of the structures being established by the local authority for consultation, but the overriding issue in the section is that there will be consultation.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	476	I welcome this if it turns out to be what I think it is. That is the reason I want to tease out the issues and perhaps ask the Minister if his Department would consider publishing a set of guidelines that might be recommended to local authorities as an example of how the consultation process can be improved and can be seen to be more fulfilling and involve more engagement than has been the case to date. For example, if there was an issue in a local community whereby a traffic management plan was about to be implemented, I know from my own experience, and I am sure that of many others who meet and consult with local community groups on such issues, that people may seek to hold a public meeting or an information evening. On many occasions, members of the local authority staff do not attend such meetings because they do not feel obliged or compelled to do so. That is the gap that exists in the process where the local councillor is trying to communicate with his community and afford it information pertaining to a project that is in the offing. I am simply asking whether it would be possible for the Department to produce guidelines that might indicate practical means and methods by which the public could adjudicate on the improvements that are being presented as improvements on the consultation process. I do not know if the staff are constrained by the Haddington Road agreement; perhaps the Minister could respond to me on that issue.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	477	When setting up a consultation process there is always a danger that one will have a rent-a-crowd in respect of whatever is the issue of the day. They could come from any part of the country into a local community on the basis of being whipped up to do so. I am trying to provide a structured opportunity, underpinned by statute, to ensure local authorities have discretion to have that information made available to the people, to have the consultation in a properly structured and respectful way and, at the end of the day, not to cut across the statutory responsibilities of the elected members but to ensure that all points of view are put across, not just those of people with vested interests. We are trying to put through legislation whereby the common good is respected and whereby, at the end of the day, councillors are properly informed by their constituents in a structured way, as they ultimately have to take responsibility for the decisions they make, not community groups. The guidelines, which will be robust, will be issued to local authorities in a practical way. With regard to staff, I acknowledge that a cultural change is required by local authority management in certain areas where they need to go beyond the call of duty in very difficult situations that will arise in any community from time to time. Councils must be able to put their best foot forward in providing the necessary expertise and personnel to give information. I am heartened by some recent cases in which road issues or other major projects that are submitted directly to An Bord Pleanála and that would not normally go through the local authority structure for discussion are the subject of information meetings attended by staff. Again, it depends on the cultural mindset of the manager of the day to determine what is the appropriate level of engagement with the citizen. What I am providing for is based on the fact that the more information and the more structured consultation we can put in place the better.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	479	Seanad amendment No. 63 provides for the removal of a provision that was originally included in the Bill for the leaders of political parties above a certain threshold of membership in the local authority to be subject to automatic membership of the corporate policy group. This is in response to debates in this and the other House prior to Christmas in which concerns were expressed that there was a risk, with the text as published, that the corporate policy group could lose its purpose of being the corporate management mechanism in the local authority. Rather than run this risk, I undertook to remove any provision for representation of political parties on the corporate policy group. Concerns were also expressed at the inclusion of non-elected people on the corporate policy group in the person of the chairperson of the LCDC, which I have already addressed in a previous amendment. I recognise these concerns and I am now deleting the provision. My motivation behind it was that I often found, as a member of a local authority, that the leaders of political groups who were not on the corporate policy group were left out of the information loop in respect of the plans and programmes being pursued at local authority level. I understand concerns were raised about the definition of a "group" and how we could include all members of the council in some way to ensure they were properly informed. What we will do instead is to make provision in the guidelines to ensure the corporate policy group, through the cathaoirleach or mayor, is in a position to make regular reports to the local authority instead. I am also proposing amendments Nos. 64 and 65, which are consequential technical amendments dealing with subparagraph referencing.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	480	This amendment provides for the procedures to be followed by the local authority upon receipt of a recommendation from the public appointments commission for appointment as a new chief executive. An important element of the rebalancing of the relationship between the elected member and the chief executive is the making of the appointment of the chief executive by the elected members a reserved function. This amendment does not alter this fundamental change in the relationship as originally provided in the Bill but it provides for clarity on how the elected members must go about their business of considering and deciding on the recommendation from the public appointments commission. The elected members will have three months to make the decision and a weakness originally in the Bill which would have meant rejection of the recommended person by the mere passage of time if the elected members did not consider the recommendation is removed. Provision is also made for the Minister to make regulations relating to the processes the local authority will need to adhere to in considering the recommendation of the public appointments service relating to requesting information from the person recommended for the post of chief executive, the keeping of records, confidentiality and the criteria to be applied to their consideration of the recommendation.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	481	Seanad amendment No. 68 is designed to augment the provisions in the original Bill to augment the role of the associations of local authorities such as the Association of City and County Councils, ACCC, and the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, AMAI, and, hopefully, an amalgamated association after the local elections will give them a greater role in providing a perspective of the elected members in setting policy at national level. I look forward to working with a single amalgamated association of local authorities dealing with policy matters being developed in discussion between the ACCC and the AMAI, and I understand that good progress has been made. In that respect, I send my best wishes to the outgoing president of the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland, Councillor Callaghan, from County Kildare, who was very serious. I hope that he will find himself in a position to resume duties at the earliest possible opportunity. I welcome the constructive discussions that have been taking place between the representative organisations and I wish to see a successful outcome and a new association at the time of the formation of the new structures.

In the Dáil Committee Stage debates, concerns were expressed that there may be potential risks associated with powers to suspend a member notwithstanding the fact that the suspension could only come at the end of an exhaustive process to get the recalcitrant member to behalf. I share the general view that this power should not be capable of being abused for purely political ends. Accordingly, amendment No. 69 will require a two-thirds majority of those present and voting for passage of the resolution leading to the suspension.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	484	Amendment No. 70 was made to subsection (e) of section 58 during Committee Stage in the Seanad to clarify further the role of the members of a municipal district in considering the draft budgetary plan. This provides that the members of the municipal district shall by resolution adopt the draft budgetary plan, either with or without amendment. However, I recognise that the local authority budget process must be drawn to a conclusion and a budget meeting held within the period set for the holding of such a meeting. It is important that a failure by the municipal district to adopt a draft budgetary plan can be managed within the timeline for the overall local authority budget process. For that reason, I introduced amendment No. 71 to subsection (e) of section 58 during Committee Stage in the Seanad to provide that the chief executive shall take account of any adopted budgetary plans in preparing the draft local authority budget. The Bill contains a comprehensive framework for the preparation of the draft local authority budget with further details on timelines and formats to be set out in regulations. In the first instance, the draft local authority budget must be prepared setting out the amounts necessary for the functional programmes of the authority and including an amount to be provided as a general municipal allocation. The consultative process, commencing with the input of the corporate policy group, as set out in the Local Government Act 2001, remains central to the development of the local authority budget. The chief executive must then prepare a draft budget plan for each municipal district. Each draft budgetary plan will set out the general municipal allocation being made available to that district. To ensure that these allocations are made with due regard to the principles of fairness and equity, I introduced an amendment during Committee Stage in the Dáil to provide that in making resources available to the municipal districts for their members' consideration in a draft budgetary plan, the chief executive must have due regard to the resource needs of that municipal district within the broader needs of the local authority and the resources available to it. The process through which the budget is developed is a consultative and collaborative one and will ensure that the service that is provided by the local authority continues to serve the needs of the whole local authority area.

These and other provisions related to the NOAC are being inserted in the 2001 Act by section 58 of the Bill. Amendment No. 118 rectifies an omission from the listing of reserved functions to be performed by local authorities by including the reserved power to fix the day or days for the first meetings of the municipal district members within the functional area of the local authority. This new, as Members can see, massive, reserved power is provided for in section 52 of the Bill, which amends Schedule 11 of the Local Government Act 2011 dealing with meetings and procedures of local authorities. The new provisions provide that councils at plenary level shall determine the date of the first meeting of the municipal district members and it is important that this reserved power is listed in Part 3 of Schedule 3 for completeness.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	492	Amendments Nos. 75 to 85, inclusive, and 103 all relate to section 60 and Schedule 2, and are largely technical in nature correcting textual errors with some substantive drafting amendments, namely amendments Nos. 78 and 83. Amendment No. 78 inserts a new subparagraph to section 23(2)(b) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 as substituted by the Local Government Reform Bill 2013 to provide that the matters to be addressed for the economic component of the regional spatial and economic strategy will include enabling the conditions for creating and sustaining jobs.The objective of the regional economic strategy is to support the economic policies and objectives of the Government by providing a long-term economic framework for the development of the region, which is ultimately about enabling the condition for creating and sustaining of jobs at local level, providing for an regional economic strategy to enable the conditions for creating and sustaining jobs is consistent with a stronger role for local government in promoting economic development. As outlined earlier, there will be increased local government involvement in economic development because of the economic impact of its functions generally, its links with enterprise, its local knowledge and leadership, its economic initiatives by many local authorities and its new local development and enterprise functions. It is therefore important that the regional spatial and economic strategy enables the conditions for creating and sustaining jobs at local level.  Amendment No. 83 inserts "rural areas" in subparagraph (4)(2) of section 23(2)(b) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to provide that the qualities of rural areas are also considered in identifying the regional attributes that are essential to enhancing regional economic performance, particularly as the regional economic strategy is also about augmenting the economic performance of the region across the economic sectors of agriculture, forestry and other natural resource sectors. Amendments Nos. 74 and 104 are technical ones to insert an indefinite article where it has been omitted. Amendment No. 75 is a typographical amendment which inserts "of" after "purpose" to read correctly as "purpose of". Amendment No. 76 deletes the word "such" in order to provide for a reference to regulations, as the use of "such" implies the regulations have already been referred to in the section when there is no previous reference to regulations. Furthermore, any such regulations would form the same set of regulations that may be prepared under section 21 of the planning Acts. Amendment No. 77 is another typographical amendment which inserts "of" in place of "for" to refer correctly to "Minister of the Government". Amendments Nos. 79, 80, 81 and 82 together with amendments Nos. 84 and 85 provide for the renumbering of the subparagraphs and a consequential reference in light of the insertion of the new subparagraph (i) enabling the conditions for creating and sustaining jobs. Amendment No. 102 is a typographical amendment to delete a superfluous word "in". Amendment No. 103 addresses an omission by inserting "regional" before "spatial and economic strategy" to read correctly as "regional spatial and economic strategy" in Schedule 2 to the Bill. Seanad amendment No. 80: Section 60:

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	493	Seanad amendments Nos. 86 to 92, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	494	Given the existing Government commitment to the cessation of the non-principal private residence charge in 2014 and the cessation of the household charge in 2013, there is a requirement to repeal and amend the relevant legislation as appropriate. Amendment No. 86 is a standard provision which defines a small number of terms used in a new Part 12 of the Bill which is in itself provided for in amendments Nos. 87 to 92 inclusive. Amendment No. 87 inserts a new section 70 which provides for the repeal of the Local Government Charges Act 2009 as well as for related compliance measures. The repeals are staggered over time principally to support efforts by the local government system to secure compliance. While I consider the compliance with the charge as being high I am keen to ensure that compliance is maximised, so the repeal of the 2009 Act is staggered over 12 years. The general approach taken in this section is to provide for repeals in a given date which can then be confirmed or altered by ministerial order. Given the time periods involved of up to 12 years, I believe that the flexibility granted by the making of ministerial orders is necessary. Moving to the non-principal private residence charge, I am certain that compliance with the charge has been high. To date, almost 359,000 properties have been registered for the charge and more than €394 million has been raised over the last number of years, all of which has been used to fund local authorities in delivering vital services, and this has been a huge achievement. However, I want to maximise compliance and collect outstanding non-principal private residence charge arrears and to help ensure compliance amendment No. 88 provides for a six-month period from March to August 2014 during which new late payment penalties will not be applied to existing liabilities, and this will provide an opportunity for owners to agree terms with the local authorities. As a complementary measure, section 73 will give local authorities explicit latitude to reduce outstanding charge liabilities by writing off parts of such liabilities. At the conclusion of the six-month period, a different situation will prevail. On 1 September 2014 if the non-principal private residence charge remains undischarged or repayment terms have not been agreed, the monthly penalties which would have applied will be reinstated and the entire sum will be multiplied by 1.5 and the entire liability will be frozen for every property. As a complementary measure, amendment No. 90, which inserts a new section 73, gives local authorities powers to reduce outstanding non-principal private residence charge liabilities by writing off part of the liability. The purpose of this section is to provide local authorities with a degree of flexibility when collecting the non-principal private residence charge arrears and under this section local authorities will act as they see fit to collect arrears efficiently. I want local authorities to take a reasonable and equitable approach and I especially want local authorities to deal fairly with those who are unable to pay their arrears. The section explicitly provides for local authority write-downs of late payment fee liabilities when it would be economically most efficient to do so. There is little point in local authorities seeking redress from households which cannot afford to pay their arrears. I will be issuing statutory guidance this year in regard to the application of this section. Amendment No. 89, which inserts a new section 73, largely replicates the provisions of sections 6(3) to 6(7) of the Local Government Charges 2009 Act, as amended by the Act of 2011. As section 6 of the 2009 is being repealed, effective from 2 March 2014, those provisions of the section which relate to probate or grants of representation must be restated so that they apply from 2 March 2014 onwards. Amendment No. 91, which inserts a new section 74, provides that the Minister may issue guidance to local authorities concerning any matter to which sections 71 to 73 relate and each local authority shall have regard to any such guidance. It will be necessary to guide local authorities in the application of section 73 and I intend to issue such guidance early this year.  Amendment No. 92, which inserts a new section 75, provides that all activity undertaken by the Local Government Management Agency to collect the non-principal property charge or the household charge or any late payment fees and late payment interest under either of those Acts shall not be impugned on the basis that the agency may have lacked the function to perform that activity. In effect, the amendment retrospectively validates collection-related activity undertaken by the Local Government Management Agency on behalf of the local authority. The section is intended to address a minor technical matter and has been prepared on the basis of legal advice from the Attorney General and as such it is not possible for me to comment any further.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	495	I note what the Minister said and I welcome the arrangements he has made in regard to the methods by which local authorities collect these funds and the discrepancy that they have in relation to adjudication of the arrears and so forth. For how many years is it expected that the non-principal private residence charge will continue to be enforced? I am conscious of that considering the implementation of local property taxes, the fact that water charges will be in play and that some people are being hit continuously. When this was brought in the concept of a property tax was not one which was being discussed widely by the Fine Gael Party at that time. The Minister might inform me specifically at this juncture as to how long more it is envisaged it will be in place and that it will be charged.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	496	The level of compliance with this charge is quite high and people have been responsible in meeting the legal obligations in regard to the second home charge, but we are going to continue the compliance with this legislation for 12 years. However, we are providing an incentive for people for six months in this year whereby they can make arrangements. We have asked local authorities to be as flexible as they can in arrangements.If people make arrangements, the penalties will stop, the interest will stop and the local authorities will be able to retain the money collected in arrears. I expect local authorities will be incentivised by that. There will be fairly stringent penalties from September onwards, but they will apply for the following 11 years before they cease to exist, and they will be attached to the property in the event of a sale of the property.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	497	So the Minister is now confirming that the charge against non-principal private residences and any multiple that may exist for any property owner is in place and there is legislation to allow it to remain in place for the coming 12 years.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	498	Yes. There will be no new charges on an annual basis. This is based on the fact that at the end of the end of 2013 the charge will cease to exist, but the arrears that have accumulated for people who did not comply with the Act introduced in 2009 will still be enforceable. I have set out the arrangements to be complied with.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	499	We may be contradicting ourselves. So there is no recurring annual charge after 2013?

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	503	Amendments Nos. 93, 96, 98, 100, 101, 105, 106 and 108 to 110, inclusive, and 112 to 115, inclusive are related and may be discussed together.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	504	Amendments Nos. 93 and 100 are related and provide for the deletion of section 230 of the Local Government Act 2001 and a consequential provision arising under the deletion. Under section 230 of the principal Act, the Minister is empowered to dissolve joint burial boards and cemetery joint committees and to transfer those responsibilities, including all land, other property, rights, moneys and liabilities to the county council in whose county the burial grounds are situated. Deputy Barry Cowen is familiar with one of the examples that might fall through the cracks but we will come back to it to see if we can solve it. In accordance with those powers, I recently signed a transfer order in respect of five joint burial boards and a joint cemetery committee, responsibility for which will transfer to the appropriate local authority on 1 June 2014. Following the transfer, the provisions of the 2001 Act will no longer be required, and the amendments provide for their deletion. Their repeal will be commenced following the coming into effect of the transfer. I am advised that notwithstanding this provision, there will be a capacity for each local authority to continue a joint committee between, for example - in the case I am thinking of - Offaly and Tipperary. Deputy Noel Coonan has been in touch with me about this point. The Dunkerrin burial board is one of the best examples in the country of co-operation between local authorities in an important facility. We will be able to deal with the issue without having it written in statute. Amendment No. 93 also deletes the reference to the joint library committee within the overall definition of a joint body. This will no longer be required following the enactment of the provision dealing with the dissolution of Tipperary joint library committee, which was provided for during the Dáil debate on Committee Stage. The purpose of amendments Nos. 96 and 98 is to provide that the period in which a budget meeting period may be adjourned is reduced by seven days, from 21 to 14. Amendment No. 101 is consistent with the amendments to the principal Act and provides that the period in which a budget meeting period may be adjourned is reduced by seven days, from 21 to 14 days, in cases in which an insufficient budget has been adopted. These amendments are intended to ensure sufficient time is available for local authorities to consider and adopt their budgets prior to 31 December. Under the EU regulations known as the two-pack, formally adopted on 30 May 2013, a common budgetary timeline was introduced for all euro area member states. Specifically, the draft budget for central government and the main parameters of the draft budgets for all subsectors of the general government must be published by 15 October each year. Draft budgetary plans in a common format must be submitted by all euro area member states that are not in a programme of assistance by this date. The budget for the central government must be adopted or fixed upon and published by 31 December each year, together with the updated main budget parameters for subsectors of the general government, including the local government subsector. Following these regulations, the local authority budget is required to be adopted by 31 December each year. Amendment No. 106 is a typographical amendment inserting a definite article where it was omitted. Amendments Nos. 105, 108, 109, 110, 112, 113 and 114 consist of a number of amendments to legislation outside the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government arising from the structural changes provided for in the Bill. The amendments are contained in Part 6 of Schedule 2, which deals with minor consequential amendments to Acts other than those already dealt with in Schedule 1 and in Parts 1 to 5 of Schedule 2 as a result of the reform programme. Amendment No. 115, relating to the Valuation Act 2001, is being taken at the request of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. Currently, the Valuation Act 2001 requires that properties that are a building or part of a building, land, waterway or harbour directly occupied by the State, including those occupied by Departments, the Defence Forces or the Garda Síochána, or are used as a prison or place of detention, although not rateable, must be valued by the Valuation Office, and the value is placed on the valuation lists of local authorities. The amendment means the Valuation Office will no longer be required to value these properties, allowing the resources within the office to be deployed to other aspects of work, including the current programme of revaluation.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	505	On a related topic, the Minister referred to various properties and the valuations attached to them. I refer to the abolition of town councils and the amalgamation of city and county councils. With regard to ownership of properties in the names of town councils that move into the ownership of the overarching local authority, are costs associated with this from a probate perspective? Have the costs been evaluated and collated nationally and has a figure been put on this? Is it the responsibility of each local authority and its legal representatives to carry out those functions? Is there a case for national procurement? Is the local authorities' legal expertise being used in this audit, whether in-house or as an outside function? What costs will be incurred? Based on these costs, is it the duty of the Department to procure this on a national basis? Has that process begun?
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	506	In my area, Cahir, offices are being closed. What will happen? How will the transfer take place? Will the properties be sold off? Will community groups get a chance to avail of them? What is the cost in the case of Tipperary's uniting and changing its logo? What is the cost of changing every logo on every item and letterhead? Will consultants be hired to administer this and will it end up as a savage cost to the taxpayer?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	507	It is a seamless transition directly to the overarching authority and, in the case of Tipperary, it will be to Tipperary County Council.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	508	The Minister did not answer the question of the costs. I am relieved to know there will be no legal costs but what about the cost of changing a logo? Some years ago it cost a fortune to change from Cashel urban district council to Cashel town council, and that was only a small area. The entire county will have to be changed.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	509	To which costs is the Deputy referring?
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	510	There were two costs, with one being legal costs. The Minister assured us there will be none of those and there will be a seamless transfer. What about changing the logos on everything from machinery to buildings to vans to letterheads?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	511	When there is change there will clearly be some costs associated with rebranding what is being done.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	513	No, as it is a matter for the local authorities. I hope they will do it as cheaply as possible.

It cost a fortune to change the name of town councils some years ago so we can multiply that cost by the number of town councils and the two county councils. One does not need to be an expert to know it will be an enormous cost.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	515	The purpose of the legislation is to ensure there are no additional costs and we are already making significant savings with procurement, and I hope Tipperary county council will do the same. We will be doing everything possible to guide the councils along the way in terms of tendering and procurement in order to reduce costs.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	516	It does not stand up.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	517	This is a technical amendment relating to the definition of a local economic and community plan. There are a number of other amendments consequential to this amendment, including amendment Nos. 99, 116, 117, 119 and 122. Following consultation with the public regional assemblies, municipal districts and the local community development committees in respect of the economic elements, it will be a reserve function of the local authority to integrate both the economic and community elements into a single integrated local and economic community plan. Implementation strategies and arrangements must be put in place and led by the local authority and the LCDC respectively for the economic and community elements of the local economic and community plan. Listing these reserve functions is necessary in the appropriate schedule, for which these amendments are proposed. The local economic and community plan will be reviewed and updated annually and the local authority must report on the success or otherwise of the implementation of the local economic and community plan each year in the annual report. It will be a matter for members to approve the text of the annual report as a reserve function, giving them a further opportunity to ensure that the implementation of these and any other plans is properly driven and led by them. In that context I propose Seanad amendment No. 99.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	518	On Committee Stage we spoke briefly about this in the sense that rather than the existing annual report one would have, there could be measurements of success and failures further to the plan being put in place at the beginning of the year in the first instance. Will the Minister confirm that this will amount to much more than what is currently the case? How will performance be measured and will the Department have a mechanism to review and inspect the performance of a local authority over five years, for example? If there are trends emanating, what reportage will feed back from the Department to the Oireachtas or local authorities?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	519	I can assure the Deputy that the national oversight and audit commission, on which public representatives will also sit and which will operate at a regional assembly level, with public representatives present, will be able to consider best practice with all service delivery in each local authority in the region. The commission will report to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and Gaeltacht on what I hope will be a regular basis, and it will be able to drive the efficiencies necessary across best practice in each service delivery area. In addition, local authority members will have an annual service plan relating to the delivery, or otherwise, in each service area. I hope and expect that local elected members, which will be given the necessary capacity building require to achieve this, will have a developed level of expertise to be able to scrutinise the annual service plans in each service area better than it is done now. On a national basis, the national oversight and audit commission with local government auditors will provide the best vehicle for the efficiencies advocated by the Deputy for service delivery. It is a learning process for every local elected member and local authority and what works well in an area in the delivery of service should be aspired to by every authority. The idea will be driven by the national oversight commission. I beg the Acting Chairman's indulgence as I must request another clerk's correction to the text of the Bill. In order to correct a drafting error on page 163, line 37, the reference to paragraph (b)(i) should be changed to paragraph (b)(iv). We have done a few of those today.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	520	I thank the Deputies for their contributions to the debate. At the beginning of Second Stage, I indicated that I was prepared to listen carefully to the discussions in this House and that where Members had practical experience of what we were trying to do I would take many of their views into account. We have taken many of the issues into account. I thank Deputies Cowen, Stanley and Murphy, who have taken a particular interest in these matters during the debates and responded very constructively in respect of what we are trying to achieve. I thank them for their co-operation. I thank my officials, led by Mr. Denis Conlan and Mr. Michael Murphy, and all the officials in the local government division for ensuring that much of the painstaking work that has taken place for a number of years would culminate in this Bill. We do not always agree on the detail in this House but I hope the spirit of constructiveness has resulted in a much better Bill than the one that was initiated.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	521	I join the Minister in paying tribute to and thanking the staff of the Department for their work in putting this Bill before the House and their work thereon as it passed through the Houses. I thank them for acquiescing to the wishes of Members and the Minister. I thank the Minister for the manner in which he conducted affairs during the passage of the Bill through the Houses. Many amendments have been made, not only in response to our requests but also to those of the various representative bodies outside the House. I compliment the Minister on his forbearance in regard to these issues. As I said on Second Stage, we do not necessarily agree with the thrust of the Bill. While it is well intended, we would have proceeded very differently. We are fearful of the impact of the legislation on local democracy. That is a matter for another day, and it was for another day. We have put on record our opposition to the legislation in that context. That said, we recognise the mandate of the Government and its ability to pass legislation. With that in mind, we have sought to be as constructive, fair and reasonable as possible in seeking to put forward the views of those we represent. We sought to make the legislation as friendly as possible to the representatives who will be expected to implement it and work within its confines. I wish the legislation well and hope, contrary to many opinions, that it is constructive, not only for those who will work with it but also for the staff in local authorities, who face a big challenge with the amalgamations. Ultimately, I hope the legislation will be of benefit to the people we represent - namely, the people who wish to avail of the services of local authorities. I look forward to a review of the legislation by a committee and Parliament over the coming years. I am particularly conscious of the oversight role of the Department in reviewing the performance of the legislation against its intention. I commend everybody associated with the Bill and hope it is successful. While I do not necessarily agree with its content, I will be the first to admit it if I am proven wrong and it is a success for the Government.

He asked me to represent him here. I know of his interest in this legislation. I, too, was impressed by the number of amendments to the initial legislation that were accepted and I have no doubt that they will improve the quality of the Bill. We continue to have very serious misgivings not only about the thrust of the Bill but also the thinking behind it. Effectively, it means we are moving local elected representatives further from the people they represent. The same is happening with the bigger national and European electoral areas. It is all a process of moving people further from those who represent them. We will be vigilant in analysing the progress of this Bill but we recognise the great deal of hard work that has gone into it.

I am not denying the hard work of the Department and Minister, as referred to by colleagues. However, I fundamentally disagree with the Bill because, as Deputy Colreavy stated, it is creating a bigger divide between the people and public representatives. In our case, south and north Tipperary are being bulldozed together. As I stated, the costs will be huge. The Minister cannot answer my question on this. We will see the result in time to come. The legislation is putting people last and getting rid of elected town councils. In Tipperary, they have served for centuries. Councillors have been voluntary in the main and would work voluntarily again if they were left to it. The legislation errs in that it is not putting people first; it is putting people last. I believe it will be challenged in another forum. Perhaps that is why the date for the local elections has not yet been fixed. While reference is made to 23 May, we will see whether that stands. I wonder why all the authorities were allowed to pass their estimates for a full year if they are to be terminated well before the first half of the year. I cannot wish the legislation well because I believe it is founded on a false premise and neglects the views of local authorities. I do not know why the local authorities' representative organisations did not stand against the Bill. Sin scéal eile. The legislation is putting people last and the Government will find that out when it goes back to meet the people in 2016 or another time.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	527	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." I am pleased to have the opportunity to present the ESB (Electronic Communications Networks) Bill 2013 for the consideration of Dáil Éireann. The Bill is a relatively short legislative proposal, the purpose of which is to provide an explicit legal basis to enable the ESB to engage, now or in the future, in the installation and operation of electronic communications networks and services, either alone or by agreement with one or more other companies, and to provide for consequential matters. This legislation affords an excellent opportunity to significantly enhance the quality and availability of modern, resilient and future-proofed broadband infrastructure through the use of the ESB's extensive electricity networks, potentially extending the reach of fibre to the home and further enhancing broadband connectivity in Ireland. It is a further important step in the country positioning itself as a front runner in tackling the broadband infrastructure deficit. The ESB has identified an opportunity to use its electricity distribution network to provide telecommunications services in the Irish market. I understand the company has sought a joint venture partner with a view to providing such services on a wholesale-only basis. I am advised that this, in turn, could facilitate the delivery of high speed broadband services by retail telecommunications operators in the areas served. This legislation is merely for the purposes of enabling the use of ESB's infrastructure and that it is not specific to any given project. I expect, however, that the ESB will bring forward detailed proposals in relation to the project it is considering. Such proposals and the necessary statutory approvals, where required, will be subject to separate detailed consideration by my Department once a detailed submission is received. My Government colleagues and I consider this to be a very welcome development and very much in the spirit of the national broadband plan. The plan which I published in August 2012 commits to the delivery of high speed broadband across the country. This commitment is to be achieved by ensuring the environment is right to maximise investment by the commercial sector and through a State-led investment in those areas where it is evident that the market will not deliver. The plan also specifically commits to the use of State assets to accelerate the roll-out of high speed broadband infrastructure and services and recognises the role commercial State companies can perform in accelerating the roll-out of such infrastructure. I remind Deputies that the national broadband plan followed on from the publication of the next generation broadband task force's report in 2011. The task force which I chaired comprised the CEOs of all the major telecommunications service providers in the Irish market, plus representatives of some of the smaller players. It considered in detail a number of policy challenges, including target speeds, spectrum, investment barriers, demand stimulation measures and the role of State assets in assisting broadband infrastructure deployment. The report of the task force and the subsequent public consultation undertaken by my Department laid the foundations for the national broadband plan.  I have advised the House on progress in implementing the plan on a number of occasions and would like to take the opportunity to provide a further update. Of particular note is the ongoing and very significant level of commercial investment taking place in the fixed and mobile telecommunications market. In some instances, commercial telecommunications providers are investing in services and coverage that significantly exceeds the targets to which they committed when the national broadband plan was being prepared. This is good news for consumers and businesses where high speed broadband services are being rolled out. It is also a vote of confidence in the broader economy. However, despite these welcome developments, it remains the case that many towns, villages and communities, particularly in rural Ireland, will see very little of this investment. Ireland's widely dispersed population and topography means that there are some areas where it is simply not viable for the commercial sector to provide services. Intensive technical, financial and preparatory work to define the scope of the State-led investment committed to under the national broadband plan is continuing. This investment will facilitate the widespread availability of reliable and guaranteed high speed broadband. In parallel, a comprehensive mapping exercise of current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector is advancing. This exercise will identify where the market is expected to deliver high speed broadband services in the coming years and, consequently, the precise areas that will need to be targeted by the State-led investment. In order to progress the State-led investment, a full procurement process must be designed and EU state aid approval obtained. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014. As I mentioned, the national broadband plan promotes the use of State assets to accelerate the roll-out of high speed broadband infrastructure and services. The plan recognises that a number of commercial and non-commercial State bodies are already leveraging their existing assets to actively provide infrastructure and services for the telecommunications market. These assets continue to play an important role in improving broadband services and the plan commits to exploiting further opportunities that arise, with a view to accelerating the roll-out of high speed broadband. The ESB is already providing telecommunications services utilising the electricity transmission infrastructure. The purpose of the legislation being discussed is to allow the ESB to leverage its extensive and robust distribution
infrastructure to provide high speed broadband infrastructure in Ireland. I understand from it that it is considering proposals to provide such services on a wholesale, open access basis with a joint venture partner. In August 2012 the company launched a call for expressions of interest in such a joint venture, attracting considerable interest from the telecommunications sector. I await with interest detailed formal proposals from it on the proposed joint venture. It should be noted that the legislation is not project-specific and will allow the ESB's considerable distribution infrastructure to become available to the telecommunications market, even if the current joint venture proposals do not come to fruition. The ESB's detailed proposals are awaited and my Department's assessment will, among other things, include an assessment of the proposal's compliance with detailed and binding EU and national regulatory requirements in the electronic communications market. I propose to outline the main provisions of the Bill. For the convenience of Deputies, a detailed explanatory memorandum has been published and it provides a synopsis of the provisions. The Bill is relatively short, consisting of eight sections. Section
1 is a standard provision providing for definitions of certain terms and words used in the Bill.  Section 2,
if enacted, will provide an explicit legal basis for the ESB to engage in the provision of electronic communications networks and electronic communications services where the company identifies a commercial basis for doing so, either alone or with any other company. The House will be aware that the ESB already operates a fibre network across its electricity transmission system. This network which was developed by the ESB originated to assist the management of its electricity network. Over time, additional capacity on the network has been sold to operators in the electronic communications market. The current proposal differs from the ESB's existing fibre network in that it would be a stand-alone business, with no direct connection to the management of the electricity network, and it might be developed by way of a joint venture. It is considered prudent, therefore, to provide an explicit legal basis to allow the ESB to engage in the electronic communications market in the manner proposed as provided for in section 2.
Section 3 will permit the ESB to agree to provide access to its electricity infrastructure to another company, including a joint venture company, to enable the company to develop electronic communications infrastructure along its electricity network where it is commercially viable to do so and to provide services of any nature to facilitate such development.  Section 4
redefines the meaning of "electric line" in the ESB Acts 1927 to 2004 and the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 to provide a single definition in the Statute Book. The section also extends the definition of "electric line" to include electronic communications infrastructure suspended from the electricity network. This provision also includes a retrospective element to maintain the status of the existing electronic communications network following this amendment.  The ESB's electricity network crosses private land in some places. In recognition of this, the existing Electricity (Supply) Acts 1927 to 2004 provide statutory wayleave rights for the ESB which allow it to cross private lands, subject to the payment of compensation, where appropriate. Section 5
will extend this right to any company authorised by the ESB to install electronic communications infrastructure along its electricity network, subject to the requirement to pay compensation, where appropriate. The section qualifies this right by requiring the consent of the Commission for Energy Regulation in order to exercise the wayleave rights. Section 5 will extend the wayleave rights currently available to the ESB to construct the electricity network on private lands to the construction of electronic communications lines attached to its electricity network. These way-leave rights include a right to secure fixtures to any wall, house or building. This right is not available to other providers of electronic communications infrastructure. It is not appropriate therefore to make that power available to the ESB or any subsidiary or joint venture in relation to its commercial activity in the electronic communications market. Accordingly, section 6 provides that the authority to secure fixtures to walls, houses or buildings will not apply in respect of the construction of an electronic communications network. Section 7 is a standard provision enabling the expenses of my Department to be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. Section 8, the concluding section, is also a standard provision providing for a Short Title, collective citation, construction and a commencement provision. As I have stated previously the current Government policy is to deliver high-speed broadband access across the country by creating an environment conducive to commercial investment and by using State assets and commercial State companies where appropriate. Significant progress is already under way in the provision of fixed broadband and mobile data services which is attributed to significant network investments particularly by eircom, UPC, Sky, Vodafone, 02, 3 and Meteor, among others. This investment is delivering both higher broadband speeds and increasing numbers of users opting into bundled communications services to secure better value. In that regard I am especially pleased that the investment programme of Eircom, as pledged - after a period of difficulty - is proceeding apace and it is a particularly welcome element of the improvement that is happening as we speak. As of September 2013, there were more than 1.67 million broadband subscribers in Ireland, an increase of 1% on 2012. In the fixed-line market, approximately 42% of all broadband subscriptions were equal to or greater than 10 MB per second up from 31% the previous year. In the same period 33% of all broadband subscriptions were equal to or greater than 30 MB per second, up from 20% in September 2012. In the mobile market the most significant headline in recent times was the €855 million commitment made by four mobile services providers to secure radio spectrum capable of delivering next generation 4G services capable of providing significantly increased data services. In the last year - to September 2013 -
data volumes across mobile devices increased by 40% as the number of SMS or text messages sent by mobile users fell by 25% in the same period during 2012 to 2013. The increase in data traffic is reflected in a 17% increase to 2.7 million in the number of smartphones and tablets in use in the year to September 2013. It is worth noting that the digital part of Ireland's economy is growing at a rate of approximately 16% per annum. The opportunities this presents must be harnessed in order to maximise the accruing economic and social benefits. Reliable connectivity to the Internet is critically important for business growth and development, and is an essential requirement for more flexible work patterns. From a societal perspective, it is an important facilitator of many activities including education, entertainment, business, e-health, e-government and is increasingly used as a simple and effective way of communication through social media. The exponential growth of digital technologies across the globe is further driving demand for high-speed broadband. Consequently, high speed, quality and reliable broadband as an enabling infrastructure for economic and social development is becoming a critical component of a 21st century society. The Bill is a positive step in facilitating the accelerated roll-out of high-speed broadband infrastructure in this country. It is my view that the ESB's proposal will have positive impacts on the Irish market. We have already seen the benefits competition can bring in delivering commercial investment in electronic communications infrastructure and providing customer access to higher broadband speeds. In the mobile market last year's successful auction of spectrum, following the switch-off of analog television, shows that the commercial operators clearly believe there is a vibrant market. The national broadband plan is a clear expression of the importance of broadband infrastructure to the achievement of Ireland's economic and social objectives. High speed, quality and reliable broadband as an enabling infrastructure for economic and social development is becoming a critical component of a 21st century society. The potential to use the ESB's considerable network to deploy fibre will contribute significantly to the commercial deployment of high-speed broadband and will be important in terms of meeting the objectives of the national broadband plan. I look forward to hearing the views of the House on the Bill, a constructive Committee Stage debate and your assistance, a Chathaoirligh, in facilitating its early passage into law.

The entry of the ESB into this area should increase competition in the broadband and electronic communications market. I hope that will result in reduced costs and an increase of broadband coverage throughout the country. That is what everyone should strive towards because we have seen the difficulties and we have debated them at length in the Chamber. When in government, Fianna Fáil invested heavily in the provision of broadband infrastructure as the technology developed. Indeed, we committed more than €450 million for the provision of broadband services during the period from 1999 to 2011. The investment was necessary to establish a foundation for the expansion of services in the years to come. The explosion of social media, online shopping and e-commerce in general has resulted in broadband becoming a vital service for homes, schools and businesses. Increasingly, broadband is almost as important as electricity, especially to online businesses but for other sectors as well. Technological advances in this area are taking place at a rapid pace and in order to be competitive in the world of business, Ireland needs to be at the forefront of broadband provision and speeds. The Government has failed to keep pace with technological advances and the expansion of the service has stalled. The Government’s plan for full broadband coverage in Ireland by the end of 2012 under its rural broadband scheme may technically have been met in 2013, but the quality of the service is often so bad that it simply cannot be used. The publication of the national broadband plan last year, which commits to the delivery of high speed broadband across the country, is welcome, but we need action as people are increasingly worried that a two-tier society could develop for broadband access. Despite the increased number of service providers in the broadband market and the improvement in quality in recent years in urban areas, many towns, villages and communities, particularly in rural Ireland, will receive little investment, if any, in the expansion of the broadband network from private firms. It has been accepted by these firms that Ireland's widely dispersed population and topography means they do not believe it would be commercially viable for them to provide services in some areas. That is something in which the State must intervene to ensure rural Ireland does not get left behind in the digital revolution. The failure to provide these services is contributing to a two-tier economy where regional and rural areas lose out on investment and business expansion to urban areas. That is not a positive development given the increasing pressures on rural Ireland where State services are being reduced and potential services are being driven away by the lack of resources such as high-quality broadband. In August 2013, the Irish Examiner ran a story in its features section entitled "Is Ireland Living with a Great Broadband Myth?" The piece carried a story about a small business in Westmeath only one hour and 15 minutes from Dublin city centre which employed 120 but it could not get reliable broadband. The company in question had resorted to both satellite and mobile broadband, which promised speeds of 10 MB download and 4 MB upload but independent tests showed that the actual speeds it was getting were closer to 0.5 MB, upload and download. At one point during the year, the company had to go without broadband for five days due to connectivity problems. During that time it had to despatch staff members to print documents in their own homes. At one point, the company owner had to get into the car and go to somebody’s house near Mullingar to print something off at 11 p.m.He estimates the company lost at least two customers a day for the five days the satellite was down. Eventually, it had to bring in external IT consultants to try to sort it out. This is simply not acceptable. This is a company trying to compete nationally for business, but it has been set at a massive disadvantage because it is located in an area that does not have reliable broadband. The owner, when asked why he had not moved to Dublin, replied:It is a fair point. But we have built up a business in a little village, which was a disadvantaged area with no employment. We have recruited lots of people from the farming community, people have moved to the area because of us, and we want to try to keep jobs in the community.The Minister will agree that this question should never have to arise. The people concerned are trying their best to create employment in rural areas and ensure their businesses are sustainable, yet the lack of reliable high quality broadband is dragging down their entrepreneurial skills and sapping their ability to expand. I hope the entry into the market of the ESB in this area will bring about progress for those communities which face the difficulties I have outlined. Given its widespread electricity network which reaches into every community, it will be possible to improve and expand broadband services in areas which cannot rely on the services currently provided. Another issue that needs to be addressed is broadband congestion which affects tourist areas, in particular. In County Kerry, for example, when the influx of tourists increases dramatically in the summer months, broadband provision advertised as providing 3 Mb/s speeds drops dramatically to 0.06 Mb/s. This has a significant impact on local businesses which rely on high speed broadband to deliver online services within demanding time limits. Upgrading the coverage in these areas would enable businesses to compete with places such as Dublin for a talented workforce, while keeping the quality of life that comes with living in less built-up regions. It is my intention to bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage in order that the services advertised by the broadband providers with regard to speed and quality would be reflected by the actual speed and quality of the broadband the consumer receives. I hope the Minister will be willing to take it on board. I am open to suggestions from his Department on how best to frame it, if he is willing to accept such an amendment. Another aspect of the legislation which must be seriously considered is the extension of the extensive rights being enjoyed by the ESB relating to its access to private property to allow the company to carry out its functions. The Bill extends section 53 of the Electricity (Supply) Act 1927 to third party companies with which the ESB may agree a contract to provide electronic communications services. Not all of section 53 applies to these companies, however. Is this a wise decision, given people’s inherent right to peaceful enjoyment of their property? The legislative provisions contained in sections 5 and 6 allowing the ESB and other companies access to private property must be carefully construed in order that works carried out by these companies do not dramatically impact on property owners’ rights in the long term. Any work carried out on private property must also be conducted with care and the least amount of disruption to the property. We have plenty of experience of contractors who find it very easy to rip up roads at a quick pace, yet find it very difficult to repave them to their original standard. This must be avoided in this area as we are dealing with people’s private property. Some form of complaints mechanism must be introduced to allow a dissatisfied private property owner to request that a company which accessed his or her land to carry out works be compelled to return and restore the property to the high standard it previously was in if the company has left it in an unsatisfactory state on finishing its work. I intend to submit an amendment in this regard which would allow a complaint to be made to the Commission for Energy Regulation where a property is left in an unsatisfactory state. I am interested to hear the Minister’s views on this matter and I am open to any advice his Department might have in this regard. Fianna Fáil welcomes the Bill and will be supporting its passage through the House. Broadband services are vital for domestic and commercial life in this country. This legislation should go some way towards increasing high quality broadband services and will, I hope, reduce the high costs associated with this service. I hope my suggested amendments will be considered by the Minister on Committee Stage.
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	529	Sinn Féin welcomes the ESB (Electronic Communications Networks) Bill which is important legislation dealing with the networking of fibre optic cables that will I hope develop an area of infrastructure in which the country has lagged behind. Sinn Féin has already suggested the ESB network be used as a vehicle to carry the fibre optic network. Broadband has become an almost essential utility for every household. Many daily functions are now almost impossible without a proper broadband connection. There are many areas, most of them rural, which still do not have an adequate broadband connection. The lack of broadband and poor service levels are increasingly becoming a constraint in accessing services. The range of services being delivered online is continually increasing. Common examples include online travel reservations and online banking, with the latter likely to accelerate with the closure of more bank branches in smaller towns. On the ground, service delivery in many rural areas is contracting, with many services further curtailed in the current economic environment, with the closure of banks, post offices and rural Garda stations. There is near universal acceptance that online access is the norm for some services and, accordingly, quality broadband is an imperative. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has outlined ambitious plans for e-government, including e-health. Access to high quality broadband will be an essential element in this regard. Proper broadband access is essential in developing a healthy and vibrant economy. The Government must be to the forefront in pushing this agenda if it is serious about the economy recovering to its full potential. International research shows that the Internet contributes up to 6% of the GDP, gross domestic product, in advanced economies. Most of the economic value created occurs outside of the information technology sector, with 75% of the benefits captured by companies in more traditional industries. The research has also found that the Internet created 2.6 jobs for every one lost arising from technology-related efficiencies. The fear everyone had a few years ago was that technology would replace people’s jobs. The contrary appears to be happening, as technology-related efficiencies are resulting in the creation of more jobs. Greater efficiency in a business means that it can employ more people. I am glad that the ESB will deliver a fibre-to-the-building network. This will allow for the highest speeds in a home, which shows that there is forward thinking in the development of the fibre network. Fibre is one of the optimum technologies, as it is regarded as the most future-proofed and is, therefore, likely to yield better value for State and private investment. At a wider economy level, the OECD has examined the benefits arising in other economic sectors such as transport, health, education and electricity from a national fibre-to-the-building network. The analysis examined the cost of deploying fibre to the building across different OECD countries, including Ireland. It estimated the combined savings in each of the four sectors over ten years could justify the cost of building a national fibre-to-the-building network. Investment designed to deliver next generation broadband should be based on technologies which are future-proofed in the longer term, not just aimed at meeting immediate targets to 2015 and 2020.While the immediate target is to ensure what is outlined in the national broadband plan is reached, the infrastructure to be put in place should be designed to have benefits far beyond this. Proper investment will not just deliver targets in the short term but will also benefit the State and its people in the immediate and longer term. Ireland performs badly in broadband connection when compared internationally. We have one of the lowest access levels to broadband in the European Union, which is hardly something that makes this the best small country in which to do business. This cannot be blamed solely on either our size or population density. While Ireland has a relatively low proportion of people living in urban areas when compared with the OECD average, its rate of 60% is broadly similar to that for Finland which has a rate of 60% and for Japan and Hungary which have rates of 65%. In addition, Ireland's population density, at 63 people per square kilometre, is higher than several other comparator countries such as Australia, Finland, the United States of America, Canada and Sweden which have densities of three, 16, 32, three and 21 people per square kilometre, respectively. All of these countries have fixed rates of broadband subscribers. In Australia 93% of premises will have access to fibre to the building that is capable of providing broadband speeds of up to 1 Gbps. Gaining the advantage of high speed broadband in connecting rural areas and delivering online education and health services is a key goal of that country's digital strategy. The western and north-western region in Ireland which I represent has suffered significantly in respect of broadband access. This has put its inhabitants at a distinct disadvantage when compared with the more populated areas of the country. Government thinking is changing and must change to ensure those residing in rural areas have access to the services available to urban dwellers. The western region is predominantly rural, with almost 65% of its population now living outside towns with a population of 1,500 or more, compared with 38% nationally. More than half the national urban population live in cities, but there is only one city in the western region. Consequently, the share of its urban population living in a city is far lower, at approximately 27%. A larger share of the region's urban population live in small towns. In the western region 16.4% of the urban population live in small towns of between 1,500 and 2,000 people, while nationally, only 6% of the urban population live in such towns. It is clear, therefore, that any strategy rolled out must recognise the distinct population structures in the west and north west and the Government must adopt a policy that recognises this fact. In the western region e-learning is well established as a delivery mode; for example, IT Sligo and St. Angela's College, Sligo have pioneered its use nationally and internationally. Moreover, the Mayo Education Centre has been delivering online courses internationally for the past decade. However, online learning will be hampered in these and other institutions by inadequate upload and download broadband speeds. The national broadband plan has outlined several targets that are to be reached in the delivery of broadband throughout the country, namely, 70 Mbps to 1,000 Mbps to more than half of the population by 2015, at least 40 Mbps and, in many cases, much faster speeds to at least a further 20% of the population and potentially as much as 35% around smaller towns and villages and a minimum of 30 Mbps for every remaining home and business in the country, no matter how rural or remote. These targets are laudatory, but one must recognise we cannot rely solely on private industry to deliver on all these targets. The Government must take the initiative in aiding with the extension of the broadband network in order that Ireland can truly have a world-class access service. State telecommunications assets are important in helping to bridge the gap between market provision of services and the need for additional State investment. Government policy, in ensuring access to next generation broadband throughout the country, should recognise the range of applications and industries that require next generation access, the ever increasing bandwidth requirements and the long-term value of investment in network infrastructure. These returns will include the wider economic benefits of better positioning in the global knowledge economy, job creation and enterprise development, all supported by quality, future-proofed broadband. The issue of privatisation must be discussed in the context of this legislation. One of the primary reasons Ireland has such a poor level of broadband penetration heretofore is the privatisation of Telecom Éireann. This move was disastrous for Ireland's telecommunications network, resulting in a severe lack of investment in the area. Ireland is only now playing catch-up with other European countries and, by right, this legislation should have been brought forward in one way or another many years ago. The privatisation of Telecom Éireann and the establishment of Eircom were a disaster for the Irish telecommunications market and we need not go down this route once again. I suggest all fibre optic cables used by the ESB under this legislation remain in public ownership. It is surely the only way in which proper broadband access can be delivered to and assured for all regions of the country into the future and a provision to that effect should be included in the legislation. Does the Minister know how much Government expenditure will be required before the roll-out of the fibre network on, for example, consultants' reports and other preparatory work? Second, how does he envisage the public sector element being secured in this regard, particularly in rural areas? How can Members ensure everyone in the country, including those in sparsely populated areas, will have the same standard of broadband access because we cannot have a two-speed Ireland? In common with Deputy Michael Moynihan, I believe all Members must give careful consideration to the issue of access to private lands and at least some additional access activity to maintain the network.  To summarise, Sinn Féin welcomes this legislation, wishes it a fair wind and will help the Minister in every way it can to see it established.

I am unsure how much time I will take at this point. In common with other speakers, I welcome the introduction of this legislation. It is a progressive step to enable the ESB to provide fibre on its networks and in respect of broadband, it probably is one of the most progressive steps that could have been taken by a Government to ensure this would happen. As Members are aware, the ESB is a company that already has a relationship with every household and business in the country. Consequently, it is a perfect fit for it to be able to provide fibre-optic broadband by wrapping fibre on their existing networks. I note that the ESB already has fibre wrapped on its transmission network nationwide on the larger lines from 110 kV upwards, which is useful and has linked the metropolitan area networks around the country. While this is useful, the real difference and impact can be made as the company starts to roll out fibre onto the connections to houses and businesses nationwide.That is why the Bill is to be welcomed. The existing policy up to now on providing broadband has been to rely on the market. That has left many areas behind, including rural areas but also areas where people are trying to operate businesses and create and maintain jobs. They are not getting a service that is in any way reliable or up to standard. Providing a proper fibre optic broadband network could act as a major stimulus across the country, enabling people to create businesses, do their business and access education. In recent years we have relied on mobile telephony to provide broadband and bridge the gap. It has failed and is not capable of providing the service people need. The provider for the rural broadband scheme, 3, wants to build 160 masts to provide its broadband service across the country. We know everything this invokes in communities across the country when masts are erected. The legislation provides the opportunity to avoid all of that disruption across communities and the country by providing a reliable and resilient service for everybody. That is the way we should go. I urge the Minister to ensure after this legislation is passed it is rolled out to the significant number of households across the country in order that people can access modern fibre networks. In Ireland approximately 2% to 3% of households have access to a fibre connection. In Estonia over 30% have access, while in Portugal almost 20% have such access. These are countries that would not be seen as the most digitally advanced or progressive. We aim to pitch ourselves at the heart of information technology and information provision through the Internet; therefore, we should aim to have universal coverage across the country. As has been mentioned, Australia began a project a couple of years ago to roll out fibre broadband to every house in the country. When that project is completed, a huge proportion of the country will have access to proper broadband speeds. We should look to go that way and it could unleash great potential. The Western Development Commission published a report a couple of years ago examining the creative industries. It estimated that the creative industries in the north-west region alone could create approximately 18,000 jobs simply by improving access to the Internet in order that they could sell their wares across it. These businesses are not being thought of at all. We regard foreign direct investment as a way of rebuilding the economy. We can consider the individuals involved in creative industries who could establish new industries that might not have been thought of by having access to a proper telecommunications infrastructure. That is the opportunity this legislation opens up to us. It is like when the ESB set out to electrify the country in the rural electrification scheme in the 1950s. Now it could be used as a vehicle to turn on the whole country and light fibre across the country. That is to be welcomed. As has been said, it is probably a little late but better late than never. We commend the Minister for ensuring this is happening. When he sums up on Second Stage, will he outline his plans, if any, to ensure as wide a roll-out as possible of a fibre optic network? We should look to invest in this as a state to assist the ESB in providing this service because it would pay huge dividends in the long run and, as a stimulus, make a significant difference to people's lives across the country. Given that the ESB is a semi-State company, we would be able to invest in it and provide funding to ensure this happened. I urge the Minister to ensure it will happen to provide access for all to a proper broadband service, with proper download and upload speeds, and open up the innovation and skills available across the country. Jobs and new businesses would come from it and real innovation would take place.  This legislation is welcome and I hope it will go through without any problem and be welcomed across the board. I hope the ESB is geared up and ready to go in rolling out the fibre network that is envisaged and that we will see in the coming years access to suitable broadband across the country. I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward the legislation.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	532	I thank the Chair for givng me the opportunity to speak on the ESB (Electronic Communications Networks) Bill 2013. I welcome this important debate because if we are to get the country back working again, we must change with the times and reform at both local and national levels and in the context of this debate, the communications and electronics sector. Before discussing the details of the Bill, I commend all ESB staff for their great and magnificent work during the recent storms. They were brave, efficient and very professional. They went out in the cold, wet and windy conditions to restore power for people, small businesses, factories and the whole economy. I thank them and commend them for their dedication. It is important that the State value such persons and support them when they have issues. For example, in the case of the recent pensions row this should never be forgotten, as all ESB staff deserve a decent and fair pension. I welcome the legislation and commend the Minister for bringing it forward. It legislation I will support. It is not very often that I will support Government legislation in this House, but this is particularly positive legislation. It is welcome that there seems to be a broad consensus in supporting it. The word on the street in Howth, Marino, Clontarf, Raheny, Kilbarrack and Baldoyle is that this is sensible legislation. I listened to the word on the street and the people involved in the sector. The Bill will allow the ESB to develop an electronic communications network using existing infrastructure to provide electronic communications services. That is a positive development. The ESB has already been involved in fibre optic network development and an expansion of services is proposed, hence the need to establish a legislative basis. The Bill will treat electronic communications networks in the same manner as electricity infrastructure. This includes existing powers of entry onto private land. The Bill will also allow the ESB to partner with a separate company to provide such services. The legislation does not go into more specific detail on such a partner. The ESB started the process by seeking a partner in 2012 with a tender proposal and is to report to the Minister. However, no further information is available. The Bill does not affect the recent debate on expansion of the national grid, the ESB workers' pension dispute or electricity price increases. That is what the legislation and the future of the country is about and it is very important we take this into strong consideration. We need new ideas and infrastructure to develop the economy. When we have such a high youth unemployment rate in the State, we need projects such as this. In this debate we should not forget our highly qualified young people who have fantastic skills in electronics and communications. Just a few minutes ago I heard on the news about a group of four Irish friends who had got together and started a small company and who already had secured an investment of approximately €20 million.We need to nurture young talented people and ensure the education system helps to develop their electronic and technological skills to the maximum. Let us not forget we have many highly skilled and qualified people.  In the context of the debate on pylons, GridLink and the expansion of EirGrid, this project has been given much media attention. However, the Bill is not relevant to that debate. It confers no extra powers on the ESB regarding electricity lines, although ESB lines will also be able to be used for the purpose of electronic communications networks, as well as for the carrying of electricity. The stated aim of the GridLink project is the provision of a new high voltage overhead power line, linking Knockraha in County Cork with Great Island in County Wexford and Dunstown, near Kilcullen, County Kildare, that will ensure a reliable and high quality electricity supply for homes, farms and businesses in the south and eastern region for the future. The stated aim of the Bill is to enable the electricity supplier to engage in electronic communications networks and electronic communications. The debate on pylons is important and we must listen to all sides. On the one hand, we must ensure we get the maximum power and energy supply and modern communications for the country. On the other, we must listen to the reasonable arguments of those who have concerns about the pylons to be constructed. There has been a massive reaction on this issue which is a difficult one to resolve, but we must try to come up with sensible solutions. I am sure there are good quality people who could devise sensible solutions. We must ensure we protect tourism and the environment, but we must also ensure we protect the development of jobs and the economy, particularly in the electronics sector. We must resolve both issues and I am confident people will be able to sit down and come up with a solution.  I support the section of the Bill which suggests the ESB will work with other companies. While this does not necessarily provide capacity for partnership, the ESB and the electricity sector have involved third parties since before the Electricity (Supply) Act 1927. Under that Act, an authorised undertaker was a person statutorily allowed to generate, distribute and supply electricity to the public in a specific area. Under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, is allowed to grant authorisations to construct electricity stations and access the transmission and distribution system. We need to be creative and if the ESB has new ideas for expansion, we should let it keep at it and doing what it knows best. We have a pool of talented people in the ESB and saw them in action following the recent storms. Not only is the expertise of the ESB recognised nationally, it is also recognised internationally. I have many friends in the ESB who have happy stories to relate of projects in which they were involved abroad. Sections 5 and 6 of the Bill concern the right of ESB companies to enter private lands. There are already extensive powers in place to allow the ESB to carry out its functions and it is important to ensure this will continue. The issue of rights of way is often raised. In this context, they concern right of way over or through land, for example, for cars to carry gas, pipes, wires and pylons, which has been created by express grant, reservation or statute. While rights of way may be granted, we must ensure we respect the rights of people, in particular in regard to their property. The Bill extends section 53 of the Electricity (Supply) Act 1927 to prospective companies the ESB may partner to provide electronic communications network services, but not all of the section will apply to other companies. Some of the subsections are relevant such as that which provides the power to place electric lines above or below ground, across any land that is not a street, road, railway or tramway. Notice must be given to the landowner or occupier of such an intention. Where the landowner or occupier agrees with the conditions, within seven days the company may enter to place the lines. Where the landowner does not agree, the company may still enter and place lines, but it must pay compensation under the Acquisition of Land (Assessment of Compensation) Act 1919. This issue can sometimes cause problems, but compensation must be paid. Under the Bill, the ESB and other companies will not be able to attach anything to walls, houses or buildings. We must respect the rights of people and families and their homes. The ESB has this power for the purpose of supplying electricity, but it is not allowed in the Bill because such powers are not considered appropriate in the development of electronic communications networks, given that existing telecommunications providers operate within these limits. We must provide for the public good, while respecting the rights of people. In the context of Government targets and policy, the Bill is expected to provide for an anticipated increase in the availability of high speed broadband. This objective complements Government and EU policy as set out in the Government's national broadband plan for Ireland. The Government has committed to high speed broadband availability across the country during its lifetime. Specifically, it has committed to its availability to more than half of the population by 2015, as well as homes and businesses, no matter how rural or remote they are. We need to focus on these issues in order that we can develop the whole economy. We hear much talk about competitiveness. If we do not have competitiveness, we will not be able to compete on the national and international markets. This is particularly relevant in the context of a company such as the ESB which is already playing in the premiership internationally when it comes to communications and electricity provision. It has a proud record in this regard across the world. Forfás has stated the availability of high quality broadband has been of strategic importance for enterprise. This is very true. We cannot get on unless we have the resources and right strategies and systems in place. Forfás has stated advanced broadband services are crucial in achieving productivity and the necessary growth to improve competitiveness, sustain high level incomes and ensure Ireland captures new opportunities for entrepreneurship and job creation across all sectors. We must focus on this issue. There is only one game in town and it concerns the economy and job creation. Job creation must be our focus in the next two or three years and this legislation can make a massive contribution in that regard. It is welcome when talking about growth and productivity that the Minister is also talking about sustaining high level incomes because those on good solid incomes are the grassroots and engine of the economy. They are the ones who are paying their taxes and spending their money in local small businesses. The regulatory impact analysis, RIA, states the increased availability of high speed broadband has the potential to contribute to Ireland's competitiveness and have a positive effect in addressing the digital divide. I welcome this important legislation which I strongly support. The cost implications associated with the Bill amount only to administrative costs related to pursuing legislative proposals generally. No additional or recurring costs to the Exchequer have been identified and I do not believe the Minister has consultants hanging around in the background. The legislation has the potential to generate growth in the sector and bring the country into the modern age. It also has great potential to create jobs and develop the economy. I urge the Minister to ensure when he is examining the issues involved that he taps into the high quality young people available who are streets ahead of us when it comes to electronics, technology and communications.They are the future of the country, but they are in the highest unemployment bracket. We need to focus on them because they can lift all of us and the country by getting into the sector and paying taxes which we could use to develop the State and services, particularly for people with disabilities and those who are least well off. I welcome the legislation, which I support.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	533	I very much welcome the Bill, which will allow the ESB to use its distribution network to deliver fibre services to the telecommunications market and engage in the installation and operation of electronic communications networks and services, either alone or in conjunction with another company. As a rural Deputy from the Cavan-Monaghan constituency, I am very well aware of the huge disadvantage it is for businesses, communities, householders and young people not to have access to high speed broadband. I have raised this matter with the Minister on many occasions and I am really pleased the ESB's extensive electricity networks will have the ability to extend high quality broadband throughout the country but particularly to rural Ireland which has proved to be very problematic in the past. This proposal makes good common sense and people in rural Ireland will be able to move into the 21st century in terms of telecommunications. As we know, broadband is now an essential utility like water or power. To survive in today's world we need high speed reliable broadband. I agree that there was extensive investment in broadband by previous Governments, but it did not deliver to rural Ireland in the way it should have and we were left behind. I have lost count at this stage of the number of occasions I have been approached by individuals and businesses regarding broadband services. The problem always seems to be the same; if one is too far from the local exchange, the quality of broadband seems very poor. The topography of County Monaghan, with its drumlins, makes it very difficult for people to use wireless broadband. I know of one particular business which employs 32 people and the lack of quality broadband in the area causes great difficulties and expense. This business availed of the national broadband scheme, but as it is a commercial enterprise, it was of little benefit to it. While the national broadband scheme may guarantee broadband access, unfortunately, the reality is it is at very limited speeds and for this business, it means that any major software upgrade has to be done on site, rather than by remote access, which results in considerable extra costs. To access broadband the owner must pay €600 a month for an ISDN line which is of only limited ability and use to him. The problem is that fibre optic broadband is available across the Border, only four miles away in Caledon, County Tyrone, and as a result, the owner is seriously considering relocating his business to Northern Ireland, which is certainly not something I would like to see happen. The major issue is that in the era in which we live if rural areas are unable to avail of a high quality broadband service, they will simply not be able to compete when it comes to attracting investment and new businesses. Virtual businesses, online sales and e-commerce are vital amenities for any start-up business. At a time when we are trying to make Ireland the best small country in the world in which to do business, we absolutely need to ensure an adequate broadband service is available throughout the country, not just in the major cities. Recently I met a lady with an excellent proposal for an online business through developing the concept of a virtual assistant whereby somebody could work from home serving a business in the United States or anywhere in the world. This would be particularly important for women who want to say at home and look after a family. They could juggle their work hours with their childminding needs. What is most important for the business is access to high speed broadband because without it, one could not work from home. Access to the Internet provides huge opportunities. We badly need such innovation and entrepreneurial spirit, but without high speed broadband, it cannot be done. I came across the case of a mother who had wireless broadband and used to drive her child to urban areas to access broadband on a laptop to do homework or engage in project research. There is a broadband deficit in Ireland along the lines of a rural-urban split. The Bill will allow this to change and bring huge benefits to rural Ireland through the provision of broadband. I very much welcome the Bill and commend the Minister for bringing it forward.
#PeterFitzpatrick	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-party	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-dob	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	534	The ESB has identified an opportunity to use its electricity distribution network to provide fibre telecommunications services in the Irish market. It will be able to do this either alone or in partnership with another company. It is envisaged this, in turn, could facilitate retail telecommunications operators in Ireland to deliver fibre broadband services. The purpose of the Bill is to enable the ESB to attach a fibre network to its electricity network for the purpose of entering the wholesale communications market. The ESB already operates a fibre network across the electricity transmission system. This fibre network originates through the ESB's management of the electricity network. Over time additional capacity on the network has been sold to operators in the telecommunications market. The proposed new network relates to the distribution system and differs from the ESB's existing fibre network in that it would be a stand-alone business with no direct connection to the management of the electricity network. It was, therefore, considered prudent to introduce legislation to provide the ESB with an explicit legal basis to engage in the telecommunications market. It is expected that it will bring forward detailed proposals for this project during 2014. Such proposals and the necessary statutory approval will be subject to separate detailed consideration by the Department. The ESB is no longer one entity but comprises a group of companies looking after various specific tasks. Electric Ireland manages electricity and gas supply accounts. ESB Networks Limited maintains Ireland's electricity network and infrastructure and the ESB's electricity meters. ESB International is an international energy company investing in energy and engineering projects. ESB Telecoms Limited was founded by the ESB group in 2001 to explore opportunities in the Irish telecommunications market. It built and owns 1,300 km of the national fibre optic network, comprising 48 core fibre wrapped around the ESB's high voltage network which links various metropolitan area networks in major Irish cities. Its national network is constructed in a figure of eight pattern around Ireland, with a spur from Carrick-on-Shannon to Buncrana. It also owns and manages more than 400 telecommunications towers and sites containing substantial installations for all major Irish telecommunications companies. Through its network, it offers bandwidth and infrastructure to mobile phone operators, Departments and agencies, licensed operators and wireless Internet service providers. ESB Telecoms Limited's fibre-optic network forms a key part of the national telecommunications infrastructure enabling broadband connectivity for businesses and consumers. This was significantly expanded in 2012 with the completion of a subsea fibre optic cable directly linking Irish businesses with major UK cities.This network is augmented by one of the largest networks of independent mobile tower sites in the country allowing customers to support the increasing demand for services delivered through mobile devices and smartphones.  Significant investment is required to upgrade broadband infrastructure at a time when the ongoing global economic uncertainty makes raising capital more expensive. While UPC has invested significantly in upgrading its cable network in our main urban centres, businesses, particularly SMEs, in a large number of medium-sized towns do not have access to competitively price advanced broadband services. Several operators in the market provide a fibre optic broadband and communications service, including eircom, UPC and Magnet. When enacted, the legislation will allow the ESB to use its distribution network to deliver telecommunication services.
#JoeOReilly	unknown-#JoeOReilly-party	unknown-#JoeOReilly-dob	unknown-#JoeOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	535	I welcome the legislation and acknowledge that it as another part of the Minister's effort to modernise the communications and energy sectors, with a resulting positive impact on job creation. That is the logic underpinning all of the strategies employed by the Minister and his Department. That has to be the ultimate result of any initiative the House approves. It should be about job creation and getting people working. Everything else will follow from this. I am happy to acknowledge that under the programme for Government, we committed to ensuring 90% of homes and businesses would be provided with next generation broadband. This can only be achieved by delivering fibre optic cables to homes or kerbs. The Bill is a confirmation of that commitment and an expression of how important investment in broadband infrastructure is to the country. It is welcome that a basic broadband service is available in most of the country, but Members who represent constituencies such as that represented by Deputy Heather Humphreys and me want the Government to go one step further and ensure the service is better than this. The Minister is committed to rolling out high speed broadband to every home and business. We are making great strides in the provision of national high speed broadband. Market giants such as eircom, UPC, Vodafone and Meteor have increased the speed of their services and 3G and 4G coverage is available. However, many small towns and villages in rural communities have yet to experience the impact of these services. My constituency is predominantly rural and owing to geographical and commercial reasons, some areas have a poor to non-existent broadband service. While acknowledging all that is good in the legislation, I would fail in my duty if I did not remind the Minister of State of this. However, he is acutely aware of the issue which is of great concern to the people I represent. This puts homeowners, small businesses and farmers in these areas at a severe disadvantage compared to those in other parts of the country. A regulatory impact assessment of the legislation last year found that if it were fully enacted, it would have the potential "to reduce the existing digital divide between geographic locations" and on that it is in line with the objectives of the national digital strategy, which aims "to address social inclusion by encouraging citizens to engage with the Internet and Internet services". One of the aims of the strategy is to get 10,000 businesses online for the first time and have a further 2,000 small business trading online in the next two years. We need to get into that market. Irish consumers spend €3 billion on average online annually, but, sadly, approximately 70% of that spend goes abroad and we must try to correct this. This legislation is critical in that regard. The Bill will enable many SMEs to tap into the online market, which would otherwise be unavailable to them. For counties such as Cavan and Monaghan, it will also make a difference in the context of inward investment, particularly by large multinational companies, as we do not do well in that regard. The lack of an adequate broadband service is one of the contributory factors to a lack of investment by such companies. One of the key recommendations in the Forfás report commissioned last year is that significant investment in upgrading the broadband infrastructure is required at a time when ongoing global uncertainty makes raising capital more expensive. While our larger towns and cities have access to quality, speedy broadband, large numbers of medium-sized towns do not have access to competitively priced advanced broadband services, hence the significance of the legislation. One of the ways in which this issue can be rectified is through the prioritisation of the removal of barriers to private sector investment, in parallel with State investment and intervention. As was mentioned, the wireless system is erratic and not universally and uniformly satisfactory in drumlin territory, given the topography of the area. Section 2 permits the ESB to engage in electronic communications networks and services, either on its own or in conjunction with another communications company. According to OECD reports, Ireland's volume of fibre optic connections is low. Fibre optic cables can provide voice, data and televisual services with enhanced quality and speed. The ESB is seeking a partnership to roll out a €400 million fibre optic network across the State, which is significant. Sections 2 and 3 of the Bill enable the company to enter into such a partnership with a private telecommunications company and give that company access to the ESB's infrastructure, which is a wonderful development. It is a logical step, but it will not happen until the legislation is enacted. The regulatory impact assessment also found that if a decision was made to retain the status quo and not allow the ESB to carry out these activities, any opportunity for the increased availability of high speed broadband could be negatively impacted on. It is, therefore, objectively established, as well as appearing logical, even to lay people. Furthermore, the assessment found that by giving the company the necessary legislative footing, the increased availability of high speed broadband would be a more likely outcome. This important legislation will tie in with EU proposals and commitments relating to broadband services, provide for market competitiveness, which is crucial, and make good on the commitments laid out in the national broadband plan and the programme for Government. Section 5 gives the ESB authority to grant wayleave powers to companies accessing electricity infrastructure. This will be vital when the legislation is implemented. The legislation will be important in the context of job creation and enhancing the ability of small businesses to market their products and create an online market. That is where the potential to develop lies nowadays and it is important that small traders can get into the online market. The Bill also has the potential to attract multinationals and large industries to areas to which they were not traditionally attracted. There will be quality of life implications owing to improved access to knowledge and entertainment and enrichment of a range of lifestyle choices.We are achieving the objective of job creation and modernisation, while also addressing quality of life issues.  Why should we not disperse quality of life and opportunities for job creation widely across the country?  This is progressive and modernising legislation in that respect and we should enthusiastically support its rapid passage through the House as a signal that we are serious about job creation, quality of life issues and modernisation. Broadband is the modern equivalent of the road network in ancient Rome and the trains and other communications developments that accompanied the Industrial Revolution.  It allows for the dispersal of opportunities.

ComReg reported in 2012 that 16,000 Internet users had dial-up connections.  One third of Internet subscriptions rely on mobile broadband, which is expensive, variable in quality and synonymous with small data caps.  Eircom estimates that 6% of the population cannot connect to DSL connections.  If one adds these figures together, one finds that 250,000 people have mobile, satellite or fixed wireless services.  Our patchwork broadband infrastructure makes the service unusable, even for those with DSL connections.  A report by Netflix indicated that Ireland had the second worst spread of the eight countries it had surveyed.  However, I do not put much weight on such reports because they do not always reflect the truth.  Perhaps the Minister is in a position to contradict them.  We cannot always run ourselves down in regard to the services provided because we have come a long way in the last six years in providing adequate broadband connections.  There will be pitfalls and roadblocks along the way, but I hope the involvement of the ESB will help to eliminate the problems that arose previously and go a long way towards providing top of the range services in both rural and urban areas.  We will be proposing an amendment to section 5 of the Bill to ensure the development of electronic communications facilities on private property will not have a dramatic impact on property rights and ownership and that such work will be carried out with care and minimal detrimental impact on the properties concerned.  Our amendment would provide for a complaints procedure to the Commission for Energy Regulation where the criteria set out are not fulfilled.  Advertised speeds must be binding on Internet service providers, with the possibility of issuing fines for breaches.  Some providers advertise unrealisable speeds. Ireland's small and dispersed population does not make the economics of broadband roll-out attractive when compared to many other countries.  The major companies that provide broadband services are cherry-picking urban centres and inclined to stay away from rural areas.  The national broadband strategy commits the Government to a range of actions that will facilitate more efficient roll-out of infrastructure and maximise the use of existing assets.Ireland's broadband costs are among the highest in the OECD, which compared cost and quality of service. I presume that is because of the sparse population in some parts of the country and trying to reach out with broadband. In many rural areas to which different Deputies on the far side of the House have referred, there are small companies providing important employment. In the rural part of a constituency, two or three such companies can provide perhaps 15, 20, 30 or 40 jobs. Such jobs are important to the economy of small villages and towns through the country and it is important that we be able to provide state-of-the-art broadband services for such companies in the future. As I stated at the outset, I welcome the fact the ESB is now getting involved. I would have preferred to have seen the company go it alone, but it will be in partnership with some of the major communications companies in this country and throughout Europe. The Minister might outline when he is replying why the ESB could not get involved on a stand-alone basis completely. As I stated, the company was successful in the provision of electrification of Ireland and in providing the service down through the years, through good times and bad, through good weather and bad. We might get an outline of why the company cannot go it alone in providing this infrastructure rather than in partnership with other companies. Overall, I welcome the Bill. I ask the Minister to continue to take a strong interest in rural areas that are not getting the services they require to enable them to expand, develop and survive in the world of modern technology. When one considers that ten or 12 years ago mobile phones were probably only coming on the market, we have moved so far ahead that all the bookings for flights and for concerts and all of the different areas that people want to access in their day-to-day living are dependent on the speed of broadband. I certainly welcome the Bill. Hopefully, we will see ESB every bit as successful in this area as it has been in the provision of electricity.

If citizens across this country are to receive equal treatment, then access to basic infrastructure is vital and what we have at present, in terms of industries and householders reliant on broadband, is a two-speed Ireland. I welcome the provisions of this Bill, which will provide greater freedom to ESB in terms of broadband infrastructure, which in turn can be used by other providers, but this represents only the beginning of a long process if dwellers in rural Ireland are to be able to access the broadband services they deserve. One need only look at the percentage of fibre connections as a total of broadband connections to see the extent of the poor performance to date. Ireland ranks above only Greece and below a range of countries, including Korea, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Turkey, Mexico and Chile. Rural areas all across Ireland are losing out because micro-enterprises can no longer locate in rural areas given the abysmal level of broadband available. Even when one raises this issue in the context of a company that perhaps would create three jobs in a rural area, there is no movement or impetus to ensure that when jobs are at stake all necessary provisions are put in place to ensure that the right level of broadband is available. In decades gone by, significant emphasis was placed on bringing vital infrastructure such as electricity to rural areas, but I see no such vision in terms of broadband. We simply get the mantra that the aim is to ensure that a set percentage of people in the country have access to high-speed broadband, when this simply translates as having high-speed broadband available in Dublin and its hinterland. I have made repeated representations to the Minister on broadband availability in areas such as Athenry, Mountbellew, Moylough, Ballymacward and Tuam - I welcome the fact that the necessary ducting has been provided in Tuam - but the repeated mantra is that since market liberalisation in 1999 broadband services are delivered in the first instance through private sector operators. How many homes in Ireland would be able to switch on the lights if the national electrification scheme was left to private providers? In recent weeks, I was contacted by a company in Headford, County Galway, seeking to double its workforce with the creation of 20 jobs, but broadband is the stumbling block. I have brought this matter to the attention of the Ministers, Deputies Rabbitte and Bruton, and also to the attention of the Taoiseach. I certainly am not happy with the response I received so far from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. Unemployment is a major issue in County Galway and all Departments should be working together to secure these potential jobs. Leaving this vital national infrastructure to private providers will mean that there will be excellent services in the cities, good service in the larger towns, a mediocre service in smaller towns and poor provision in rural areas, or certainly the speed necessary to locate a business in a rural area will not be available. Broadband is not a luxury for rural businesses; it is a necessity. One need only ask any local business person. If rural areas are not to be left behind on this particular highway, then the current framework of leaving services to the private sector will have to change. Fibre to the building, FTTB, is the level of service that is required in towns such as Ballinasloe, Loughrea, Tuam, Athenry and Mountbellew, and while there has been some movement on this, it has been slow. We remain over-reliant on congested copper cabling and business and home owners in Ireland continue to fall behind in European terms when it comes to bandwidth and the price of Internet services. I was recently contacted by a businessman in County Galway who can get fibre broadband in his Finland offices for €50 per month and can get the same service in Prague for €100 per month. In Ireland, that costs €2,700 per month. This is having serious repercussions on the competitiveness of Ireland, in particular, on the competitiveness of vast swathes of Ireland that lie outside the major cities. Another issue I wish to raise in respect of the Bill is the extension of the wayleave rights. Previously, only ESB had the right to enter private property, but this Bill extends that right to companies working in partnership with ESB in the provision of communication networks or services. An extensive information campaign, including letters to every ESB customer, is necessary to ensure that all ESB customers whose lands have a wayleave right for ESB are properly informed of this change. Otherwise, it would give rise to a situation where landowners will confront workers whom they believe are trespassing on their lands when in fact the wayleave right will have been amended through this legislation. It is crucial that this change is communicated to landowners by the ESB as soon as is practicable. This Bill is a step forward in terms of putting the mechanisms in place whereby improved broadband services can be provided, but the pace of change remains frustrating, particularly for those in small towns and rural areas across Ireland.
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	541	I welcome and support the Bill. Before I speak to the Bill, I should put it in the context of the legacy of the telecommunications that we have been left with in this country. One of the biggest mistakes was the selling of the Eircom infrastructure which, I suppose, became a considerable barrier to the development of quality broadband in this country. For that reason, we have been playing catch-up. I commend the Minister and the Government for their recent initiatives and the strides they have made in extending quality broadband to schools right around the country. This Bill will be an additional step in the provision of digital infrastructure right across the country. Ireland is uniquely placed in the export of services right around the world in terms of engineering, technology and business support and there is no reason we cannot export this expertise over the Internet from every corner of Ireland. The Bill is a progressive step which gives the ESB the capacity to reach its full potential in terms of delivering telecommunications infrastructure on the back of its existing distribution networks. ESB has always delivered infrastructure with full public confidence to the highest standard and to all parts of the country, both urban and rural. The ESB is recognised as having the expertise and the personnel to deliver essential infrastructure and no doubt it will continue to deliver it, including essential telecommunications infrastructure, to the regions. As Members have said, the regions must have access to quality broadband and digital infrastructure if they are to have equal access to job creation and development, and the Bill will certainly assist that process. The ESB has available to it existing transmission networks which it already utilises for telecommunications and now the company plans to expand and use distribution lines which reach into every parish and community in the country. We cannot underestimate the significance of the Bill. Telecommunications technology allows telecommunications cables to be wrapped around the existing lines and this cuts the need for significant capital costs in terms of excavation, wayleaves and ducting across the country. The Bill could be a real game changer in terms of delivery of wholesale Internet to the regions. I am very excited about the news from the ESB on how it plans to invest in this technology with investment partners in rolling out broadband further to the country. This will enhance the telecommunications infrastructure that can link with existing digital hubs and the metropolitan area networks, MANs.We already know about the Eircom investment announced last year, and all of that will feed into the national broadband plan. It will introduce healthy competition into the wholesale market for the provision of broadband. It will also increase access opportunities for the retail providers who are also investing in infrastructure in the country. I draw the Minister's attention to the south-east region. As he knows, I come from Waterford. A recent economic strategy for Waterford city and county identified the lack of a dark fibre aurora high capacity broadband network in the south-east region, and that is also identified in a Forfás report. I have a map showing the existing network which goes from Dublin across the midlands to Galway, down to Ennis, into Limerick and then down to Cork, but unfortunately that network does not reach into the south-east region. That is a big disadvantage to us. That is identified by Forfás. I hope the opportunity that this presents might interest the ESB and its investment partners so they can extend into those regions this type of network which will bring balance and the same opportunities for people and businesses in those regions and communities to access the quality network to which we all aspire. I will be supporting this legislation. These are exciting times. The Minister will make up the ground that was lost through the sale of the Eircom infrastructure and that is where all the focus is, and I wish him well in that regard.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	542	I very much welcome this legislation, the main principle of which is to include electronic communication in the statutory functions of the ESB. Most people would associate Eircom with communications and not the ESB. I am not impressed with the history of Eircom in the provision of broadband, a point Deputy Connaughton made in respect of rural Galway. The previous national broadband scheme certainly looked good and I was a member of Galway County Council at the time it was introduced. We would have had presentations from 3G. The scheme was accompanied by lovely colourful maps but coverage was not factual on the ground in many areas. Many places which would have been deemed to be covered by that scheme in reality were not covered. I am more hopeful of the Minister's new national broadband plan. I know he has initiated a mapping procedure and he is examining European rules in terms of State aid to ensure we get adequate broadband provision. I am more hopeful of that. It is always important to hear from constituents and to hear citations from them. I have two from constituents in rural Galway who are both business people. One person is living in Tullykyne near Moycullen and he has always been an Eircom subscriber. He wrote that his attempts to obtain broadband at his residence have been resoundingly unsuccessful, with his latest phone call to Eircom having been answered in what he understands to be Mumbai, India, and the operative on that occasion suggested that he contact his public representative. He also wrote that there are many homes in his area without broadband despite it being available in Moycullen and Rosscahill, all areas within three or four miles. He further wrote that the absence of broadband in 2013 is a travesty, particularly when he relies on it for work or for keeping in touch with family. He asked that I make representations to Eircom on his behalf. The second citation, from 2011, is from a businessman who runs a guesthouse near Oughterard. He wrote that for many years he was not able to get any kind of fast Internet connection. He also wrote that the company 3 contacted him earlier this year and said he could get a satellite link which would give broadband connectivity provided through the national broadband scheme. He further wrote that he jumped at this, as running any kind of business without broadband is beyond a joke at this stage. He said that since 3 installed the satellite link the service has been despicable, shameful and hugely time-wasting. He also understands that the State pays a large amount to 3 in order to provide businesses such as his in remote areas with broadband access. He further said the broadband he gets from 3 for which he pays each month is below dial-up speed on many occasions and completely unusable. Those are citations from people living in rural areas who are very frustrated with the quality of service they have received over many years. I welcome the Bill and believe it will provide great opportunities. With respect to the joint venture between the ESB and another company or companies, it will own the fibre assets and it will pay ESB Networks to piggy-back on its pole infrastructure. Most fibre networks run to roadside cabinets, with copper wire used for the final stretches, and this results in the slowing down of speeds. As others have said, Eircom has initiated a large level of investment and there are plans in Moycullen and Barna to improve the infrastructure and the broadband speed. I welcome that and I have met with representatives there. The ESB joint venture will run fibre directly into the walls of buildings, which is the fibre to the building programme. It will improve competition in the sector, which is important also. I remain concerned and doubtful whether it would be viable for ESB Networks to serve the most rural areas economically, hence the importance of the national broadband scheme and the State intervening where the markets do not. I have another example from the Knockferry exchange in my area near Rosscahill where I have contacted Eircom in terms of next generation access. It states that for commercial reasons it is not in a position to roll out next generation access to Knockferry at this stage. It also states that while it constantly reviews its business and investment plans, including considering technology and other changes, there are certain areas of the country where the commercial case for investment is exceedingly difficult to justify and, in this context, it is engaging with the Government in the context of the national broadband plan to identify areas where a joint approach between Government and industry could devise solutions to deliver the Government's targets of 30 Mb to all households regardless of location which will not be served by commercial operators. There are many similar areas where it is not viable economically for Eircom at present and while welcoming this legislation I also welcome the initiatives I mentioned regarding the national broadband plan, the mapping and the Minister's endeavours to ensure that State aid can be provided and that it would be within competition rules. I know from replies to parliamentary questions that the Minister has been in contact with the Commission on such funding. I welcome the legislation, which is good for jobs, rural areas, those working from their homes in rural areas and the sustainability of a rural economy. I look forward to the passing of the legislation and, more importantly, to the roll out of the important fibre directly to buildings in rural areas across our country.

This is an important Bill and I compliment and sincerely thank the Minister for bringing forward this progressive legislation. It is important from the view of having access to a proper fibre telecommunications service in the Irish market. It is as important as a good road going into a county or up a boreen. The last mile of road up to a person's house is the most important mile of road in the country to that person. Equally, it is important to young people living with their parents and people trying to run a business that they have proper communications and a proper fibre optic network into their homes. It is no longer a luxury. Some years ago it might have been an aspiration of people but now it is a must-have. In doing what the Minister is doing, he, his staff and the people working with him deserve to be commended. The Minister has my wholehearted support with regard to this important legislation and I am glad to be present in the Chamber to speak on it. It is very important for the State to protect its investment. With respect to any type of services we have, it is important that we protect our ownership of that asset. This Bill is helping job creation. As a small business operator in a rural location, I know how important it is to have proper access and high-speed connectivity at all times. It is not a luxury; it is an essential tool of any small business. Whether it is to a young person at home doing his or her studies after school and needing access to proper broadband or the parents trying to conduct business or do work, it is vital. As to whether I see this move as creating jobs, I certainly do and the Deputy is a progressive Minister in bringing the legislation before the House. It was neglectful of me at the outset not to pay a special compliment to people in the ESB and in Eircom for the excellent work they did over the Christmas period. A very close friend of mine, Mr. Tom O'Shea, works in Eircom and the Minister will be interested to hear his story.From the week before Christmas to date, he has had one day off, Christmas day. He has had no other day off. Under the stewardship of his boss, Mr. Pat O'Sullivan, who supervises Eircom in our area, they had up to a thousand faults to deal with. Eircom made a decision that I am not too impressed with, namely, to create a package for the excellent staff to leave on 31 December. Talk about bad timing. It was ironic at a time when the service was crumbling, with hundreds of faults. There are people who still do not have their telephone lines connected.

Any man who has had only one day off since the week before Christmas is remarkable. Eircom was up against it and it was the height of bad timing that so many people who had a wealth of experience left on 31 December. I do not blame them for going and I know the Minister does not either. If the package is available, people must make up their minds whether it is the right thing for them and their families. Age also affects whether it suits them, but it left us with a massive problem. We are talking about improving fibre-based telecommunications, but some people do not have their phones connected after the storms. It is not the fault of the management or the workers but the fact that so few people are trying to do such a massive amount of work. It is no one's fault, but it is what people must live with. I refer to the debacle in which Eircom was packaged and sold. It was not the fault of the current Minister but of a previous Government. It was an excellent service at one time, as the Minister remembers, but unfortunately Members travelling the country see poles and wires hanging down because of a lack of investment. It was bad and then it was made good, but now it is in disrepair. The workers in Eircom are struggling and they work morning, noon and night in harsh conditions. They must be up on poles in all types of weather doing very awkward and contrary work, which is very precise and must be done in open circumstances. I thank them sincerely from the bottom of my heart for the work they do. The speed of broadband is vital and ensuring high-speed connectivity is important. The world we live in is very fast-moving. While there is a social aspect, such as holiday bookings or access to information by children, we must have the best service available to people. Things have changed so much over the past few years, and the advances have been great. The Minister's Bill deserves cross-party support. I am the first person to criticise the Government if things go wrong but when I see something right I am the first to welcome it and thank the Minister and his colleagues. The Fianna Fáil proposals for a complaints procedure are welcome, and I see merit in the amendment, as can the Minister. It may need to be tweaked but the Fianna Fáil viewpoint warrants debate. In any system, a proper system of complaints is important. Running a small business in rural Ireland is extremely difficult. Every obstacle is thrown at people. Since becoming a Member of the House, I have continuously said that I welcome the efforts of the Minister, who works hard at attracting overseas investment, but we must look at what we have ourselves. We must look at small business people who have created jobs over the years in shops, manufacturing or the service industry. We must look at what they are doing. The Minister is a practical man and in my opinion he is what I categorise as the acceptable face of the Government. He is a person we can all relate to and get on with.

I am sure people have said a lot worse to the Minister. Running a small business is difficult. Ministers should try to look at the business people we have, who are creating a job for themselves, jobs for family members and jobs for their neighbours and friends. This is important. A person who creates between two and ten jobs is every bit as important as Apple or any other company because he or she is the backbone of the country. They were there in the past and their mothers and fathers before them created a few jobs here and there. We should try to make their lives easier and make it more acceptable for them to employ more people. Other Government measures are not friendly towards those people. Decisions taken by this Government have not helped those people, who are the backbone of rural Ireland and urban Ireland. They go without to pay the wages on Friday. The Minister is more experienced than many Members, myself included. He knows what I am talking about. If we can make their situation better, and if every person creating jobs can increase the number of jobs by one or two or three, it will have a massive impact on employment opportunities in our country. We do not want to see our well-educated and lovely young people having to leave our shores to go to Australia, Canada or America. If we can help keep youngsters at home by creating an environment for work at home, it is most welcome. The worry I have is that when we lose young people, although a certain amount of them will come back - I hope they do - statistics over the decades show that a large percentage will not return. It is very sad because we do not lose just that generation but also the children they will hopefully have. We lose several generations, which is sad. In bringing a Bill before the House and in his work, the Minister is playing his part in the creation of jobs in rural and urban Ireland. I represent places that are disadvantaged because of their location. While I am a Member, I hope I am doing my best to highlight the plight of places such as the Black Valley, Sneem and Glencar. They are disadvantaged through their location but a proud group of people live in those areas and work very hard with very little to create a livelihood for themselves and their families. The legislation will play a role.It is important, as I stated already, to protect the State's investment. We have seen the debacles that have happened in the past, such as with the sale of State assets. I am thankful the Government took on board the Opposition's opinion on the sale of State assets like Coillte. There was a U-turn on that.

The activities uncovered recently in charity boards, with salary top-ups and pension payments, is completely unacceptable and an affront to the ordinary people of this country, who are paying through the nose for a recession which had they no hand, act or part in creating. The debacle we have seen has the potential to destroy the base of charity donations, as has been indicated in various surveys over a period. That is beginning to happen, and if the process continues, it will completely undermine the services being provided by the various agencies, such as the Central Remedial Clinic. A host of services is being provided in this sector at national and local level. Many if not all these services should be provided by the State. Local and national organisations provide services on behalf of the State, with locals serving in a voluntary basis on boards and doing an excellent job. The debacle we have witnessed reflects very poorly on the very good work being done at local and national levels by many organisations, with individuals serving on a voluntary basis on the boards. This issue again reflects the fundamentally unacceptable policy of the Government. There is an elite golden circle who are cosseted and supported; they have made money from being central to the collapse of this economy, and they continue to make money from our current position.

I warmly welcome the legislation and I will strongly support it. The Bill would fully enact all the provisions of the Charities Act 2009, which brought about reform in the law relating to charities in order to ensure greater accountability and protect against abuse of charitable status and fraud. These three words, "accountability", "abuse" and "fraud", have become pertinent in recent weeks, with scandals apparent in the sector. There has been talk of a regulator and of course we need one for the charities sector. That person should be good, accountable, professional and efficient. That has not been mentioned in this debate as everybody thinks a regulator will solve all the problems. We must have the right person and team of people to oversee this regulation. We have seen disaster in the past in the banking sector because of a lack of regulation, so the issue is very important. Section 2 of the proposed legislation sets out the advancement of human rights as being included as a charitable purpose via amendment of section 3 of the 2009 Act. Human rights is a key phrase as many people with disabilities, as well as their families, are sick and tired of buckets and charities because they want their rights as citizens. They pay taxes every single day and they want the equality they deserve. They are sick to death of the mentality that still exists in this country, as the fat cats get big salaries of €200,000 to €400,000 as they work with people with disabilities. It is unacceptable. We need equality and justice, and I urge everybody to support this very important piece of legislation. I am also delighted to see that the principle of equivalence, which lies behind the Good Friday Agreement and directed much legislation in this area, has been seen as very important. We want to build an island with a basis in human rights, equality and respect for all citizens and particularly those with physical and intellectual disability.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	555	All of us have been absolutely disgusted by some of the matters revealed in the past number of weeks. It is one thing to be disgusted and debate it in the Chamber but it is something else to act. We must deal with the issue as a matter of the most extreme urgency. It is not a case of just doing anything as the approach in this piece of legislation must be followed by the Government. There is a lead in this Bill relating to human rights advancement with regard to what defines charitable organisations. That is an extremely important point, and it has not been fully appreciated that human rights organisations focused on that area alone will not be able to avail of existing legislation. The problem should be addressed. Deputy Finian McGrath is correct in that there is an over-reliance on charity. When donations drop by half we can see just how vulnerable are the services provided through that sector. We must get to a point where there is an absolute minimum level of service that people cannot fall below. I would also like to see included areas that could be seen prior to Christmas on an RTE "Prime Time" programme, and these are another side of the fund-raising arm of charitable organisations. Specifically, it related to religious organisations which claimed to be able to treat people suffering from addiction. The RTE investigation unit uncovered examples of vulnerable people being asked to work 18 hours a day in fund-raising by some very questionable organisations, and such issues must be brought under the remit of the law. We can see how fragmented some of our services are and sometimes it strikes me that the country is stuck together with Sellotape. Many of our organisations reflect that but we must get beyond our current position in order to start building decent institutions.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	556	I welcome the Bill which has been introduced by Deputy Mac Lochlainn and I support its intentions. Including the advancement of human rights in the 2009 Act is an excellent idea, as is setting out a timescale for full implementation of the Act. I also welcome the recent commitment by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, to ensure the regulator will be in place by Easter. In that context, I am surprised and disappointed that the Government would not support this Bill. It seems a very simple, sensible and non-political Bill, which provides a very painless way for the Oireachtas as a whole to demonstrate support for what needs to be done. I am disappointed by the missed opportunity from the Government. It is clear that we need a regulator in the charities sector, as there are approximately 8,000 registered charities, with approximately €1 billion in public money disbursed every year. As we know, public confidence in the sector is shot because of revelations about top-up payments and severance packages, and charities have been calling for the establishment of a regulator for a very long time. The Oireachtas has failed those charities as it is only now, after five years, that it is implementing something important that has been sought for a long time. Having consulted people in the sector, there are two issues I want to raise with the Minister, and perhaps he could revert to me about them. We have been told that the chief executive and other staff of the regulator will be found from existing Civil Service resources.That is being interpreted as allowing hiring only from the Civil Service. Obviously, there are many fine and capable civil servants but there are many others with valuable expertise and experience, including within charities and the private sector, academia and other parts of the public sector, who have a lot to bring to bear in this regard. I ask the Minister to let me know whether civil servants alone are to be allowed join the regulator. If so, why? If it is the case, it would be a major mistake. The second concern raised is that the charities have been given no guidance as yet on future governance. As the Minister is aware, there is a multitude of voluntary codes in place. Some are Irish and others are from the United Kingdom. The charities want to know how this matter will be dealt with. For example, they are asking whether a single, unified governance code will be imposed on them. They are asking what mandatory, financial and procedural implications this might have. On this point, the Minister might revert to me. I ask the Government to let the sector know as quickly as possible how this will be dealt with by the regulator. Let me add my voice to those of many Deputies and many in the charities sector in hoping that the disgraceful revelations concerning the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, will not continue to damage the many excellent and well-run charities in the country.

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	558	I will speak fast for once in my life. I welcome the decision of the Minister, Deputy Shatter, to establish the charities regulator. He has announced an aggressive timeline for establishing it. In fairness to him, this decision was taken some time ago and his announcement is not a knee-jerk reaction to the crisis in the CRC, as some critics have alleged. I am concerned, however, over the lag between the Minister's decision and the implementation. Had the charities regulator been in place, it might have been possible to limit the damage to the reputation of the CRC rather than drag down the whole charity sector. Deputy Donnelly said what is occurring has been taking place for the past few years but I first spoke on charities legislation in 2003. This matter could have been dealt with a long time ago. We wanted to change the circumstances that obtained in 2003 also. We must make no mistake that the entire charity sector has suffered as a result of the recent revelations. Over the past seven years, the sector has been hit by a perfect storm. The level of support has fallen in the State by between 20% and 40%, depending on the charity. Donations from the public have decreased. Owing to the state of the public finances, grants have been reduced. I am reliably informed that even before the CRC crisis, the percentage of Irish people giving to charity had for the first time fallen below that giving to charity in the United Kingdom. The impact of the CRC scandal has been profound. The period up to Christmas is a key one for many charities as some take in up to 60% of their income in those weeks. Fundraising Ireland reported charitable income was down by 40%. The longer-term impact may be even more profound. The chairman of one small charity told me it does not intend to run any bucket or bag-packing drives using volunteers this year as it is afraid those volunteers will be abused by members of the public. Left unaddressed, we will see not only a fall in fund-raising income, but also a decline in the number of people volunteering and, crucially, the number willing to serve on charity boards at a time when good governance is needed more than ever. We need the Minister to appoint the regulator as a matter of urgency and ensure the office of regulator is properly resourced. I urge him to pay particular attention to the board of the new body and those who serve on it. Legislation is rightly very specific on the skills and qualifications necessary for board membership but we need people not only with the right skills, but also with a stature such that the public can trust them to try to restore the reputation. Charities need to step up to the mark. Every charity needs to sign up to and implement the fund-raising codes and code of governance and produce and publish the compliant accounts. The charity sector needs to understand that this is no longer the gold standard but the minimum that any serious fund-raising charity needs to meet. Charities need to consider a co-ordinated response to the lack of trust. For example, they must ask whether we need a quality mark for the sector so charities can clearly and easily show the public they are adhering to best standards. This House also needs to step up to the mark.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	559	I acknowledge the work of Deputy Pádraig MacLochlainn in bringing his legislation forward. The detail and the Minister's insight will obviously result in a different perspective on this side of the House. Let us consider the views of the individual citizen watching the circus of the CRC and the Rehab debacle. A farmer watching the 6 p.m. or 9 p.m. news looks at the amount of regulation at farm level and notes the regulation requiring his jeep to be tested every year. He notes all the regulations and bureaucracy in his life and his family's lives only to turn on the television to see a man receiving a golden handshake worth €742,000 without regulation. That is what is driving people daft and silly. It it is not just a case of annoyance as no word can describe it. The issue surrounding the CRC and the golden handshake is just disgusting. One should bear in mind the great work done at the CRC and the great work done for people who need and rely on its services. The downside may be a lack of funding for them as a consequence of this debacle. With regard to Rehab, I want to make a point that indicates some confusion in my mind. Last night, the Minister commented on figures and asked questions about the proportion of money coming in as opposed to going out and the net profit showing. The Taoiseach did so this morning. They were legitimate enough questions bearing in mind ministerial responsibility to this House. How could Rehab, the plaintiff, have a spokesperson make a public comment on the very same issue at a committee meeting on 9 October 2013 and yet regard the comments made last night by the Minister, Deputy Shatter, in his capacity as a member of the Executive, a responsible position in this House, as inappropriate? That confuses me and verification is required.
#AineCollins	unknown-#AineCollins-party	unknown-#AineCollins-dob	unknown-#AineCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	560	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Charities (Amendment) Bill. With all the recent disclosures regarding certain charities, we are in general agreement in the House that drastic and urgent action is needed. I do not want to get into any detail on particular cases right now. I am a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and assure Members that the committee will continue with its investigations. Its reports will be submitted to the House as quickly as possible. Irrespective of what action is taken, it is essential that the Oireachtas plays its part in restoring the faith of the public in charitable organisations. Despite some of the recent revelations, I am quite confident that most charitable organisations in Ireland do excellent work, especially front of house. I include all the work done with children and the disadvantaged in many areas and in a very prudent and effective manner. A considerable number of very genuine people are involved in the agencies. Volunteers give freely of their time and energy to support various charities. Very dedicated staff are providing important services on the ground. These people must not be tarnished by recent controversies. Many charities have suffered considerable reductions in donations over recent weeks and months. Inevitably, services to vulnerable people will be affected if this continues. There is an onus on all of us to put in place a strong regulatory regime that will help to restore confidence in the sector. As part of the Charities Act 2009, a new independent charities regulator is to be established. The sections of the Act that could have been commenced in advance of the establishment of the authority have been commenced. The remainder will be commenced following the establishment of the authority. The Minister for Justice and Equality intends to establish the authority as early as possible this year. The Department of Justice and Equality has received sanction for the appointment of an interim chief executive officer and staff. The authority will give us a much-needed increase in transparency and accountability in the charity sector; this is critical. A vibrant charity sector must be trusted and enjoy the confidence of the public. I would examine the accounting and reporting standards for charitable organisations. Currently, they come under the Companies Acts, especially if they are limited by guarantee and are not for profit. This needs to be addressed so there will be more transparency on salaries, directors, etc.
#HelenMcEntee	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-party	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-dob	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	561	I welcome the chance to speak in this debate. The community and voluntary sector is one of the largest in the State and it makes a huge contribution to the economy, not to mention society as a whole. We are all aware of community and voluntary groups' great importance.We recognise the role they play in supporting the State in areas such as health service delivery and community development. Given their completion of functions on behalf of the State, it is important that their work be carried out in a fully transparent manner and that they all sing from the same hymn sheet. In the past few weeks there has been a lot of talk about the charity sector, but, unfortunately, none of it has been good. The behaviour of a few - as we have seen in recent revelations at the Committee of Public Accounts and by the Minister for Justice and Equality last night - is nothing short of a betrayal of thousands working in this sector and has damaged the extremely important work charities are doing. Since my election last year, I have met numerous voluntary organisations which are doing amazing work. Most of them operate to the highest standards of governance and many have signed up to voluntary codes of practice, but that, clearly, is not enough to restore public trust in the light of the recent scandals. Public confidence in the charity sector has been eroded. We saw a similar situation in the past in the building sector, where self-regulation meant no regulation. It is not just politicians but also charities which have been calling for regulation of the sector. The setting up of the regulatory authority has not just been welcomed by Members of this House but also by voluntary organisations.  The setting up of a regulatory authority is an important step towards regaining public trust, but it must done properly. The authority will have an enormous role to play in promoting good practices, setting and enforcing standards and restoring public trust. It cannot be yet another body with limited powers. It must be entirely free of conflicts of interest. It must be given the independence to initiate investigations and hold people to account. Organisations or individuals that are under investigation by the authority must be subject to the full rigours of the law. Without the fear of consequences and people feeling they will be held accountable, bad practices will continue, with or without a charities regulator. It is important that we do this properly. It is only by getting it right that we can restore public confidence and fix some of the mess made which has come to light recently. It will enable the thousands of committed, hard-working and decent people who are working in the sector to continue their good work. I commend the work of the Committee of Public Accounts on bringing certain things to light and fully support those working in the sector.

Charity and love are the same - with charity you give love, so don't just give money but reach out your hand instead. Irish people have an admirable and unwavering reputation for generosity that puts us ahead of many of our international counterparts. We do not just give money, we also regularly reach out our hand to help and volunteer. I am involved in a number of charities. I help to fund-raise, organise events, volunteer and contribute to charities, as do many other Oireachtas Members and thousands throughout the country. There are hundreds of excellent charities operating in the country. Given the recent CRC revelations, it is timely that we discuss the importance and urgency of implementation of the Charities Act. The wrongdoing of what I hope will only be a small number of people has rocked the foundations of a worthy sector that is reliant on the public's goodwill and generosity. There is something rotten in the state of charity funding if money raised by charitable organisations does not go to the people the public envisaged it was helping. Irish charities are now reporting that donations are down by 10% since the revelations. Implementation of the Act is necessary to help to remove the doubts that have crept into the minds of people who generously donate to charities. We must ensure we have in place a properly regulated charity sector once and for all. I welcome the Minister's announcement that the board of the regulatory authority will be appointed by Easter. The new authority must lead by example and be transparent. It will require a robust board that is not dominated by the cronyism and golden handshakes that we have seen in the past. It will I hope help to avert any future crisis in public confidence through its transparency, leadership, accountability, best practice and corporate governance. I look forward to the full roll-out of the Act this year.
#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	563	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to what is arguably one of the most of important debates in this House because it addresses something that is not just relevant for us, as legislators or politicians, but also as human beings. Last week, as I travelled through Clonakilty and Bandon, I came across an anger about this issue that was unparalleled in my ten years in public life. A light has been shone in a very dark corner and it has been extremely uncomfortable for every one of us. It is too simple to lay the blame for this at the door of the Government or politicians generally. Unfortunately, there is a malaise in human nature itself, which is what makes it so uncomfortable for us. That malaise is real and has been there since time immemorial. It is an ugly nettle that we, as a society, will have to grasp. There will be much more discomfort for us as a society as lights are shone in other dark corners. I urge the Government to continue in this vein because now is the time for leadership and courage. It must continue its quest to hold all those who claim charitable status to account. I commend the Minister for Justice and Equality on the further revelations he laid bare last night. Again, it is very uncomfortable for any of us who has supported charities such as Rehab to realise the uselessness of that support, based on the amount of money which actually went to the service users. Supporting service users is the intention of anyone who puts €5 into a bucket and gets a couple of scratch cards. I regret the response of Rehab and appeal to that organisation, in the interests of society as a whole, to play the ball in this debate, not the man. If there are facts to be put in the public domain or if there are corrections to be made to anything the Minister said, they would be very welcome. Playing the ball is what needs to be done.  There has been too much deference shown in our society during the years, at enormous cost. Too much deference was shown to the political class, the church and many other organisations and the charity sector is no different. We cannot assume that because an organisation is charitable, it is holier than thou and good. There are many organisations about which I have many concerns, one of which is Family & Life. That organisation sends letters to what I believe is a very targeted audience of primarily elderly, vulnerable people, soliciting donations of up to €7,000 in the name of charity. It deserves to have a strong light shone on its activities. There are numerous others about which we should also be concerned. We must have courage, be brave and continue our quest to shine that light.
#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy	unknown-#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy-party	unknown-#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy-dob	unknown-#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	564	I welcome the opportunity the Bill has afforded me to speak. I understand from where Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn is coming in proposing his amendment, but I accept the comments of the Minister on the human rights aspect of it. Irish people are renowned for their generosity in making charitable donations. Whenever a disaster strikes, whether it be local, national or international, we can be sure Irish people will either fund-raise themselves or give generously to help those in greatest need. The lack of regulation in the past has allowed some in the charity sector to take advantage of this giving nature. In fact, charities have become an industry and there is huge diversity in their size. There are 24,000 not-for-profit organisations in Ireland, which figure is an illustration of the fact that charities have become an industry. Of these 24,000 organisations, 8,342 qualify for a charitable tax exemption. The annual income of the top ten is €740,000 or above.In a sector worth €4.9 billion, it is clear that a small number of charities are receiving the lion's share of the money both from fund-raising activity and from the State. The recent revelations on the salaries of some CEOs have not only astonished many of us but disappointed us too. Everyone in the Dáil and in every household in the country has given generously to charity in good faith that the money will go to those who need it most. Serious damage has been done. Even with the downturn in the economy, in 2010 and 2011 the fund-raising figures rose. That is, again, an illustration of the generosity of the Irish people. I am afraid that 2012 and 2013 will reveal a different story. The few have caused problems for so very many. While some charities are subject to the Director of Corporate Enforcement, Revenue, and criminal and fraud legislation already, the introduction of the regulator, as planned by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, is necessary and will help rebuild the trust as never before required by the Irish people. It is in the interests of both the public and the State that the regulator is put in place as soon as possible. That will help restore public confidence and introduce additional transparency, which the majority of charities will welcome, as the genuine charities that do everything correctly and comply with good corporate governance and good financial arrangements need our support more than ever. I acknowledge the leadership of the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group, which has carried out good work within the sector. It has continued to advocate good practice, organised seminars and provided a statement of guiding principles for charities. It has also worked very hard with the Department in order to progress the establishment of a regulator. Trust must be restored as soon as possible. The charities service users deserve no less.
#TonyMcLoughlin	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-party	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-dob	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	565	Members will be aware that there has been a 40% cent drop in donations to charity in the two weeks since the scandal of top-ups to executives' salaries was revealed. Fundraising Ireland stated recently that this issue has reached crisis point in the sector and charities are taking calls every hour from people seeking to cancel subscriptions. People feel let down, which is understandable. It is understandable too that this Dáil would seek immediately to address this impasse. I note the concerns of all to try to allow charities to regain their reputation. From time to time, most of us have either fund-raised or involved ourselves in a charity locally. We did so because we witnessed the work done by those same groups that enabled many families to have a better life. This week, amid the debate on the issues around the remuneration of senior executives within the CRC, we were reminded by parents of children who need the clinic and the clients of CRC of the fantastic work and therapy provided at Clontarf. That is the reason we must focus on allowing the work to continue and so that the wonderful staff there can move on and continue to provide their services at the CRC. According to Fundraising Ireland's CEO, Anne Hannify: "We need a regulator, we need more transparency, and more openness...the public have a right to know where their money is going." People who have donated so generously in the past feel cheated and fooled and the only way forward is the establishment of a charities regulatory authority, CRA. The proposals are now approved by Government. I warmly welcome the fact that the Department of Justice and Equality has been given the green light for the appointment of an interim CEO and for the allocation of a number of staff to the authority. Furthermore, I welcome the commitment by the Minister, Deputy Shatter, to seek expressions of interest in membership of the board of a new authority, which I understand could be up and running later in the summer. The CRA will provide transparency, accountability and good practice in charity governance and management. That is what the public want and has a right to expect, and will lead to increased donations and voluntary support for the sector. The reason we could not fully introduce the 2009 Act was due to cost implications. However, the commitment by the Minister is very welcome and allows charities to come under the umbrella of checks and scrutiny and will restore the confidence of the public to part with their hard-earned money and allow vital charities in society to continue to make their valuable contribution. I commend the Minister, Deputy Shatter, on his decisive action with limited resources to set up the authority. I will conclude by urging charities to at all times take the opportunity to display their management and financial affairs through a very clear window for us all to see and understand.
#EamonnMaloney	unknown-#EamonnMaloney-party	unknown-#EamonnMaloney-dob	unknown-#EamonnMaloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	566	I share the view expressed by Members last night and tonight that this is one of the most interesting debates we have had in the House. I have listened to most of the contributions. It will undoubtedly go down as one of the best debates with many stimulating contributions. All Members welcome the Bill and the principle of what is proposed. Ultimately, we will have an authority. As Deputy Mac Lochlainn indicated, there is a need for a regulator. We must introduce regulation in this jurisdiction. The difficulties we are now dealing with were ignored by politicians in the past, which is the reason we are in this mess. Where there is no regulation some of those involved will do things they should not. Essentially, that is what has happened. The volume of charities registered with Revenue is in excess of 8,000. It makes one wonder what that says about us with a small population of approximately 4 million. Historically, if one registers as a charity with Revenue, one has the status of being tax exempt. I take the view that all those who work for a living should pay their taxes. That is the duty of every citizen. I apply the same standard to charities. In one way or another charities collect money or get it from the State or from us as taxpayers. I do not think any of them should be tax exempt. It is possible that, as in other jurisdictions, they would pay a nominal sum of money. That is the way it should be because the status quo has led to where we are now and to abuse by some due to the lack of accountability. Charities are one thing but I have long held the view that trusts in this country have far too much autonomy. They operate as secret societies that essentially do what they like. They appoint who they like to the trust. It is bad practice and as politicians we should not tolerate it and we should address it in the Bill.
#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	567	I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate. It is important that we work collectively to restore the tarnished image of the charitable sector, but in particular we must help to restore the image of those who work for charities, volunteer for charities and the service users who need and require the service provided by many charitable organisations. As somebody who has raised funds in Cork for the COPE Foundation, Cork Mental Health and the Irish Cancer Society, has participated in church gate collections, has sold a box of flags in a shopping centre and has asked for money, it is critical that we ask the people of this country to continue to support charities. That is the first part of the debate. We must never lose sight of that aim. It is important that a sense of right and wrong is re-established and that those in the charitable sector in charge of governance must recognise that whether it is public money or it has come from donations there must be transparency, accountability and legitimacy in terms of the money spent, where it goes and in particular that it is spent on the service users and facilities for them. Let us put the matter in context; there are many charitable organisations providing a service and support to people that the State has not addressed. One could ask where we would be without them. Where would we in Cork be without the COPE Foundation?The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, was correct last night on the Rehab group. It is important, as Deputy Jim Daly said that there is an opportunity for the organisation to reply and we play the ball not politics with this issue. There must be compliance in the charities sector with absolute integrity restored in it. I call on those involved to voluntarily come forward and ensure compliance. I was the Fine Gael Seanad spokesman on the charity sector when the Charities Act was introduced there. There was a strong debate in the Upper House regarding the human rights element in the legislation. I hope we will come back to this issue at a future date. I welcome the Minister’s decision to implement the Charities Act so that we will have a regulator for the sector. However, a regulator alone will not solve this problem. There must be proper governance and adherence to articles of association. What are auditors signing off on when it comes to these groups’ accounts? No one has yet asked this question in the debate. Annual accounts are signed off on and presented to annual general meetings with no queries from auditors. To have transparency, it is important to restore confidence and trust. However, it must also be ensured that the service-users and their families are given the services they need and deserve. All of us have a duty and responsibility to help restore confidence in the charity sector. The people have always given to charity which must continue. This debate must rise above the partisan level to ensure our charitable sector is viable, honest and just.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	569	The recent revelations about the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, have raised significant public concern at the failure of the Government to regulate the charities sector. This was compounded by the information provided last night by the Minister for Justice and Equality about the funding activities of the Rehab charity and the refusal over some time by its chief executive to provide details of her salary. In the case of the CRC, funding raised by the Friends and Supporters of the Central Remedial Clinic group was used to provide top-up allowances to senior staff. All of this is now in the public consciousness. Last year, this amounted to €250,000. In December, the CRC’s former chief executive told the Committee of Public Accounts that he was given €200,000 when he left the organisation, which came from charitable donations. A kid caught robbing from the poor box in the chapel would be in Mountjoy Prison. Then it was revealed the CRC’s former chief executive actually received a severance package of €740,000. Ceapaim go n-aontaíonn achan duine liom nuair a deirim nach bhfuil aon rud mhaith ag baint leis an tsaint.
 It is estimated that half of the €1.5 million raised last year from charity work by the CRC was used to pay top-ups to its former chief executive. I have a friend, Donnacha Rynne, whose mother, Anne, recently wrote a letter to The Irish Times which I want to read into the Official Report. A chara, I have been following the story of the CRC and the top-ups for its executives. I am the mother of a severely disabled man [my friend, Donnacha] who has been bed-bound for the past year partly because there is no money to purchase a new wheelchair for him. He is on an emergency list for a wheelchair, but we are told that due to lack of funds he will have to wait. I feel sick I am so upset Is mise, Anne Rynne,Miltown Malbay, County Clare. Families who raised millions of euro over many years to supplement the moneys the CRC received from the health service are shocked and angry at this week and last week’s revelations. Many are upset at what they see as a breach of trust. What is also clear is that there is a toxic culture of bonuses, top-ups and bailouts where there is always money for the elites but none for the services that the charities were established to provide.
Tá daoine ar buile agus tuigim cén fáth. Ní thuigeann daoine bochta ná teaghlaigh faoi strus na rudaí a tharla an tseachtain seo ná leis an CRC agus carthanachtaí eile. These citizens are especially fearful because they feel the public will become sceptical - the public do have the right to be - about giving money to a charity which uses these moneys to pay already well-paid officials. This is evidence of cronyism at its worst. What is also striking is that these elites believe they are entitled to these large payments. This is not just confined to the charities sector but exists across every sector. This is a toxic mix which has been in this State for a long time. The can of worms has only slightly been opened up so far. I believe we are going to see more of these types of revelations. We need to tell and assure the people this will be sorted and fixed. However, it cannot be fixed in the piecemeal way the Government is going about it. There is evidence there has been no regulation of charities or most other sectors since the State was established. Human nature being what it is, especially in a post-colonial society like this, and with the absence of transparency, accountability and regulation in every sector, one will see the abuses, scandals and controversies that have affected us all in recent times. The initial legislation concerning charities regulation was brought forward in 2007, legislated for in 2009 but never implemented. The Government has been in office for three years but has simply sat on it.
 Níl rud ar bith déanta acu. When Deputy Mac Lochlainn asked the Minister in February 2012 why the Government had not implemented the Bill, he was told it could not be done as there were too many financial and staffing difficulties, so the Act had to be deferred. The Minister also claimed that it was not the fact that charities were devoid of oversight. While I appreciate and applaud some of the steps the Minister has taken, the oversight referred to by him has been woefully inadequate. The culture of jobs for the boys, of golden circles and of elites has to be tackled. This recession will go. My main fear all the time, however, is that the fat cats, who never had a recession in the first place, will still be in charge when the recession is over. They will re-invent themselves, re-circle while the ordinary punters, whose kids have had to go to America, bear the brunt of the recession or, like in the case of my friend, Donnacha Rynne, be confined to bed for a year because a wheelchair is not available due to no money. A starting point in tackling this would be the speedy and full implementation of the Charities Act. I do not buy the Government backbenchers’ claim that they have to wait for the human rights issue to be dealt with. That is not appropriate. We already know what piecemeal approaches bring to us. A recent survey found one in five charities is facing a 10% dip in donations, even before the CRC scandal. It must be borne in mind that these charities are providing services which the State should be providing anyway. If the State was based genuinely on republican core values, these citizens with disabilities would have society shaped, ordered and organised to allow them to have the fullest life possible. It will only get worse if the Government keeps bringing in cuts and the public stops giving to charities because of the recent scandals. I praise the charities made up of people who deeply care for the causes in which they are involved. Their integrity, honesty, generosity and their honour have been besmirched by those in the leadership of some of these agencies. Will the Minister reflect on this debate? It is above party politics. Will the Minister accept the regulation of charities needs to be dealt with now fully? Deputy Mac Lochlainn’s Bill is about achieving that.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	570	Tonight’s Bill gives all Members an opportunity to address what is wrong with charities in this State. More importantly, it provides the means to bring about reform and to improve the climate that is facing the charity sector. I believe there is general agreement right across the benches in that regard. Since the financial crash, the charity and community sector has faced an avalanche of cuts and the lack of regulation in this area for so long has brought about some high-profile organisations' use and abuse of the private donations they receive. While most organisations do fantastic work, the shocking revelations about some organisations will be extremely damaging to the entire sector. The high wages the chief executive officers of some voluntary organisations have been paying themselves are appalling for most people in Irish society. It seems like an awful and persistent hangover from the so-called Celtic tiger days and has created a grand canyon between donors and those organisations they traditionally supported. This fear, coupled with the poor economic state, means that high-profile and well-run charities are struggling to meet rising demand with falling donations. The greedy actions of a few are a brutal betrayal of all those who donate to an organisation, as well as of those who work in the front-line services that the charity sector provides. The most outraged over these recent scandals are the common man and woman who donate to these organisations or those who work in this sector. Moreover, many organisations in this sector have been calling for regulation for years, as charities have been unregulated since the foundation of the State. As speakers have stated over the past two nights, the Charities Act 2009, which would create a charities regulatory authority to ensure greater accountability and transparency in the sector, is urgently needed. This Bill before Members would re-introduce the advancement of human rights argued for by the sector but excluded by the Fianna Fáil-led Government when it brought forward the Charities Act 2009. It also specifies a date, namely, 31 May, for the full enforcement and enactment of all provisions of the 2009 Act. As Sinn Féin’s spokesperson on foreign affairs, I have seen at first hand the life-changing work Irish charities and non-governmental organisations, NGOs, do both on this island and in some of the most impoverished places around the world. Ireland is well known for its commitment to overseas aid and development and has a hard-won badge as a world leader in this sector. This is directly linked to the hard work of the NGOs and charities, as well as through the consistent generous donations of Irish people. The vast majority of these organisations are self-regulating and their commitment to accountability and transparency is due to their own commitment to providing the most effective aid and assistance programmes. For example, in 1993 a selection of Irish NGOs came together to form Dóchas, which provides these NGOs with a forum for consultation and co-operation and helps them to speak with a single voice on development issues. It also helps the NGOs to become more transparent and accountable and works towards ensuring that organisations in this sector follow the highest standards of practice. In fact, Dóchas members are fully compliant with the Accounting and Reporting by Charities: Statement of Recommended Practice, SORP, standards. While the SORP standards are British regulations and have no jurisdiction outside Britain, many Irish charities have voluntarily adopted them in order to follow respected practices in accounting and reporting and, most particularly, to satisfy their many stakeholders in this regard. While their voluntary commitment to these practices definitely is to be welcomed, there also must be Government legislation across the charity sector to ensure the highest standards of practices and accountability. Lest Members forget, this is a huge sector, with more than 8,000 charities registered in this State employing more than 100,000 people. Moreover, as other speakers have noted, the sector has an estimated turnover of €5.7 billion a year. Consequently, any regulation needs to be transparent and fit for purpose. It cannot be done on the cheap or because of recent scandals that the Committee of Public Accounts has helped to uncover. The passing of legislation to regulate this sector and the establishment of a charity regulator must be financed, must have actual authority and, most importantly, must have independence. One reason this sector is so big is because of consecutive Governments' disastrous record in health care, social protection, housing provision, poverty reduction and inequality in Irish society, and the lack of rights-based legislation. Nelson Mandela, who is badly missed, once stated: “Overcoming poverty is not a task of charity. It is an act of justice.” It would be well for all Members to reflect on this. They must regulate the charity sector but also must start to meet the basic needs and the realisation of their own citizens. This is the key. People are rightfully angry and many are worn out from trying to access services for loved ones. That debate has been heard in this Chamber many times. They are exhausted from filling out forms to get basic services for their children or family members. I believe the Bill being debated tonight will improve transparency as well as bringing clarity and new thinking to this sector. Most importantly, it will shine a light on those charlatans and parasites who are exploiting the goodwill and generosity of Irish people.

Ceist tábhacht agus ceist atá i mbéal an phobail mar gheall ar an méid atá le cloisteáil i gcoistí an Oireachtais, sna páipéir, sna meáin agus an rud atá ag tarlú sa CRC agus áiteanna eile. Níl dabht ar bith go bhfuil dóigh níos fearr de dhíth faoi choinne cultúr níos foirfe ná a bhí ann go dtí seo ó thaobh na ngrúpaí carthanachta. Tá na grúpaí carthanachta ag iarraidh go mbeadh níos mó freagrachta ann, go mbeadh an reachtaíocht i bhfeidhm agus tá an pobal ag tabhairt tacaíochta leis sin. Caithfear an tAcht ó 2009 a chur i bhfeidhm go huile is go hiomlán. An sprioc atá ag Sinn Féin ná go mbeadh reachtaíocht de chuid an Teachta Mac Lochlainn i bhfeidhm. Cuirim fáilte roimh an méid a bhí le rá ag an Aire go mbeadh rialóir ann roimh an Cháisc. Sin páirt amháin ach tá cuid mhaith eile de dhíth. Mar a chítear sa reachtaíocht atá os ár gcomhair anocht, bhí bearnaí ann ó thaobh reachtaíochta de i 2009, go háirithe ó thaobh grúpaí a bhí ag obair ar son chearta daonna. Ba chóir é sin a cheartú agus is féidir é sin a dhéanamh trí thacaíocht a thabhairt don reachtaíocht seo. There undoubtedly is a need for a more accountable culture, for which both the charities and the public are calling out. The Act of 2009 must be implemented and this Bill would force the Government to so do. While an unimplemented Act is of no use to anyone, I welcome the commitment given by the Government that a charities regulator will be established by Easter. However, this comprises only part of the solution, and the adoption of the legislation that has been drafted by Deputy Mac Lochlainn on behalf of the Sinn Féin party would be a welcome and major step towards bringing accountability to this culture. The charity sector is a large one and does some excellent work, but like all large sectors in the economy it needs regulation to be effective and to prevent it from being abused. However, unlike other large sectors, such as the banking sector in particular, there is no resistance from the charities sector towards regulation - indeed, the charities are demanding it. The sooner the Act is implemented in full, the better for all. The inclusion of human rights work as an eligible charitable function is worthy of everyone's support. Its omission from the Act must be rectified and I believe this Bill deserves the support of every Deputy in the Chamber this evening. This debate is being held in the context of an almighty scandal that has been revealed in the media through committees of this House and which has gripped public attention in respect of what has been going on in some sections of the charitable sector. I say "some" because it is unfortunate that the fall-out from the scandal has affected all charities and the great work many of them have done. Moreover, it has affected those who depend on the work of those charities. The public was quite rightly shocked by the revelations that emerged regarding the culture of excessive pay and top-ups prevalent at the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC.I have heard from all sides of this House, commentators, Independents and those from political parties right up to Cabinet level saying this should not have happened and that Mr. Kiely should return the money that was paid to him. It is worth noting that some of that money no longer resides with Mr. Kiely because some of it was taxable and the Revenue collected approximately €130,000 of Mr. Kiely's €740,000 pay-off. It would be an important step for the Government to indicate tonight that the money collected by the Friends and Supporters of the CRC, which was never intended to line Mr. Kiely's pockets or the coffers of the Revenue, should be returned to the Friends and Supporters of the CRC so the services for which they raised that money can continue to be provided. It would be a small step but it would be a first step for us towards trying to recoup the overall costs of the diversion of that much needed charitable fund-raising money to an area where it should never have gone. It would be welcome if the Minister were to announce such an initiative tonight. The CRC debacle points to a larger problem of poor corporate governance, an unhealthy culture in some bodies and undoubtedly to a cosy golden circle of appointees close to certain political parties. TASC has published detailed research on the need for a more transparent system of public appointments. Its 2010 report, Mapping the Golden Circle, shows in detail how a cosy consensus exists and how corporate governance is in need of drastic modernisation and improvement. That report showed that in the heyday of the Celtic tiger, among 40 of Ireland's largest companies a "director network" of 39 individuals held multiple directorships on at least two boards across 33 of the 40 companies examined. These represented one in 14 of the total group of directors serving on these boards during the period under review. Even now this culture prevails. As we have seen with the banks there is a persistent and obscene culture of high pay among executives and, in the case of the banks, no political desire to rock the boat. There is still a lack of diversity in the executive levels. Very few women are breaking through the glass ceiling and governance suffers as a result. Another issue is individuals holding multiple directorships across companies or bodies. Each of these issues must be tackled head on and a proper republican culture of merit should win through. That is the challenge before us, and this Government should support this Bill as a small first step. We must end the old boys' club in every aspect of our society. A rotten culture of cronyism has been allowed develop and has been left unchallenged for far too long. Again I ask the Minister to instruct the Revenue to return the €130,000 bagged by it from Mr. Kiely's top-up and pay it back to the Friends and Supporter of the CRC. Nobody in this House believes that payment was right and it definitely should not have come from people who were out on the streets collecting for services.

Throughout the history of this State charitable and voluntary organisations have been instrumental and central to the provision of essential services and supports. These works have served both the wider population and smaller groups of people with special needs not served by the State. This State has always been in deficit when it comes to meeting the needs of its people whether in education, health care or even the social safety net that keeps food in the cupboard and a roof over one's head. Charitable organisations have stepped into this breach and done work the State would not do. In a better world, much of the work of charities would be provided by the State rendering some groups much less necessary. Unfortunately, the State has exploited charitable organisations to shirk its duties. This State owes charities quite a debt in some respects. One such debt is the proper regulation of charities to ensure as long as charity is needed that good charities thrive and bad ones wither. In my brief as Sinn Féin spokesperson on housing I see the great work done by organisations like Simon, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Focus Ireland, the Peter McVerry Trust and many others. They serve hot meals to those who have been left with nothing. As Government policy throws people out on the street they have bent over backwards to accommodate more people. Groups like these are operating at maximum capacity but still are trying to improve. They have in recent years stepped up fund-raising to support this. I doubt anyone did not encounter someone raising money for one of these groups over the Christmas period. They deserve to be trusted and this recent scandal has hurt them and other worthy causes. We like to repeat the line that Ireland is a very charitable country and this is true but we are a country sick and tired of cronyism and people lining their pockets. It is especially galling to see people living the high life on money raised to support children with disabilities. It is especially galling when the people doing it are linked to a party which brought this country to its knees and caused so much recent hardship to families dealing with disabilities. Those who are found to have misappropriated or misused funds should as much as possible be made to feel the full force of the law. This is not just the right thing for these wrong-doings but the right way to try to rebuild confidence in the public so they can donate without fear of their money being wasted on top-ups and foreign getaways. The CRC, a really fine organisation which has helped so many people, has been damaged by the actions of these few people and we must ensure that kind of behaviour is stamped out for once and all. The needs of service users must come first. The Minister for Health and the HSE need to assess how the CRC can be reformed to provide services and make the best use of public money to win back public trust. The Irish people are shocked and disgusted at the greed and the gross abuse of trust at executive level in the CRC. It begs the question how the board could allow this and think nothing is wrong. It is not lost on them that people with physical disabilities are struggling to get access to vital therapies and other services. The entire management and structure of the CRC needs to be reviewed and changed to ensure every cent is directed towards the provision of services. In my area we have a fantastic organisation which works with and for people with disabilities and their families. The work they do and the help and support they provide makes the difference to families between living and just barely surviving. In the last five years, €12.3 million has been cut from the funding of St. Michael's House. This has dramatically reduced the service's ability to cater to the needs of people with intellectual disabilities and their families. They continue to do great work but each year they have had to cut their cloth closer and closer. They have done all they can to save money but are still being asked to do more with less. The money thrown away by the unscrupulous people at the top of the CRC or the doctors at top levels in public hospitals would have gone a long way to helping the families of St. Michael's House. That money might have helped to stop the reductions in staffing levels; outsourcing of its residential and respite service; closure of the service one Sunday of every month; cessation of rent subsidy in residential services; cessation of paying trainee allowances; reduction in transport meaning staff and families have to provide their own; moratorium on offering new residential places or long-term placement in respite beds; and reduction in day services for school and training centre leavers from 2013. When we make changes, we take an extra holiday away from a well-paid person who is supposed to be doing a public service. When we allow it to continue, we are denying essential services to people who need them most. The sad part of this is that people, staff, volunteers and donors are demoralised and badly wounded. We must give confidence back to all by putting in place the proper regulations to ensure this does not happen again.It is difficult to understand the mindset of people, not just in charities but in society in general, who believe they have a God-given right to earn huge wages, receive massive bonuses and have gold-plated pensions. It is high time some semblance of reality was brought to bear on these people. I commend all those in many of our charities who have worked tirelessly to deliver the services we have today. That is the reason this Bill should be supported by everyone, irrespective of political affiliation. Go raibh maith agaibh. Táim ag lorg tacaíochta ó ghach pháirtí sa Teach.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	573	I am pleased to address the House on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality. On behalf of the Minister, I thank all who have taken part in the debate on this important matter. The need to strengthen the regulation of the charitable sector has been impressed on all of us by the recent disturbing revelations regarding the use of charitable funds at the Central Remedial Clinic. In the course of addressing the Bill introduced by Deputy Mac Lochlainn, the Minister set out yesterday his plans for the establishment of a charities regulatory authority under the provisions of the Charities Act 2009. This week, he will issue a call for expressions of interest for membership of the board of the new authority with a view to filling board positions before Easter. Sanction has been received from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to fill the position of CEO of the new authority and a number of other administrative posts on an interim basis from within existing resources. Arrangements are in hand to fill these posts by the end of February. A key focus of the new authority in its initial phase of operation will be the preparation for publication of a new comprehensive statutory register of charities. This register, together with the reporting provisions of the Act that will apply to registered charities, will provide the essential infrastructure to strengthen transparency and accountability across the sector. Many contributors to this debate have highlighted how important it is that charity funds are used efficiently and to the benefit of the work of the charity. Donors to charities have a right to know how their donations are being used and to feel confident that they are being used for the purpose for which they were given. This is a sentiment wholeheartedly shared by the Government and, I am sure, every Member of this House. It is crucial that we have full transparency in regard to the accounting and use of charity funds, whatever their origin. While there is some level of oversight in the area, a complete regulatory architecture will be in place only when the Charities Act is fully implemented. The Charities Act provides that each registered charity must provide a report each year to the charities regulatory authority on its activities. The authority will make these reports available to the public. This measure will represent a tangible increase in the transparency of the charity sector and will help donors to make informed decisions about the charities they support. We have all been shocked by the disclosures about the use of charity funds by the Central Remedial Clinic. We are all agreed that such a situation should never be repeated. We are all concerned at reports of the impact these disclosures have had on donations to charity. I agree with those contributors who said that not all charities abuse their position. The majority of charities provide worthwhile services and they ensure that donations go directly to the people for whom they are intended. It is unfortunate that the few that do not have such a negative impact on the other charities. Undoubtedly, many well run charities are experiencing the adverse effects of this scandal. Trust and confidence in our charities has been damaged and must be rebuilt. It is incumbent on each of us as leaders in our community to ensure this trust is rebuilt. The key thing the Government can do to help with this task is to put in place the necessary structures to implement the Charities Act as it stands and as set out before the House yesterday by the Minister for Justice and Equality. For the reasons given by the Minister yesterday evening, the Government will oppose this Bill, but that is not to say the Bill was frivolous or not worth debating. It was well worth debating. In saying this, however, the Minister has asked me to state that he appreciates the opportunity given by Deputy Mac Lochlainn in tabling this Bill for Members of the House to address the real concerns that have arisen with regard to certain charities and afford to Members of the House an opportunity to address recent revelations. Almost every Sinn Féin speaker here has suggested somehow or other that the disability sector - the sector of which I have most knowledge - is solely dependent on charitable donations, but that is not true. This State gives €6.4 billion of taxpayers' moneys to disability services in this country.

This money is provided for the delivery of services to people with disabilities. What people give in charitable donations serves as a top-up to those services, but not to the CEOs. This distinction was not made by some charities. There is a way for charities to ensure there is greater transparency. I do not understand why boards do not include service users or those who represent them. This should be part and parcel of what they do. We should insist that this happens and I have endeavoured to do this with all boards I have appointed.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-01-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	576	I commend my colleague Deputy Mac Lochlainn on his introduction of this Bill, which adds our party's voice to the demand that Government regulate the charity sector. I agree with the Minister of State that, undoubtedly, the majority of charities act properly. Even in those cases in which board members or executives have been found wanting, the staff providing the services within those charities have also acted properly and take great pride in the service they deliver, in the case of the Central Remedial Clinic, to people with disabilities. However, it should not have taken a scandal such as that of the CRC or the exposure of top-up payments to hospital and agency chiefs to spur the Government or the previous one into action. I cannot understand why Government parties intend to vote against our Bill this evening, as it simply calls for the full implementation of the 2009 legislation. Last night, the Minister for Justice and Equality described the Charities Act as an important legislative milestone in this State but, to be blunt, until its provisions are implemented, the Charities Act is not worth the paper on which it is written. The term "legislative milestone" may sound good in this Chamber, but unless a legislative milestone is converted into action, it means little to the outside world. The Minister has cited costs as a barrier to implementing the Act in full. I put it to Government Deputies that they and we cannot afford not to implement the Charities Act 2009 in full. I do not understand why Governments must wait until things go belly-up, whether in regard to the care of our most vulnerable citizens of the spending of public moneys on them, before putting the necessary checks and balances into the system. Why must public confidence be rocked to its core and untold damage done before it steps up to the plate? I am interested in hearing from the Government the full cost of implementing the 2009 legislation. Let us have the figures. What is the annual saving to the State due to not implementing the legislation in full? If there truly is a concern in regard to cost, let the Government come to us with the figures and let us have that debate. I believe this House could and should send a message tonight to citizens that we hear their outrage and their hurt. We should stand together united in our commitment that the 2009 legislation will be implemented in full. Last week, the Committee of Public Accounts learned that €700,000 from the funds of the Friends and Supporters of the CRC, gathered by charitable donation, was used to top up the pension pot of the former CEO.The golden handshake in this case was approved by the board under what seemed to be a cloud of secrecy. The former chairman of the Central Remedial Clinic, Mr. Hamilton Goulding, stated in an interview over the weekend he had been unable to cut Mr. Kiely's annual salary of €240,000. I find this an astonishing statement and further evidence that the scandal at the CRC, like the public's outrage, runs much deeper than originally anticipated. Initially the investigation of the Committee of Public Accounts revolved around compliance by the Central Remedial Clinic and other section 38 agencies with public pay policy. What we uncovered, despite efforts to mislead the committee, was a systemic culture of entitlement of the few to the detriment and at the cost of the many. What we have learned to date is truly shocking, but let it be said what we have yet to uncover may prove worse. We do not know as yet. My office has been inundated with e-mails, calls and letters from citizens throughout the country who are angry, upset and really hurt by the revelations about the CRC. I am sure it is the same for other Deputies. Charities have consistently called for regulation of the sector and the Government's refusal to do so has compounded the sense of hurt and outrage. It is the families who rely on the services of organisations such as the CRC who are most devastated by the revelations. The scandal exposes fundamental faults in how the State delivers non-acute health supports and services to citizens; therefore, it is not simply a matter of public pay policy. It is about good governance, ethics, organisational culture and the role and responsibility of management. It seems that in many instances since the foundation of the State successive Governments have looked to others to do their job for them, be it in education, health or housing. For decades the Establishment parties have outsourced the care of citizens. With the religious orders of old or the modern manifestation of section 38 and 39 agencies, the State has actively sought to put responsibility for these services at arm's length. We have learned that money was paid out without the accountability associated with direct State provision. It is timely for a substantive debate on how the Government takes on this very obvious faultline in the public health system, in particular. We need to be clear that the CRC is not the end of the story. In fact, it may prove just to be the beginning. The information brought forward in the Dáil last night by the Minister for Justice and Equality on the Rehab Group was very troubling. It requires a considered response from the group's board and management, not the type of knee-jerk and deeply inadequate statement issued by Rehab this morning. At this stage we cannot and should not take a conclusive view of management's or the board's probity. However, information already in the public domain should give us real cause for concern. This evening the Committee of Public Accounts, on foot of the information made available by the Minister, has written to Rehab, the Department of Justice and Equality and the HSE seeking further information. Speaking recently, Ms Angela Kerins, CEO of Rehab, argued that she was not subject to HSE pay ceilings and cited the fact that 60% of the group's activities were commercial, as they are. She subsequently refused to give details of her salary package. Based on the information in the public domain on the issue of pay, it seems Rehab is walking two roads at the same time, which seems to be a theme in many of these agencies. Rehab's income for 2012 was €183 million, one third of which came from public moneys, with another 10% from charitable sources. Ms Kerins cannot have things both ways. Rehab Group management has actively sought to adhere to public sector pay policy but only when it comes to cutting the pay of staff working in the organisation. In early 2010 Rehab cut workers' pay in line with the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act. The case made its way to the Labour Court where Rehab management argued very vigorously that the group had clear links with public service rates of pay and pay movements. When it comes to the staff of Rehab, management applies public sector pay policy or seeks to do so but not when it comes to the pay of the CEO. This troubles me and it is a question we need to raise with it. We have heard much in recent times - certainly at the hearings with the CRC at the Committee of Public Accounts - which points to a culture or sense of entitlement among some in society, not least some of those who serve on these boards. As the Minister stated, people make donations to charity in good faith. They do so as an act of human solidarity with others and donations, however large or small, must go towards the purposes for which they were intended. I agree with the Minister that trust and confidence in charities have been hugely damaged and need to be rebuilt. The Minister of State has told us that the Government cannot afford to implement the Charities Bill in full, but to this Sinn Féin states it cannot afford not to do so.

I am very disappointed and it is a missed opportunity that it will not be incorporated into the Charities Act 2009. The reasons given are to do with technical issues for Revenue, but every year the Finance Act introduces a range of technical changes to deal with issues such as this; therefore, it is doable if there was the will to do it. Yesterday the Minister spoke about the five year review built into the Act, but we have waited five years for the Act to be implemented. It will not be implemented this year and is suggested it could be another five years before human rights will be incorporated. That is not acceptable. I must remind the Minister of State that her colleague, Deputy Joe Costello, is now the Minister of State with responsibility for trade and development and promoting Ireland's track record in human rights. He works with organisations in advancing human rights in Ireland and abroad, particularly abroad, and deals with our overseas aid, of which we are very proud. Per capita we are among the top countries in the world. How can we not include the advancement of human rights in the definition of charitable purposes when one considers all of this? In 2009 the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello, enthusiastically argued for the inclusion of human rights in the Bill, but now the Labour Party will vote against this Bill, about which I am disappointed. I do not want to turn it into a big disgrace issue, but I am disappointed and believe the Minister of State knows this is not right. The President, Michael D. Higgins, a man with a huge reputation in promoting human rights, someone of whom we are all very proud and who is internationally renowned and respected, as one can see when he visits various countries representing Ireland, also argued in favour of the inclusion of human rights in the definition of charitable purposes. I do not understand why the amendment cannot be accepted.The idea of regulating the charity sector did not come about in 2009. Those who have served in the House for a long time know the debate has taken place for many years. One Fine Gael Member recalled debating the issue in 2003. We know for a long time that this needs to happen and that the charity sector is not adequately regulated. However, there was considerable consultation with the charity sector prior to the publication of the Charities Bill in 2009 and it finally seemed that there would be regulation. The then Government dragged its feet for cost reasons and regulation did not happen. The current Government also did not proceed with it for cost reasons. That was a huge mistake. I fervently believe we would not be debating the CRC and the Rehab Group debacle if that had been done. The Minister chose to put on record matters of profound concern during this debate. I reiterate the calls on those running the Rehab Group to answer questions. They may well have satisfactory explanations regarding what was revealed and I hope they do but they need to answer these questions and restore people's faith. The Government parties have dragged their feet and there is a crisis in the charity sector. As many Members said, more importantly, this is about our most vulnerable citizens, including the elderly and disabled and those who are sick or ill. All of us have supported charities. They are being damaged by the actions of a few. If regulation had been in place, those actions would not have happened. While it is highly unlikely, I ask the Government to seriously support our Bill. The Minister suggested his Bill could be implemented towards the end of 2014. We should be clear that the legislation is not only about a charities regulator; it is also about a register of charities, the charities appeal tribunal and the consultative panels. A range of infrastructure is required to implement this legislation and not just a regulator.

We will pursue this legislation until it is enacted to make sure all of us send a message to the public that the days of the CRC golden handshakes and the other issues that emerged are over and they can have full confidence in the sector to represent them again. I hope that even at the last minute the Government will seriously consider supporting the Bill. There is no good reason to vote it down other than it was tabled by Sinn Féin. I do not understand that because that is not right.
