#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Prior to the summer recess, Deputy Brian Hayes, the Fine Gael spokesman on education, asked the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, about the withdrawal of facilities for Protestant fee-paying schools.  He raised this again yesterday in the Dáil.  The Protestant Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. John Neil, raised this matter at his diocesan synod.  I understand the facility was made available to fee-paying Protestant schools by the late Donogh O'Malley, for very good reasons, when free education was introduced.  All Governments since then have treated the Protestant fee-paying schools fairly, as stated by Archbishop Neil yesterday.The Minister for Education and Science has wandered into stormy waters that could be very controversial.  Will the Taoiseach state why advice on this matter was sought from the Attorney General given that the system in place operated without any difficulty for the past 40 years?  Will he confirm what question was asked of the Attorney General?  It appears as if the Minister for Education and Science is saying in his responses to Deputy Brian Hayes that the payment to Protestant fee-paying schools has been unconstitutional in all the years for which it has been made available.  Who sought advice from the Attorney General and what question was asked?  Does the Taoiseach believe the system that has been in place for 40 years is unconstitutional?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1	This Government, like all its predecessors, is anxious to support minority schools, faith schools and the Protestant community generally.  That is our intention at all times.  The block grant remains in place and there is no question of its having been removed.  It applies to those attending Protestant fee-charging schools and we continue to provide the support.  It is a targeted support for individual members of the Protestant community wishing to attend Protestant second level schools.The issue in question arose in regard to the withdrawal of an ancillary grant last year as part of the measures the Minister had to consider in the context of limited resources.  Since last November, he has made it clear to the education committee of the Church of Ireland that he would like to hear from it on the issue of how those schools in rural areas that require support can be targeted, while acknowledging at the same time that there are well-established schools in more urban areas that draw from a wide catchment, similar to Catholic fee-paying schools.  It is a question of hearing from the education committee as to how we can better target those schools that require financial support in the interest of maintaining the Protestant ethos in our education system, which we all welcome.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	2	The Taoiseach did not answer my question.  I asked who sought the Attorney General's advice and what question he was asked.  The solution is to reinstate the grant, as pointed out by Deputy Brian Hayes yesterday.  The block grant is irrelevant to the issue.Today's The Irish Times quotes Archbishop Neil’s remarks at yesterday’s diocesan synod where he stated, “It was driven by what amounts to a very determined and doctrinaire effort within the Department of Education and Science to strike at a sector which some officials totally failed to understand.”  Furthermore, he stated, “It is only now that what was once seen as realism in relation to different and complex situations is being described simply as ‘an anomaly’.”  He also made the point that previous governments had treated these schools in a fair manner and that the same cannot be said of the present Fianna Fáil-Green Party coalition. The Taoiseach’s Minister for Education and Science has caused this problem.I understand from the Department of Finance that it is not a question of the extra grants for the fee-paying Protestant schools but of the fact that the Department of Education and Science lost its case against Protestant schools last year.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	4	The schools were told they would be got at by the Department of Education and Science.  The Taoiseach has direct responsibility for Northern Ireland relations and for good relations between all the churches.  These are issues we discuss in the House occasionally.  This is a matter in respect of which the Taoiseach should step in, overrule the Minister for Education and Science, who has made an almighty mess of the matter, and reinstate the grants, as Deputy Hayes pointed out yesterday.  We do not want claims of sectarianism or discrimination or upheaval considering that the Protestant ethos in this Republic has been recognised and the Protestant minority has been treated fairly by all Governments since the late Donogh O'Malley introduced his free education scheme.  This is an issue with which the Taoiseach can deal this morning.  In his reply, he can state he will instruct the Minister for Education and Science to restore to fee-paying Protestant schools the grants that have been allocated to them for the past 40 years.  It is not an issue concerning the Department of Finance but one of a mood and environment within the Department of Education and Science resulting in an effort to get at Protestant schools.  I do not support that and neither should the Taoiseach.  I would like him to deal with it now.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I fundamentally disagree with Deputy Kenny.  I do not attach mal fides to anyone in this matter.  The Minister has indicated that he is conscious that Protestant schools in rural areas may be in a different financial position from larger schools in Dublin.  He reiterated yesterday in this House his invitation to the Archbishop and the schools concerned to come forward with proposals——

He is committed to progressing such proposals in a helpful way.  To ascribe mal fides, in the way the Deputy has done, is not responsible or accurate.  It is a question of dealing with the issue in a substantive way, recognising that some schools require continuing assistance, which the Minister is anxious to facilitate on the basis of a targeted initiative, and that there are other well-established schools whose needs might not be so great.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	12	A report in today's Irish Independent states that the number of children on hospital waiting lists is increasing and that the number of children who have been waiting for six months or more for procedures has gone up from 1,709 last December to 1,830.  Everyone is agreed that there is a shortage of public hospital beds.  There is disagreement as to how they are to be provided and some disagreement as to the number required.  However, there is general agreement that there is a shortage.In July 2005, the Minister for Health and Children issued an instruction to the HSE to enter into co-location arrangements for the provision of beds.  Sites on the grounds of public hospitals would be made available to property developers, tax incentives would be provided for the construction of private hospitals and those private hospitals would provide 1,000 beds, thereby releasing an equivalent number in the public system.  There were, originally, to be ten co-located hospitals.  In the programme for Government negotiated in 2008 we were told that the Government would implement the plan for co-located facilities because it represented the quickest and most effective way of ensuring that public capacity was increased and ring-fenced.  In May 2008, when I questioned the Taoiseach about this, he wrote to me and stated that approved bidder status had been approved for six of the hospitals and it was expected that project agreements would be signed shortly for three others.  In other words, there were to be nine hospitals.In the programme for Government re-negotiated recently between Fianna Fáil and the Green Party this has been scaled back.  The new programme states that the Government will proceed with the current programme of co-location limited to already committed projects under existing project contractual agreements.  We know from replies to parliamentary questions that contractual agreements have been signed for four hospitals.  The revised programme for Government has scaled back the number of co-located hospitals from nine to four.First, if the number of co-located hospitals has been reduced from nine to four, how many hospital beds will be provided?  The original idea was that 1,000 would be provided.  Second, when will construction work begin on the four hospitals?  Third, when will we see the first of the beds promised by the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, in July 2005, when she said the purpose of co-location was to fast-track the provision of hospital beds?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I do not have information specifically relating to this question, of which I did not have notice.  I can contact the Deputy in due course and clarify many of the issues he raises. I do not accept that it is the universal view that there are insufficient beds in the system.  What is needed is the utilisation of those beds to best effect.  We have seen a big increase in the number of day cases and the length of stay of people requiring surgery has been shortening.  Utilisation of existing bed places and greater efficiency and effectiveness has seen an increase in workload in our hospital system.A report by the ESRI, published today, projects a significant increase in the demand for health care in Ireland, based upon demographic factors.  It points out that shifting appropriate treatments from an in-patient to a day-case basis and moving activity which is more appropriate to primary care out of acute hospitals are some of the reforms currently taking place and which must be advanced.I can obtain specific information for the Deputy in the next few hours.  With regard to the general issue of co-location, the whole purpose was to facilitate bringing beds which had been designated as private into the public system by co-locating a private bed complement on co-located sites.The traditional means of public procurement is also slow.  There have been complications with regard to the co-location initiative coming on stream because of the problem in the banking system.  There is also the question of ensuring that we proceed with those for which planning permission has been granted and on the basis of finance being provided.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	14	I appreciate that the Taoiseach did not have advance notice of my question, but this subject should be familiar to him.  One of the central issues in the last general election was that of hospital beds.  There was a debate about the number of beds required.  The country was full of posters giving the respective figures.  There was also a debate about how they were to be provided.The solution in the programme for Government was to increase the number of dedicated public hospital beds by 1,500 and to provide 1,000 of those through the co-located hospital scheme.  The original number of planned co-located hospitals was nine.  This dropped to four in the recently revised programme for Government.  How many hospital beds does the Government now intend to provide?  Until now it has been accepted as 1,000 and there was a formula for that figure.  Four co-located hospitals cannot provide 1,000 beds, which were to have been provided by nine.Second, what is happening to the co-location arrangement?  When will the four hospitals be built and when will we see a bed produced?  The HSE was reluctant to go down this road but the Minister for Health and Children instructed the HSE that this was the Government's route.  She justified her instruction by saying it would fast-track the provision of hospital beds.  That was more than four years ago.  We still have not provided a bed and there is no sign of these hospitals being built.  Now, under the revised programme for Government, the number of such hospitals is being reduced from nine to four.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	22	Those co-located hospitals for which there is project agreement, subject to planning permission and the availability of finance, will proceed.  The question of existing bed complements is not a static situation.  Efficiencies have been and are being achieved by an increase in the number of day-cases and shorter stays by patients in surgical units.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 12, inclusive, together.Together with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Micheál Martin, I met with Gerry Adams, Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness and representatives from Sinn Féin on 8 July last.  I then met with Mark Durkan, Minister Margaret Ritchie and their SDLP colleagues on 9 July.  At these meetings we discussed recent developments and in particular progress on the devolution of policing and justice and the marching season as well as the positive outcome of the NSMC plenary meeting which took place on 6 July.  Following that meeting I had discussions with First Minister, Peter Robinson, over lunch.  I have already replied to questions in this House on the NSMC plenary.I had a number of telephone conversations with Prime Minister Brown in recent days and weeks in the context of the ongoing situation on the devolution of policing and justice.  The Minister, Deputy Martin, also met with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Shaun Woodward, on 7 October to discuss the issue and they met again this week.Our officials are keeping in regular contact with the Northern Ireland parties, the Northern Ireland Office and No. 10 Downing Street.  There was a further meeting between First Minister Robinson, Deputy First Minister McGuinness and Prime Minister Brown last night in Downing Street.I am heartened by the successful outcome to those discussions.  I understand that a financial package to support devolution of policing and justice was agreed and will be published later today.  The First and Deputy First Ministers have indicated that they will consult with their colleagues and other parties on the package, as well as having further talks between themselves to resolve any remaining issues.At my meeting with US Secretary of State, Ms Hillary Clinton, in Farmleigh on 11 October our discussions focused on current developments in Northern Ireland and the importance of supporting the Northern Ireland parties in moving forward on the devolution of policing and justice.  We both welcomed the progress made in discussions between Prime Minister Brown and the First and Deputy First Ministers in recent weeks.  There was also a shared emphasis on the need to promote economic development in Northern Ireland, as well as building up the all-island economy as a key element of economic recovery.  I thanked Secretary of State Clinton for her steadfast personal attention to the issue of Northern Ireland and her continued friendship for Ireland.I met with Sir Hugh Orde in Government Buildings on 27 July.  He formally completed his term as Chief Constable of the PSNI on 31 August.  I thanked Sir Hugh for the contribution he made to policing in Northern Ireland and wished him well in his new role as president of the Association of Chief Police Officers.  I take this opportunity to wish his successor, Matt Baggott, well in his new role.On 15 October I addressed the North-South Consultative Conference in Farmleigh.  The conference was attended by the social partners, North and South, along with other members of civil society.  There was a wide-ranging discussion on the contribution that civil society can make to supporting the process.The next meeting of the British-Irish Council will take place on 13 November in Jersey.  At the meeting we will focus discussion on the current global economic crisis as well as the theme of minority languages.  The next plenary meeting of the NSMC will take place on 14 December in Northern Ireland and I expect we will have further discussions on the economy at that meeting.  In total, we have had four plenary meetings of the NSMC since May 2007 and another 43 ministerial meetings over the same period.I pay tribute to the important role that Senator Ted Kennedy played over many years in the peace process and more generally to the welfare of this island.  His passing is a great loss for Ireland and the United States.The total amount spent on the MacEntee commission of investigation, which completed its work in March 2007, was €2,632,702.  All costs relating to the commission of investigation have been discharged.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	27	This is the first opportunity in which we have had questions on Northern Ireland since the death of Senator Ted Kennedy.  I join with the Taoiseach in paying tribute to the enormous contribution he made over many decades to bringing about peace in Northern Ireland.  I also pay tribute to Mark Durkan who since we last had questions in the House on Northern Ireland has announced his intention to resign as leader of the SDLP.  I pay tribute to the work he has done both in that capacity and in his earlier work with the SDLP.Specifically on the devolution of policing and justice matters, can the Taoiseach give the House any more information than he outlined in his opening reply?  He mentioned he has been having discussions with Prime Minister Brown.  I understand that Prime Minister Brown is to announce a financial package in the near future.  There has been some speculation that he would do so today.  Does the Taoiseach have any information in regard to that and was he involved in any way in discussions on the preparation of that package?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	28	As I said in my reply there have been a number of meetings involving both Governments and the Northern Ireland parties in recent weeks.  The main focus of those talks has been the financial package to support the Northern Ireland Executive once devolution of policing and justices has taken place.  The Prime Minister has taken a close personal interest in those discussions and I am grateful to him for those efforts, which I believe have resulted in agreement on an excellent financial package which will be published later today.  I spoke to him by telephone this morning.For their part, the First and Deputy First Ministers and the Northern Ireland parties are in ongoing discussions about issues on which they need to finalise arrangements, including the appointment of a justice Minister and how the new Department and Minister will fit into the existing Executive system in the North.  Legislation to facilitate that has been passed at Westminster and the necessary Northern Ireland legislation is currently working its way through the Assembly and its committee system.In parallel to all of that the First Minister has indicated that he wants to maximise what he has described as community confidence.  The publication later today of the financial package is a major step forward in that regard.  There are a few more steps to be taken before devolution finally takes place but I remain optimistic that it will proceed in the near future.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	29	I welcome the Taoiseach's optimism that the devolution of policing and justice functions will take place in the near future.  Concern has been expressed by the chief commissioner of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission about the delay in publishing a promised consultation document on a bill of rights for Northern Ireland.  That was promised in both the Good Friday Agreement and in the St. Andrew's Agreement.  Has the Taoiseach raised that issue with the British Government?In that context I also wish to ask him about the fears that have been expressed recently by the president of the Irish Human Rights Commission, Maurice Manning, who claims that commission will not be able to continue to exist if its funding is cut further in the budget.  Since the establishment of that body also arose from the Good Friday Agreement, can the Taoiseach offer any hope to it that funding cuts will not threaten its continued existence?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	30	Regarding the bill of rights for Northern Ireland, I reiterate the commitment of the Government to ensure the full and effective implementation of all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrew's Agreement.  In that context we attach importance to a specific bill of rights for Northern Ireland as envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement.  The Government has consistently communicated that position in contacts with the current British Administration and with the Conservative Party Front Bench.The work of the forum on a bill of rights and the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission has made a significant and important contribution to the bill of rights process.  I look forward to the consultation document currently being prepared by the Northern Ireland Office bringing us closer to the enactment of a bill of rights for Northern Ireland.  I would like to see that brought into the public domain as soon as possible.Regarding other issues in our own jurisdiction, no body — however important or august — can regard itself as immune from an exercise in expenditure savings that is necessary for the future development of the country.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I welcome the comment by the INLA some weeks ago that it has confirmed an end to its campaign of violence in Northern Ireland and that shortly it expects to begin decommissioning whatever arms it has.  That is to be welcomed.  There is an increasing threat, however, from dissident forces both North and South of the Border.  I understand that a crime seminar organised on Monday stated that dissident Republicans posed a "severe and increasing threat".  I want the Taoiseach to know that in so far as the Government takes action on this matter it will have the full support of this side of the House in supporting the forces of law and order to deal with any of those dissident threats.My colleague, Deputy Flanagan, our spokesman on justice, recently highlighted efforts that have been made by dissidents to recruit young people in the Republic.  First, does the Taoiseach have a view on the extent of the threat posed by dissident Republicans in view of the seminar on Monday at which it was stated that they posed a severe and increasing threat?  Second, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who is sitting beside the Taoiseach, recently met his counterpart in Northern Ireland, Paul Goggins.  Has the Minister reported to the Taoiseach on those discussions?  Did they put in place a strategy to deal with an increasing threat from dissidents?  Did any discussion take place about the huge increase in cross-Border criminality, mostly in the area of smuggling petrol, diesel and cigarettes?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	32	To respond to the last point made by the Deputy regarding the activities of our Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who has joined me here this morning, the seminar last Monday, at which he met Mr. Goggins, was precisely about the issue of cross-Border criminality — smuggling, working with Customs, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Assets Recovery Agency etc., North and South.  The close co-operation between the Garda, the PSNI and other agencies of the State is an ongoing priority for the Garda Commissioner and for the Minister.On the question of the recent INLA statement, last Sunday's announcement that the INLA campaign is over and its commitment to peaceful means is potentially important.  I would encourage it to engage with the decommissioning body.Regarding recent dissident activity, I condemn in the strongest possible terms the recent activities by dissidents, including the targeting of families of police officers and attempted bomb attacks.  Those who are carrying out these acts represent nobody.  Their actions are entirely destructive.  Co-operation between police services North and South has never been better and they are working closely together to ensure these people are brought to justice.  It is clear from recent IMC reports that dissident groups styling themselves Óglaigh na hÉireann, the Real IRA, and the Continuity IRA are criminal groups.  They have failed to move on.  They have no mandate from the people and their continued involvement in various types of criminal activity should leave no one in any doubt about what they are trying to do.Police services North and South are co-operating closely in tackling cross-Border crime.  The conference held on Monday last, the seventh such conference, builds on the successes of previous years and further strengthens cross-Border co-operation.  The event brought together senior officers from the Garda Síochána, the PSNI, the Serious Organised Crime Agency, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Revenue Commissioners, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, Government Departments and immigration officers from both jurisdictions.  We must tackle cross-Border crime effectively and take a united approach at both political and operational levels, sending a clear message to organised criminal gangs that there is no hiding place on either side of the Border for their illegal activity.  The devolution of policing and justice will help this process further by enabling us to provide a fully integrated system of devolved government for Northern Ireland.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	33	Last December the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission handed over its advice to the British Government on the preparation of a consultation document for a Bill of rights for Northern Ireland.  The Taoiseach is aware that this is a significant part of the Good Friday Agreement.  The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission is now concerned that the consultation document will not be published in advance of a British general election because the timeline is short.  Again, according to the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, the Conservative Party has made it clear that it proposes to replace the Human Rights Act 2000 with a United Kingdom Bill of rights and responsibilities, which would include Northern Ireland.As the Taoiseach is aware, a Bill of rights for Northern Ireland is an integral part of the Good Friday Agreement.  Has he had any discussions with his counterpart, Prime Minister Brown, or has his officials discussed this issue at official level?  If an election takes place in Britain and there is a change of government and if the Conservative Party wishes to introduce a new Bill to replace the Human Rights Act 2000, this would mean what is in the Good Friday Agreement would be changed.  Does the Taoiseach have a concern about this?  Does he have any information about whether the consultation paper will be published before a British general election?  Does he consider that would be important given that he had a part in the negotiations which led to the Good Friday Agreement being concluded, of which this is an integral part?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	34	As I said in reply to an earlier question, we reiterate our commitment to ensuring the full and effective implementation of all aspects of the Good Friday and St. Andrews Agreements.  We attach importance to the provisions of a specific Bill of rights for Northern Ireland as envisaged in the Agreement.  We have consistently communicated that point and position in contacts with the current British Administration and with the Conservative Party Front Bench.  There is a consultation document in preparation in respect of that aspect of the Agreement.  We would like to see it published and consultation proceed, and the merits of that initiative being debated in its own context, as the Deputy said, consistent with the Agreements we have signed.

Was the Government involved in the recent negotiations?  How will it fulfil its role in ensuring the full implementation of this aspect of the Good Friday and St. Andrews Agreements?The Taoiseach might recall that the Dáil unanimously passed the motion, which was sent to the British Parliament and called on it to release all relevant documentation regarding the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings of May 1974.  We asked for this information to be assessed by an independent international authority.  Given the refusal of the British Government to comply with this request of the Oireachtas, what course of action does the Taoiseach now propose to take?  Does he agree this is a very serious issue and that the lack of action on the part of the British Government must be confronted?  Does the Taoiseach agree also that this issue clearly shows that any process of truth recovery relating to the conflict must be anchored, not by a body nominated by the British Government, but by an independent international truth commission?  In terms of such an independent international truth commission, which both Governments would authorise, will the Taoiseach support a proposal that they would authorise the UN or a similar body to establish such a truth commission?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	36	The financial aspects of the provision of devolution of policing and justice to Northern Ireland — the financial package to support the Northern Ireland Executive once that devolution has taken place — is to be published today.  I am pleased this correspondence will be published today and that people will see that a commitment has been made to ensure it happens.  A few more steps will have to be taken before devolution finally takes place but I am optimistic that it will proceed in the near future.  The publication of the financial package is a major step forward in this regard.On resolutions of this House, it is a matter for this House to deal with those matters.  Having forwarded a formal resolution to the Parliament, it is a matter for the Dáil to decide what further steps, if any, it can take in the context of the clear view taken by the House in those matters at the time.Regarding the question of dealing with the past, it is important that the work done by Mr. Bradley and Lord Eames and others provides the framework in which all of society can look to see how issues of the past can be dealt with in a way that would promote healing and reconciliation in the community.

As the leader of the Dáil, I presume he would have had — perhaps he can enlighten us — conversations with the British Government representatives.  If the Irish Parliament passed a resolution and sent it to the British Parliament asking for action to be taken, I presume, as would all in this House who passed that resolution, that the Taoiseach would pursue it at intergovernmental level.Has the Taoiseach or any of the representatives sought from the British Government information on the recent claim by a retired RUC Special Branch officer, George Clarke, that British agents were involved in initiating plans to blow up the Sinn Féin offices in Dublin in 1971?  Should this not be pursued in the light of the failure of that Government to provide information on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, but also in the light of the fatal bombings by British agents in Dublin in 1972 and 1974?  How many other plans were initiated and carried out in this jurisdiction?Tá ceist eile agam i dtaobh Acht na Gaeilge.  Tá sé thar am go mbeadh seo curtha i bhfeidhm sna Sé Contae.  Ar phléigh an Taoiseach an cheist seo le Príomh-Aire na Breataine, Gordon Brown.  An gcuirfidh seisean brú go gcuirfear an reachtaíocht seo i bhfeidhm gan mhoill nó cad é stádas Acht na Gaeilge sna Sé Contae faoi láthair?

Mar sin, is ceist í sin atá á phlé ag Aire an Roinn Gnóthaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta, an Teachta Éamon Ó Cuív, lena comhghleacaí sa Tuaisceart i dtaobh cén dul ar aghaidh atá le déanamh againn ar an ábhar sin.Regarding the specific questions about claims being made by this, that or the other person about any activity, these are matters that can be put to the line Minister and to the Garda for investigation in the event of any allegation of criminal activity.  From my point of view, as Leader of the Government, my job is to see in what way I can assist the healing process of truth and reconciliation in Northern Ireland in respect of all matters that have taken place during the course of the conflict, and to try to assist in that in a way that will promote public confidence on all sides of the community.  That is the role that I would see myself taking in respect of that.This Government and the previous Administration have, as I stated in my reply, devoted considerable resources to obtaining to the greatest extent we could but, unfortunately, not to the full, as much information as we could on those who died in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, one of whom came from my own home town.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	39	I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 to 18, inclusive, together.The revision of the programme for Government has been completed and it will serve us well in the years to come.  The new programme sets out the development of the country over the remainder of the Government's term up to 2012 and is designed to act as a blueprint to meet the challenges we face.  We have worked well together, as two parties in Government with others, providing good Government for the country during a period of unprecedented global economic turmoil.The initial programme for Government agreed in the aftermath of the 2007 general election made clear that its delivery was based on an economic growth rate of 4.5%.  It was negotiated prior to the worst global downturn since the 1930s.  This review is about ensuring the programme for Government reflects current economic realities.  Achievement of the goals set out in both documents, subject to resources, will continue to provide the political basis of Government action until we complete our term in 2012.  As has been the practice in previous years, it is our intention to publish on the web in the next few weeks a progress report relating to the delivery of our initial programme for Government.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	40	I will first deal with some of the specifics in the revision of the programme for Government, particularly in the area of education, because I want to get clarification on them.  I welcome the commitment in the revised programme for Government that there will not be a reintroduction of third level tuition fees in the lifetime of the Government.  Is there a commitment that the university and college registration fees will also not be increased?  There has been some concern that while there is a commitment not to increase the tuition fees, the registration fees might be increased.  Can the Taoiseach clarify the position on the education items in the revised programme for Government?  Is it intended that they will be funded out of the education budget or will the funding be found elsewhere?While there were many specifics in areas such as the ones I mentioned, I was surprised by an absence of specifics in other areas such as the handling of the public finances.  Is there agreement, and did part of the discussions involve how the public finances will be dealt with?  Is there agreement or, as part of these negotiations, was there discussion, on what adjustments are to be made in respect of the different years in the remaining expected life of the Government?  What was the position, or was there any position agreed, in respect of issues such as public sector pay and social welfare payments?  While we all read of the specifics there were in areas like education, it is surprising there were no specifics agreed on those areas which I would have expected the two parties in Government would need to address, particularly heading into the budgetary process.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	41	The review of the programme for Government does not replace the budgetary process in any given financial year but the overall parameters under which the programme for Government operates remain the same as have been outlined in the budgetary statement by the Minister for Finance in overall terms in April.  The overall economic realities remain the same and it is important to point out that such is the case.  Every programme for Government must be subject to the availability of resources at any given time.  This review highlights some of the priority areas.On the question of any specific issue related to education, parliamentary questions may be put to the Minister, who is involved at present in bilateral budgetary discussions with the Minister for Finance.  We have outlined the areas to which we intend to give priority.  The Deputy will be aware of our position in regard to the teachers.  The provision of sufficient funding for that purpose will be required in future budgets.  While the overall education budget has yet to be fixed in terms of what is available and what is possible, we are at this point indicating a preparedness to move on some of those areas as outlined in the programme for Government.  It is a question of setting out a priority without indicating the status quo in respect of every aspect of the programme.On the issue of social welfare payments and public sector pay, the position is simple.  We have a situation in this country whereby we are spending more than €55 billion and taking in only €32 billion.  We have to make a serious correction during the course of the budget.  As indicated in April that correction is of the order of €4 billion.  One cannot reduce expenditure by that amount simply by looking at the cost of providing services.  If, for illustration purposes, this was to be achieved on a one-third, one-third, one-third basis across the board one would be seeking a cut in the provision of services of 25%, which is not tenable.  One must look at every area of expenditure, including the overall social welfare budget and public sector pay and pension bill, if one is to make the corrections that are necessary.It is time that everybody in this House acknowledged that regardless of the various aspects of the corrections, this is the scale of the difficulty facing us, in terms of the public finances, that must be addressed.  We are seeking to do this over a number of years as it cannot be done overnight.  In this regard we are trying to stabilise what is a high deficit position this year going into next year and to do this in a way that meets the requirements of the situation, which is what is required of all of us.  We would like to see a nationally supported effort in that effort.  The idea, which has once again been suggested, that nothing in terms of two-thirds of expenditure in the public purse can be touched is not a realistic starting point from which to address the scale of the problems we face.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	42	I want to come back to what was agreed in the revised programme for Government.  I have read the programme, which is specific in some areas.  A huge range of areas are mentioned.  For example, there are to be 41 reviews of policy.  The word "review" is mentioned 41 times in the 43 pages of the revised programme.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	43	It was in the high seventies under the rainbow coalition——

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	45	Repetitio est mater studiorum.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	46	What I am trying to get an answer to, in the context of the two parties in Government having sat down together to revise the programme for Government at a time when there is a hugely important budget due and there are huge problems with the public finances, which we all acknowledge, is not what is the scale of the problem or what are the options but has the Taoiseach agreed with his partners in Government how this will be dealt with?  I appreciate that agreement has not been reached on the budget, which will come later.  For example, what are the target figures — I raised this yesterday with the Taoiseach — for the adjustment in the public finances?  We already know, as it was published in last year's budget and announced last April that the target is €4 billion.  The Minister for Finance broke down that figure in the Budget Statement in terms of how much will be savings in public expenditure, taxation and the capital programme.The Taoiseach let slip that the Government is now thinking of addressing this on a one-third, one-third, one-third basis.  Is that what has been agreed with the partners in Government?  Has agreement been reached on the big items, including pay, welfare and taxation?  The Government had before it two significant reports which would have informed its discussions.  Did it agree on what recommendations of the report of an bord snip nua would be advanced?  Did it agree on what measures of the Commission on Taxation report would be progressed?  None of this is dealt with in the revised programme for Government put before the Green Party conference.  It is difficult to imagine that the two parties in Government, having had discussions on revising the programme for Government, would not have agreed how these big issues are going to be dealt with.  We have not, to date, heard how they are to be dealt with.  I am not asking the Taoiseach for the content of the budget but whether the Government has reached agreement on the broad parameters of how these issues are going to be dealt with.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	47	What the Deputy is asking for is the outcome of Estimates discussions which are ongoing.  I explained for illustration purposes the composition of public expenditure in terms of three broad headings.  I have indicated to the Deputy that it is not possible to deal with the scale of the problem we face by regarding any aspect of that expenditure as immune from consideration for cuts.  I have stated this clearly.  While that is not the position the Deputy is prepared to take, it is the position I am taking.  Every area of expenditure will have to make a contribution towards the solution to this problem.  It is not a position——
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	48	Has that been agreed with the Green Party?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	49	That is the position of the Government.  The Government has made that clear.  The an bord snip nua report has been under consideration since September by way of bilateral discussions between the Department of Finance and independent Departments and discussions in this regard are ongoing.  The Deputy has been previously involved in the Estimates discussions and will be aware they take time.  Various options are looked at, alternatives are sought and people who have priorities or other issues to put forward can do so.  Ultimately, savings have to be identified and agreed.  The process is ongoing.  I cannot indicate to the Deputy during the process of those discussions what will be the outcome in this regard, except to say that the Government is determined to bring forward an adjustment that meets the requirements of the situation as we see it and that avoids a situation of drift whereby we increase the level of debt, deficits and the burden of debt on the State, which will increase further taxation levels into the future.The Government and, the Minister for Finance, has made clear that 95% of our tax revenues come from the four main heads of income tax, VAT, excise and corporation tax.  That there is available to us a big range of tax revenues in current circumstances over and above what we are already receiving in view of the fragile nature of the economy is an option that would have to be carefully considered.  One would have to be slow to do that in an effort to maintain jobs and competitiveness.The suggestion has been made that there exists a range of people who can provide sufficient funds to fill the gap.  Taking the example of people earning €150,000 upwards one would be required to increase the marginal rate to 67% to raise €1 billion in that area.  The impact this would have on the enterprise economy and maintaining jobs would have to be taken into account.  We have already seen the marginal rate raised to 52%.  Considerable tax impositions have been already introduced in the two budgets introduced in October 2008 and April 2009.  It has been recognised that this was the correct action to take in the short term as we sought to investigate every area of expenditure, which was the whole purpose of the exercise undertaken by the McCarthy group.  The McCarthy report is now forming the basis of further political discussions.Deputy Gilmore has stated he does not want details.  What he wants to know is what is the outcome of the Estimates process, which is ongoing.  I am suggesting that given the scale of the issues to be dealt with, it is not possible to leave aside any area of public expenditure, including public sector pay and pensions and welfare, and to expect that the remaining area of public expenditure will provide the correction that is needed without, in my opinion, greatly undermining the provision of public services to those who need them and saying that those who provide the services, and those in receipt of public support, are not in a position to make some contribution towards the overall effort.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	50	I will allow a brief supplementary question from Deputy Kenny.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	51	What is the Government's estimate of the cost of the revised programme for Government between Fianna Fáil and the Green Party as signed off recently?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	52	I am sorry; what was the question?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	53	I was asking the Taoiseach whether he has an estimate of the cost of the revised programme for Government agreed recently by Fianna Fáil and the Green Party.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	54	I explained to the Deputy last week that this programme is subject — as is every programme, including those introduced when Fine Gael itself was in Government — to the overall financial parameters in which we operate.  The programme sets out priorities and the areas and initiatives that need to be considered and in which progress needs to be made.  However, the overall position is that we are spending €55 billion and taking in €32 billion, and no programme for Government is sustainable on the basis of that alone.  Thus, we must make corrections.  What will emerge from the budgetary and Estimates process are those areas of activity we are prioritising in the various Departments of State next year based on the resources that are available to us.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	55	I estimate that the value of the tax increases will be of the order of €2.5 billion in personal taxes.  To break this down, the cut in pensions relief represents €120 million; the abolition of the PRSI ceiling is €200 million; the carbon tax is €500 million; the site value of people's homes represents around €1 billion; water charges are €500 million; extra local government taxation is €100 million; and the closing down of tax reliefs will be at least €100 million, which represents a total of €2.5 billion.  Would the Taoiseach agree that those figures are reasonably accurate?  Was this considered by the parties when they were negotiating this deal?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	56	I do not accept the figures given by the Deputy for the site acquisition tax and others, because there is much work to be done before we can even see what the rates will be.  The Deputy also leaves out the fact that all tax expenditures are being considered in the context of the Commission on Taxation report.  Many tax expenditures take place at the moment as part of our effort to achieve an enterprise economy, and these must be considered.  Thus, there are expenditures on tax as well as the question of the introduction of new taxes.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	57	I give the Government credit for maintaining a strong capital programme, which is necessary in terms of jobs.  From my involvement with architects and builders dealing with school buildings, I know it is now possible to build permanent buildings for less than the cost of prefabricated buildings.  The time taken to obtain planning permission and for procurement is the same, but the construction period is a little longer for permanent buildings.  Given the real value and skills that are now available from contractors and builders, the extent of employment that is possible, and the fact that they are such a necessary part of our infrastructure for the future, is it the intention of the Government to consider extending the capital injection into the schools building programme?  If we compare the building of 20 km of motorway with the possibility of building all those school buildings, is it a question of juggling moneys in areas in which we can achieve greater employment and real value?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	58	Our focus with regard to the capital programme has been on completing the projects to which we are contractually committed on time and within budget.  This has, I am glad to say, been the case without exception, particularly for major road works, for which we must congratulate the NRA and the contractors it has employed to do these works, the most recent of which was the Waterford bypass, which was opened this week.The Minister for Education and Science introduced a good initiative in the area of temporary and permanent accommodation by providing block grants to local boards of management which can identify and locate local contractors at competitive prices, where the building is planned in good time prior to the September in which the school intake will require the extra provision.  Much work has been undertaken at local level by the use of that initiative.  There will always be, as there is in any system, the requirement for some prefabrication because of the immediacy of the problem that arises and the need to provide temporary accommodation as an interim solution.  As we know, there have been many major school building projects with which we have proceeded through the years, certainly during the good times, and we have seen improvements in our school building programme for not only tens or hundreds of schools but thousands of schools.This has been against a background of historic under-investment because of the lack of resources available to Governments through the years to achieve modernisation.  Particularly in education, we can all be proud of the many advances that have been made.  The provision of facilities in many of our schools has been exemplary, although problems remain in developing areas, particularly where demand rises quickly.  The acquisition of sites and suitable locations for schools — and the provision of the many different school models now being promoted in our education system — has brought certain pressures.  However, in overall terms, the work of successive Ministers in this area has been good.  I am not saying there are no problems, but there are far fewer problems now than was the case in the past.Looking to the future, the questions of capital appraisal and the employment involved in projects are important, and will be considered by the Minister for Finance in the context of the capital budget allocation.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	73	The Labour Party opposes this proposal.  The Dáil should not adjourn today until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 3 November.  The Dáil should meet in normal plenary session tomorrow, with an Order of Business, Questions and normal business.  We should also be back here next Tuesday in plenary session, with all of the business we would normally have — Leaders' Questions, Taoiseach's Questions, Oral Questions to Ministers and Dáil business.  The Dáil should sit a full normal week next week.  For the past two or three years, it has been the practice that the Dáil sits normally the week after the October bank holiday.  This should remain the case.The Government is attempting to pretend that the Dáil is in session next week by having the select committee dealing with the NAMA legislation meet tomorrow and next week in the Chamber.  The Labour Party had proposed that Committee Stage of that Bill should be dealt with on the floor of the House, but by the entire Dáil, as Committee Stages used to be dealt with on major legislation.  What is happening in this case is that the NAMA Bill has been referred to the select committee and it is, effectively, hiring the Dáil Chamber for the business to be conducted tomorrow and next week.  That is not an acceptable arrangement.  We want the Dáil to meet in normal plenary session tomorrow and next week.  I agree it should, if necessary, deal with the NAMA legislation by way of Committee Stage in the full House, but not the kind of arrangement put forward in this proposal.

The Dáil should meet tomorrow and all next week on Committee Stage in the Dáil as a whole to deal with the NAMA legislation.  There was an opportunity for the Government to allow that and allow Members, who are interested in contributing on the NAMA debate, to contribute continuously.  Given the scale of the proposal being put before us, all Members should be entitled to take part as a Committee of the Dáil, rather than in select committee as proposed, so that they can table amendments on Committee Stage, which they are not entitled to do in a select committee.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	75	Will the Taoiseach say whether he has spoken to the President of the European Council in regard to the nomination of a Commissioner from Ireland to the European Commission, and could he indicate when he intends to make his choice known?In respect of the proposal by the Minister for Transport to reduce the drink limit on driving from 80 to 50 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, I understand that this morning the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said on his local radio station, LMFM, that the situation in the Republic would have to be compatible with that in Northern Ireland.  Will the Taoiseach say whether this is true and if the proposed Bill will not be introduced by the Minister until there is compatibility between the two jurisdictions in this regard?  In other words, is the Minister for Transport's Bill dependent on there being an equivalent alcohol limit in Northern Ireland?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	76	As regards the commissionership issue, I refer to the June European Council's conclusions.  In fact, direction has to be given by the Council for that process to begin, and that will probably be considered at the next meeting of the Council, at the end of this month.  Obviously I am  au fait with any developments taking place there. On the road traffic legislation, the Minister has been seeking North-South co-ordination at ministerial council level.  As we have seen with the mutual recognition of disqualifications and speeding, the need for co-ordination is very beneficial and important from a road safety point of view.  The statistical data in Border areas show an improvement where co-ordination takes place in these areas of policy.  Clearly, the legislation continues to be progressed in terms of its preparation and the Minister will obviously look to the co-ordinating mechanism that could be considered there also.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	77	When can we expect the Minister to publish the details of what he intends to press through the Dáil?  Will it take place in November?  Does the Taoiseach know when he expects to introduce it here?Deputy Shatter raised the matter of members of the Judiciary being exempt from the pensions levy and its consequences.  That is governed under Article 35.5 of the Constitution as the Taoiseach is aware.  In view of his remarks both this morning and yesterday in respect of public pay policy, is it the  Government's view that in order to maintain respect for the Judiciary and yet not have its members exempt from public pay policy, it may be necessary to amend the Constitution in order to bring that compatibility into line?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	78	To what did the first question relate?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	79	When will the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, bring the Bill before the House?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	80	As I understand it, that is due this session.  The publication of legislation has been promised for this session.As has been the convention of this House, while we want to ensure that everyone participates in any effort we are making to show the wider public that we are all of the one mind in terms of our preparedness to reduce people's remuneration, it is important that we respect the constitutional provision regarding the independence of the Judiciary.  It is a fundamental bulwark of our system.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	81	I think that is a given.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	83	My question related to public pay policy though.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	84	As the Deputy knows, decisions or initiatives have been taken by the Chief Justice in that regard, which are ongoing.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	85	It is fewer than half of them.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	86	Against the wishes of the Opposition, the Government has now insisted that the Dáil will not be back here in full session until 3 November.  This is a real trick or treat perpetrated by the Government against both the Opposition and the wider public.  Since we will not be back here until 3 November, and that will leave only approximately a month until the budget, when does the Government intend to publish the pre-budget outlook?  We no longer get Estimates in advance of the budget in the normal way.  We now rely purely on the publication of the pre-budget outlook.  When will that be published?Yesterday, I asked about the publication of the report into the sexual abuse of children in the Dublin archdiocese.  The Taoiseach responded to that, and I understand the Minister of State with responsibility for children is now going back to the High Court to seek clarification or get decisions on further matters relating to the report.  How long does the Taoiseach expect that return to the High Court to delay the publication of the report on the Dublin archdiocese?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	87	Regarding the workings of the House during the remainder of this week and next week, it will be concentrating on the very important legislation on the asset management agency, which needs to be enacted as a matter of urgency.  While respecting that it has been referred technically to the select committee in terms of the voting arrangements, the full opportunity is being given to everyone in the House to debate and discuss it in plenary session as was the original request.  I note that it is not the full concession to the request sought by the Opposition, but it is a fair compromise in all the circumstances.Regarding the other matter referred to by the Deputy, as he said there is an issue that requires us to go back to the court.  It is about ensuring that we do not do anything prejudicial in respect of any prosecution that may emerge in respect of some aspects of that report.  That is required on the basis of legal advice.  It is only a recent development, but it is about following that advice and ensuring that we publish the report as quickly as possible consistent with that consideration.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	88	With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I wish to revert to the point raised by Deputy Kenny in the context of public sector pay with particular reference to judicial pay and conditions, and the matter of the Constitution.  I accept what the Taoiseach has said about the independence of the Judiciary being the bulwark of our democracy.  However, matters must be advanced.  It is important that there be a functioning relationship between the Executive — and indeed this Legislature — and the Judiciary.  The long-promised legislation that may assist, the judicial council Bill, is not mentioned in the programme for Government.  What is the position on the long-promised legislation setting up a judicial council having regard to the fact that, on 23 May last year, the Tánaiste when deputising for the Taoiseach indicated the legislation would be before the House before the end of 2008?  I ask that the matter be progressed as there is concern at the need for such a judicial council to deal with a number of issues, which may well deal with the type of issue raised by Deputy Kenny.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I understand that draft heads of the judicial council Bill have been prepared.  Consultation is taking place seeking the views of the Judiciary in this matter.  It is at that point at the moment.  We await its views so that we can progress the legislation as quickly as possible.  Obviously, I do not expect that it would be available for consideration by this House before next year.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	90	A few minutes ago the leader of the Labour Party, when asking about the pre-budget information, asked whether this was trick or treat time.  It is for the children of the country, but for the Deputies it is like the old Irish Hallowe'en game of bobbing for apples.  We are bobbing for information about the budget.  The Taoiseach ignored Deputy Gilmore's question which was whether he or the Minister for Finance would make a pre-budget statement as happens in many other parliaments setting out in some detail the Government's proposal for the budget, which is due in little more than a month's time.  I ask for a timeline and an indication of the likely length of the debate on the pre-budget situation, which is standard in most parliaments but has not been done here.  As Deputy Gilmore said, we no longer even get Estimate information.  We get everything just after the Minister for Finance stands up to speak on budget day.There are two Bills in the Seanad dealing with management companies, the Property Services (Regulation) Bill and the Multi-Unit Developments Bill.  I know the Senators are working hard on their amendments to these Bills.  Does the Taoiseach know when they might finish their amendments and we might get these Bills in this House?  The confusion for many apartment and house owners who are subject in their tens of thousands to management companies is considerable.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	93	I want to know when it will come in here.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	94	So does the Deputy.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	95	The other House has to dispose of the legislation before it comes here.  I call Deputy Crawford.

We are waiting for months.  We went to the trouble of producing it and it is stuck in the Seanad for months now.  It is a matter of urgency that it is introduced.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	97	That is a matter for another day.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	101	The question of when the Bill is returned from the Seanad is not something I can predict at present.  However, I will ask my colleagues to see in what way it can be expedited.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	102	We appreciate it.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	103	The Deputy is welcome.  My apologies for not replying to Deputy Gilmore earlier in regard to the pre-budget outlook, which was an oversight on my part.  I would expect we will have a debate on that upon our return after 3 November.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	104	I call Deputy Crawford.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	105	In light of the fact the self-employed and farmers are finding it impossible to get any sort of social welfare, can the——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	106	Is this question related to promised legislation?
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	107	It is very much related to promised legislation.  There is legislation which promised an increase in social welfare in the 2010 budget.  When will that Social Welfare Bill come to the House?Second, we have had much discussion in recent days on the limits for alcohol use.  When will the sale of alcohol Bill, which would control some of the alcohol sales to young people, be brought to the House?Finally, while I appreciate there was agreement to have a debate on agriculture tomorrow, that has now been cancelled.  Will the Taoiseach guarantee this will be a matter of urgency when the Dáil resumes because farming is in crisis?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	108	To take the last point, the question of the publication of the pre-budget outlook is an opportunity for a wider economic debate in the House which could of course include those, like the Deputy, who have a particular expertise and interest in the agricultural industry.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	109	Agriculture is entitled to an independent debate.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	110	It is a matter for the Whips to consider.  It was intended, as the Deputy knows, to proceed this week but that has been overtaken by events.  Of course, the use of our committee system for these specialised debates is not excluded either.The sale of alcohol Bill will be early next year.  In the aftermath of the budget, whatever social welfare changes are envisaged will have to be enacted within the timelines that are provided for.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	111	Will that be before Christmas?

#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	113	I wish to raise two issues.  The first concerns the customs Bill, which is to consolidate and modernise national legislation relating to the administration of the Customs Service.  From the outset, both Customs and the Garda Síochána must be congratulated on recent seizures of drugs.I wish to suggest one practical way in which Customs could be helped.  In this country — I believe it would happen nowhere else — the two main ports have one scanner, which alternates between the two ports.  I have raised this issue with the Minister of State with responsibility for drugs policy.  In the interests of intercepting drugs coming into the country, and we are led to believe that only one in ten shipments is detected, I suggest the Government would provide a second scanner so that Customs and the Garda Síochána would not be chasing their tails.  The importers and the drug lords know where the scanner is——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	114	That is a question for the line Minister.  It is an operational matter.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	115	This will have to come from the Taoiseach.  I would hope he would give some indication that this could be done.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	116	The question is whether it is necessary to introduce legislation to do it.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	117	The customs Bill is to modernise the legislation.  Let us modernise the force.Second, this is the second anniversary of the plebiscite that was held by Kerry County Council in regard to the placename change of An Daingean to Dingle-Daingean Uí Chúis.  Despite being two years on from that plebiscite, no legislation has been introduced to give it a legal standing and give back to the people of Dingle their placename, Dingle-Daingean Uí Chúis.  When will that legislation come before the House?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	118	Unfortunately, I do not believe any date is envisaged for either of the Bills the Deputy suggests.  I will have to come back to him specifically in that regard.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	119	I wish to raise two matters concerning legislation.  First, when does the Government intend to bring the Seanad-introduced Adoption Bill into the House for a Second Reading?  This Bill was introduced to the Seanad in January 2009 by the Leader of the House to consolidate the legislation.  No bilateral agreement between Ireland and Vietnam can be entered into until this legislation goes through.  I understand a high level deputation led by the Deputy Prime Minister of Vietnam will visit Ireland this week.  Is it the intention of the Minister of State with responsibility for children to meet that deputation and to discuss this issue?Second, the Animal Health and Welfare Bill is listed as being to consolidate and update existing legislation in the areas of animal health and welfare.  Why has the purpose of the Bill changed?  In any previous listing of the Bill, its purpose was listed as including: "to consolidate the responsibility for the welfare of all animals (including non-farm animals) within the Department".  It now seems that this aspect has been dropped from the purpose of this legislation.  It is important that it is put through.  The Bill is still listed in section C of the legislative programme, with no date proposed.  I urge the Government to bring it forward as soon as possible.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	120	I understand that it is hoped Second Stage of the Adoption Bill would be taken some time in November.  On the second matter, I would have to revert to the Deputy on whether any significance can be attached to the omission of words that were previously in the Bill.  We do not have a date for that Bill.  I will check the position and revert to the Deputy by correspondence.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	121	Does the Taoiseach know if the Minister of State will meet the Vietnamese delegation?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	122	I do not know.  The Minister of State visited Vietnam recently.  I am sure, if a senior political figure from that country is to visit here, it is unlikely that this matter would not be taken up.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	123	It is urgent.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	124	It is about nine months since the Government established a working party to consider Dáil reform.  Will we ever see any proposals from Government on this matter?  Is the Taoiseach interested at all in progressing the matter and when can we see action?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	125	The Deputy will understand I have some other preoccupations at present.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	126	Is that a "No", "Yes", "maybe" or "go to hell"?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I would never be dismissive in that way.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	128	That is what we are getting here all the time from the Taoiseach.  It is not good enough.  We get the same answer all the time — too busy, not important.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	129	It is being worked on.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	130	When will the situation between the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with regard to the foreshore licences amendment be resolved?  Several applications are with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food but have been passed over to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Nobody will take responsibility for the initial studies in regard to foreshore licences, in particular, aquaculture licences.  This is a matter of urgency.  Many people are employed in this sector, particularly in the shellfish sector, as in the case of Kinvara on Galway Bay.  They have been told for the past three years that there are no personnel to carry out the initial studies by which this legislation can be brought to fruition.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	131	I understand this matter will be published before Christmas.

He gave an undertaking that they would be consulted and kept involved in any of the implementations of the recommendations which affected them.  Notwithstanding that undertaking, given in the presence of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, will the Taoiseach confirm whether the latter has now moved unilaterally to establish a memorial committee and to appoint two individuals to that committee without any consultation whatsoever with representatives of the victims of abuse?  Is the Taoiseach aware that an undertaking given by him has been unilaterally ignored by one of his Cabinet Ministers?

This is particularly so this year, with 31 October falling on a Saturday.  My constituency seemed to be worst hit last year in terms of the huge amount of damage to property and persons, with many gardaí being injured and various fires occurring that are still being treated as arson.  There is a significant amount of negative anti-social activity associated with Hallowe'en and it is getting worse every year.

I raised it last week and the Taoiseach indicated it was the responsibility of Ministers to answer questions relative to their Departments.  My question to him today is whether that includes questions relative to expenditure by subsidiary bodies of Departments.

There is no point in criticising those outside the House who claim the Oireachtas does not function effectively.  I am asking the Ceann Comhairle, as the Chairman and president of this House, what in God's name is happening?  There are people outside the House asking why money is being put down the drain through the various subsidiaries of the various Departments.  Ministers are responsible to this House for that expenditure.  Such issues are part of the budgetary process.

This is the only means by which I can hope to obtain an answer.  This issue was never mentioned as part of the agenda of Dáil reform.  It relates to a practice now established by Ministers whereby, on a creeping basis, they have resiled from their responsibility to answer Opposition questions in the House.  I see the Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche, is smiling.  It is not a smiling matter.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	152	The Deputy will have to find an alternative way of raising the issue.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	159	I move: "That Second Stage be taken now."
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	160	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."It is an honour for me to introduce this Bill.  The purpose of the Bill is to amend the European Communities Act 1972 in order to give effect to the relevant provisions of the Lisbon treaty in the domestic law of the State, and to provide for related matters.  The provisions necessary to enable the State to meet its obligations under the treaty must be enacted into domestic law before the treaty enters into force.The people of Ireland voted by a majority of 67.1% to 32.9% on a turnout of 59% on 2 October to approve the proposal to amend the constitution in the 28th Amendment of the Constitution (Treaty of Lisbon) Bill 2009.  That Bill has now been enacted, having been signed into law by the President on 15 October.  On 8 October, this House approved the terms of the Treaty of Lisbon in accordance with the terms of Article 29.5.2° of the Constitution, and on 16 October the President signed the instrument of ratification.  The ratification process will be complete when the instrument of ratification is deposited with the Italian Government, in accordance with Article 6 of the treaty, and the Government proposes to do so before the European Council which begins on 29 October.At the European Council in December 2008, the Government committed itself to seeking ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon by the end of the term of the current European Commission.  The Commission's mandate expires at the end of this month.  The treaty will enter into force on the first day of the month, following which all member states will have lodged their instruments of ratification with the Italian Government.  Twenty five of the 27 member states have already completed the ratification process.  Two countries are outstanding, namely, Ireland and the Czech Republic.  If all instruments are lodged by the end of this month, the treaty would enter into force on 1 November.When the treaty comes into force, the legally binding guarantees secured by the Government in June on taxation, the protection of the right to life, the family, education and Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality will also enter into force.  The legally binding guarantees are in the form of a decision of the Heads of State or Government of the 27 member states of the European Union, meeting within the European Council.  This decision will have the status of an international agreement.  The decision, the solemn declaration on workers' rights, social policy and other issues and the national declaration by Ireland on security policy have been annexed to the instrument of ratification which will be deposited with the Italian Government.In addition, the legally binding decision will be registered with the United Nations when the treaty enters into force.  The European Council also agreed in June that the decision, which deals with the legally binding guarantees on taxation, with the protection of the right to life, the family and education and with our traditional policy of military neutrality, will be annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union as a protocol, at the time of the next accession treaty.  Protocols form an integral part of the treaties and in legal terms, they have treaty status.On Friday, 2 October, the Irish people issued an emphatic confirmation of Ireland's European vocation.  A total of  1,214,268 citizens voted in favour of the Lisbon treaty.  No other European treaty has ever received as many votes in favour in an Irish referendum.  The referendum result has given new momentum to Ireland's economic recovery and it will infuse the Union with renewed confidence in our ability to continue delivering for our citizens.  The people of Ireland made a democratic decision on the Lisbon treaty.  After a hard-fought referendum campaign with real engagement on all sides, and in which its merits were thoroughly debated, they decided overwhelmingly to approve the treaty.  The fact that such an emphatic "Yes" vote was delivered underlines the commitment of the people to the European Union and also the determination of the Government and the main Opposition parties to maintain Ireland's position as a positive and constructive member state at the heart of the Union.The legally-binding guarantees secured by the Government in June that addressed the Irish people's concerns on taxation, ethical questions and our traditional policy of military neutrality, taken together with the new commitment on the Commissioner and the solemn declaration on workers' rights, were crucial to the outcome.  The European Union delivered for Ireland in June and the people endorsed the new package.  The Union works best when it listens to and accommodates the concerns of individual member states.  I am grateful to our European colleagues for their positive and constructive response to the Irish people's concerns.  The Government worked hard to explain the treaty and to demonstrate to voters that the concerns expressed last year were comprehensively addressed.  However, I want to acknowledge that the referendum success was the result of a collective effort involving almost all members of this House, trade unions, employers, farming organisations and a wide cross section of civic society representing all generations.  I want to put on record my appreciation for the tremendous work during the campaign by all concerned.It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge here the work of the Sub-Committee on Ireland's Future in the European Union. The work of the sub-committee and the sub-committee's recommendations were key elements in the strategy which brought us to the fortunate position we are in today.  I believe that the Lisbon treaty will help bring clarity to the direction and workings of the Union and should also help address the democratic deficit many people have identified.Before I turn to the Bill itself, it is worth recalling in brief the main provisions of the Lisbon treaty.  The foundations of European Union stretch back to the European Coal and Steel Community, established almost 60 years ago.  Ireland joined the process in 1973.  The Union is made up of 27 member states and operates on the basis of an agreed set of rules, which are the EU treaties. These are the basic legal documents of the Union.  Changes to these treaties have been agreed by the member states from time to time to update them to meet Europe's changing needs.  The Lisbon treaty is the latest proposed update of the European Union's operating rules.  It was signed by the Heads of State and Government of the European Union in December 2007.The treaty sets out the nature of the European Union, its objectives and values.  It states that the Union's aims are to promote peace and the well-being of its peoples.  The treaty states that the Union can act only within the limits of the competences given to it by the member states.  It proposes some changes to the operation of the Union's institutions.  These include the European Parliament, the body directly elected by citizens that makes laws for the Union, the Council of Ministers, made up of the representatives of member state governments, and the European Commission, a body with one person from each member state, which proposes draft EU laws.  The Lisbon treaty also gives formal institutional status to the European Council, which brings together the Heads of State and Government of the member states.  The treaty also simplifies the Union's structures and operation, something that I will explain later.The treaty proposes new competences for the Union in areas such as energy, tourism, sport and humanitarian assistance. The treaty also proposes to make the Charter of Fundamental Rights a part of EU law.  The charter sets out the fundamental rights — including workers' rights — of European citizens.  It will oblige the Union, when implementing its policies and activities, to take into account the promotion of a high level of employment and the guarantee of adequate social protection.  It will give a new role to national Parliaments, including Oireachtas Éireann, in the European law-making process.  The treaty will give more responsibility to the directly-elected European Parliament.  It will streamline the voting system under which some future EU decisions will be taken and make EU decision-making easier in the fight against cross-border crime.The treaty will make specific provision for the first time for EU action to combat climate change, which is one of today's major global challenges.  It will give the Union a greater capacity to prevent and resolve conflicts in other parts of the world by providing for the appointment of a full-time president of the European Council and for a new high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, whose responsibility will be to give the Union a clearer voice in international affairs.When the people voted at the beginning of the month, they affirmed Ireland's commitment to the European Union within which the member states of that Union work together to promote peace, shared values and the well-being of their peoples.  The Lisbon treaty is the culmination of a process which began nearly ten years ago when the Heads of State and Government of the 27 member states declared that the Union needed to come closer to its citizens and become more responsive to their needs and expectations.The European Union Bill 2009 will give effect to the relevant provisions of the treaty in Irish law and in so doing, will ensure that the Union can work with the member states to promote the well-being of the people and to respond to their needs and expectations. The Bill is necessary to amend the European Communities Act 1972 in order to give effect to the relevant provisions of the treaty in the domestic law of the State, and to provide for related matters.  The content of the Bill is in line with earlier amendments of the European Communities Act 1972, through which provisions of previous EU treaties have been given domestic legal effect.  The Bill also takes account of the fact that the treaty confers explicit legal personality on the European Union and makes certain institutional and terminological changes.  The Bill provides for the conferral of the new powers on the Houses of the Oireachtas under the terms of the treaty which I mentioned earlier.  In addition, the Bill provides for the continuation in domestic law of certain statutory instruments giving effect to EU directives, regulations or decisions.The Bill is relatively short, containing only nine sections, most of them technical in nature.  Section 1 provides that the "Act of 1972" means the European Communities Act 1972, that "European Union" and "treaties governing the European Union" have the same meaning as they have in the 1972 Act and that "Minister" means the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Section 2 then goes on to insert into section 1 of the 1972 Act definitions of "European Union" the  "Lisbon treaty" and "treaties governing the European Union".  These are the Treaty on European Union, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Lisbon treaty and the treaties currently governing the European Communities, excluding provisions of the EU's common foreign and security policy, in respect of which the Court of Justice of the European Union will not have jurisdiction.Section 3 amends section 2 of the Act of 1972, which sets out the EU legal instruments that are binding on the State and part of domestic law.  It provides that once the Lisbon treaty enters into force the treaties governing the European Union, the acts of the institutions of the European Communities in force prior to the entry into force of the Lisbon treaty, the acts of the institutions of the European Union and acts of bodies competent under the treaties shall be binding on the State and part of domestic law, with the exception of the non-justiciable acts adopted under the provisions relating to the EU's common foreign and security policy in respect of which the Court of Justice of the European Union will not have jurisdiction.Under the existing treaties, there are three broad areas or "pillars" of EU activity.  The first area broadly covers economic and social policy.  The second area relates to the common foreign and security policy and the third covers justice and home affairs.  The Lisbon treaty provides for a European Union with explicit legal personality that will replace the European Community established by the Treaty of Rome and the old Union established by the Treaty of Maastricht.Since the Treaty of Maastricht, the situation in Ireland has been that only those elements that relate to the European Communities or were otherwise justiciable before the European Court of Justice should form part of the domestic law of the State. Therefore, the inter-governmental second and third pillars were excluded.  The confusing distinctions between the European Community and the European Union are to be abolished by the Lisbon treaty.  The three pillars will be merged, but special arrangements will continue to apply in the case of the common foreign and security policy.  There will be limited involvement by the European Parliament, the European Commission and the ECJ in this area.  In line with our existing practice, the provisions of the Lisbon treaty in this area are not being brought by the Bill into domestic law, except where the ECJ will have power with regard to persons, bodies or companies that are subject to EU sanctions — a welcome innovation introduced by the Lisbon treaty — or in respect of the boundary between the common foreign and security policy and other areas of Union competence.  As the Lisbon treaty provides for a European Union with an explicit legal personality, which will replace the current European Community, section 3 provides that Acts of the current Communities will be carried over and remain valid in the new arrangements.  The European Atomic Energy Community is legally distinct from the European Community and European Union, although they are served by common institutions.  The treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, the EURATOM treaty, will survive the entry into force of the Lisbon treaty.  It comes within the definition in section 3 of treaties which will be binding on the State and part of Irish law when the Lisbon treaty enters into force.  Ireland, along with Germany, Austria, Hungary and Sweden, made a declaration annexed to the final Act of the 2007 Inter-Governmental Conference noting that the core provisions of the EURATOM treaty have not been substantially amended since its entry into force and need to be brought up to date.  The Government continues to favour an extensive review of the EURATOM treaty, leading to a significant updating of its provisions.Section 4 of the Bill amends section 3 of the European Communities Act 1972 by updating the references to treaties and acts of the EU in respect of which it is permissible in implementing regulations to provide for indictable offences.  There is no substantive change in this area.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	162	I know, but they are there.  Section 5(1) provides that references in enactments other than the Bill and the 1972 Act to the European Communities shall be construed as including references to the European Union.  Section 5(2) provides that references to the treaties governing the European Communities shall be construed as references to the treaties governing the European Union.  Section 5(3) provides that references in any enactment to the treaty establishing the European Economic Community or the treaty establishing the European Community shall be construed as references to the treaty on the functioning of the European Union.  This takes account of a provision in the Lisbon treaty to the effect that the Treaty of Rome, which is currently formally called the treaty establishing the European Community and prior to Maastricht was called the treaty establishing the European Economic Community, will henceforth be called the treaty on the functioning of the European Union.  Is that clear?  Section 5(4) provides that "enactment" shall include a statutory instrument.Section 6 of the Bill amends section 1 of the European Union (Scrutiny) Act 2002 by updating the definition of "measure" to take account of terminological changes consequent on the entry into force of the Lisbon treaty.  The change in title of the Treaty of Rome has been reflected in paragraph (a).  Paragraph (b) reflects the fact that the different types of legal instruments used in the existing second pillar — joint actions and common positions — are replaced by a joint legal act used across all areas of the Union’s activities, to be known as a “decision”.  Accordingly, a “joint action adopted under Article 14 of the Treaty on European Union” and a “common position adopted under Article 15 of the Treaty on European Union” will become a “decision adopted under Article 28 or 29 of the Treaty on European Union.”  Paragraph (c) reflects the fact that the constitutional amendment facilitating the ratification of the Lisbon treaty has simplified and updated the provisions of the Constitution relating to our membership of the Union, by replacing the wording in the 2002 Act, which refers to “a measure requiring the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas pursuant to Article 29.4.6° of the Constitution” with a new wording, which refers to “an act ..... requiring the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas pursuant to subsection 7° or 8° of Article 29.4 of the Constitution”.  These are the provisions in the Constitution which require the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas to be obtained before the State can participate in certain EU measures, including acts adopted under the area of freedom, security and justice.Section 7(1) of the Bill provides for the operation of the new powers of the Houses of the Oireachtas under the terms of the treaty.  These powers will allow either of the Houses, by means of a resolution, to object to a proposal to move from unanimity to qualified majority voting in the Council of Ministers, or a move from a special legislative procedure to the ordinary legislative procedure provided for under Article 48.7 of the Treaty on European Union, as amended by the Lisbon treaty.  This is the so-called general passerelle, or bridging, clause.  The ordinary legislative procedure involves an equal decision-making role for the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament in the adoption of regulations, directives and decisions.  It requires the Council to operate by qualified majority and the Parliament to operate by a simple majority of those voting.  However, if unanimity is required in the Council, or the Parliament has a lesser role in the decision making process, this is known as a special legislative procedure.  Section 7(1) complements the provisions of the new Article 29.4.8° of the Constitution, which requires the prior approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas before the State can agree to any change under Article 48.7 of the Treaty on European Union.  Such agreement would, de facto, be expressed by the Taoiseach on behalf of the State at a meeting of the European Council.Section 7(2) of the Bill provides for a similar power with respect to a proposal to move to the ordinary legislative procedure in relation to family law matters with cross-border implications under Article 81.3 of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union.  The prior approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas is required in this area under Article 29.4.8° of the Constitution.  As this matter falls within the area of freedom, security and justice, the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas would be also required under the new Article 29.4.7° of the Constitution in accordance with Ireland's opt-in arrangement under Protocol No. 21 to the treaties.The veto mechanism provided for in sections 7(1) and 7(2) of the Bill is known colloquially as the "red card."  Article 6 of Protocol No. 2 to the treaties on the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality provides that if at least one third of national parliaments in the European Union issue reasoned opinions on a draft legislative act's non-compliance with the principle of subsidiarity, the draft must be reviewed.  The threshold is one quarter in the case of draft legislative acts submitted in the area of freedom, security and justice.  The institution proposing the legislative act, which is normally the Commission, may decide to maintain, amend or withdraw the act.  It must give reasons for such a decision.  This mechanism is known as the "yellow card."  If the draft legislative act is made under the ordinary legislative procedure, and if a simple majority of national parliaments issue reasoned opinions on non-compliance with the principle of subsidiarity, the Commission must justify any decision to maintain the proposal in a reasoned opinion submitted to the Council and the European Parliament.  This procedure is known as the "orange card."  The principle of subsidiarity means that in areas where the member states and the European Union share a competence, action may be taken only at Union level where this is deemed likely to be more effective than action taken at national or regional level.  The mechanism for the exercise of the "yellow card" and the "orange card" is the same and is provided for in section 7(3), which states that either House may issue a reasoned opinion on whether EU legislative proposals comply with the principles of subsidiarity in accordance with Article 6 of Protocol No. 2.  The consequence of an orange card, rather than a yellow card, is more stringent.  If the Commission wishes to proceed with its proposal, the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers are obliged to consider both the opinions of the national parliaments and the Commission's justification before deciding to proceed with or terminate their consideration of the proposal.Section 7(4) of the Bill covers acts, rather than draft legislative acts, of an institution of the European Union.  It provides that if either of the Houses of the Oireachtas gives a reasoned opinion to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that an act of the EU institutions infringes the principle of subsidiarity, the Minister shall arrange for proceedings seeking a review of the act concerned to be brought in the Court of Justice of the European Union in accordance with Article 8 of Protocol No. 2.  Section 7 will form the basis for the new role of the Houses of the Oireachtas in the European law-making process.  This new role is proof, if it were needed, that the Lisbon treaty will make the Union more, not less, democratic.  It is not proposed to make provision in this legislation for broader questions, such as Oireachtas scrutiny of draft European Union legislation or the transposition of directives.  The Government is of the view that it would not be possible to deal with these issues adequately within the tight timeframe available.  It accepts that these issues will need to be dealt with at a later stage, when it has had time for a proper consultation process.Section 8 deals with the implementation in Irish law of EU codification directives, which are a relatively new phenomena.  Such directives repeal pre-existing directives in a particular subject matter and consolidate them with a view to making the EU legal system more transparent and easier to understand.  This process mirrors the steps being taken at domestic level to consolidate the Statute Book.  Section 8 provides that statutory instruments giving effect in domestic law to acts of the EU institutions, which have been repealed and replaced by codifying acts of such institutions that do not materially modify the rights or obligations conferred by the repealed acts, will have effect as if they had been made for the purpose of giving effect to the codifying acts concerned.  The provision is confined to EU codification directives which do not change existing law.  The Government is committed to mirroring at domestic level the simplification being carried out by the EU.  Therefore, Departments, as a matter of policy, will be expected to prepare codifying statutory instruments to ensure transparency.  This technical provision will avoid the possibility of opening up lacunae in the enforcement of our EU obligations, pending the making of such statutory instruments.The effect of section 9 is that section 8 on EU codification directives will come into force on the enactment of this Bill, but the rest of the provisions will not come into force until I sign a commencement order, which I will do as soon as the date of entry into force of the treaty becomes clear.  The Act must come into effect on the same date as the treaty enters into force.  As I have said, this could be as early as next week.These are the provisions of the Bill.  Now that the entry into force of the treaty is within sight, I would like to indicate to the House some of the next steps as we move towards implementation.  In his statement on the outcome of the referendum, the Taoiseach stated:The European Union is shaped by its peoples and nations to serve its peoples and nations.  Today's vote is a declaration of intent by the people of Ireland to remain at the heart of Europe, where our future belongs.With that in mind, the Government is committed to pushing for the early adoption at EU level of the necessary procedures and conditions necessary for the citizens' initiative provided for by the treaty and the Government will take any steps at domestic level that might be necessary on foot of this.Deputies will recall that, under the new citizens' initiative, at least 1 million citizens who are nationals of a significant number of member states will be able to invite the Commission to submit proposals on a matter within its competence.  This is an important and welcome development under the treaty and putting it into place is a priority for the Government.If there is sufficient clarity in the coming days on the intentions of the President of the Czech Republic, the European Council will discuss institutional issues, including the implementation of the treaty.  Consideration will have to be given to two new high-level appointments, namely the President of the European Council and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.  In addition, the Irish member of the European Commission will need to be appointed and the Government is currently considering this.After intensive contacts and negotiations, the European Council in December 2008 defined a path to allow the treaty to enter into force by the end of 2009.  The Council agreed that, provided the treaty enters into force, a decision will be taken to the effect that the Commission will continue to include one national per member state.  This represented a clear and positive response to a key concern that arose in last year's referendum.Once the Lisbon treaty enters into force, we will be sure to have an Irish Commissioner at the Commission table.  However, if the ratification process is not completed and the Nice treaty remains in force, the size of the Commission will be reduced and no country, including Ireland, can be guaranteed a place at the table indefinitely.The Lisbon treaty will simplify and stabilise the Union's external representation.  One of the key elements in this area is the establishment under the treaty of two important new positions which are relevant to the foreign policy area.  The European Council brings together the Heads of State or Heads of Government of the 27 member states and it defines the Union's general political direction and guidelines for the common foreign and security policy.  Within these guidelines, the Council of Ministers adopts decisions on actions and positions to be taken by the Union, and any necessary implementation arrangements.The President of the European Council will hold office for a two-and-a-half-year period and may be re-elected once.  The President will chair the European Council and drive forward its work.  His or her role is not confined to external relations but, on the external front, he or she will represent the Union in foreign policy matters at Head of State or Head of Government level.The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy will chair meetings of Foreign Ministers and represent the Union generally in the foreign and security policy area.  This new post will improve the interaction and coherence between the Council and the Commission in that the high representative will be also a vice-president of the Commission with responsibility for external relations.  The high representative will be able to make proposals on the common foreign and security policy and elaborate the Union's external action on the basis of the strategic guidelines laid down by the European Council.In representing the Union externally, the high representative will play a key role, for example, in political dialogue with third countries and at international conferences and in international organisations.  He or she will be assisted — this is a considerable innovation — by a European external action service which will have a presence in both Brussels and third countries.  The European external action service will include staff seconded from national diplomatic services of the member states in addition to officials currently serving in the Commission and General Secretariat of the Council.  Implementation of the treaty's provisions on the European external action service will be discussed at the European Council next week and consideration is under way in my Department of the proposed structure of the service and on optimising the Irish profile within it.More generally, the Government is looking at a renewed strategy for engagement with the European Union with a view to maximising Ireland's influence on EU laws and policies.  This strategy will include support for the employment of Irish personnel in EU institutions and bodies.The Lisbon treaty puts the European Defence Agency, which was established during the Irish Presidency in 2004, on a treaty basis for the first time.  The purpose of the agency is to assist and support the member states to develop the necessary capabilities to undertake peace support and crisis management operations.Participation in specific European Defence Agency projects is entirely voluntary and is for national decision on a case-by-case basis.  The legally binding guarantee on our traditional policy of military neutrality secured by Ireland in June provides that it is a matter for each member state to decide, in accordance with the provisions of the treaty and any domestic legal requirements, whether to participate in the European Defence Agency.The Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009, which was published last month and brought before the House by my colleague the Minister for Defence last week, makes it clear that Irish participation in European Defence Agency programmes will be subject to the prior approval of both the Government and Dáil Éireann.  It also provides that the Government will not approve participation unless it is satisfied that such participation would contribute to the enhancement of capabilities for UN-mandated missions in peace-keeping, conflict prevention or the strengthening of international security in accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.  Similar conditions pertain to any possible participation by Ireland in permanent structured co-operation.I hope that, with the passage of this Bill, we will be able to turn a page and move on from protracted discussions on institutional issues and focus our efforts on issues of direct consequence and relevance to the citizens of the Union.  I have in mind issues such as climate change, energy security and the global economic crisis.  The Lisbon treaty gives the Union the tools it needs to tackle big-ticket issues such as these, issues that are beyond the scope and competence of Ireland alone.  EU membership continues to be vital to our future and ratification of the Lisbon treaty represents an important step we can take on the road to national recovery.I recall what Mr. Jack Lynch said in April 1972, namely, that the decision to be taken in our referendum on European Economic Community membership in the future "would be recorded either as an unprecedented opportunity which we choose to grasp with incalculable gain or which we choose to throw away with irreparable loss".The decision taken by the people at the beginning of this month to ratify the treaty of Lisbon and to renew our commitment to the European Union was the right decision and it was of comparable significance to the sovereign decision taken by the people, almost half a century ago, on the eve of our accession to the then European Economic Community.  The Bill before us gives effect to the wishes of the people, as expressed on 2 October.  I look forward to today's debate and commend the Bill to the House.

We support it wholeheartedly.  Having listened to the Minister's contribution, I can understand how the public finds it so difficult to engage with EU issues.  So many of the issues are technical, but my saying so is no reflection on the Minister.The European Union Bill 2009 fulfils the requirement to give domestic effect to the Lisbon treaty.  It is mainly an administrative measure and is similar to the legislative instruments passed in the aftermath of the Nice treaty ratification in 2006.  The Bill provides for a number of measures independent of giving domestic effect to the treaty, including providing the mechanism for increased parliamentary oversight of European affairs provided for in the treaty and the mechanism designed to allow statutory instruments implementing EU measures to have continued effect where a measure has been repealed and replaced.The process for adopting EU treaties into the Irish legal order has two distinct strands, international ratification and domestic integration.  The objective of sections 2 and 3 of the European Union Bill 2009 is to update the European Communities Act 1972 to take account of the State's ratification of the Lisbon treaty.  An identical procedure was followed in the wake of the ratification of the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice treaties.  The only difference in this case is that the European Union now has legal personality.  In other words, it will be the subject of international law after the ratification of the Lisbon treaty.  There is a slight difference in terminology in this instance.  The Bill refers to the European Union established by virtue of the Lisbon treaty and the European Atomic Energy Community throughout.The key part of the Bill implies that the European Communities Act 1972 is updated so both the foundational treaties and the Acts of the institutions shall be binding on the State and be part of the domestic law thereof.  This part of the Bill therefore completes the integration of the Lisbon treaty into the domestic legal order.Section 4 makes a technical amendment to the European Communities Act 1972.  Section 3 of that Act had originally provided authorisation to Ministers to make regulations deemed necessary to give full effect to the adoption of European law into the domestic law of the State.  However, the original section precluded Ministers from introducing indictable offences by way of this secondary legislative regime.  Section 4, like section 2 of the European Communities Act 2007, will allow any Minister to create an indictable offence by regulation if he or she feels the State's European obligations require the creation of the offence.  I ask the Minister to clarify this matter when he replies to this debate.Section 6 updates the definition of "measure".  Section 7 deals with the role of the Oireachtas.  Advocates of the Lisbon treaty argued that one of the benefits of the treaty was its promotion of parliamentary oversight at member state level.  In principle the treaty of Lisbon provides for three types of procedure according to which the treaties may be amended: the ordinary revision procedure; the simplified revision procedure; and what is known as the passerelle, or bridging, procedure, which the Minister dealt with extensively in his speech.Section 8 provides that statutory instruments that give effect in domestic law to Acts of the EU institutions that have been repealed and replaced by codifying Acts shall have effect as if they had been made for the purpose of giving effect to those codifying Acts.  The section does not apply to primary legislation and only applies where no substantive change in the law has been made.  Although substantially similar effects have been achieved in domestic legislation previously, owing to the European dimension, this is a unique provision in this Act.Fine Gael welcomes this legislation.  I thank the Minister for his Department's co-operation with Fine Gael and for the consultative meetings we had with him and the Taoiseach in the lead-up to the referendum campaign.  I think it is no exaggeration to say that no one wants to hear the name Lisbon again.

We should have learned them from the Nice referendum campaigns.  Many people had legitimate concerns.  Nevertheless, it is probable that more people — although not the largest percentage — voted for the Lisbon treaty than any other EU treaty.  All of the political establishment, Government and Opposition, were blasé.  We knew we had got things wrong in the Nice referendum but we assumed people would vote "Yes" because Irish people have a positive and strong sentiment about our involvement in Europe.  They realise that Europe has been good for Ireland, economically and socially.  Most of our progressive legislation has emanated from Brussels.  The financial support we received in the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s helped us to create the infrastructure which assisted in the creation of the Celtic tiger.  Today, emergency funding, stimulus packages and access to funding from the European Central Bank all benefit the country.The Oireachtas sub-committee which was established after the first Lisbon referendum based its sittings on the findings of the Milward Brown research.  That research, while not inaccurate in the issues it raised, did not fully reflect the broader view of two aspects of the vote.  First, people did not understand what Europe was about and, second, they did not know where Europe is going.  One of our weaknesses is that no one can say where the European train will stop.  My own view is that Lisbon is the final stop, with the exception of some enlargements.  Institutional reform has taken place.  There was always a fear of creeping federalisation and of a united states of Europe, which was never going to be the case and never will be.  I do not believe there is the will or desire in Europe to create such a bloc.  The only desire is to pool sovereignty where it is beneficial to everyone concerned.The EU is probably the greatest example of a democratic institution on the planet.  It is much more democratic than the Oireachtas, which is very undemocratic.  Deputy Breen and I have been in opposition for a number of years, although this will, I hope, change.  Even Deputies on the Government side of the House have very little input into legislation.  This is evidenced by reports of last night's meeting of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party, where many members favoured a particular course of action while the Minister decided on another.  We must be more democratic, regardless of what side of the House one is on.  Many good suggestions have come from Fine Gael, Labour and other parties but they are never adopted.  One side does not have a monopoly of wisdom.  We must look at amending our system so that everyone can have an input.  The Oireachtas appears to consist of the Government and nothing else.  People become detached from the process:Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,And waste its sweetness on the desert air.I am sure the Minister, Deputy Martin, remembers that from his teaching days in Cork.  People become weary making good suggestions because none is adopted.Europe has been good for Ireland and I am glad the Minister has made a commitment to look at EU directives.  One of my parliamentary colleagues expressed his concern to me at this weakness.  We cannot simply leave the Lisbon debate and move on.  We must engage with people continually and see how we can make them more involved.I am glad to hear the Minister is committed to developing the citizens' initiative.  When Fine Gael planned our recent referendum campaign, we looked at the weaknesses in the Lisbon treaty.  We wondered how to explain the citizens' initiative and we were relieved that the "No" side did not home in on it.  There is no structure to it or definition of how it will be done.  Will it be possible to gather one million signatures or e-mails?  Based on the number of e-mails Fine Gael received regarding the Government's NAMA proposals, it may not be too difficult.

It appears to me that it will be difficult for it to achieve a simple measure.  I am glad to see the Minister intends to work on it.Many objections to the Lisbon treaty were legitimate and based on real concerns.  Others were based on misconceptions about neutrality, social and ethical issues and loss of control.  Those arguments have been made over the past 35 years.  They have not come to fruition and never will.  It is easy to play on the public's emotional fears.  I listened to Senator Rónán Mullen this morning as he pointed the finger at the "Yes" campaign as well as at the "No" campaign.  There may be some truth in what he said.  Some concepts were difficult to sell.  Enhancing the role of national parliaments is one of the main measures of the Bill.  The public climate for enhancing the role of national parliaments is not favourable and that was not a strong selling point.  Many people want to pull down the national parliament, they are so annoyed at how things have gone.

During the campaign, we felt it was important to deal with what the treaty could achieve rather than its content.  During the first referendum campaign we spent much time reflecting on and explaining the content of the treaty.  People were not interested in that and found it hard to digest its difficult terminology.  If the role of the national parliament is to be enhanced, it may be necessary to amend Standing Orders so that the procedures to be put in place can be seen.  Let us keep it simple and provide a mechanism whereby the role of the national parliament can be enhanced.  We do not want to stand here in three or four years time, wondering at various measures which passed into law without scrutiny because the Oireachtas knew nothing about them.  We can no longer blame the Minister for a directive, such as the water directive, because the parliament will have the power to examine them.  It behoves Members of the Oireachtas to pay more attention to what is going on.Let me return to the question of using inaccurate information to play on the voters' emotions.  I often wondered during the campaign whether there would be merit in setting up an electoral commission to consider the conduct of election campaigns and to produce a report on them.  That is currently being examined by the Government and the Standards in Public Office Commission.  While one battle might be won there will be other battles in the future.  It is important that the public would know about the credibility of the various groups that participate in a campaign.  Some of the information that was disseminated about the minimum wage was outrageous.  Many people still probably hold such information to be valid.  It is important that an independent body would pass judgment on campaigns.  I include all sides; the "Yes" side, Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party should all be subject to the same criteria.  One can ask how accurate were the claims we made.  The next time something is on the horizon people would be able to note what certain groups had said in the past.  That would give rise to more responsible campaigning by all groups.  We should examine that matter.In the past year a great deal was written about the Lisbon treaty and I am sure members of the Government were confronted with that every time they went to Europe, but at the end of the day the issue went through silently.  It slipped through with no great celebration or homecoming with a cup.  We are very supportive of the legislation.I alluded previously to section 4, which specifies that the Minister can create indictable offences by secondary legislation.  Will he refer to that in his reply?  When the European Communities Act 2007 was introduced, reservations were expressed by some speakers.

#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	177	I thank my colleague, Deputy Timmins, for sharing time with me.  As he and the Minister indicated, the Bill fulfils the legislative requirement to give domestic effect to the Lisbon treaty.  It is primarily an administrative measure and is broadly similar to the legislative instruments passed in the immediate aftermath of the Nice treaty ratification in 2006.The Bill also provides for a number of other measures independent of giving domestic effect to the treaty.  Given the short timescales involved some minor provisions and sections are not discussed.  Rather, the Bill's digest discusses the Bill around three principal themes.  The first is to give domestic effect to the Lisbon treaty.  We need the treaty to reform the institutions of the European Union.  When the European Union was formed in 1957 there were six member states.  It is obvious that a Union of 26 countries would require changes.The European Union, then EEC, was set up following the Second World War.  After the events of 11 September 2001 it was evident that the European Union would have a responsibility to fight against injustice and to ensure that global matters were settled peacefully rather than through war.  The European Union decided that it was time that the then 25 member states would stand together on a global stage and be part of world events.  The Union involves 500 million people working closely together in all areas, not just to maintain peace but also on economic matters.  It is important that we have an ability to play a leading role in the new world order.During the referendum campaign I used the analogy of a club to explain why we needed to ratify the treaty.  No club of 27 people would agree on a single issue.  Differences in language and culture also play a part.  In any club one must have rules and regulations.  The resounding support for the treaty on this occasion was in stark contrast to the situation of one year ago.  One wonders if the Celtic tiger had continued whether the people of Ireland would have given a resounding "Yes" on this occasion also.  Perhaps it was the reality of the recession that brought people to their senses and convinced them of how important Europe is to this country, how much it meant to us and how much we have got from it since we joined in the 1970s.On this occasion the people gave a resounding "Yes" to the treaty.  A total of 67.1% of people voted for it compared to 32.9% against.  That is very different from the previous occasion when the "No" vote won by 53.4% to 46.6%.  My own constituency of Clare played an important role in both campaigns.  On both occasions we gave a resounding "Yes" to the treaty.  In the second referendum on 2 October last the "Yes" vote increased.  All parties played an important role during the campaign.The referendum generated significant media interest in this country during the first week in October.  There were 560 TV, radio and print journalists; not only from other EU countries but from as far away as China and Japan.  Anyone with satellite television who watched it on 2 October could see that this country was at the forefront of the news on Euronews, France 24, al-Jazeera and others.  They were camped outside awaiting the result.  They did not have to wait for too long as the results came in early on Saturday morning.  It was clear from early on that this country was going to endorse the Lisbon treaty on this occasion.  I was at the count in Ennis where the tallymen got the correct result early on.When canvassing on this occasion I found that people had a far clearer understanding of what is involved in the treaty.  The political parties on the "Yes" side ran a very effective campaign second time around.  I congratulate all those involved in the "Yes" campaign on how it was conducted.  We canvassed at supermarkets and door to door.  People were angry with the Government's mismanagement of the economy but they put that aside on this occasion because they felt that Europe was so important in helping us to get out of the recession.  That shows how intelligent the electorate is and that people have a clear understanding of what is happening.  A good campaign was run in the media also.  It was a victory for democracy.  Deputy Timmins was the Fine Gael director of elections.  We played an important role in the campaign.  The Minister, Deputy Martin, has acknowledged the role played by Opposition parties.  We distributed over 1 million pieces of literature, held 40 meetings around the country, put up 25,000 posters and our party leader travelled more than 6,000 km and visited almost every constituency to promote a "Yes" vote.The reason there was a substantial swing was partly due to the greater role played by the political parties.  However, the legal guarantees that were negotiated by the Taoiseach and Minister and his team in Brussels were very important.  Deputy Timmins referred to that and the Millward Brown research poll.  Issues such as the retention of our EU Commissioner, the right to life and the fears that people had on the previous occasion that Irish people could be conscripted into an EU army were dispelled.  We focused more on the positive aspects of the treaty.  We all remember that in the previous referendum the "No" side depicted certain issues but on this occasion they did not succeed in convincing the people.  The people we met at the doorsteps understood that the guarantees we secured in regard to Ireland's position were important.The deterioration in our finances did not reflect a rejection in terms of the outcome even though more than 423,000 people are now unemployed.  People understood that we cannot get out of this mess on our own, that we need Europe and to be at the heart of the Union.The Declan Ganley factor in the campaign was important.  He said he would not get involved in a second referendum following his failure to get elected in the European elections but then he became involved in the "No" side of the campaign at a late stage.  The business people who got involved in the "Yes" side of the campaign played an important role.  Love him or loathe him, the debate with Michael O'Leary on "Prime Time" was also an important factor.  As a successful businessman, he, as well as others, came forward in support of the "Yes" side of the campaign.  However, Mr. Ganley's entry into the race backfired on this occasion.The "Yes" side was very organised.  All sections of society including business people, trade unions such as SIPTU, former taoisigh, particularly a former Taoiseach and former leader of our party, Garret FitzGerald, played an important role on this occasion.  That must be acknowledged.  The fact that Garret FitzGerald, who is in his eighties and is still actively interested in the European project, shows his commitment to the European ideals.There are lessons to be learned from the campaign.  All political parties can learn lessons from the negative campaigning that took place.  The "No" poster claiming that Ireland's minimum wage would be reduced to €1.84 per hour if the treaty was passed backfired.  Such negative posters did not have a huge impact on the campaign on this occasion.  I found that young people I met at the doorsteps were the only people who were concerned about that issue.  However, that negative campaigning did not have an impact on the outcome.We must also examine the reason almost 33% of people voted "No" in the referendum.  We need to ask why the people in the two Donegal constituencies voted "No".  What factors were different between Donegal and the other counties?  People reflected on issues such as unemployment, the banking crisis and local issues.The reality is that this treaty is good for Ireland.  It is important that the EU is brought closer to the people.  Proposed EU legislation will now be dealt with in the Houses of the Oireachtas, which we as legislators very much welcome.  The Minister rightly pointed out that a yellow card system will apply.The Minister also referred to the fact that people will be able to put a face to the European Union and he spoke about the role of the president of the EU.  It is important for the Union to have a President.  Up to now the European Presidency has been rotated every six months.  During his four-year term of office, President Obama would meet eight different EU leaders under the current structure.  It would be difficult to build up a relationship in that respect.  We will now have a President of the EU and will be able to put a face to the Union.  It is extremely important that the President of the EU will not be president of a country.  The focus of the President will be the European Union representing the 27 countries.  He or she will be elected for two and a half years and more than likely will continue in office for a second term, which would bring his or her term up to five years.The other significant appointment is the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.  Javier Solana held that office and during his term he has limited powers.  It is extremely important that people can put a face to the person in Europe dealing with foreign policy.The proposed European External Action Service is also important.  Ireland has 76 embassies throughout the world.  The UN recognises approximately 200 embassies.  If a problem arises in a country in which we do not have an embassy, action can be taken speedily to address it because we are part of that system.  That is extremely important.I could speak about other relevant issues, particularly how the ratification process will move forward in terms of the Czech Republic.  An EU summit will be held on 29 and 30 October.  We have removed the largest obstacle to the ratification of the treaty and its ratification now lies in the hands of  the European Union.I welcome the Bill.  I am confident it will get a speedy passage through this House.

The main purpose of it is to give legal effect to the provisions of the Lisbon treaty and  to provide for other related matters.  We have to deal with the matter by amending the European Communities Act 1972.As other speakers said, the Lisbon treaty was ratified by the Irish people on 2 October with a large turnout of 59% of the electorate and a strong "Yes" vote by two thirds of those who voted, namely 67% as against 33% who voted "No".  That was very welcome and provided a strong indication of where people stood on this issue.  It followed 15 to 16 months of soul searching, campaigning and analysis to reach that position.  We must acknowledge that the campaign on this occasion was much different from that on the last occasion.I congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs on the manner in which they were upfront in campaigning and led from the front on the issue, which was very welcome.  I acknowledge all the other contributions made by the other Opposition parties, which campaigned very strongly, by the trade union movement, which strongly supported the campaign which was notable on this occasion, and by the farming community, which took an early strong robust position on the campaign.  That support was topped off with the campaigns by various sectors of civic society.  There is a lesson to be learned from that as to how we move forward in the future.The European Council will hold a summit meeting on 29 and 30 October in Brussels.  In this legislation the Government is tying up the loose ends to ensure that when the Taoiseach meets his EU colleagues next week he will have the instruments of ratification all ready to be deposited.With regard to the Lisbon treaty, the legal guarantees on taxation, security and defence and the right to life, family and education, the declaration of workers' rights and the national declaration by Ireland make up the package of proposals which will be associated with Ireland's instrument of ratification.  The Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2009, which is currently before the Dáil, spells out the restrictive terms for Ireland's participation in the European Defence Agency and in permanent structural co-operation.  These are key new elements in the Lisbon treaty.  The entire package is a unique blend.  It contains substantial treaty issues, guarantees, assurances, a solemn declaration and a national declaration by Ireland.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	179	I propose to take Questions No. 96 and 97 together.As the Deputies will be aware, the report of the tourism renewal group was launched on Thursday, 8 October 2009.  This report sets out tourism's contribution to Ireland's economic, social and cultural development and the prospects for Irish tourism in a changed world, as well as a framework for action for tourism's survival, recovery and growth over the period to 2013.The report proposes five survival actions for short-term action to ensure the survival in 2009-10 of a strong Irish tourist industry and to minimise the potential impact of current challenges.  Nine recovery actions are proposed for action from 2010 on, to set Irish tourism back on a growth path from 2011, as the world economy recovers.Under each action in the framework, a number of measures are recommended.  The measures are wide-ranging in nature and scope, and are addressed variously to this Department and its agencies, to other Departments and agencies, and to tourism and transport enterprises.  Some measures would be matters for Government decision, including in the context of the budget and Estimates, while others fall to individual Departments and agencies at an operational level.The framework for action set out by the tourism renewal group and the analysis underpinning it is, from a tourism perspective, robust, realistic and soundly based.  The Minister fully agrees with the group's conclusion that this is a critical time for the Irish tourism industry and that it is essential Government and State agencies respond with focused and effective actions, to sustain the industry in the short term and to maximise its potential in the medium term.When the report was published, the Minister stated his intention to engage in consultations with other Ministers involved on the implications of the recommended actions in the report affecting them and their Departments.  Some actions are properly matters for Government as a whole, particularly in the context of the budget and Estimates, and the Minister will raise the report of the renewal group with his colleagues in that context.This Department is also following up on the recommendations of the tourism renewal group with other relevant Departments, agencies and other organisations, especially where they are ascribed a lead or support role.  The Minister has already asked his Department and the agencies under its remit to look directly at progressing the recommendations addressed specifically to them.  The Minister is also considering the recommendation of the renewal group that a small group be established to oversee and pursue the implementation of the framework for action, on the lines adopted in following up on tourism strategy reports previously.The Minister is satisfied that the tourism renewal group has fully met its terms of reference.  The group's detailed analysis of the tourism sector and broad-ranging consultation has resulted in a clear focused report with soundly-based recommendations.  Drawing on the report of the group, the Minister is determined to take the lead in identifying and driving the right measures to assist in ensuring that tourism survives and remains a major industry for Ireland and to position the sector for recovery and growth as the Irish and global economies get back on track.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	180	I would be grateful if the Minister of State would convey my good wishes to the Minister, Deputy Cullen.  I hope he will make a speedy recovery.I appreciate the Minister of State's comments.  My concern is focused on the five survival actions recommended in the report.  The first of these is maintaining spending on overseas marketing.  I support this because if a product is not on the shelf, nobody will buy it.  That is important and the Minister recognises that.It is the second recommendation, the abolition of the travel tax, which is my main concern.  There is a clamour right across the industry, and particularly from the airlines where the immediate burden is felt, to abolish this and this has been borne out by the renewal group.  The report states that the group considers that any apparent immediate fiscal benefit from the air travel tax is more than out-weighed by the actual and potential damage to overseas tourism earnings due to the additional cost wedge on Irish routes vis-à-vis other possible routes for carriers.  That is the key issue.Perhaps the hotelier in Kerry does not recognise what this is doing to his or her business, but the airlines recognise it.  For an island country, there is nothing more important than access.  If people cannot get access or it is more expensive or more difficult, the product we have on offer, no matter what it is, will not be bought.  That is the key issue.  Aer Lingus and Ryanair are taking planes off Irish routes and serving other destinations that are more competitive, and that is the bottom line for us.  That is the biggest threat to the Irish tourist industry.Is this being taken seriously by the Minister?  He dismissed concerns about this, stating it is not an issue.  His own group has now recommended it as an area where action must be taken.  Is it a matter the Minister will bring to the Cabinet table in preparation for the budget and will he indicate this is the single most important issue for the tourist industry which, while employing fewer every day, employs in the order of a quarter of a million people?
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	181	Obviously, maintaining marketing investment abroad is important but I suppose it is a balance between maintaining fiscal sustainability while putting in place the necessary supports for sustainable economic renewal.  The tourism renewal group has prioritised spending on marketing within the tourism budget and has advanced a range of economic and business arguments for its recommendations.  The renewal group report will certainly help make the case for investing in tourism marketing and the Minister will make that case strongly with his Government colleagues in the coming weeks.On the air travel tax, it is no surprise that a group charged with examining the renewal of Irish tourism would express concerns about the air travel tax.  As I have stated, the Government must consider its response to any measure with additional tax or spending implications within the wider context of fiscal sustainability and economic renewal.  The recommendations of the renewal group will be taken into account in framing the budget, along with the views of the Commission on Taxation, for example, but obviously I cannot pre-empt the outcome of those considerations, neither as Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism nor as Minister of State at the Department of Finance.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	182	I hope it will be more than taken into account because it would be a case of an own-goal to disincentivise the people who one wants to attract into the country.  It is important to note that visitors to our country are effectively taxpayers for the period they are here and we should not disincentivise them from coming.  On the other recommendation of prioritising spending, the Minister of State mentioned the importance of marketing.In terms of capital spending, I would like to put in a word for the cultural institutions, an area I am aware is of interest to the Minister of State, which have been starved of infrastructural investment for many decades.  They missed the boat in terms of the Celtic tiger years.  I urge the Minister of State to invest any available money, in terms of capital spending, in this area.  As this comes within the Minister of State's area of responsibility, I am sure he will have an interest in ensuring this is done.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	183	Obviously, heritage tourism is important, although it may vary a little in different parts of the country.  I attended a south Tipperary tourism seminar with the industry at which it was stated that 50% of tourists to Ireland come to visit heritage areas.  Most of the heritage in south Tipperary is under the auspices of OPW, Swiss Cottage, Cahir Castle, Cashel and so on.  While the percentage might vary a little from place to place, wearing my OPW hat, I am conscious of the need to continue to invest in those facilities and, equally important, to make them accessible as far as practicable with financial constraints and in the sense of understanding heritage.I do not agree entirely with the Deputy that our cultural institutions have been starved of money for decades.  While this was true up to the late 1980s, there has been huge investment in this area, including in the National Gallery, Collins Barracks and the Museum of Modern Art.  While a great deal has been done, more needs to be done, for example, in the National Library.  If one tours, as I did with the OPW, the innards of the National Library, one is in what is in many respects a Victorian building with various hazards.  There is no doubt that when funds become available the priority will be to invest in such an institution.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	184	On a point of order, in stating that the cultural institutions have been starved of investment, I was quoting from the submission from the Minister's Department to the Department of Finance.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	185	I, too, wish to send my good wishes to the Minister, Deputy Martin Cullen.The recent CSO figures in relation to tourism are pretty stark and a little scary.  The report, while good, is overdue, particularly in terms of the five survival actions contained therein.  That the proposed actions are called "survival actions" implies serious urgency.  Perhaps the Minister of State will state what actions will be prioritised.The air travel tax is an issue we have all raised in the House or by way of parliamentary question.  I put it to the Minister of State that this issue must be addressed.  The Minister has up to now refused to take this matter seriously.  It is important this issue is addressed as part of the survival actions.  The Minister of State stated in his initial response that a group will be set up to oversee implementation of the actions.  Will this be yet another quango and what in the Department prevents or precludes it from overseeing implementation of those actions?
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	186	Tourism in the year to August is down approximately 11%.  The overall figure for this year is likely to be closer to €7 million than €8 million.  Some sectors of the economy have been hit worse than that.  I do not believe that any country, certainly not Ireland, can afford to underestimate the economic importance of tourism, particularly given that it is such an employment intensive industry which is spread throughout the country.  I apologise I have forgotten the Deputy's other question.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	187	When are the promised actions——
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	188	The Deputy asked about the Department's role.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	189	Yes.  Also, when can we expect these actions to be initiated?  A point made in the report is that tourism is as important as agriculture.  While I agree agriculture is an important industry for this country, why is it that we do not have the same noise around tourism as we do around agriculture?  Why have we not had the same level of activity or concern around tourism from the various Ministers involved?  Tourism is a very important industry for this country now.  While it has enormous potential, we have heard little about it from the Ministers involved.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	190	Implementation groups are often established following the publication of a report which includes recommendations.  I do not see any problem in this regard.On when the actions are likely to be initiated, the Minister will first need to know the outcome of the budget's Estimates deliberations before announcing what exactly the bodies under his aegis will be able to do next year.  I am sure the different agencies are planning their campaigns down to the last detail.  What exactly they will be able to do will depend on their budgetary allocations.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	191	We must move on.  I call Deputy Upton for a brief supplementary.

Why do we need yet another new body to promote and progress it?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	193	We have dealt with only two questions.  We must move on.

I will communicate with the Deputy on the matter.  I am not clear whether persons outside the Department or public service will be involved.  In principle, an action group is established to oversee implementation of a report with detailed recommendations.  It is normal, in terms of bureaucratic procedure.

#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	198	That will be a first.

The programme places an added emphasis on the sectoral areas under the Minister's ambit, in particular in the radically changed and challenging fiscal and economic circumstances in which we now find ourselves.In the arts sector, the renewed programme makes commitments to host major international events, ensure supports provided by the Irish Film Board are maintained, produce a ten-year development strategy for the audio-visual sector and assess the suitability of the GPO complex as a site for the Abbey Theatre as well as promoting the development of an important new Irish arts and business centre in New York.In the sports sector, the programme makes commitments to complete a new sports facilities strategy, build on the Irish Sports Council's programmes to remove barriers to participation in sport and to continue to deliver on the successes achieved by the high-performance system.  In the tourism sector, it makes commitments to develop the potential for food tourism, walking and cycling tourism as well as developing a rural and marine recreational industry.  In the period up to 2012, the suite of Discover Ireland websites will be positioned as exemplars of an information, content and reservation tourism system and we will develop tourism business from new emerging growth markets in the Middle and Far East.  In addition, in view also of the capacity of the arts, sport and tourism sectors to drive economic and employment prospects, the programme makes commitments to expand community arts schemes and associated physical spaces for artists and community groups, capitalise on the proximity of the London 2012 Olympic Games, and position Dublin as an important centre for conference tourism business and Ireland generally as an important international destination for cultural tourism.All commitments in the renewed programme for Government will be progressed as speedily as possible.  The commitments in the area of this Department are challenging yet realistic, and the Minister is determined to ensure their full implementation to contribute to the achievement of the overall political goals envisaged in the programme.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	200	A number of measures in the new programme for Government relate to the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.  I wish to inquire about two of these, both of which the Minister of State mentioned.  One was the wording of the commitment to the film industry generally.  This is an area of interest to the Green Party because it is noted as a contributor to the smart economy.  The programme states, "We will ensure that the supports provided by the Film Board are maintained".  However, one of the things about which the arts community is concerned is that the Irish Film Board itself be maintained and that the funding should not come from some other Department.  It was suggested in the McCarthy report that it would go to Enterprise Ireland.It would be catastrophic for the film industry if this were to happen.  I do not know if the Minister of State is aware that the Minister, Deputy Cullen, is of the same view.  Years of experience, expertise, knowledge and international credibility now reside in the film board——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	201	Can we have a question?
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	202	Is the Minister committed to maintaining the Irish Film Board, as opposed to merely the supports for the film board?My second question concerns the development of Dublin as a business tourism centre.  I recently read reports in the papers that the Convention Centre Dublin is in financial trouble.  Apparently Spencer Dock Development Company is having difficulty in accessing finance to finish the job.  Has the Minister had meetings with the developer and is it likely it will be able to fulfil the terms of the contract?  Have there been any emergency meetings?  Can the Minister advise the House on what will actually happen?  I understand there are already several bookings for the conference centre but the problem is whether it will be completed.  I understand the company is now borrowing from Treasury Holdings, which is itself going into NAMA.  There seems to be a difficulty there.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	203	I agree with the Deputy about the importance of maintaining the credibility of our film industry and of Ireland as a location for making films.  On several occasions in Dáil Éireann the Minister has outlined the benefits accruing to Ireland from having a vibrant film industry and the crucial role of the Irish Film Board.  The Minister welcomes and supports the commitment in the renewed programme for Government to the continuation of supports for Irish film making.  The Minister has also pointed out that the recommendations of the special group on public sector numbers and expenditure programmes, which call for the abolition of the Irish Film Board, have not been adopted by the Government as policy but rather are proposals for consideration in the context of addressing the current budgetary challenges.  My understanding of the passage read out by the Deputy — this is true throughout the programme, whatever the subject — is that care should be taken in general not to pre-empt budgetary and Estimates decisions.  As the Deputy knows, one of the starting points for the Estimates process is what is popularly known as the an bord snip nua report; however, while it may start there, it does not end there.  I would not read too much into the wording of the report, given what I have outlined.With regard to the convention centre, good progress is being made.  The OPW is heavily involved.  The Convention Centre Dublin is well advanced and on schedule to open in September of next year.  Fáilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland and the Dublin Convention Bureau are working closely with the operators in marketing the centre and there are already 24 confirmed events, which are expected to have a significant impact on tourism business.  Neither in deputising for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism nor in my own capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW have I been made aware of any difficulties of the type to which the Deputy refers.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	204	I am not sure whether I got a "Yes" or a "No" answer with regard to the Irish Film Board.  I think the Minister of State is saying we should wait for the budget.The Minister should inquire into the issue of the convention centre because I am sure the reports in the newspapers are not inaccurate when they say there are financial problems.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	205	I would make the point that practically every enterprise in the State is to the pin of its collar, to a certain degree, in managing the present economic situation.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	206	I appreciate that, but if I had a contract going on for several years — 25 years, I believe — with a body that was in financial trouble, I would be asking questions.

#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	208	The development of a national sports facilities strategy was originally a commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government 2002-2007.  Before commencing work on the strategy, an assessment of the sports capital programme was undertaken. This was done in the context of an expenditure review of the programme, which sought to assess the benefits that the investment had yielded to date and identify any difficulties or inefficiencies associated with the operation of the programme.  This review, which commenced in 2003, took longer than expected to complete due to the scale of the programme and the time required to analyse the volume of information and data that was collected during the review.The expenditure review report was completed in 2005, following which an inter-agency steering group was established by this Department to oversee the development of the strategy.  The group comprised representatives from my Department and the Departments of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Education and Science, Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Finance, along with the Irish Sports Council, the National Sports Campus Development Authority and the County and City Managers' Association.  Consultants were engaged to assist in the development of the strategy.In order to generate a clear picture of the important issues to be considered in the provision of sports facilities, a wide range of stakeholders, including other Departments, local authorities, national governing bodies of sport, local sports partnerships, sports clubs and interested individuals were consulted during the drafting of the strategy. A review was also carried out of existing national and international reports, studies and strategies relating to facility provision.A draft national sports facility strategy for the period 2010-15 has now been completed within my Department and has been circulated to a number of other Departments and relevant bodies for observations.  Any comments received will be taken into consideration and the Minister intends to submit the strategy to Government shortly for its consideration and publication.  The aim of the national sports facilities strategy is to provide high-level policy direction for future investment and grant assistance at national, regional and local level.  The strategy also identifies the wider economic, health and social case for continued investment in sports facilities.  It aims to prioritise areas for future investment and to ensure continued impact in the relevant areas.As the Deputy will be aware, no new applications for funding under the sports capital programme were invited in 2009.  It is the Minister's intention that it will be on the basis of the new strategy for sports facilities that future funding of such facilities will be determined.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	209	It is beyond me why it has taken so long for this strategy to be put in place.  We got the review and report on tourism within a matter of months but the issue of a strategy and review of sports capital funding has gone on for years.  The outcome of this is that sports capital grants are not available.  We do not know why this is the case or when they will be opened up again.  If we had the strategy in place and knew what was in it, we could make progress.  We have all been concerned about the sports capital grant, but nothing has happened.  We were able to get action on the entire banking system overnight.  We sat here one night and the Government voted the proposal through.

Some €725 million was spent on this area between 1998 and this year.  I am sure the Deputy is as aware as I am, from observation in her constituency, of the transforming effect on many clubs and facilities the sports capital programme has had.  I said to the previous Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy John O'Donoghue, that if the rest of Government worked as well as the sports capital programme did during that period, the country would be flying.

When I was in Kerry one summer just after the sports capital grants had been announced, the message on the front page of The Kerryman  was “Thanks Minister”, but there was no thanks and several inside pages carried howls of complaint from sports clubs in Kerry that had not received grants.  This fact should be borne in mind.

Approximately €56 million was allocated this year and it is being spent on previous commitments.  Some previous commitments will still require to be paid for next year also.  Nonetheless, as indicated in my reply, consideration is being given on the basis of the new strategy as to what form future funding will take.  As the Deputy will appreciate, like everything else, this depends on budgetary and Estimates decisions which I cannot pre-empt.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	222	The sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, is the primary vehicle for Government support for the provision of sports facilities and equipment in this country.Since 1998, through the sports capital programme, the Government has invested over €725 million in over 7,400 separate sporting projects.  This investment has transformed the Irish sporting landscape, with improved facilities in virtually every village, town and city.  The facilities funded range from basic sports facilities and new equipment for the smallest clubs to regional integrated multi-sport centres and national centres of sporting excellence.This investment is evidence of the importance that the Government places on sport.  Sports facilities that are well-planned, built and managed have the ability to act as focal points for a community and allow more people to get involved in healthy activities.  Participation in sport is important for many reasons.  For individuals, participation has health benefits, builds confidence and gives people a sense of their worth.  For society as a whole, sport can reduce antisocial behaviour while sporting success has the ability to lift the spirits of whole counties and even the whole country.Two reviews of the sports capital programme have been undertaken in the past.  The first covered the period 1988–98 while the second covered the period 1999–2002.  The national sports facilities strategy will provide an improved policy platform for any future rounds of the programme.  For further details on the strategy, I refer the Deputy to my reply to the previous question.No decision has been made on the timing of future rounds of the programme.  However, €56 million has been provided in the C1 sub-head of the Department's Vote in 2009 out of which grants are paid for the provision of sports and recreation facilities.  Almost 1,300 payments, with a total value of €47 million, were approved by the Department from this sub-head by close of business on 19 October.  All of the €56 million provision will be distributed to grantees in the current year in line with the previous years.
#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	223	I am a little confused by the Minister of State's response.  The question concerns the review and is pertinent to the discussion we had on the previous question.  The bottom line with regard to what I and the public want to know is who decides on the allocation or distribution of the sports capital funding?  Is the Minister of State aware of the deep dismay that exists with regard to the geographical distribution of sports capital funding over the years?Deputy Mansergh mentioned the sports strategy.  In a five-year period, County Kerry, for example, got €20 million and my constituency of Mayo got €10 million.  The Minister mentioned headlines in The Kerryman when sports funding was allocated there and the criticisms of those who did not receive grants.  I can show the Minister of State another headline, which states, “Former Minister left ‘bill’ of €124 million in sports grants”.  Are we paying for the withdrawal of sports capital funding now because too many promises were made in 2007 and in the lead up to the general election?Between 2006 and 2007, some €173 million was allocated in sports capital grants.  In 2008, some €50 million was allocated, but there have been no grants allocated in 2009 and there is no prospect of them in 2010 if I understand the Minister of State correctly.  Is it his view that the review should ensure the allocation of grants is distanced from the political system, particularly if the distribution is such as that we have been getting?  For example, in County Kerry a swimming pool project was allocated €5 million in 2006, yet the response to the previous question stated the strategy was completed in 2005 and that funds would be targeted.  Some €5 million was provided for a pool in Killarney in 2006, when there were 15 other swimming pools, and in fact that project is no longer viable and may be closed down.  Will the Minister of State please answer those questions?
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	224	I shall certainly answer them, and in no particular order.  I would not be pre-empting what is going to happen in 2010, and I do not believe my answer pre-empted budget decisions in either a positive or negative direction in that respect.
#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	225	I should be delighted if the Minister of State would announce they are coming back.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	226	My experience, based on being a Deputy and Senator, in regard to grants has shown me that the applications are looked at very professionally by civil servants, assessed and marks awarded based on their quality.  In 2007 I had the experience where many clubs in Tipperary were getting grants, except for the one with which I was associated.  One has to live with this and I have been present at constituency level meetings between organisations and the Minister, where people went away with the impression that their applications would be favourably looked at.  When the decisions were announced, however, for objective reasons they unfortunately did not qualify.We have seen many examples in the agricultural sphere, but I suppose it is true of all Government grants that they tend to get oversubscribed.  I am around long enough to remember the home improvement scheme of 1985 and the successor Fianna Fáil Government was still paying out grants on that up to 1990.  Every so often with such schemes, and particularly in economic circumstances such as we have at present, it is necessary to pause and consolidate, to deal with existing commitments and a Minister is not in a position to take on more.  However, what the situation will be in 2010, as to whether new applications will be invited, I cannot pre-empt.
#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	227	I see from the answer to Deputy Upton yesterday on the "sunset clause", that clubs which were awarded grants subsequently had them withdrawn.  The figure came to €27 million over the last five or six years and €8 million in 2008.  Can the Minister of State guarantee that this money will be put back into sports funding or that it will not be lost to sports capital funding?  He must be aware of the desperation among sports clubs and organisations for any type of financial encouragement, however much reduced.  As regards the review, we obviously want to get away from a situation where Deputies are ringing clubs and telling them to get their applications in as they are going to be granted money.  We must end that practice, and introduce a fair system.  The money that has been allocated is good, but it needs to be structured better than it has been in the past.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	228	Certainly, the programme operates on the principle that if a grant is not used after a year or two, then it is lost.  In those circumstances, funding not used by club X goes back into the general fund and can be applied to commitments for clubs Y and Z.

Notwithstanding these constraints, I am pleased to report that planning permission has recently been obtained for phase one of the National Sports Campus.  As the Deputy will be aware, the planning permission includes provision for a multi-sport national indoor training centre to provide world class facilities for more than 20 sports; sports science and medical facilities; accommodation for sportsmen and women; all-weather synthetic pitches for community recreational access; and a national field sports training centre catering for rugby, soccer, Gaelic games and hockey.Meanwhile, refurbishment work on the former central meat control laboratory has recently been completed and this will provide a headquarters for the Irish Institute of Sport.  The provision of further funding for the National Sports Campus project is now being considered as part of the Estimates process for 2010.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	232	The budget this year for the National Sports Campus is €4 million or thereabouts, I understand.  The McCarthy report wants it abolished altogether.  I do not agree with that as I believe we need a national sports facility, to supplement the moneys we have spent on local sports facilities.  As the Minister of State says, it now has planning permission and there is a budget of €4 million.Under a freedom of information request it has come to my attention that the National Sports Campus has a contractual commitment of €9.5 million for project management and design for phase one of the project, but there is no budget whatsoever for that.  On top of that it took over the Abbotstown lands this year and the maintenance costs for this is an additional €1 million for which there is no budget.  The international benchmarking report, last year, said that the aquatic centre alone would need an annual subsidy of €1.5 million, and there is no budget for that either.Can the Minister of State say what meetings have taken place between the Minister and the sports campus, to discuss the fact that it has contractual commitments?  What consideration is being given to the fact that it may have to withdraw from these contractual commitments?  What will the cost be, not just the financial cost, but in terms of the loss of expertise in standing down the design team and the lost momentum in providing these facilities?  It is catastrophic as far as this facility is concerned, and in terms of the Government's annual budget, let alone the budget for sports.

If it is only for five years, what realistically are the prospects of getting this started and in place within that timeframe?  Is this just another large "Bertie" white elephant legacy that we are now inheriting, with substantial amounts of money already spent, and absolutely no return?  All types of promises were made to the effect that we would have a state-of-the-art facility for the Olympics.  Usain Bolt was to come here, according to the Minister, Deputy Martin Cullen, but the Jamaican team is now going to Birmingham, for example.  Realistically, what is happening to it?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	235	Perhaps the Deputy might table a parliamentary question in this regard, if the information is not available.

On a more general issue, over many years there has been a tendency to politicise this project in respect of a former Taoiseach.  However, at its core are some very worthwhile facilities that are worth providing.

Is that feasible?  Has it ever happened in history that a Government agency has been forced to withdraw from a contract claiming that it cannot pay for it?  This is the position in which the sports campus finds itself.

#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	245	I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 and 110 together.Since 2001, Government support for the horse and greyhound racing industries has been provided under the horse and greyhound racing fund, which was established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  In 2004, the Government put in place regulations to increase the limit of the horse and greyhound racing fund from €254 million to €550 million to continue the fund for a further four years to 2008.  By the end of 2008, a total of €545.8 million was paid out of the fund.  The remaining balance in the fund at the start of 2009 was €4.2 million.  Some €68.1 million has been allocated to the fund for 2009 and a regulation which increased the level of the fund by €63.907 million has been made.Funding of both Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon supports two very important productive industries and helps to sustain the important role of horse and greyhound breeding and training enterprises in the development of the rural economy.  These industries together account for an estimated 27,500 direct jobs, generate very substantial economic activity and make a vital contribution to the rural economy, including farm incomes.The funding given to the greyhound racing sector helps in sustaining a tradition that has existed for hundreds of years and in underpinning the economic activity in what are in many instances less affluent regions of the country.  The funding has also contributed significantly to the almost €90 million that has been invested in the improved facilities now available at greyhound tracks around Ireland.The funding has allowed Horse Racing Ireland to undertake a capital investment programme that has underpinned growth in the sector.  The funding has allowed Ireland to develop into a world centre of excellence for horseracing.A review of the fund has been completed and is currently being considered in the context of deciding on the future funding options for these industries.  The level of funding to the horse and greyhound racing industries in 2010 will be dependent on overall budgetary conditions taking into account the significant contributions that these industries make to the economy in general and the rural economy in particular.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	246	This year's budget for the horse and greyhound racing fund is €68 million of which I believe it is estimated €31 million would come from the betting tax.  That was the forecast at the beginning of the year and I suspect that the outturn is considerably less.  One way or another, the Exchequer was going to invest considerable money into the industry.  All sides of the House would accept that this is not sustainable.  I believe the industries themselves recognise it is not sustainable.  They want as much as we do for the industries to provide the tax to support them.For some time the Minister has been saying that he is considering alternative forms of tax.  However, he says that one month and the next month he comes in and tells us how difficult it is to find an alternative form of tax and particularly to capture the on-line betting.  Given that the review is complete, is it possible to bring forward a form of tax to ensure these industries can survive?  I note that the submission of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism to the Department of Finance offered savings as a result of a new form of tax.  Therefore, can the Minister of State confirm that a new form of tax, including perhaps capturing on-line betting, has been found?
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	247	I cannot pre-empt what further decisions will be made on either tax or funding in the context of the budget and Estimates.  I am certainly well aware of the arguments the Deputy has put forward.  If she is expecting me to mark her card as to exactly what will happen, I regret I am unable to do that.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	248	The Minister promised the review of the funding of the industries.  The review has taken place.  My understanding from the Committee Stage debate is that it was to be discussed in the House.  We have not had that opportunity.  We are lining ourselves up right beside the budget and there is no decision.  We have all agreed that it is a really important industry that needs to be supported.  However, from where will that funding come?  I understand the Minister of State may not be able to answer that question today.  There has been total failure to tax Internet gambling.  The Government has also capitulated on taxing bookies.  There are aspects that can and must be addressed.  There are opportunities.  It does not need to come from the Exchequer's standard tax take.  It is really important for us to know the plan prior to the budget.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	249	I wish to confirm that the Minister gave a commitment to bring the matter to the Dáil to give us the opportunity to discuss it.  As the Minister of State is a Tipperary man, I know this important industry is close to his heart.  It is an export service industry and a regional industry that provides jobs in areas where there are very few other jobs.  It is of great value to the economy.  I can envisage it being put on the long finger and then the opportunity will come to stop the funding because of the financial situation facing the Government.  I am sure there are opportunities to capture tax from these industries to fund horseracing and greyhound racing.  I want the Minister to outline to the House the details of the findings of the review.  I ask the Minister of State to bring that to the Minister to ensure that it happens between now and the budget.

Of course the equine industry is very important to the entire country.  As the Deputy observed, it is particularly important to County Tipperary.  Together the two industries employ approximately 27,500 people with approximately 80% in the horse industry and 20% in the greyhound industry.  I was formerly a nominee of the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association when I sat in the Assembly that Deputy Mitchell's party apparently wishes to abolish.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	251	We are moving off on a tangent.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	252	I presume the Deputy is referring to the commitment in the programme for Government in the context of retaining existing jobs and supporting viable but vulnerable businesses.  This commitment is to continue the apprenticeship programmes at the national cultural institutions.  The national cultural institutions operate various internship, apprenticeship and placement programmes, having regard to the individual institution's requirements and facilities.  These programmes will continue notwithstanding the moratorium on public service numbers.  Any costs borne by the individual institutions, as heretofore, would be met from their annual grants-in-aid.The National Gallery of Ireland is involved in graduate internship programmes, whereby graduates are taken on in the education, library and visitor services departments on short and long-term voluntary internships at different times during the year.  It is also sponsoring a year-long internship in conservation, funded by the Heritage Council, during 2009-10.  The gallery and the National Museum are involved in various transition year student placements during the year.  The Chester Beatty Library offers a short–term and a one-year internship in conservation and from time to time makes places for internships in other areas, when possible, but it is a less formal arrangement than the conservation placements.The Crawford Art Gallery has several different internships running at any one time, in collaboration with colleges in Ireland and also the University of Trento.  These include a student who is currently working on a gallery signage design; and a post-doctoral researcher from California on a six-month internship, researching meta-data tagging, website development and collections management software.  The Crawford Art Gallery is the Irish national correspondent for Association Pepiniere, a cultural network based in Paris that organises residencies for artists throughout Europe.  There are currently three artists in Cork on six-month residencies under the auspices of this programme.  They will be exhibiting their work at the Crawford Art Gallery at the end of their residency period.  There are two students from the University of Trento due to arrive under the auspices of the Leonardo programme.In regard to the National Archives, this institution has had a conservation scholarship or internship programme in operation since 2006.  Most recently, two conservation scholars have been awarded contracts for services for the 12 months commencing in September 2009.  The scholarships are open to graduates in paper or archives conservation who graduated in either the current year or the previous two years, and are awarded on foot of a competition.  The arrangement is mutually beneficial as the scholar gains essential work experience while we gain skilled conservator services.The National Library has operated a studentship programme for some ten years now.  Under this programme, four 12-month placements are offered in the areas of library studentship, archives studentship, Irish history research studentship and conservation internship.  One would expect that the effect of these projects would be to foster and develop the talents and expertise of those involved in assigning them in their chosen fields into the future.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	253	I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply and I welcome the commitments.  What prompted the question is that it is a particularly tough time for emerging artists right across the spectrum of arts and culture.  We have to be proactive in providing opportunities for them, keeping them in productive employment and improving their skills while they hope to get into full-time employment.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	254	The Deputy will be aware of the 2009 budget announcement of the rationalisation of agencies under the aegis of this Department to include the amalgamation of the National Archives and the Irish Manuscripts Commission into the National Library of Ireland to become the National Library and Archives of Ireland.  In the case of this merger, the structure will become clearer when the necessary legislation has been finalised.  This will require substantial amendment to the National Archives Act 1986, the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997 and the Heritage Fund Act 2000.  The memorandum and articles of association of the Irish Manuscripts Commission, and its position as a guarantee company, will be extinguished while the functions of the commission will be transferred into the new body, mutatis mutandis.  As the Minister has previously stated, the Department has considered the corporate and legislative position of each of the institutions in order to draft proposals for the appropriate legislation to give effect to the decision to merge these bodies.That merger will take place in the context of a federal-type structure whereby the different bodies would keep their identity.  To take one example, I would be very familiar with the Irish Manuscripts Commission, which does fantastic work.  I can think of a couple of productions last autumn which the Taoiseach launched at Birr Castle, including the 800 to 900 page Ross papers, covering the period from the 1640s through to the mid-20th century.  These contained fascinating material both about the Confederate wars and Sir Lawrence Parsons, who later became Earl of Rosse, was admired by Wolfe Tone and was a leading anti-Union member of the old Irish Parliament.More recently, I reviewed for The Irish Times three volumes of the journals of the Irish House of Lords, which were again fascinating.  Deputies might not be aware that the origin of the free envelopes scheme is the mid-17th century.  It was a measure designed against Charles I to allow free correspondence between MPs and the people, and its effect was extended to Ireland during the Cromwellian period.  Few of us think of that scheme as having its origins back then.  An interesting feature of that scheme is that not merely could MPs, now TDs, send post free of charge to their constituents, but their constituents could send letters to them free of charge.  Somewhere in the past 300 years, the reciprocal nature of this arrangement has gone missing.  Whether it would be worthy of revival or whether we have enough post to deal with is a matter for debate.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	255	That is fascinating, although I hope the Minister of State has not eaten into my speaking time.  I appreciate that some further consideration along the lines of a federal arrangement between the Irish Manuscripts Commission, the National Library and the National Archives is taking place.  However, the keeping of an archive is a State function and I do not believe it should be in a semi-autonomous body like the National Library.  Be that as it may, my key concern is when any of this is going to happen.  The Minister of State knows, as I do, the state of the National Archives, including the building where it is located and the way it is managed at present.  It is in an extremely difficult position because of the uncertainty about when the legislation will be introduced.  Staff are leaving and not being replaced, and the whole institution is running down and beginning to moulder.When is the legislation likely to come?  Will the Minister of State agree something must happen in the National Archives given the huge problems caused by staff leaving and not being replaced?  Quite apart from the cultural tourism element, the National Archives is part of our heritage, yet is being kept in a biscuit factory.  The current arrangement is neither sustainable nor acceptable.  After many years of the Celtic tiger, nothing has happened, which is a disgrace.  I am sure the Minister of State would agree, if he could do so privately.  Is there any hope of bringing forward the legislation so that some new direction is given?I am particularly concerned with the National Archives, although I realise the Irish Manuscripts Commission will be included in any arrangement that is made.  My problem is that nothing is happening.  I examined the legislative programme and this legislation is dealt with in the back pages, where it is impossible to give a timeline.  Can the Minister of State enlighten me as to when the legislation will be brought forward?

My main concern is not just with what one might call institutional organisation questions, which consist at the top level of some kind of overarching co-ordination and management and, at the bottom level, shared back office services, which obviously make sense.  The proper conservation of our archives and access to them is also important.  Brilliant work is being done by historians on the basis of the archives, and new archives are becoming available all the time, such as the Bureau of Military History and the IRA military pension files, which will be available by 2016.  For the sake of the economic, social and cultural history of the country, I would dearly like the Land Commission records to be made available to historians.

The successful delivery of this project is a priority for my Department and the Government in the renewed programme for Government and the national development plan.Arising from the original Government decision to relocate the Abbey Theatre to a site provided by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority at George's Dock, an inter-agency steering committee was set up to oversee the project.  The committee is chaired by my Department and comprises representatives of the National Development Finance Agency, Office of Public Works, Abbey Theatre and Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  A project team, chaired by the Office of Public Works and comprising representatives of the same agencies as the steering group, was also established and met on more than 20 occasions.  A considerable amount of technical, legal and financial due diligence was undertaken to ensure this project was progressed and that the best solution possible was put in place.To date, €219,590.32 has been expended on design, engineering, architectural, financial and legal fees.  Significant progress had been made in finalising the accommodation brief, international design documentation, financial stress testing, technical and engineering feasibility and layout, the majority of which are project as distinct from site specific, in the event of decisions being taken by Government to procure the new Abbey Theatre on an alternative site.  In that regard, the Office of Public Works, in conjunction with my Department and the Abbey Theatre and with relevant external technical input, has commenced an assessment of the GPO complex to ascertain its feasibility as a location for the redeveloped national theatre.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and An Post will also be engaged in this process.  There are many technical issues involved in such an assessment and a full report will be brought to Government in due course.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	265	This project certainly seems to be a complex undertaking.  The preparation for a design competition has been ongoing for years and three Ministers have been involved in the process, but no decision has been made.  There has been a substantial outlay in money and time and various experts have been enlisted to provide the design completion specification.  The question is whether that specification is site-specific, in which case the GPO proposal, which would have been most welcome five or six years ago, is nothing other than a red herring if it would require us to go back to the drawing board.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	266	Everyone would agree there is a critical decision to be made in this regard.  A considerable degree of pressure has been taken off the Abbey Theatre following its recent refurbishment on the existing site.  I understand the board is satisfied that the theatre will be able to continue for the next five or six years until a new site is developed, hopefully in time for the centenary of the Rising in 2016.  As I said in my reply, the vast majority of spending associated with this project to date — I mentioned a figure of some €219,000 — is project specific as opposed to site specific.  In other words, the vast majority of it could be transferred into the GPO if that is the decision.  It is important to note that while the programme for Government declares an interest in going down that road, all the complexities of the proposal will have to be fully explored and identified in order to ascertain whether it is feasible.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	267	It is amazing that this process has gone on for so long until now, quite suddenly, we have had an about-turn.  From where did the impetus come for this about-turn in terms of relocating the theatre to the GPO?  Will there now be a requirement for more consultants to be engaged to look again at the GPO?  Even after such evaluation has taken place, is there still a chance that we will revert to plan A?
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	268	The concern is that the proposal is merely a time wasting exercise.

I participated in a debate on this issue in the Seanad in June 2008 at which point the clear course being pursued was to locate the theatre at George's Dock.  Since then, there has been a shift in thinking of which I became aware at a meeting with the Taoiseach, the Minister and the Secretary General last June.  Once I was aware of that, I instructed officials in the Office of Public Works accordingly.  I understand the GPO was considered some years ago as one of four or five options, so limited work had already been done on it.  On the question of consultants, the vast majority, if not all, of the work is being done in-house by the Office of Public Works.

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	275	When I spoke earlier, I made the point that the entire package of proposals which make up the instrument of ratification is a unique Irish blend.  It contains substantial treaty issues, guarantees, assurances, a solemn declaration and a national declaration by Ireland.  When a Commissioner for each member state is added to the mix, it becomes something of an Irish stew.No other country has received as many concessions, protections and reassurances as Ireland.  It is little wonder that Czech President Vaclav Klaus is emboldened to demand some assurance, declaration or guarantee that the Charter of Fundamental Rights will not apply to the Czech Republic.  For a small country we have left our mark on the Lisbon treaty, as we did on the Nice treaty.  We have got our Irish solution to our Irish problem.  This is not something to boast about, as it reflects an attitude that is ambiguous, inward-looking and instinctively questions the motives of others.  The 26 member states which make up the European Union were perceived to want to interfere with our taxation system, neutrality, education system, family structure and personal relationships.  We are only satisfied when they make a public confession to the contrary.We cannot continue to indulge in the luxury of saying "No" to Europe on the first voting occasion, so that when we have squeezed sufficient concessions and assurances from our EU colleagues — with whom we negotiated the deal in the first instance — we become good Europeans again.  We must accept as a people that we cannot always have two bites of the cherry when it comes to the ratification of EU treaties.  Unwittingly, we are undermining the integrity of the European process and it is inevitable that many other EU member states like the Czech Republic will follow in our footsteps and become a shrill cacophony of discordant voices seeking concessions pertinent to their national sensitivities.  No process could live with that and the EU would quickly founder and self destruct.  For the last 18 months, the British eurosceptics have been cheering us on from the sidelines because they want to see the dismantling of the European project.  It is not the Irish electorate which is at fault.  It is the political leadership which lacks all direction and conviction when it comes to EU matters.The European project has never been presented or perceived in Ireland as a great political peace and solidarity initiative, perhaps because we never experienced the horrors of the Second World War that traumatised every one of the other 26 member states.  Instead, successive Irish Governments have used Europe as a scapegoat, blaming it when things go wrong and taking the credit themselves for the benefits that have accrued from the EU.  When a difficult treaty comes along, they transform the EU into a golden goose, or a cash cow that delivers funds for every conceivable project in Ireland.  There was no pot of European money to offer during the first referendum on Lisbon.  However, by the second referendum in October 2009, the traditional carrot of European money to create jobs, stimulate recovery and beat the recession had become the main argument for a "Yes" vote.  Now is the time to address the Irish EU democratic deficit and to become good Europeans by discarding the begging bowl, and pointing out that the EU is good in itself for Ireland, for the member states and for the world.I welcome the statement today by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he will be bringing proposals before the Government on how best to deal with EU matters.  Next week, Heads of State will discuss high level appointments such as the president of the EU Council, the high representative for foreign affairs and security policy and the Commission itself.  The Government too readily backed the candidacy of José Manuel Barroso for the Presidency of the Commission and appears to be equally supportive of Mr. Tony Blair for the new post of president of the European Council.  These are traditional political candidates, who do nothing for the peoples' perception of the political make-up of the institutions of the EU.  What is needed is some lateral thinking with which the public can identify.  It seems to me that an international figure like Ms Mary Robinson would make an ideal president of the Council.  She has been both a strong and respected establishment and anti-establishment figure, and she has recently received the US President's award for her contribution to the promotion of global human rights.This is particularly true now that the Lisbon treaty contains a re-statement of the principles and values underpinning the European Union in terms of human rights and adherence to the Charter of the United Nations.  Moreover, the Charter of Fundamental Rights is now part of treaty law.  Equality is a fundamental right and women are sparsely represented in the institutions of the EU. Mary Robinson's appointment would send out all the right messages, namely, that the EU is not a stuffy bureaucracy which rewards retired politicians like Tony Blair, a person has done absolutely nothing for the Middle East peace process since he was appointed two years ago.  In fact, the appointment of Tony Blair would send out the wrong signal to a European Union which is developing a robust security and defence policy of crisis management and conflict resolution, formalising the European Defence Agency and establishing the new status of permanent structured co-operation.  While Mr. Blair's role in the Good Friday Agreement was laudable, his enthusiastic and controversial support for the George Bush's invasion of Iraq is not the message which the EU should be promoting through its new institutional appointments.  I ask the Taoiseach to consult with the Opposition party leaders with a view to getting agreement on a suitable candidate.We should remember that ten years ago the Lisbon treaty originated from the need to deal with the democratic deficit and the public perception that the European Union had become far too bureaucratic.  It was decided that we needed to address its identification as a type of institutional, remote operation.  Now is the time to make appointments that would move away from that perception and bring a breath of fresh air to the Union's institutions.As well as giving domestic effect to the provisions of the Lisbon treaty, the Bill before the House amends the European Union (Scrutiny) Act 2002 by updating the definition of "measures" to take account of changes consequent on the entry into force of the Lisbon treaty.  Indeed, the entire scrutiny process is relatively new.  Until 2007, it formed a minor part of the functions of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, being confined to a sub-committee of that committee.  The 2002 Act must be thoroughly examined and revamped.  If the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny is to carry out the necessary parliamentary oversight envisaged in the treaty of Lisbon, resources must be provided in support of its power to amend legislation.  The Joint Committee on European Affairs also needs the necessary resources to do its work in the context of new developments.The new role of the Oireachtas is governed by Article 48 of the Lisbon treaty, which deals with a number of issues, such as the amendment of treaties through the ordinary revision procedure and the simplified revision procedure, which is known as the passerelle, or bridging, procedure.  The Oireachtas will also have a substantial new role in consulting the Commission and the EU institutions on policy development and legislation.  This is one of the key new areas in the Lisbon treaty.  It will require the Houses of the Oireachtas to examine the operation of their current business and to ensure they conduct their business in a different way that encompasses the new developmental role of the parliaments of the member states in the operation of the EU.  The Union's business will have to become far more central to the business of the Dáil and the Seanad.  No longer should it operate on the periphery or be confined to committee meetings as it is at present, by and large.Section 4 of the new Bill continues to provide for the use of statutory instruments to give effect to the adoption of European law, including the introduction of indictable offences by secondary legislation.  The European Communities Act 1972, which allows for ministerial regulations that warrant a fine of up to €500,000 or terms of imprisonment of up to three years, was amended by the European Communities Act 2007.  While that is merely being reaffirmed here, I do not think it is an acceptable development within the operation of the European Union.  In effect, it is anathema to the whole thrust of the Lisbon treaty, the purpose of which is to streamline the EU institutions, to make them more accountable and transparent, to make the entire operation of the EU more democratic and amenable to the perceptions of the public and to increase public awareness of the Union.I do not agree that line Ministers should be able to create serious criminal offences purely on the basis of their judgments and opinions, without reference to either House of the Oireachtas.  The mere fact of passing a statutory instrument and lodging it in the Oireachtas Library for 21 days does not constitute a proper democratic way of dealing with EU legislation.  This area must be re-examined, although that cannot be done in the context of the Bill before the House.  If we are to eliminate the democratic deficit and assure the people that nothing is going on behind closed doors — I refer both to decisions taken in Europe and the transposition in this House of decisions taken in Europe — it is important for decisions to be taken on the floor of the Dáil, rather than in ministerial offices.The use of such instruments is not how the democratic process should work, with the best will in the world, even if we have excellent civil servants.  The process must take place openly and be subject to examination, amendment and scrutiny.  It must be done by these Houses, rather than by means of ministerial instrument.  For that reason, I will oppose section 4 of the Bill.  When we get around to considering how we will conduct our business in the future, I hope we will examine this legislation and come to the conclusion that we should abolish the proposal that will allow for the broad use of statutory instruments, particularly in relation to indictable offences.

The people have spoken, for whatever reason.  If I wanted to go down that road, I would ask for the next referendum to be held after the forthcoming budget.  In such circumstances, I wonder if the people would accept the con job that was perpetrated, to the effect that the Lisbon treaty would help the economy and bring an end to the recession, to try to buy votes.  Some 1,214,268 people voted in the referendum earlier this month.  Of those entitled to vote, 38.8% voted "Yes" and 19% voted "No".  That just 58% of those entitled to vote did so is an indictment of the failure of public representatives, of all political parties and none, to secure high turnouts in referenda.  The views of almost 42% of those who were entitled to vote were not reflected in the final result.The turnout in the recent referendum increased by five percentage points when compared to the 2008 referendum.  I cannot explain away the difference in the vote this time as I did in the case of the Nice treaty, by pointing out that the "No" vote remained virtually static in terms of numbers, but not percentages, between the first and second referendums.  On that occasion, all the extra votes went to the "Yes" side.  On this occasion, there was a substantial swing from the "No" side to the "Yes" side because the people were bullied or frightened into voting "Yes".  The "Yes" side's creation of the illusion that the referendum was on the membership of the European Union meant people were confused.  There was never a doubt about our membership.I have mentioned my concerns about voter turnout not only in respect of referenda but also in respect of local elections, European elections and general elections.  As with the first referendum on the Lisbon treaty, the turnout for the second was at its highest in the affluent areas.  Through the good work of many groups, including the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice, local community groups and political parties, we managed to increase the turnout in some of the working class estates in Dublin.  However, on this occasion the turnout in most working class areas was only in the order of 50% or 55%.  When one compares this statistic with the turnout in Chapelizod, 77%, Terenure, 87%, and Templeogue, over 80%, one realises just where the "Yes" voters came from.My constituency, Dublin South-Central, had one of the highest "No" votes, which I regret was not above 50%.  In Drimnagh virtually every box produced an outcome of "No", and the same was the case in Crumlin.  The vote in Ballyfermot was overwhelmingly in favour of the "No" side, running between 55% and 60%.  The residents of the Oliver Bond complex voted "No".  Some voted "No" in Inchicore and the residents of Bluebell voted "No".  In Cherry Orchard, the proportion of "No" votes in one box was 89%.  This shows that those who were not visited by the Celtic tiger, namely, people in working class areas, do not trust the Government.  They have seen that the Government has failed them.  It has failed to deliver for them because it was too busy looking after the bankers and speculators.  It promised them much and led them up the garden path of public private partnership for the regeneration of flat complexes and areas.  These promises collapsed.  We saw an example of it this week in St. Theresa's Gardens.The Government said it would tackle the drugs, alcohol, crime and unemployment problems in the aforesaid areas but failed time and again in every respect.  If the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, or any of his colleagues was on "The Apprentice", currently showing on TV3, he would be fired.  As Mr. Bill Cullen says on the programme, "You are useless."The Minister of State's fellow travellers on the campaign, those in the unions and the Labour Party, have let down the working class through their support for the Lisbon treaty.  As I said during the referendum campaign, shame on them.  Their decision will come back to haunt them.  I cannot figure out how they could not see the agenda of the European Union in recent years.  It is anti-worker.  Given the current economic climate, the Government should, at the very least, have argued for additional protections for workers.  Additional supports should have been secured for the millions now redundant on dole queues across the Union.  Additional resources for the retraining and education of workers and people in the dole queues should have been made available.  An opportunity to protect the Irish people whom the unions and Labour Party purport to represent was rejected.  A signal could have been sent out during the first referendum campaign and prior to the declaration that there was to be a second referendum that unless there were enforceable guarantees and changes to the treaty text, there would be a "No" vote in this country.Last year after the first referendum on the Lisbon treaty, which resulted in a "No" vote, I believed the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Gilmore, when he said, "The Lisbon treaty is dead".  Perhaps it was foolish of me.  Deputy Gilmore later gave the treaty life, as did some others in the Opposition benches.  Deputy Costello referred to people being emboldened.  The Labour Party had an opportunity to be emboldened so as to demand effective changes but it did not take up that opportunity.  The Deputy said we cannot always have two bites of the cherry.  One should have been enough, in which case a proper message would have been circulated not only to the Government but also to the other Governments in the Union.  The message is that a second vote on the same treaty should produce the same result: "No".  The message now being circulated is that one should not worry about the ratification of treaties by Ireland because if its electorate gets it wrong the first time, there will be no problem because it can be bribed or bullied into changing its mind, on the basis that this has been done twice already.I hope the Irish will not rue the day they passed this referendum and hung a noose around the necks of future Governments and generations, and around the current Government's ability to govern in the people's best interests.  Our interests are now playing second fiddle to those who are behind the European project, which project is dominated by larger countries with a NATO-based and pro-nuclear agenda.  Most of these larger countries have an imperialist past and some have an imperialist present.Many other issues arise in respect of the referendum campaign but I will just touch upon one.  I do not know which bright spark came up with the idea of attaching the polling card to the document.  This never happened before.  It caused considerable confusion, not only among those on the "Yes" side but also among those on the "No" side.Comhghairdeas dóibh siúd a sheas an fód i gcoinne fheachtais an Rialtais agus cairde an Rialtais a dhein iarracht scanradh a chur ar an bpobal gan vóta a chaitheamh i gcoinne Conradh Liospóin arís.

I welcome the endorsement of the Lisbon treaty by the Irish people on 2 October.  They recognised its importance.Let me refer to some of the comments of Deputy Ó Snodaigh, who implied the result of a referendum reflects satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the Government.  If this were true, I would be quite happy based on the result achieved in Clare.  There was an average of over 73% across the boxes.

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	283	I would like to believe this is a reflection of the work I did.  The extent of the "No" vote may reflect the work of Deputy Ó Snodaigh.  Perhaps the outcome was based on our work and not on the level of satisfaction, or otherwise, with the Government.  The result in my county does not reflect the current level of satisfaction with the Government given the difficult measures it must introduce.  This is understandable and is well recognised.The second referendum campaign was good and well fought on both sides.  There were some disingenuous elements, but I am certainly not accusing Deputy Ó Snodaigh in this regard.  He has had the opportunity to debate this issue on a number of occasions and at all times he was balanced.  I might not have agreed with his approach, particularly on the economy but, to the best of my knowledge, neither he nor any of the members of his party sought to draw on issues extraneous to the treaty which could not, according to any fair-minded person's approach, be linked therewith.  Unfortunately, however, some individuals continued to draw on extraneous issues during the second referendum campaign.  The debate during the second campaign was better informed than that during the first.I disagree with Deputy Ó Snodaigh's suggestions that it was through coercion, bribery or bullying that the Irish voted as they did.  They people benefited from the first campaign and had an opportunity between the two campaigns, during which time there was much more heightened awareness of the issues at stake and much more debate about the Union, to weigh up the pros and cons and make an informed choice.  Voter turnout was the highest for any referendum on our involvement in the European project to date, as stated by other Members.  Clearly, people voted with a greater understanding of what was involved.The outrageous approach of Cóir in the campaign was very disingenuous.  I will not name any individual but it is fair to identify the role of the organisation as an entity.  They used religious objects and documents to suggest that the Catholic Church supported a "No" vote.  While there were divergent views among the Catholic bishops, they made it clear that there was nothing in the treaty to prevent a Catholic from voting either "Yes" or "No" and that the issue should be decided on the basis of political or economic arguments and not of ethics or morals.  I found it difficult to receive documents, either in my home or in various churches, which contained religious imagery to make them look as if they came from the hierarchy and sought to create a negative opinion in the minds of readers.  It was particularly disgusting to see some groups linked to Cóir seeking to portray the Charter of Fundamental Rights as a tool of destruction and to play on the fears of vulnerable people, including people with a mental handicap, alcoholics or other marginalised people.  These documents gave the impression that with the passage of the Lisbon treaty the Charter of Fundamental Rights would give powers to the State which it did not previously have and would limit the freedoms of people who were vulnerable or in difficult circumstances or that their children would be impacted upon or lose their liberty.  That was particularly disgusting and I hope such tactics will never be used by any group in the future.The biggest difficulty of the "Yes" campaign was in convincing people who did not have full information that the treaty had merits.  It is difficult to provide information in a vacuum when people do not have the concrete knowledge of what the European project is about.  If we learned anything between the first and second Lisbon referendum campaigns it was the importance of generating a greater level of debate on the European project in this House.  This issue must be addressed.  While I recognise the contribution of the Opposition in promoting a "Yes" vote, the Fine Gael proposal to abolish the Seanad is a retrograde step.  We have an opportunity, in reforming the Dáil and Seanad, to give a much greater level of access to European information and to further European debate within the Seanad.  On the Order of Business today, the Labour Party and Fine Gael voted against the proposal that the Dáil sit in committee next week to discuss Committee Stage of the NAMA legislation.  We need to develop committee debate rather than indulging in the tit-for-tat debate which we often have in the House and which does not reflect well on the real work of the Oireachtas.  There is a notion that if we are not sitting in plenary session and throwing insults at each other across the floor that we are not doing our work.  We would achieve a greater level of work more beneficial to the people and the State if we sat in committee, with public access, to debate issues of strategic national and international importance.  This matter could be addressed by the Whips in terms of furthering the campaign for a greater level of debate on matters of European importance.I recognise the prominent role played by Fine Gael, the Labour Party and a number of Independents in debating and canvassing to communicate to the people the importance of passing the treaty.  I recognise the tremendous efforts made by various groupings such as the IFA, the ICMSA, other farming organisations, trade unions and IBEC.  I particularly recognise the work of two groups which represent civic society.  They are We Belong, which was headed by Olivia Buckley, and Ireland for Europe, which was headed by Pat Cox and involved Brendan Halligan, Regina O'Connor and many others who gave their time voluntarily because they believed in the European project and in the importance of a "Yes" vote.  This coming together of people outside the political sphere was extremely welcome and should be harnessed in terms of how we continue to promote the European project.The efforts of the Government, of Government advisers and of national and international officials and civil servants must also be recognised.  There was a difficult campaign in negotiating the legal guarantees with other member states.  It was possible at an early stage to obtain declarations of intent but to obtain them in a legal format along with agreement that they would be attached as protocols was a well negotiated position.  A debt of gratitude is due to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and the civil servants and ambassadors in the member states who worked effectively on that campaign.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party also used their contacts in their respective political groupings in the European Parliament and played a significant role, which should not go unnoticed.The legal guarantees on taxation, social and ethical issues and militarisation were hard fought but vitally important because research had identified them as issues which had forced the Irish people to vote as they did in the first referendum.  The securing of those guarantees, together with the solution of the representation issue of the loss of a Commissioner, ultimately brought the Irish people around to the belief that nothing in the Lisbon treaty would be harmful to the achievements of successive treaties or to the growth of the European Union.Deputy Costello made it clear that this referendum campaign was more difficult than others because the Irish perception of involvement in Europe had always been enhanced by a belief that there was something of monetary value in it for us.  I believe we have moved beyond that.  Our understanding has improved and we have matured as a member of the European Union.  We now see ourselves, not as part of a hand-out culture but in a central role in guiding the future direction of the European Union to our benefit and that of others.  We have the capacity to steer the European ship to our benefit and that of others in a collaborative way.  The passage of the treaty referendum, difficult as it was, shows the maturity of the Irish people.  It is important that the efforts of all concerned be recognised.Having brought European matters to such a level of understanding and awareness, it would be a pity to allow all of that to dissipate.  We have come through an intensive round of discussions.  After the defeat of the first referendum the Commissioner issue was resolved in December 2008 and this was followed by the build-up to the legal guarantees being agreed in June 2009 and the referendum campaign in October.  There is now continuing talk about when the treaty will come into force.  All of this keeps the European project in the people's mind and in the media.  We all hope that President Klaus of the Czech Republic will sign the treaty.  My concern is that once that matter has been dealt with our discussion on Europe will fade away.  That would be a great pity.  It behoves us in this House to try to ensure that European matters remain at the forefront of the agenda so that as we evolve with Europe we do not have to go back to deal with the information deficit that existed prior to the first referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  Through the co-operation of like-minded parties in this House there should be a capacity to do that.  When the provisions of the Lisbon treaty are adopted a greater level of debate will be created in the Oireachtas whether through scrutiny or the subsidiarity checks.  We must work more imaginatively to ensure that we retain that knowledge base and build on it as we move forward.The sub-committee of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs that was set up in the wake of the failure of the first referendum on the Lisbon treaty identified a number of considerable weaknesses in the European knowledge base.  That is something we must address.  That was largely as a result of our belief that we participated in Europe to gain something rather than for us to be part of the growth and development of Europe.  We must work to try to develop a consciousness of the importance of the European Union.  We will achieve that if we keep on debating and discussing that agenda in this House.We also must examine the education system and the curriculum as a means to achieve that.  Unfortunately, there is not enough of a knowledge base or understanding of the origin and development of the European project for children in school as they progress through exams and become voters and progress through life.  They are unaware of its foundation as a peace process and what the results of working together to the benefit of all can bring.  Perhaps some of the reason for that relates to the fact that we often talk about the European project in some abstract form.  We spend too much time talking about institutions and the relationships between them rather than looking at the much more concrete elements of Europe, what the issues are, what is the purpose of the existence of that collaborative environment that is the European Union and where and how we should progress with it.  Ultimately, that must be our focus.There is also a requirement on the media.  It is easy to put the blame on the media and I do not wish to do that.  We must be imaginative in how we generate debate in the Oireachtas and if we are successful in that regard the media will report on it.  It was interesting that through some of the research we carried out in the sub-committee of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs and, in particular, hearing the views of the media, it emerged that if issues are not debated in this House and are left to be debated in the context of the European Council, the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament or the Committee of the Regions or some such forum, they will not find their way into the common discussion fora in this country and will not be reported in the media.  If we can succeed in having a greater level of debate and discussion we can achieve success in that regard.There is a considerable role for the national broadcaster, especially in view of its public service obligation, which is ultimately funded through the licence fee.  There is a need to look more broadly at promoting our relationship and involvement with Europe and what the European project is all about.  A magazine programme or documentary that is screened at 11.30 p.m. or midnight is not helpful in that regard.  Such programmes need to be much more mainstream and based around a weekly schedule.  Ultimately, that should be the role of a public service broadcaster; to look to areas that might not be commercial.  It is clear that if it was commercial at the outset the public broadcaster would have the type of programmes that generate revenue through the commercial arm.  For that reason there is a role for RTE.  The broadcasts must be at a time that attracts an audience so as to develop a knowledge base of the European project in the community.  I look forward to that discussion being dealt with through the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources.Unfortunately, the debate on Europe often centres too much on abstract issues and dealing with EU speak rather than focusing on how the European Union applies on an ongoing basis to the daily lives of people in this country.  Unfortunately, in many instances the only time there is reference to the European Union is when something negative arises.  Other speakers referred to that point, namely, that the Government and politicians take credit for the positive and seek to blame the Union for any negative consequence that might arise from directives and legislation.The Union needs to focus, either through the Commission or the Council of Ministers, on addressing the challenges facing Europe in a much more upfront and concrete way rather than talking about the back-end institutions, and how those issues relate to the lives of the citizens of the various member states.In terms of the financial and economic situation we need to consider the role of the Commission and the Union in developing policies on banking regulation.  We need to discuss that issue more in this House.  We need to look at the capacity of the Union to develop stimulus measures to reignite economic activity in the various member states.  We also need to consider the co-ordination of efforts to resolve the banking problems.  It is clear that a small country such as ours with a small national banking infrastructure cannot be expected to resolve those matters in isolation.  People would begin to see and appreciate the benefit of the collaborative working between member states through the Commission and the various institutions of the Union, but that needs to be addressed more.  A greater level of debate is required on the role of the European Central Bank, ECB, and in particular the support it is giving the State through the funding arrangement that will be in place for NAMA.The future development of the European Union must be communicated better.  It is incumbent on us as Members of this House to use all the elements we have at our disposal.  I again appeal to the Fine Gael Members present, whom I know have a great regard for the European Union and the way it works — that has been the case throughout the history of that party — to use the Seanad and the committees of this House to ensure there is a much greater level of debate, understanding and promotion of what that work is all about.

#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	286	I compliment Deputy Durkan on his outstanding role as Chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs and the meetings he held, most notably with the party leaders and Bishop Treanor.  The clarification given during those committee meetings was most effective in its analysis.  The meeting with Bishop Treanor in particular was very effective.I welcome the emphatic decision of  the Irish people on 2 October to support the ratification of the Lisbon treaty.  They made a very important decision both for the future of Ireland and the future of Europe.  They have shown their confidence in the EU and reinforced their commitment to the values and objectives of the Union.  I believe that with this positive vote, the Irish people have demonstrated their commitment to the European project.  They have recognised the benefits which EU membership offers both economically and socially.  They expressed their wish to remain at the centre of the Union and to constructively engage with our EU partners in a spirit of solidarity.By voting "Yes" they also wish to see a Union that works more efficiently, effectively and democratically.  Delivering the reforms in the Lisbon treaty must now be our priority as we move away from institutional questions and towards facing the challenges of the 21st century.  The treaty cannot enter into force until it is ratified by all member states.  Currently, only one member state has not completed ratification.  I hope agreement can be found at the European Council later this month that will allow President Klaus to sign the Czech Republic's instrument of ratification.Europe needs the reforms contained in the treaty so that we can act more effectively and efficiently in delivering the results our citizens are demanding in this time of economic uncertainty.  I am convinced that the Irish people's vote was a vote for democracy.  They want to see the democratic provisions contained in the treaty fully implemented.  Therefore, I welcome the European Union Bill 2009.  It will give effect to the new powers contained in the treaty, which will enhance the role of national parliaments, including this House, within the EU.  There is no doubt people across Europe are concerned about democratic accountability and legitimacy within the EU.  Therefore, it is vital that the democratic provisions in the treaty are properly implemented.  It is important, under the principle of subsidiarity, in the context of the role of national parliaments that we take serious account of such empowerment.The implementation of these provisions is important for bridging the knowledge gap that has developed among the general public in regard to the European Union, a point to which Deputy Dooley alluded.  The referendum campaign in 2008, and to a lesser extent this year, demonstrated that people do not fully understand the EU and how it works.  It is difficult for people to trust something they do not fully understand.  I strongly believe that the more people know about the EU and how it works, the more likely they will be supportive of the Union and its actions.  It is therefore vital that the Oireachtas properly and publicly debates EU matters.  The democratic provisions of the Lisbon treaty and the Bill before us will facilitate this.I would like to focus on section 7 of the Bill, which provides for the operation of new powers for the Houses of the Oireachtas under the terms of the Lisbon treaty and, in particular, the application of Protocol No. 2 to the treaty on the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.  These new powers will enable Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann, for the first time, to have a direct input into the EU's legislative process.  Article 5 of the Lisbon treaty states that national parliaments will from now on have the formal role of ensuring that the institutions of the EU comply with the principle of subsidiarity.  This means we will have the important job of ensuring the EU acts only within its defined objectives and competences and when EU-wide action would be more effective than action at the national level.  That is an important and effective role for national parliaments in ensuring the EU has only that remit.The Lisbon treaty, through its protocol on the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, introduces a new early warning system known as the "yellow and orange cards".  The Bill gives effect to this system within the Oireachtas.  The Oireachtas will have the right to send to all EU institutions, within eight weeks, a reasoned opinion stating why it considers a draft legislative act does not comply with the principle of subsidiarity.  This is where the Secretary General of every Department will have an important role to play.  With the short timescale of eight weeks available to submit a reasoned opinion, it is important to work with other parliaments to address concerns about draft legislation.  The Minister of State might allude to the powers and responsibilities of the Secretary General of each Department to identify such issues of concern.  If one third of other parliamentary chambers across the EU agree with the Oireachtas, the Commission or Council must review its legislative proposal.  For proposals on judicial co-operation in criminal matters and police co-operation, the threshold is only one quarter.  This is the so-called "yellow card".  If one half of national parliaments believe that a legislative proposal is in breach of subsidiarity, the Commission must decide either to withdraw the proposal or to continue with its proposal to the Council and the European Parliament.  The principle of subsidiarity means the laws should be enacted here and that they are not in breach of the laws enacted by the Dáil.  In other words, it is a bottom-up process.  The timeframe of eight weeks available for debate is important.  We are all aware of directives such as the nitrates directive and the raised bogs directive that were not debated, but since we took on a scrutiny role in 2007 our job is to ensure that controversial directives, once they are introduced, are effectively debated and amended before being agreed at EU level.  If the Commission decides to continue with its proposal, it must also prepare a reasoned opinion which would be considered by the Council and the European Parliament together with the reasoned opinions of the national parliaments.  If the European Parliament, by a majority of votes cast, or the Council, by a majority of 55%, agree with the national parliaments, the draft legislative proposal will have to be withdrawn by the Commission.  This is known as the "orange card".  This is an important provision.  This is where Leinster House has a critical role to play.  It is important to have an objective and in-depth analysis of draft legislative proposals.If the Lisbon Treaty is ratified, and I believe it will be, this early warning system and the powers for national parliaments will come into force.  We need to bear in mind the timeframe involved.  I know from my experience as chairperson of the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny that directives are often received too late for such scrutiny.  I put down a clear marker that concerns about such draft legislative proposals need to be put forward immediately.In line with the Lisbon treaty and Protocol No. 2, the Bill bestows these powers on both Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann equally.  It is important that the Houses of the Oireachtas put in place the measures that will give these new and important powers practical effect — the Minister of State might indicate how it is planned to introduce these powers - in order that we can play our full and active role in the new early warning system.  The Joint Committee on European Scrutiny, of which I am chairperson, is ready to play its role in ensuring that these new powers are given such effect.  The joint committee is well placed to play a constructive role in the operation of these new powers.  As the committee responsible for the operation of the European Union (Scrutiny) Act 2002, we have during the past two years built up a high level of institutional knowledge as well as experience and expertise in the scrutiny of draft EU legislative proposals.  We already have in place the systems and resources which ensure that all legislative proposals are scrutinised appropriately.  Also, through our involvement in COSAC, at which Deputy Durkan is an effective participant, we have taken part in its subsidiarity testing pilot project and have produced four reasoned opinions to date.  Therefore, we already have experience of how the “yellow and orange card” system will work.In May 2008, the joint committee published a report on the enhanced role for national parliaments in the Lisbon treaty.  The report makes a number of conclusions and outlines the issues which may need to be examined with a view to implementing the new powers of the Oireachtas under the Lisbon treaty and as provided for in the Bill.  It was the committee's clear view that the Lisbon treaty provisions on enhancing the role of national parliaments will strengthen the democratic legitimacy of the EU and make it more accountable.  The "yellow and orange card" arrangements will also mean the EU will have better legislation, because it will be better informed of conditions in member states.  National parliaments will for the first time have the power to directly influence the EU political and legislative process.An issue that we will need to consider before deciding how best to implement these important new powers is the possible need to amend the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann to underpin the mechanism whereby each House will have a separate vote in the yellow and orange card procedures.  In addition, if it is decided that the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny will play a role in the operation of the new powers, the current orders of reference of the joint committee may need to be changed to take account of the Lisbon treaty provisions and the provisions of the Bill when enacted.The effectiveness of these new powers will also depend on the level of public awareness of this important work.  It is not simply good enough to have greater democratic accountability but it must be seen and communicated beyond this House.  There is a need for greater public awareness about the current work of the Oireachtas on EU matters and about its future role when the Lisbon treaty enters into force.  I reiterate my proposal that an EU information office could be established within the Oireachtas with the remit of communicating to the wider public the work of the Oireachtas on EU matters and acting as a reliable, impartial source of information on the EU.The Joint Committee on European Scrutiny has been active in trying to enhance its media profile and to make its work more accessible to the public though the preparation of easy to read meeting reports and improvements to its webpage.  However, I believe that it is important that EU matters are debated more within these Houses. I reiterate the committee's recommendation that reforms are made to Dáil and Seanad procedures to ensure regular consideration of EU matters in plenary session.  As an initial measure the Dáil and the Seanad could each allocate at least one day per month to EU matters.  They could consider reports of the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny on important draft EU laws as well as the ongoing work programme of the Joint Committee on European Affairs.I welcome this Bill.  It provides for the operation by this House of the new powers for national parliaments as contained in the Lisbon treaty.  These new powers will make the EU more democratic and more accountable and I believe this is what the Irish people want, as expressed in their decision on 2 October.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	317	In the shortest possible time, I will say this.  I compliment those who worked in the course of the recent campaign.  The campaign did not start, like somebody thinks, in the past six months; it started two years ago.  It was a very difficult campaign.The first campaign was unsuccessful because the people said that they did not know enough about the subject, and the campaign on the "Yes" was poorly fought on several grounds.  I compliment my colleagues on the Joint Committee on European Affairs and the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny for the work that their members, of all parties, did.  They travelled up and down the country with no thanks.  Nobody said to them that they did a good job in the interests of democracy or otherwise, but they did their job unstintingly and unselfishly, and at great personal sacrifice.In the second campaign the Joint Committee on European Affairs changed tactics altogether and decided to take a different route.  The committee selecting the leaders of the various parties in the Houses of the Oireachtas to address it and, through the web-cast, anybody outside who wanted to hear and see it.  That was a good decision and it worked extremely well.I say without prejudice to anybody that the leaders of the parties in the House should take full credit for the way in which they displayed their knowledge of the subject and the way that they carried the respective campaigns to the committee and, through the committee, to the people.  I compliment the Taoiseach for the way he started, and he was excellent on the day.  There is no question but that it had a significant impact.  I particularly compliment Deputies Kenny and Gilmore for the courageous decision that they took because it is never easy for an Opposition party at any time, regardless of in whose interest it is, to support the Government, particularly at a time when there may be other issues on the horizon that might distract attention.  They did a great job without exception and they led their respective supporters in an exemplary way.While all people outside this House can criticise — they do so on a fairly regular basis and they sneer at the institutions of the State, including the Oireachtas — the leaders of all the parties showed that they were prepared, when the issue was put to them, to do their job to the best of their ability, and they did it.  I do not want to leave out the leader of the Green Party, Deputy Gormley, who also came before the committee and gave leadership, which is what this was all about.  Even Deputy Ó Caoláin, with whose opinion the majority of members on the committee did not agree, came before the committee and spoke, through the committee, to the people who were his supporters outside.All in all, democracy was seen to work and ultimately, the people responded in an emphatic manner.  If there was any doubt about it on the first occasion, there was no doubt about it on the second.  I believe the correct decision was taken then.What happens from here on in is hugely important.  I agree with what the Minister stated today, that in the future Ministers going to the Council of Ministers meetings should come before the relevant committee.  He is correct because that is where it starts.  Afterwards when a directive is mooted and it comes back, it must be dealt with by the relevant committee, which in that case is the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny.There must be a greater commitment on the part of the Houses of the Oireachtas, in terms of time and personnel, to how we will deal with the issues relating to the European Union.  This is a much bigger and serious issue than it was previously.  There is no use in Members making a token representation, or whatever the case may be, in the hope that it will be all right.  That will not work.We in this House need to liaise more with our colleagues in other member state Parliaments to know what they are thinking.  If we do not do that, matters have a way of evolving without our knowledge.  When that happens, matters get out of control.We are only a small country.  We took a decision for the rest of Europe.  It was an emphatic and important decision.  We can continue to play that important role within the European Union if we become involved.  If we stand off and do as some other countries have done in stating a wish to opt out from this or that aspect we will eventually end up in a situation where we are on the outer perimeter where we will no longer be influential and where we will hear about the decisions after they are made.  That is not where we should be as a nation.In the short time available to me, I am unable to address the real issues that need to be dealt with at this stage but I want to say this.  The Lisbon treaty gives greater power to member state Parliaments.  That is a two-edged sword.  The European project will move only as fast as the slowest wants it to go.  That is why it is hugely important that the members of the member state Parliaments are totally au fait with the thinking within the European institutions, including the European Parliament, the Commission and at the Council of Ministers.  If we do not make that effort, then we will not be there when it counts, we will be squeezed and we will not be able to take decisions which are in the national interest.I acknowledge that any time the Fianna Fáil Ministers were asked to come before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs before attending a meeting they did so.  It does not always happen, and it should, but it is hugely important in the democratic process that if one is to have the views of the member state Parliament on hand before going to a Council meeting, it is essential that a meeting takes place.  Such an exercise does not constitute an attempt to impose on or dictate to a Minister.  However, it should be mandatory that the Minister take the opportunity to discuss with the members of all parties of the member state Parliament before making crucial and vital decisions that may affect the entire nation.

Of all the challenges facing this country at present, the longer-term strategic importance of that decision is second to none.All the parties and civic organisations who worked for a "Yes" vote are to be commended, including our partners in Government, the Greens, and the main Opposition parties, who put country before party.  Two former Fine Gael taoisigh plus another former Fine Gael leader also contributed with their usual authority to the debate.  I also pay tribute to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs.The Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Micheál Martin, our diplomats and civil servants deserve particular credit for their skilled and patient handling of the fall-out from the first referendum, their careful research into the reasons it did not pass in June 2008 and the negotiation with our partners of guarantees and assurances which addressed all of the main issues, a strategy which was vindicated.  The proposed alternative, the bombastic demands in June 2008 of the Libertas and Sinn Féin leaders who had no diplomatic responsibility, that the Taoiseach should go to our EU partners and, on behalf of a member state comprised of 4.5 million people lay down the law in all directions to the other 495 million people in 26 other member states to tear up the treaty, and renegotiate, if not subvert, the entire project seeking all sorts of opt-outs not in the national interest and make the EU treaties and their interpretations subordinate to the Irish Constitution was utterly removed from any political reality and would have wrecked our relations with our partners and our reputation for trust and reliability built up over 35 years.The analogy of the Downing Street Declaration, which explicitly referred to all parties on the way ahead and the Good Friday Agreement, did not stand up to a moment's examination.  A better parallel in terms of realism or lack of it would have been the Sinn Féin demand in 1987 for a timetable for British withdrawal with reparations thrown in.  The guarantees obtained by the Government consistent with the treaty showed up most of the critical claims made in the run-up to June 2008 as entirely baseless, with the important exception of the right of each member state to an EU Commissioner which could be re-established by unanimity using a contingency provision of the treaty.It is ironic that while the disparate "No" campaigns argued unconvincingly that the guarantees obtained were worthless, the most ardent nay-sayer to Lisbon of all outside this country, President Vaclav Klaus of the Czech Republic has indicated that he would be quite satisfied with Irish style assurances on the hypothetical question of retrospective land claims by people of Sudeten German descent and on the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  I mention this without prejudice to the position that may be taken by this country or its partners in the European Council in response to this demand, if made and which may be joined by the Slovak Government.Our European partners are also to be commended on their understanding and restraint despite their obvious anxieties and impatience after eight years of negotiations since the 2001 European Council in Laeken.  On the weekend of the result, I was representing Ireland at the annual conference of the IMF and World Bank in Istanbul.  The French economy Minister, Madam Christine Lagarde, alluding to President Sarkozy's admonition to the French people in another context that a nation needs to know to which family it belongs expressed satisfaction to me that Ireland had decided to stay with the European family.The British development Minister, Mr. Douglas Alexander, led applause for the Irish decision at a working dinner in the British consulate.  Quite apart from the effect of removing the major impediment to the euro-wide ratification of the Lisbon treaty, the decisive character of the vote has been a morale boost for the Union.  Ireland has shown that when the arguments are clearly put there is still much popular support for the European Union despite cynical belief to the contrary.As was pointed out in an article in yesterday's Financial Times, up to 18 months ago smaller states seemed to be doing better than larger ones and appeared to be the principal beneficiaries of globalisation.  This led to a certain over-confidence about what we could achieve independently and an under-estimation of the importance of the support of a partnership framework that was to a degree reflected in the June 2008 vote.The global economic and financial crisis has underlined the acute vulnerability of smaller countries.  Ireland has been better placed than most by virtue of its membership not alone of the EU but of the eurozone.  The crucial indirect supportive role of the European Central Bank is something we could not have done without in tackling the banking crisis.  A clear majority of the Irish public has understood the importance of two-way EU solidarity if we are to come through this crisis with our freedom intact.  If we do not want to run the risk of becoming even temporarily a failed state economically, we must take the necessary difficult decisions, one of which was changing our mind about the Lisbon treaty, including the notion that we did not need it and Europe could do without it.I sat next to the Croatian ambassador at a recent farewell function in Iveagh House for the Mexican ambassador.  His Government is delighted that a potential roadblock to enlargement, which is vital for stability in the Balkan region, has been removed, with Croatia likely to become a member within little more than two years.  The model of national sovereignty and self-determination that existed only briefly between 1918 and 1939 between the two world wars was untenable.  The equivalent in Irish terms was one of the Sinn Féin models, described at the time as the option of the isolated Republic.  Miraculously, we made it as a neutral country through the Second World War, but the isolated Republic between 1949 and 1955 did not provide a model, either for economic and social development on a par with reconstruction across Europe or any international influence in the post-war years.  The most important service performed by former Taoiseach, Seán Lemass, from August 1961 was to set Ireland on course for EEC membership, even if it took a decade to materialise.I do not understand the political logic of those who resist our further engagement with Europe by positing "Thus far and no further" and, "Why cannot we stay as we are?"  If it is mostly conceded that the EU has been good for Ireland, then the recommendation to vote "No" to each and every treaty must at some point have been wrong.  However, no explanation is ever provided.  How any class of Republicans, including dissidents, could come to share so much europhobia with the British Tory Party, far more influenced by Mrs Thatcher than by Ted Heath or Harold Macmillan, is beyond my understanding.  Did not generations of Irish patriots from Hugh O'Neill to Sarsfield, Wolfe Tone, Davis, Pearse and Connolly, not seek help from the Continent?  Happily, today, there is no incompatibility between having a close relationship with Britain and an equally close one with France, Germany, Spain and other continental countries.What distinguishes Ireland's EU membership is the depth of our commitment to the European Union.  EU membership gave Ireland an equality and respect it previously did not have in the Anglo-Irish relationship, with Britain previously looking down on the Republic as a weak and poor secessionist state.  The EU, unlike the UN, which we constantly laud, has no great power directorate with exclusive individual vetoes.  Those of us concerned with Northern Ireland will be well aware of the great support given by the EU to the peace process through measures such as the peace and reconciliation fund.One would have thought that such positive differences to the advantage of Ireland and its independent status in Europe would have appealed more to Sinn Féin.  The SDLP and the Scottish nationalists have adopted a far more positive attitude to the EU.  I wonder also at the consistency of conservative groups who are ultramontane in their religion but Hibernian in their politics.As the German Constitutional Court confirmed, the EU is an association of sovereign States, not a State, even less a superstate.  The acquisition of legal personality by the EU or any other international organisation to which we belong does not alter or endanger this.  As the German Federal Constitutional Court states, it is not decisive whether an international organisation has legal personality; what is decisive is the fundamental legal relation between the organisation and its constituent member states. Direct EU representation in capitals or forums, in which we are not represented, such as the G20, could be advantageous.  Continuity of representation provided to a degree by a President of the European Council and the equivalent of a Foreign Minister will improve the coherence of the EU through which we operate and from which we benefit.  The alleged loss of our sovereignty and neutrality on this, as on previous occasions in 1972 and 1987, is neither so total nor so great that should there be, even in ten years' time, the need for ratification of another treaty by the people, they will, in the opinion of those on the "No" side, not be ready to be lost all over again, since none of their previous predictions have come to pass.  As Dr.  Johnson once said, "There is a lot of ruin in a nation".While of course we, like every other country, have to battle critically within the EU to defend our interests and ideals, it would be wonderful if we could abandon the residual element of paranoid defensiveness in some of our attitudes.  Anti-EU parts of the left-wing intelligentsia, including those who call themselves Republican, surely need to recognise that the minimally funded superstate they conjure up is a Thatcherite mantra that should have no place in their philosophy or rhetoric.  As anyone who studied her famous Bruges speech in 1988 will realise, Mrs. Thatcher was opposed to a hypothetical European superstate that recovered the power of the State, which she had been busy removing from it.As Minister of State with responsibility for procurement, at a time when wasteful public expenditure is under heavy criticism, I am very proud of the fact that the Government and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government saved €1.7 million in postal and printing costs by attaching to the polling card the leaflet explaining the basic purpose and modality of the vote.  The contract, as well as the saving involved, was widely praised by the house journal of the industry, the Irish Printer.  There were a few complaints and political criticisms claiming that voters were confused, but I received no such complaints in my constituency.The Lisbon treaty envisages an enlarged role for national parliaments.  During my time in Seanad Éireann, Ireland's MEPs were invited to the House more than once for an exchange of views, which worked very well.  As a former Senator, and also as a Minister of State who has spent considerable time participating in policy debates in the Seanad Chamber over the past 18 months, I am deeply disappointed that both membership of that Chamber and its political contribution appear to have been written off by the leadership of the main Opposition party.  Even more extraordinary is that the party's Senators, including professional Senators, should have unanimously endorsed the verdict of their own redundancy coming from their leader. Uno duce, una voce seems to be back in vogue.

A perfect example of cheap, ill-informed journalism is to be found in yesterday's Evening Herald, which talks about Senators thinking it was a good idea to swan off this week to Swansea for a meeting of the British Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body.  Attendance at that body is an important and integral parliamentary duty for its members.  I was proud to be a member for six years as a Senator and Deputy.  That body has contributed to the great improvement in British-Irish understanding which has been one of the building blocks of peace on this island and between these islands.  There is only one respect, perhaps, in which the body is or was the occasion of what might be politely called a works outing, and that was the number of journalists, past and present, who used to attend, well in excess of any subsequent visible output covering the proceedings.One of the principal causes of the loss of the first Lisbon referendum was that despite the valiant work of the Forum on Europe and bodies such as the Irish Council of the European Movement, the public felt they did not understand the treaty or where the EU is going.  While politicians must communicate, the media need to enable them to do so by showing the same interest in policy debates as in politics.  While there are many excellent and profound commentators, columnists and interviewers in all branches of the media, there is also plenty of room for improving the overall quality of content and the level of discourse.In agreement with Deputy Bernard Durkan, I hope it is not mere pious aspiration, now the referendum has been passed, that inside and outside the Oireachtas we will show an interest in trying to live up to the higher European commitment resulting from ratification.  There is one dimension of the European project that would help bind it more closely to its citizens.  Whatever may sometimes be maintained on a strict construction of the European treaties, Europe was always a political as well as an economic project, and it brought to an end centuries of destructive wars.  The missing element is the cultural one which, under the principle of subsidiarity, belongs to member states.  That should be supplemented more at EU level.  None of us would have any real difficulty in accepting the notion of a European culture and civilisation or its more active propagation.This year is the bicentenary of the birth of Mendelssohn and the death of Haydn, as well as the 250th anniversary of the death of Handel, not to mention the birth of the Guinness brewery in Dublin.

The European Union is an amazing institution that, in its growth and transformation, often gives rise to lengthy and complex documentation.  One of the interesting things about this campaign for me was to peruse the Lisbon treaty in its entirety and realise the complexity and far-spanning reach of the document and the European institutions.  The fact that everything from trade agreements with Greenland to the European Space Agency and the importation of petroleum by-products from the Netherlands Antilles can be covered within one comprehensive document shows the range and scale of the European Union.Much was made in the campaign of concerns about the possible entry of new member states into the EU, with much emphasis being placed on the prospective entry of Turkey.  It is worth taking a few moments to dwell on the possible benefits of the Union of reaching out not only to countries such as Croatia, which were mentioned by the previous speaker, but also to other countries to the east, whether Belarus or the Kaliningrad exclave.  There are other areas that could benefit dramatically from social, environmental and economic links to the EU.We must learn from the campaign.  This is not a moment to gloat or be triumphant but to reach out to campaigners on the "No" side and realise that while some of the slogans were inflated, the concerns, for the most part, were genuine.  We need to listen carefully to the voices that were raised on the "No" side and, in particular, reach out to those young people who were disaffected at best or, at worst, failed to engage at all with the EU.  There is a lesson in this for the European Parliament, the Commission and indeed the Oireachtas.  We should look to the success of the outreach programme of the Oireachtas, in which Members visit schools within their constituencies and engage with young people, responding to their questions and concerns.  I hope that both the European Parliament Office and the European Commission Representation in Dublin will, if they are not already doing so, introduce a strong initiative to bring the EU into our schools, listen to the concerns of young people and point out the benefits of EU membership.I emphasise the new importance of the European Parliament in implementing legislation within the EU.  One of the things in the treaty about which I am enthusiastic is the stronger role that will be given to the European Parliament.  I must also briefly mention the role of the Union in addressing environmental issues.  Some people on the "No" side were quite dismissive, saying there were only five words about global warming in the treaty, namely "in particular combating climate change".  However, those five words are contained with in a substantial section on the environment, which is followed by Article 194, dealing with energy concerns.  Enshrined within those articles of the treaty are the principle that the polluter pays and measures affecting town and country planning and land use that have brought and will continue to bring benefits for the European Union.  Under the citizens' initiative, one million signatories can bring forth initiatives to which the Union must pay attention.  That in itself is important.There is one side effect of Ireland's ratification of the Lisbon treaty that may sound small on the face of it but in fact will be quite significant for a woman named Amelia Andersdotter, a Swedish politician who was the second candidate on the list for the Pirate Party in the European Parliament elections last June.  If the Lisbon treaty is fully ratified, she will be elected to the European Parliament by virtue of the change in voting rules.  I am not in any way endorsing the platform of the Pirate Party, but she will be a strong, genuine and young voice within the European Parliament representing Sweden.  I look forward to her taking her seat in the European Parliament.

At no point during the Lisbon treaty referendum campaign did anybody sit back with any sense of confidence or expectation that we would see the ratification of the treaty by Ireland.  There was no sense of complacency.  As a result, we saw a successful outcome of the campaign and had a much more vibrant, committed and passionate campaign than on the previous occasion.  I have expressed my passion for Europe and for Ireland's place in Europe previously in the House and believe strongly that the Lisbon treaty is an essential and integral element of Ireland's continuing engagement in Europe and that it will lead to an improvement of the European institutions and how they function.We have had ongoing and sometimes paralysing debate about institutional reform within the European Union for well over ten years now, but we now have the opportunity to move on to a bigger and more important agenda that involves key policy challenges for Ireland, France, Poland, Hungary and each of the 27 member states and beyond.  The efficacy and successful functioning of the European Union has a reach far beyond the borders of the current member states.The issues were well rehearsed during the referendum campaign, but I would like to draw attention to key areas we have the opportunity to confront now that we are armed and equipped with a newly revitalised and invigorated European structure.  Let us consider, for example, the area of justice and home affairs.  Much crime, particularly drug and gang related crime, is a challenge that pertains not just to a country like Ireland.  Such crimes almost always have a cross-border element.  For that reason, the Lisbon treaty will play an important role in bolstering and strengthening the capacity of the European institutions to respond to cross-border crime and in enabling national police forces such as the Garda Síochána to tackle and combat it.  This is particularly relevant for Ireland.Climate change is another challenge small countries such as ours cannot face on their own.  Now, due to the reinvigorated structures at European level, we will be in a position to attend the Copenhagen summit in December with an agenda and in the knowledge that the European Union has a clearly defined legal capacity to tackle and move forward on the issues of climate change, global warming and CO2 emissions.The situation is similar with regard to the economic challenges we face.  No EU country has been immune from recession over the past 18 months and there has been legitimate criticism of the European Commission and the capacity of the Union to respond to the economic crisis.  While the Lisbon treaty does not solve this problem, it will go some way to preparing and enabling us to deal with future challenges and to helping us move beyond the economic crisis we have seen across the Continent of Europe.This legislation is important, but further legislation will be required to reflect not only the changes that will be brought about by the Lisbon treaty, but other decisions and outcomes such as those we have debated in the Sub-committee on the Future of Europe and its recommendations.  I welcome the comments made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Micheál Martin, before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs this morning.  He referred to some changes that must happen which will require further legislation later.The parliamentary reform agenda is very much in people's minds this week, not least because of some of the proposals made by the Fine Gael leader over the weekend.  Debate and discussion of parliamentary reform of both the Dáil and Seanad provides us with a great opportunity to consider how we can integrate a European agenda into the business of both Houses.  Some of the language in this Bill seems to look more towards a fluffy, nebulous and ill-defined advisory role for our national Parliament in terms of European scrutiny and scrutiny of legislation coming from the European Commission.  It does not go far enough.  It is essential that we consider some form of mandate system and direct accountability to the Dáil and Seanad with regard to the position of Irish Ministers at European Council meetings and with regard to the agenda set out by Ministers.  These must not just be advised, but be informed by the views and positions adopted by the Dáil and Seanad.  We need to reflect on this issue and come up with a more concrete mechanism that will achieve this.There is an extremely important need for scrutiny of legislation at EU level.  We have failed in that regard so far.  Ireland does not compare to other member states in terms of how we deal with directives coming from the European Commission.

We need change in this area.I echo the remarks made by Deputy Ciarán Cuffe with regard to the need to inform and educate people on European matters.  Deputy Cuffe called on the European Commission to take a more active role in schools.  We need to go far beyond that.  European affairs should have equal status with subjects like geography and history which are full subjects for the junior certificate cycle.  There is a complete lack of understanding as to how the institutions of the European Union operate.  European affairs should be a curriculum subject for the junior cycle and should be an option for the leaving certificate.  It is that important and it is fundamental to all aspects of life here.  There is an onus and responsibility on Government to educate our young people so they can engage in European issues in an informed way for the future.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	332	I thank Deputy Creighton for sharing her time on this important debate.  I congratulate her on the part she played as regional director and on a successful referendum campaign and very successful results in the Dublin region in the most recent referendum.One of the main reasons for the rejection of the Lisbon treaty in the first Lisbon treaty referendum was that rural Ireland resisted and was totally dismayed by the way in which European legislation was transposed into Irish law.  As a result, the farming community throughout the country said "No".  Most rural constituencies show that.  There is no doubt but that the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government have serious questions to answer in this regard.  I outlined to the Minister for Foreign Affairs this morning the significance of ratifying this Bill and pointed to the very important ancillary provisions in the legislation which provide for the increased parliamentary oversight of European affairs provided in the treaty.It is important to realise that over the past couple of years the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has insisted on farming by calendar.  That has been a totally futile exercise in so far as the spreading of slurry was a major issue and the best times for the appropriate weather conditions were being ignored with farmers forced to spread it in flooded fields throughout the country.  That is totally foreign to proper farming and those types of practices have to change.  I can give other examples.  An industry has been created out of inspection and regulation, adopting and implementing EU directives with the zeal  of medieval inquisitors.  Everybody in Irish farming who has experienced inspections would clearly respond in such terms.  They are being set up as criminals and fraudsters in many instances.  That is wrong and while this type of ineptitude continues, Europe will always take second place.  It is just not acceptable for this to continue and I believe the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be taking it up with his counterpart, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, to ensure that it does not continue.I can give the Minister of State a couple of examples before I hand over to Deputy McHugh.  Regarding compliance with the single farm payments scheme, and the inspections that occur, if a briar is hanging from a hedgerow, a penalty is imposed.  There is no criterion for the inspections.  In total contradiction, oddly enough, under the REP scheme a corridor about 2.5 m wide must be left so that there can be no activity within this space to the hedgerow.  That is a contradiction.  A penalty is imposed, in the first instance, on the single payment and in the other case, if there is an intrusion regarding REPS, another penalty is imposed.  That is totally reckless on the part of the Department and the officials and inspectors who insist on that type of behaviour.  It is important, therefore, to have such policies rectified once and for all.  If Lisbon and the secondary provisions of the Bill are to be implemented, it is crucial to re-open that area.I ask also that the habitats directive be re-examined.  In County Galway — as my Galway West colleague, Deputy Pádraic McCormack, knows better than I — some 75% of Connemara is designated for conservation.  More than 40% of the entire county is designated.  One cannot apply for planning permission if one is adjacent to one of those designated areas.  That is simply not acceptable.The idea that the people who have, for centuries, been cutting turf in rural Ireland, particularly County Galway, cannot continue to do so except under the derogation obtained by the Minister is ludicrous, just because we want to preserve the bogland.  This is totally wrong and must be faced up to.  Questions must be re-opened where mistakes were made in the past, to allow people to continue to practise farming and go about their other activities in a reasonable way.  Whether this is a matter for either the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government or the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, or both, perhaps the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, can persuade them that this has to stop and all the restrictions on farming must be changed.We now have a situation where people who grow grain cannot sell to neighbouring farmers because of restrictions.  Who are we protecting in this instance?
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	333	This European Union Bill cannot be passed into law without reflecting on County Donegal's unique decision to vote against the treaty on two consecutive occasions.  As one of Donegal's five representatives in this House, it is my duty to put on record what I believe to be the reasons for my country's decision to vote "No" in the referendum.  The 51% Donegal "No" verdict on Lisbon must be listened to by decision makers in Government, in Brussels and at North-South Ministerial Council level.In terms of our geographical isolation, Donegal's total land border, as the Minister of State knows, is 170 km — 158 m with Northern Ireland and 12 m with Leitrim in the Republic.  The vast majority of the county's perimeter is Atlantic coastline and the Lough Swilly-Lough Foyle shoreline.  Our unique decision can be attributed in part to our isolation.  We do not partake in the national conversation to the same extent as other counties.  Our local radio station has the highest market share in the country.  Significantly, a newsagent in my parish sells 225 local papers every week and 180 national papers, including Sundays.  The national media's united "Yes" campaign did not have a proportionate purchase in County Donegal.  The further north one goes, the greater the sense of isolation, as evidenced by the higher "No" in Donegal North-East compared to Donegal South-West.There is a combination of factors for the protest vote.  The "No" vote is a product of the anger of Donegal's marine sector and frustration with a quota system that allows Ireland to fish out of 7% of EU waters even though we own 25% of the marine territory.  Our disaffection has been longer in terms of the recession.  Our recession is longer and deeper and we did not have the benefit of the Celtic tiger.  While the Celtic tiger was roaring in the south of the country, our young men were getting into vans on a Monday morning and driving to places such as Dublin and County Meath.  We have the lowest level of disposable income per capita with 83.4% of average State income — €17,252 in Donegal as against €20,678 on average across the State.Our dependency ratio in Donegal is 56% — 18% above the national average.  A Teagasc farm income survey has shown that the average income in the north-west is €8,635 compared to €27,786 in the rest of the country.  In 2002, national unemployment was 8% while in Donegal the figure was 16.6%.  There are now 21,000 people unemployed.Regarding cynicism about EU distribution, as the Minister of State is aware, TEN-T-EA was established by the European Commission and has responsibility for managing the technical and financial implementation of the trans-European transport network, TEN-T, programme.  TEN-T-EA got money from the Commission to the tune of €4 million, which it spent on a cross-Border railway network between Cork and Dublin.  This was by way of an application which was sold to Europe as an upgrade to the Belfast-Cork via Dublin line.The impact of the Northern Ireland conflict in the context of the Border has afflicted Donegal economically and socially.  It caused problems in all of Ulster, not just Northern Ireland.  The Good Friday Agreement has to be looked at, ten years after its ratification.  It was presented to us as being about more than peace in the Six Counties.  It provided for a new society and new economics across this island.  As far as we are concerned, much of the cross-Border talk can be summed up by saying:  "When all is said and done, there is more said than done."Donegal is left in the wilderness, abandoned in Ulster, failed by Dublin and sometimes irrelevant in Europe.  I will finish by quoting from a speech made to Seanad Éireann in 1932 on a Cumann na nGaedhael motion about the economic war that Éamon de Valera was then waging on Great Britain.  A Donegal Senator bewailed the fact that the economic disharmony between the UK and the Irish State was affecting his county more severely than any other part of the Free State.  On 3 August 1932, Senator John McLaughlin, an Inishowen resident who owned a shirt manufacturing business in Buncrana, told Seanad Éireann:The people there are in the frontline trenches  . . . An unfortunate Donegal man will hardly . . . see much in the wisdom of the statesmanship that tells him to depend on himself, that we should depend on the home market, and cut him off from the only market he had.Nobody can drown the cries of the unfortunate people of Donegal who voted for Fianna Fáil, and who put them into the position as the government that cut off their best market, because no one in Ireland will feel the disastrous effects of this economic war more severely than the people of Donegal.Suffering becomes wholly malignant when lessons are not learned from it.  Some 77 years after that Buncrana Senator decried the difficulties being wreaked on County Donegal by economic divergence between Ireland and Northern Ireland, history is tragically repeating itself.  There is still economic disharmony between Ireland and Northern Ireland, and Donegal people are still in the front-line trenches.We in Donegal may come across as complainers.  We are not complainers.  There was a 13% swing to the "Yes" side.  The result in the county was 49% "Yes" and 51% "No", but democratically it came across as a "No" vote.  We have solutions to our problems at present.  We did not get the Celtic tiger; we relied on the sterling market.  However, with sterling strengthening we are in serious difficulty at present.  There are protests and disharmony among businesses that are closing down on a daily basis.  We need to provide economic solutions.  There are integrated strategies that Europe can work on, including in the areas of health, transport and education.  However, we need to see these operating on the ground in the north west.  The strengthening of sterling is creating policy gridlock at a monetary level, but we also have policy gridlock at an economic level.  We have solutions, proposals and strategies in place that will help us come out of the recession.The 51% of people who voted "No" did so for a reason.  They protested through a number of mechanisms and had a number of different reasons for voting "No".  However, there was a high "No" vote because there is a protest.  It is not about victimisation or feeling sorry for ourselves, but there is a harsh reality of the economics of being in the north west, stuck between the Northern Border and the Southern policy that is not working for us.  We need to do something.  As a representative I will be reaching out to Brussels.  The debate should be measured.  This is a benchmark and a watershed that should be used as leverage to get Donegal's entitlements.  We are not looking for any extra.  We are looking for that to which we are entitled.  Perhaps Europe could be used as a better mechanism for fulfilling the policy promises that are within and integral to the Lisbon treaty.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	334	I congratulate all the party leaders in the House on their contribution to the campaign on the referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  I also congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of State and everybody who played a part in getting the message out there.  The majority of the House were in favour of the proposal.As a member of the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny, I was interested in some of the work it did.  I have been a member of the committee for only a few months, since I lost my job at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The committee has been working very hard to get the message out particularly about the relationship between the European Parliament and national parliaments.  I was very interested in a report it produced that described the period prior to the first direct elections in 1979 at which time members of the European Parliament were appointed by the national parliaments.  Some of the people who represented this House in the European Parliament went on to be candidates and many were elected as our first directly elected MEPs.  It is a great tribute to the present committee under the chairmanship of Deputy Perry that we have debated some of these issues.  While it might have been an organic relationship between national and European parliaments at the start, we now have different roles but they have the common objective of bringing the European Union closer to citizens and contributing to the democratic legitimacy of the Union.It is well known that before 1979 a secretariat and ushers from this House were working in those parliaments, which was unique.  Whatever tension there was between national parliaments and the European Parliament at the time, there is no longer any antagonism between the two sides.  A very good role is now played by our own parliament.  I hope it will play a greater role, particularly in the area of parliamentary scrutiny as we make progress.It is interesting to talk about the relevance of Europe.  There is a leaflet we get from the EU liaison office in Brussels outlining what will happen this week in the European Parliament.  Listed are: questions with the Commission President for an hour; preparing for the European Council; reference to the new measures dealing with the dairy sector; and a debate on the budget for 2010, which is likely to call for an additional €1.5 billion to fund energy aspects of the recovery plan and an additional €300 million for the new dairy sector fund.  Climate change is on the agenda.  I particularly commend the Minister and his Ministers of State on their work on climate change.  I also commend them on their work in developing countries and the millennium development goals.If I am to mention one issue——

#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	336	I would appreciate that.I wish to refer to an issue mentioned by Deputy Burke on the habitats directive.  Like Deputy Burke, I have long fought the case of people who want to cut turf.  I declare an interest in that I also cut turf, but not in a designated area.  There is nothing in the Lisbon treaty to affect Irish control over our bogs.  Our bogs are protected under the habitats directive, which was negotiated with full participation by Ireland and freely adopted by us.  We are talking about a small number of bogs.  It was our own National Parks and Wildlife Service that listed these bogs and not a decision made by Europe.  The European Union provides considerable money — up to €500 million — to help preserve these prime natural heritage areas.  There is a case for reviewing the particular designation.  If people have been cutting turf for generations I cannot see why they would now be stopped when there is so much bog that could be conserved.  I hope that an interdepartmental group will consider that matter.I received a submission from the Council for the West, which made a very strong case outlining how the BMW region has had economic success in a European context.  While we were probably the poorest region in Europe when there were only nine member states, the accession of Greece, Portugal and Spain, and the later reunification of Germany probably meant we lost that title, and by 1991 we had a GDP per person which was less than 60% of the EC average.  Obviously many of the structures introduced in the BMW region have resulted in us making progress.  There has been great support by bodies such as the county and urban councils, county enterprise boards, Leader, CLÁR, local development agencies and regional bodies, such as the Western Development Commission, Údarás na Gaeltachta, the regional authorities and the BMW Assembly.  I obviously would be concerned that any proposals by the McCarthy group to abolish the Western Development Commission, for example, or to merge or subsume these bodies into Enterprise Ireland would affect a body such as the Western Development Commission.I hope I will be able to see this progress continue.  Obviously our membership of the European Union has been very important as has been highlighted by farming organisations and the Western Development Commission.  I join in the congratulations to the Minister of State present and his colleagues for the work they have done.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	337	I thank all the Deputies who made contributions to this important debate which comes on the heels of a referendum where an extraordinary amount of people voted.  I was amazed at Deputy Ó Snodaigh's views about the referendum, but then I am very frequently amazed at his views.  I will come back to it.  An astonishing number of people voted.  It was the highest number of people to vote "Yes" in a referendum on a European proposition.  It was an astonishing turnout.We are also approaching a very important European Council meeting.  Since the referendum Europe has begun to refocus its views of Ireland in a very positive way.  The road that has lead to this point has been a long and tortuous one, going right back to the European Council in December 2000 and followed by the Laeken Declaration the following year, which attempted to put flesh on the ideas.  The idea discussed at that time was how we would bring Europe closer to its citizens and deal with the apparent deficit in terms of democracy within Europe.  The idea goes back even further than the European Council meeting itself.  As I recall, prior to that, Mr. Joschka Fischer had launched a paper at the Humbert University in Berlin to discuss the same issue.The Laeken Declaration was an interesting starting point in that it spoke of the need for the Union to come closer in every way to its citizens and their needs.  Normally, as all in this House know, institutional treaties have been produced by intergovernmental conferences — it is frequently said they are produced in smoke filled rooms, which is not the case, but they have all been produced in private conferences except on this occasion.  Those like Deputy Ó Snodaigh who somehow denigrate the process that went into the preparation of this treaty should look at the history.  The reality was that from 2002 to 2003 there was an extraordinary innovation in the Convention on the Future of Europe.  That involved not just Government representatives but also parliamentarians from across the entire Union, its institutions and civil society.  It was open and transparent, and conducted its work in public.  For somebody to suggest that somehow this process was hidden from the public is simply at variance with the facts.Ireland's case was unique because the Irish delegation was made up not just of Government representatives but also of representatives from all of the major political parties.  I had the honour to lead the Irish delegation and it was an extraordinary experience to work with colleagues from across this House, with people bringing different viewpoints.  I well remember Proinsias de Rossa persuading me to sit in on the Social Europe group just to hear the debate there — I had actually asked to be transferred to it.  When I listened to the debate in this country in recent weeks, I could not understand why some people could not have it within themselves to accept that this had been something that was unique.The convention can be credited with putting a completely different emphasis on the preparation of the treaty.  The division of competences in the Union was addressed, a point made by Deputy Timmins in his introductory comments when he referred to creeping federalism.  The convention looked in detail at this very issue.  The conventioneers who took the view that there should be a halt to that process won out, and this treaty reflects that.  The convention was also focused on the simplification of the Union's instruments and on how we can work democratically to make the Union more transparent and efficient at the same time.The Lisbon Treaty, of course, is the outcome not just of the convention but of two intergovernmental conferences.  The first of those was under the Irish Presidency and the second followed the rejection of the treaty by the French and the Dutch.  Another period of reflection followed the referendum here in Ireland in 2008.  That period of reflection demonstrated what is good in Europe.  If we recall the day the vote was taken last year, with a negative result, the very first response from Europe was that it must listen to the Irish people and respect their view, work with Ireland because it was not just an Irish problem, and work to see how the issues raised could be dealt with.The response since then has been remarkably positive.  It is a remarkable example of the solidarity that exists within the European Union.  There was a willingness to sit down with us, to listen and to pay attention to what we asked for and make the necessary changes.  The declarations, the various IGCs and periods of reflection, the conventions and the six referenda which have been held have all been important in illustrating to people who have somehow grown suspicious of the European project that, far from wanting to force itself on the people, it wants to be part and parcel of a public evolution of the new Europe.The process has been painstaking.  The European Union is a union of states and peoples.  It is interesting to consider the work of the convention, where there was discussion as to the nature of the next treaty and whether it would be a constitution or otherwise.  One point on which there was agreement was that Europe was, in fact, a unique initiative of peoples and nations.  The nine-year process which is coming to fruition demonstrates the essentially democratic nature of the Union.  Despite the setbacks, there was never any question of rushing the fences.  At each stage, the democratic decision-making process of each member state was fully respected, which remains to this day.  When problems were encountered, they were dealt with on the basis of respect and consultation.  There was no bullying or attempt to bully or push people in any direction; there was simply respect.  Whatever the obstacles, the 27 states took the time to talk, tease out the issue and move on.The objectives set out nine years ago were ambitious and the needs identified were pressing, but the Union has recognised the need to be inclusive.  As an organisation which is based on solidarity and shared values, there was little point in setting a pace which could not be matched by the member states.  This is the essential genius of the European project.  Despite all of the frustrations which emerged over the course of the negotiations and the numerous setbacks and false dawns along the way, the Union which emerges is stronger and more effective because its citizens can see it respected the difficulties, differences of opinion and different views which informed different member states' approaches to the issue.With the Lisbon treaty, we now have a Union in which our shared values and objectives are set out clearly, equipped with institutions which will operate fairly and effectively, and tasked with the responsibilities whenever the member states decide action at the level of the Union works best, with clearly defined parameters setting out where it is best to leave issues at national or regional level.  I go back to the point made by Deputy Timmins.  It is interesting that one of the great innovations in this treaty was the very clear declaration of the conferral principal which makes it very clear we will not drift in the direction of a federal Europe which has its own powers, autonomous to the member states.  It has powers which are conferred only by the member states.In the nine years it has taken to bring this process to a conclusion, some of the challenges we face, such as climate change, have taken on an increased sense of urgency.  In recent times the economic reality has caused us to check our position on Europe.  However, the European Union which is about to come to life under the terms of the Lisbon treaty has been crafted in such a way as to give us the tools we badly need to deal with the big ticket issues, such as climate change, the economic downturn and cross-border crime.  That is what the objectives of the Lisbon treaty were, with some changes made in terms of the responsibilities of the Union; there was no attempt to grab power from the member states.In this debate, we are putting in place the final elements needed to bring a new European Union into life.  We have made history along the way — no other European treaty received as much support in a referendum in this country as the Lisbon treaty did on 2 October — and we are making history here today.  We are putting the finishing touches here in the House to a new era which will have an impact across Europe, in this country and in these Houses.  The way we do business here and in the Seanad is set to change — I am thinking particularly of the contributions of Deputies Ulick Burke and Michael Kitt.  No longer will it be the case that somewhere in the bureaucracy decisions are made without Parliament being fully involved.  One of the extraordinary changes made by the Lisbon treaty is that this House and the Seanad — the two Houses of the Oireachtas — will be involved at a much earlier date in consideration of EU policies or draft legislation than is currently the case.After the passage of the Bill, the House will have to examine the operation of these powers in management terms.  The involvement of national parliaments in the European law-making process is one of the most welcome developments since we joined the Union.  National parliaments will be able to intervene at a relatively early stage but they will also have to act relatively swiftly.  This, of course, presents an opportunity for this House and the Seanad, but also represents a real responsibility for both Houses to respond to the electorate's requirements.  One of the extraordinary things that will happen under the new arrangements is that people who are concerned about European law will have a much better capacity to deal with the issues.Before I conclude, I wish to deal with some of the specific issues raised.  Deputies Timmins and Costello spoke at the outset about their concerns on section 4.  To clarify, this section simply updates section 3 of the 1972 Act to take account of the new arrangements under the Lisbon treaty.  I take Deputy Costello's point that the Labour Party was opposed to the 2007 amendment which made it permissible in implementing regulations to provide for indictable offences.  I too had some concerns about that measure at the time, but the issue was debated in the House, a decision was made and it is now law.  Section 4 of this Bill introduces no substantive change in this but simply reaffirms the arrangement in the Lisbon treaty.I take this opportunity again to compliment Deputies Creighton, Costello and Timmins on their personal roles in the successful outcome of the second referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  Deputy Creighton referred to two specific issues in her contribution, namely, transposition and the scrutiny system.  The scrutiny system in this House is not perfect and I agree with the Deputy that it must be overhauled.  On transposition, Ireland is now within the 1% level and we have improved significantly.I do not accept the points made by Deputy Ó Snodaigh.  The recent referendum campaign produced, at 59%, one of the highest ever turn-outs in a European referendum.  Aggregating the results from the two referenda shows that 57.4% of voters supported the treaty and 42.6% voted "No".  As well as achieving a very high turnout, this was one of the highest "Yes" votes since 1992.

In page 4, line 4, before "treaties" to insert "Euratom Treaty and the other".Section 2 effectively deals with the legal personality of the legislation.  It amends section 1 of the 1972 Act to include some new definitions.  This is necessary so that all of the existing Acts of the Community remain valid for the new dispensation and are correctly expressed in the new treaties governing the European Union.  The European Atomic Energy Community, established under the EURATOM Treaty, is legally distinct from the European Community and European Union and, as such, should be expressed distinctly.  Listed in the section, in paragraphs (a) to (d), inclusive, are the Treaty on European Union, Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Lisbon treaty, and the treaties governing the European Communities.  However, even though the EURATOM Treaty is a legally distinct entity, it is not expressly referenced.I remind the Minister of State of the reservations expressed by the Minister, Deputy Martin, regarding the content of the EURATOM Treaty.  He pointed out that it was one of the original treaties, that it had not been updated since its establishment and that such updating was long overdue.  Has the Minister of State any information in this regard?  It is important that the EURATOM Treaty be specifically referred to in this legislation and that it be updated for the future.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	339	The reason for the reference to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union is they are referred to in the definitions section of the 1972 Act and that they are amended by the Lisbon treaty.  The latter maintains EURATOM as a separate entity and makes only technical changes to it.  Therefore, it is not necessary or desirable to make the change proposed in the amendment.  I refer the Deputy to the reference in section 2 that "'European Union' means the European Union, established by virtue of the Lisbon treaty and the European Atomic Energy Community".  The Deputy's point regarding the need for a review of the EURATOM Treaty is one for another day.  I certainly do not relish the prospect of further institutional review.  It would be unwise to accept the Deputy's amendment.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	341	I understand the Deputy's point but for presentation it is important that it is done in this way and that we make it very clear lest a dispute of a legal nature should arise in the future on the question of what precisely we are referring to.  Although I may have some personal views on the issue of the European Atomic Energy Community and the legislation that created it, it would be wrong to ignore the fact that the treaty touches on that area.  Presentationally, it would be a mistake to adopt the Deputy's proposal.

In page 4, line 19, after "Communities", to insert the following:"and by bodies competent under the treaties governing the European Communities".There is currently no reference in paragraph (c) to bodies competent; they are specifically excluded by the existing wording.  It is appropriate that the wording be extended to cover not only the institutions of the European Union but the bodies competent that existed prior to the Lisbon treaty.  The proposed amendment offers an improvement in the substance and the text of the provisions.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	343	Paragraph (d) includes reference to bodies competent under the treaties governing the European Union.  Therefore, it is not necessary to include this reference in paragraph (c), as proposed by the Deputy.  It would be otiose to include that reference twice.

In page 4, lines 21 and 22, to delete "those treaties" and substitute "the treaties governing the European Union".This amendment relates to paragraph (d).  I believe that “those treaties” is rather vague, and I propose that this be deleted and replaced with “the treaties governing the European Union”, which would make the reference clear.Amendment No.13 deals with a retrospective subsection in section 8, and it requires some kind of saver for the constitutional rights of the person.  It would be appropriate if it could be inserted at that stage.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	346	I am struggling with the point the Deputy is making.  It is very clear that the treaties to which we refer are  the treaties governing the European Union.  That is the point in amendment No. 13, tabled by the Deputy.  To include a reference to the treaties governing the European Union would be superfluous, because it is clear that the reference in section 8 (3)(b), to “those treaties” means the treaties governing the European Union.  The same point can be made regarding amendment No. 3.  It is again clear that the reference is to the treaties governing the European Union.It is an issue of drafting.  Some people like to make the reference on every possible occasion, and other people try to be more economical with the cross-references.  It is not necessary to do this, and the advice from the Parliamentary Counsel is that it is not necessary to do it.  We have been at this before, and I know where the Deputy's drafting suggestions come from.  We must be more economical with words in the treaties, because the more cross references that are added, the more confusing we tend to make the treaties.  Although I accept the bona fides of the Deputy's suggestion, it is unnecessary to make these cross references, as they are implicit.

In page 4, line 25, to delete "inserted by" and substitute "as substituted by".This is also a technical amendment.  It seems to me that "substituted by" is the desirable wording on this occasion.  Section 3 of the 1972 Act was "substituted" in 2007, and not "inserted".  That was the wording used at the time.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	349	I would love to help, but I have to be negative.  The Attorney General has advised that the drafting convention, when referring in brackets to a provision inserted or substituted by another enactment, is actually to use the word "inserted".  I must say we are in fairly arcane——
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	350	It is repetition of the language that was in the original Act.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	351	It is because it is actually bracketed, and that is where the term "inserted" is normally used.  Apparently, this is a drafting convention.  Given some of the debates that we have had about minor changes in wording in the recent referendum, I have become very averse to changing words at all.  The advice is very clear that the drafting convention, when referring in brackets to a provision that is either inserted or substituted by another enactment, is to use the term "inserted".
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	352	I am guided by the Minister of State again.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	353	I oppose this section.  We had some reference to this already on Second Stage.  The section refers to the European Communities Act 2007 and to the additional authority that was granted under that Act to allow the line Minister to specify indictable offences and to incorporate them into secondary legislation through statutory instruments.  This is an inordinately wide ranging power that has been granted to the Minister outside the normal operation of this House.  It goes completely against the spirit and the substance of what we are doing in the Lisbon treaty, namely, eliminating the democratic deficit so that everything is done in a transparent fashion and in an accountable fashion within the bounds of this House.  If we are now to have important Bills enacted — and this is fairly substantial — this flies against the tenor of our activities.  We should really abolish the 2007 Act in that respect and take those powers from the individual Minister and restore them to the Houses of the Oireachtas.The other aspect which underlines my argument is that we are conferring extra powers on the Houses in dealing with European Union matters.  The role of Members has been enhanced under the Lisbon treaty, yet our 2007 legislation has gone in the opposite direction.  The thrust of the discussions for this treaty since 2000 was very democratic.  The Minister of State was involved, as were other members of the Government and the Opposition.  It was hoped that we would extend that accountability into all of the activities.  It is equally important that we have it in the transposition of legislation in this House.  In so far as possible, all important legislative provisions should see the light of day on the floor of this House and the other House.  They should not be enacted behind closed doors by an individual Minister who may wish to exercise his opinion alone.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	354	I recognise that the Labour Party has had an issue with this for several years, and that it is not just a recent concern.  This matter was debated at great length in 2007 in the amendment which made it permissible that implementing regulations to provide for indictable offences be carried over.  The issue was decided by the Oireachtas at that time.There is no substantive change due to this.  The section simply takes account of the new arrangements under the Lisbon treaty, and so does not make any substantive change on where we were after the 2007 Act.  It simply re-iterates that position, but includes the Lisbon treaty within it.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	355	I will not press it to a vote.  I reiterate the Labour Party's continued opposition to this aspect of the European Communities Act 2007, which is mentioned in this section.  I accept that no change in this respect is proposed in the Bill before the House.  As the Oireachtas implements the provisions of the Lisbon treaty, this issue will have to be addressed.  We will have to consider whether these extra powers, which are essentially anti-democratic or undemocratic, should be continued or whether we should seek to abolish them.  While I will not pursue this matter at this stage, I will raise it again in the future.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	356	I fully appreciate that the Deputy has been making this point for some time.  I recognise the generosity with which he has dealt with it.  I fully appreciate that this is a concern within the Labour Party.  I respect the fact that it has been making this point since 2007.

In page 5, lines 1 and 2, to delete subsection (4).It seems to me that section 5(4) is superfluous.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	358	We have received strong advice to the effect that section 5(4) which clarifies the meaning of "enactment", is essential so that a reference to statutory instruments is provided for.  The definition of "enactment" that is set out in the Interpretation Act 2005, rather than a general definition applicable to statutes, is being used for the purposes of this legislation.  As we are keen to capture the reference to statutory instruments in the 2005 Act, it would be a mistake to strike out this section.  I accept the Deputy's point.  It may seem superfluous to the normal eye.  Those engaged in the legal drafting of the Bill have made it clear that far from being superfluous, it is important from the point of view of capturing a reference to statutory instruments.

In page 5, line 9, to delete "Article 28 or 29" and substitute "Title V".The Bill provides for the scrutiny of those Common Foreign and Security Policy decisions covered by Articles 28 and 29 of the Treaty on European Union.  I suggest that this section should be broadened to include a reference to any Common Foreign and Security Policy decision under the entire title of the EU treaty in question.  I am not sure why scrutiny should be restricted to decisions under the sections mentioned in the Bill as it stands.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	361	It is important for me to reiterate the point made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs when he touched on this matter this morning.  When one reads this fairly arcane legislative reference, it is difficult for one to understand what it means.  There continues to be a policy of keeping Common Foreign and Security Policy decisions outside the provisions which are being brought into domestic law, with certain exceptions.  We have been strongly advised that to achieve that purpose, this section should be retained as it currently stands.  If the Deputy would like further elaboration or clarification on the matter, he should reread the section of the Minister's speech in which he explained the logic behind this provision.  It was well explained.  As I have said, its basic purpose is to keep certain Common Foreign and Security Policy decisions outside the provisions which are being brought into domestic law.

#PadraicMcCormack	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-party	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-dob	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	363	Section 6 refers to regulations and directives.  In case they are interpreted otherwise, I preface my remarks by reminding the House not only that I voted "Yes" in the referendum on the Lisbon treaty, but that I campaigned strongly for a "Yes" vote.  I am speaking on behalf of the majority of people in some parts of Connemara who voted "No".  According to some accurate tallies I have seen, the areas of An Tuairín, Leitir Mór, Leitir Mealláin, Tír an Fhia I, Tír an Fhia II, Camas, An Turlach Beag, Loch Ána, Kingstown and Ballyconneely all voted strongly against the referendum.  Their opposition was mainly based on the interpretation of directives.  I do not understand why officials in Ireland are more likely than their counterparts in other countries to interpret directives so thoroughly.  Why do they lean over backwards to ensure EU directives are interpreted more strongly than in several other EU countries?  Those of us who travel to Spain often see people working on building sites without any helmets, and so on.  I am not advocating that — I mention it as an example of how regulations and directives are implemented in other countries, by comparison with Ireland.This is a particularly serious issue in Connemara because 75% of the land there has been designated as being in a special area of conservation.  Anyone who applies for planning permission in any part of Connemara is either in, or adjacent to, one of these designated areas.  According to the interpretation of the planning office, if one is adjacent to a designated area, or a proposed designated area, one's application must be the subject of several studies, including an environmental impact study.  Ordinary applicants who are qualified in every other respect — they live, work, are involved and were born in the locality — have to spend €2,000 or €3,000 on environmental impact statements about their sites.  Such interpretations are completely unnecessary.  It is generally the case that when they are submitted, planning permission is still not guaranteed.  One often has to make two or three applications before one is successful.  One may be refused on the grounds of not having a housing need.  If one proves that one has such a need, one's next application might be turned down because one is adjacent to a designated conservation area.  One will then have to get an environmental impact study.Why are EU directives interpreted so diligently in Ireland, compared to other countries?  The challenge we face, which was not mentioned during the Second Stage debate, involves engaging with the 50% of people in parts of Donegal and Connemara who voted "No" in the referendum earlier this month.  We have to engage with such people, to whom nobody seems to be giving any heed.  I submit that we have to address their concerns.  Nothing in the Lisbon treaty caused them to vote "No" — it was a kind of protest vote against the overly diligent adherence to, interpretation of and enforcement of EU directives by public officials.  Perhaps the Minister of State will advise me on what I should say to a young lad in Oughterard or anywhere else who applies for planning permission.  Such a person might work in a local shop and be of limited means.  If he gets a site from his parents, he will have to get an environmental impact assessment of the site if it is adjacent to a designated special area of conservation.  Nobody in the wildlife section of the Office of Public Works can give me a list of people who carry out this type of work and what they charge.  It is an absolute penalty on young couples who are trying to build houses to accommodate themselves in their local areas, where they are living and working.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	364	I recognise the point the Deputy has made.  I remind him that when I was Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, I introduced guidelines specifically to assist people encountering the type of issue he has raised.
#PadraicMcCormack	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-party	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-dob	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	365	The problem is that it is not happening.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	366	Deputy Timmins and I represent a constituency that is not unlike Deputy McCormack's constituency.  This is because of concerns about the environment.  The best stewards of the environment are people who live in the countryside.  I have always made the point that the most active supporters of the environment are the farming community in general.  I agree completely with the Deputy that a countryside divested of people is simply a desert.  We do not want to create a desert and call it progress because that is nonsense.  The point has been well made that frustration arises because of domestic interpretations in some of our agencies.  From our experience as local representatives, Deputy McCormack and I could both instance many cases of various agencies adopting conflicting views.  This issue requires attention.This is a hobbyhorse of mine.  When I chaired a committee that dealt with this matter some years ago, we produced a report calling specifically for more common sense to be used in the application and domestic interpretation of directives, regulations and EU legislation.  The Deputy is correct that domestic interpretation causes a great deal of frustration.  He and I probably agree that sometimes, when officials interpret laws, which laws are largely domestic, or dealing with domestic planning considerations, they find it all too easy to blame the Union for their own perverse interpretations.I am very familiar with the circumstances the Deputy describes.  If one drives through the areas of France that are not unlike parts of Connemara or County Wicklow, one will note that the constraints of which we speak do not apply at all.  There is a need for common sense here.One of the liberating aspects of the Lisbon treaty is that Members of the Oireachtas will have to become much more actively involved in EU affairs.  I make no apology for saying this and believe it is good.  It is good and democratic that people who are concerned about EU law, be they councillors or general citizens, will have the opportunity to lobby Members of the Oireachtas to ensure we are more attentive to detail.Deputy McCormack is correct that there is a predisposition in Ireland to being extraordinarily detailed in our interpretation of various measures.  It seems to be part of our national character and may be the result of something in our genetic make-up or psyche.  If one compares practices across the Union, be they in respect of the sale of artisan foods or planning, one will note a more pedantic approach in Ireland than elsewhere.  This must be addressed.  As we discuss new EU legislation in the Houses, we should be very careful that our domestic interpretation does not exceed either the letter or purpose of the former.  It really infuriates me to hear those who are guilty of very nitpicking interpretations of legislation state their interpretations are EU requirements.  They are not EU requirements in this case but domestic requirements.  All of us in politics agree on this and it needs to be attended to.I am conscious of the latitude the Acting Chairman is giving me in that we are probably straying a little from the section under discussion and the amendment of Deputy Costello.

From dealings with the Minister of State in his previous Ministry, I know what he is saying is correct.  Unfortunately, despite the fact that he stated his views on the record in the past and answered parliamentary questions I tabled, local authorities do not seem to heed those views.  They did not do so even when he was in the Ministry directly concerned with the matter I raise.  I am glad I will now be able to forward the views expressed by the Minister of State to the relevant authorities in my county to determine whether any good can come of my doing so on this occasion.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	368	The section deals with updating the definition of "measures".  It largely involves a terminological change.  Deputy McCormack's point is valid in the broader context of the section dealing with scrutiny and the need to update the legislative powers of scrutiny.The Lisbon treaty gives extra powers to the Oireachtas to consult the Commission in devising policy, in addition to the watchdog power in respect of what is coming out at the other end.  With regard to what Deputy McCormack stated, the result should be much more localised and should reflect much better the proposals of national Parliaments.  They will now have a role in the consideration of policy issued annually by the Commission and they will also have a more direct role in keeping a close eye on the transposition of legislation to ensure it does not transgress in respect of subsidiarity.  What Deputy McCormack said is quite relevant to the experiences of very many people.

In page 6, subsection (4), line 1, after "shall" to insert "by resolution direct the Clerk of the House to".This is a minor matter related to the manner in which we conduct our business.  There is no specific mechanism for the House to notify the Minister in writing.  The only action either House can take is to act by resolution.  Therefore, I suggest the Bill should state that the House should pass a resolution that would direct the Clerk of the Dáil to notify the Minister.  The Minister would then proceed to deal with the European Court of Justice with regard to any particular decision or Act with which the Oireachtas has difficulty.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	370	I agree with the Deputy that this is very important but I believe the handling of the matter would best be left to the House.  It really is a matter for the House but section 7 is very important because it gives very specific powers to the Oireachtas.To refer to the debate we just had, I will give a good illustration of why the House should be flexible in such matters.  The Deputy may recall that several years ago an Oireachtas committee produced a study that considered the application of EU regulation in agriculture.  The committee invited the Director General of the relevant section of the Commission to attend.  When he did so with his staff the result was very interesting.  He made the point that the Irish approach to adopting certain directives was very specific to our own Department and did not reflect a requirement of the relevant Directorate-General.The manner in which this very important section will be brought into operation is really a matter for the Oireachtas.  The House should pay some attention to drafting the rules on how this is handled.  I refer to issues such as the Passerelle clause and the general issue of how the new powers will be operated.  These are not matters that should be referred to in the legislation but they should be dealt with in detail by the House.  It is for the House to set its own rules on these issues.  It would, therefore, be unwise to accept the amendment.

I welcome it and the fact that he and his staff have included it in the body of the legislation.  Its inclusion reflects the enhanced role of the Oireachtas.  It will be a matter for the Oireachtas to tease out the mechanisms required for the implementation of its new role with regard to subsidiarity and other powers granted by this legislation.  Perhaps it would be best to leave the matter until we have an opportunity to examine carefully how best to respond to the totality of the Lisbon treaty and the powers it confers on the House.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	374	The amendments propose the addition of the words "or enactment" after the word "instrument" in four places in the section.  My advice is that it is not necessary to apply this provision to primary legislation.  When the Deputy drafted his amendments he may have had statutory instruments in mind.  Unlike statutory instruments, which may be linked to specific EU directives, primary legislation stands alone and survives the repeal of any EU directive which it was enacted to implement.  Accordingly, primary legislation enacted to give effect to repealed directives can be availed of to implement the codifying directive it replaces.  That is the formal explanation.  It is not necessary to apply this provision to primary legislation.

In page 6, subsection (2), line 27, after "act" to insert the following:"but subject to the constitutional rights of any person affected,".This amendment would insert a retrospective reference which would ensure that the constitutional rights of the person referred to would be protected.

Constitutional rights are constitutional rights and legislation cannot trespass on them.  They are inviolable and the absence of the additional words would not allow this legislation to trespass on them.

In page 7, subsection (2), line 7, to delete "Communities" and substitute "Union".The final summation in this section is that "The European Communities Acts 1972 to 2007 and this Act may be cited together as the European Communities Acts 1972 to 2009.".  When the Lisbon treaty is passed we will no longer have European Communities Acts but European Union Acts.  Therefore that would be a more appropriate citation.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	379	I see Deputy Costello's point.  However, such a change would be more appropriate to consolidation legislation.  There is a need, at some stage, for such legislation in this area.  The collective citation used here has its roots in the principal Act, which is the European Communities Act 1972.  It is felt it is not necessary to make the proposed change.There is need for consolidation legislation in this area.  Further tidying up will remove confusing alternative references and make things neater.  Deputy Costello's amendment would be more appropriate to a consolidating Bill.  Several pieces of textual consolidation are required and we will deal with them at that stage.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	381	Not really.  I am saying the citation draws its roots from the principal Act.  I accept the general principle of Deputy Costello's amendment.  Different terminology is used to describe this body of 27 member states.  At some stage in the future we will need consolidating legislation to make sure there is homogeneity in the language used right across.  I do not accept the amendment but Deputy Costello's general principle is sensible and points in the direction of a consolidating Act.  When the consolidating Act comes across he can claim credit for it.

How does the Minister of State envisage that happening?  Are these words designed to accommodate the question mark which remains around the ratification of the Lisbon treaty by all member states?  Will the Act come into operation immediately upon ratification by all members or will the Minister take his time until some future uncertain date?  Can the Minister of State give a clear idea of the purpose of this final section?
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	383	I see Deputy Costello's point.  Section 8 comes into operation now.  Enactment will depend on someone in another member state finding his biro and signing the necessary document for final ratification.  The Minister will then sign a commencement order.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	384	The wording of the subsection is very general.  It does not say the Minister will bring the Act into operation immediately the opportunity arises.  He may do so at some distant future date.  The Lisbon treaty could be in place for some time before the Minister decides it is appropriate to go ahead with it, perhaps because of the extra activities it will require from the Oireachtas.  Is the Minister of State telling the House that the order will be signed as soon as the opportunity arises?
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	385	Given the torture and twists and turns that we have all gone through there will not be any particular delay, but the enactment order has to be signed when the ratification process is completed.  The Minister specifically referred to that in his Second Stage speech.  The Deputy can take it that there will be great anxiety for an Irish Minister to do that but we do not know the day yet.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	386	I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche, and the Minister, Deputy Micheál Martin, for the manner in which they have presented the legislation, and for the entire debate and the precursor of it, the Lisbon treaty and the campaign that took place to ratify that.  I thank also the officials on the good work done behind the scenes.  Sometimes we forget all of that hard slog.  A significant amount of work was done by them throughout the campaign and the treaty ratification.  I welcome that and compliment them on it.I compliment everybody who was involved because it was an arduous period.  A great deal rested on the outcome of the treaty.  What we are doing today is tying up loose ends and preparing for the ratification instruments.  We hope it will be possible to put everything together next week and that the Czech President will have changed his mind or else made sufficient progress so that he will be prepared to sign the ratification documents and that we can all move forward together.  I thank the Minister of State for his contribution and his consideration in all of the matters today.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	388	I thank everyone in this House and everyone in this country who has engaged in the two referenda.  I am somewhat mystified at comments made by Deputy Ó Snodaigh about the possibility of there being some sort of democratic deficit.  The Irish people have spoken clearly.  When one takes the aggregate of the "Yes" and the "No" votes in both referenda, they have spoken even more clearly.We have gone through a remarkable period in terms of our relationship with the European Union.  I pay a particular tribute to the leaders and members of the Opposition parties who put party politics to one side to carry this important referendum.  From time to time we have a moral responsibility in this House and in the other House to put partisan politics to one side and to deal with the greater public interest.The Irish people have shown extraordinary forbearance in the past two referenda and they have shown again their extraordinary interest in being at the heart of Europe.  That is where we belong.  That is where our republicanism comes from and that is where our future lies.  I take particular pleasure in the fact that we have gone through this legislation and it is now ready to move to the other House.  I hope that in the next day or two we will be in a position to lodge the instruments of ratification in Rome.  We will have shown the rest of Europe that we as a nation value our place at the heart of the European Union, that we value the Union and we share with the other approximately 490 million people a common sense of purpose, place and follow certain values that we all hold dear, namely, democracy, the rule of law and human rights.I pay my respects to people who over the years have canvassed on the "No" side.  There are many good people whose views I do not agree with, but who were not in it just for mischief, they were in it because they believed firmly in what they were saying.  That, again, is part of democracy, and democracy was played out in a very real way in our nation on 2 October.  Other nations did not have that opportunity.  The drafters of our Constitution were very wise when they decided that the only sovereign authority to amend the Constitution was the people.  The people have spoken clearly.  It is now our responsibility when the treaty finally takes effect to show that we in both Houses are capable of dealing with the new challenges, as so many Deputies have said, of Europe in an open, transparent and democratic way and fighting the case and the cause of Ireland.  I thank Deputies for their contributions, courtesy and kind words.

#PeterKellyFF	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-party	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-dob	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	392	The guarantees secured by the Government helped dispel many of the groundless and unnecessary fears raised by those on the "No" side, in particular the suggestion that voting for the Lisbon treaty would lead to conscription or to the establishment of a European army.  The guarantees specifically and effectively addressed that scaremongering, as did the positive and detailed information disseminated by the Minister for Defence in the months leading up to the referendum on the Lisbon treaty.Ireland's leadership in the EU peacekeeping mission to Chad as well as the ceremonies and events in 2008 arising from the 50th anniversary of this country's first United Nations peacekeeping mission have helped create a positive public image of Ireland's proud record as the provider of military peacekeepers.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	393	I thank the Members of the House for the interest they have taken in the Bill and for their contributions to the debate.  I agree with Deputy Timmins's view that money spent on military equipment will reduce as a result of Ireland's participation in the European Defence Agency, EDA.  That is one of the primary purposes of our membership of the EDA.  Deputy Timmins also welcomed the fact that there would be greater openness and transparency as a result of the legislation, which I acknowledge and appreciate because that is precisely what will happen.Deputy Timmins also made the suggestion that the Government should discuss with aid agencies the security of their personnel and the measures they have put in place to ensure that.  I will discuss that useful suggestion with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.Deputy O'Shea inquired about a number of issues and I can put his mind at rest on all of them.  I will mention one in particular.  During his contribution he referred to the national declaration on the Lisbon treaty in the context of our response where a member state is the victim of a terrorist attack or armed aggression.  The important issue to remember is that the provision of any such assistance by this country, or any member state, is a matter for each state.  There is no legal obligation on any member state to respond in any particular way.  In our case such assistance would have to be in accordance with our traditional policy of military neutrality.  The important thing for Ireland is that our traditional policy of military neutrality is fully respected and that our right to determine the nature of any support thereafter is a matter for the Government alone.Deputy O'Shea also inquired whether the Bill allows for military capability building for missions not definitively or absolutely yoked to UN mandates.  He further inquired whether the Minister holds that there is a presumptive obligation on the Government only to authorise such deployments when that engagement will assist the State's ability to contribute to UN-mandated missions and whether the case is the same for the European Defence Agency.In Ireland's case, in accordance with the terms——

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	397	Anyone involved in an Opposition party will know that a strong debate usually take place as to what will be the subject of a Private Members' motion.  No Private Members' motion is ever tabled lightly.  I take it that Fine Gael pondered long and hard about choosing this subject for debate, and that is the way it should be.  The time allocated for debates in this House is precious and we are always conscious of the time.  Therefore, this motion must be taken seriously.I accept fully the bona fides of this motion, but in the current circumstances people are inclined to clutch at straws to make life better for different groups.  There is not a Deputy in this House who does not have sympathy for people running small businesses.  They keep our towns and cities going, our communities together, provide services and, to a great extent, keep the lights on.  Therefore, there is a great deal of sympathy for these people because they did not make outrageous or outlandish profits but kept their businesses ticking over.  They have always found it difficult to pay the charges levied on them and we have had a great deal of sympathy for them, particularly those of us who served on local authorities and would have been aware of the difficulties they encounter on a day to day basis.  In the approach to the Estimates every year, we have received pre-Estimates submissions from small businesses.If we were to do what the motion calls on us to do, and I understand the reason it has been tabled, the very essence of local democracy could be affected.  Local democracy in this country is very limited in any event.  We probably have local administration as opposed to local government.  I constantly advocate that local democracy, local administration or local government should be given far more powers and support than it has been given.  Those in local government are charged with collecting our rubbish, ensuring that we have clean water, our streets are lit, traffic flows, we have a safe thoroughfare, footpaths are kept in good repair, housing is provided for particular groups and that our cities and our towns run smoothly.  If we are to deprive them of the very few streams of income they have, which is what would be the effect of this motion if taken to its logical conclusion, not only would the individual citizen suffer, but businesses would suffer.   Businesses, by their nature, depend on the thoroughfare outside their premises being well kept to encourage people into their premises.Small businesses face significant competition from major shopping arcades and shopping centres located outside towns and cities.  Such shopping centres are a major attraction because it is easier to park there and if people want to buying large household goods, it is easier to shop in the relaxed atmosphere afforded by such centres.However, towns and cities are still a major attraction for people.  In Cork in particular, we talk about going to town.  It has been the tradition to go to town on a Saturday, whether to buy meat, clothing or to shop for the home.  It is a tradition and part of what we do.  When we walk through our towns and cities, we expect them to be kept neat and tidy and the footpaths to be maintained.  That is the work local authorities do, and sometimes we forget that.  The number of people local authorities have let go has also been forgotten in this debate.  There are no more local authority social employment schemes.  The horticultural input and additional services delivered by local authorities are no longer provided.  On top of that, it is now proposed that they should be deprived of this source of revenue.  I accept the motion has been tabled in good faith, but if it were to be enforced, we would have a much more depleted local government and the environs in which we live would be in a much worse condition.  None of us want that.There are actions we can take to assist small businesses, but they know that what keeps a small business in operation is the individual service a business gives its customers.  Small businesses know their customers and that service is important to people, regardless of how remote we feel from multinationals.  It is still important to people to know, when they walk into a shop, that the product for sale is safe and of good quality.  Those are the things that will keep small businesses going.  To say that local authorities would be deprived of funding to keep small businesses in operation is self-defeating.  If the local authority cannot provide the service we charge it with delivering, people will no longer go into our towns and cities because they will not be safe, clean and pleasurable to walk around.  This motion contradicts the provision of such services.There is such a desperation to ensure businesses remain in operation that people will table motions such as this one.  I do not believe the motion has been thought out fully, nor is it a positive step to take.  We must think more seriously about this issue and be more clever in ensuring businesses remain up and running until we come out the other end of this recession, and we will come out the other end of it.I am a fan of local government.  The work it does is understated.  We criticise those involved in it, but it is the essence of democracy.  It is where the people are truly represented.  That is the reason turnouts in local government elections are usually higher and depending on the ward or the activity of a local authority member they can be even higher.  People have a close affinity with their local authority and when times were good, local authorities expanded their services and created an environment that was much better than was the case in the past.  Now that times are tough they are cutting back on services.  They have no choice in that regard.  They have let go hundreds of people on temporary contracts who expected to go on to become full-time employees.  Those are decent, honourable people who would have given great service to the State but the local authorities had no choice other than to let them go.Every Member in this House has sympathy for small businesses.  Without them, our shopping experience would not be as pleasant as it is, but this is not the way to proceed.  Depriving local authorities of a funding stream is not the way to proceed.We should not always pick on the easy target.  It is easy to do that and it is a knee-jerk reaction.  We are all sympathetic but we must think harder and find other ways of ensuring this economy stays on its feet until we come out the other end of this awful recession.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	406	I am happy to speak in this debate.  I looked up the record because I heard my constituency colleague, Deputy Penrose, had spoken last night.  My heart lifted because he stated he did not agree with the motion.  I thought again of it as another factor in the famous Mullingar accord when all was sweetness and light in my constituency of Longford-Westmeath.  Everybody was beaming at one another, and Labour loved Fine Gael and Fine Gael loved Labour, until they started to work out their policies.  Deputy Penrose clearly stated he was not in favour of the motion and would not be supporting it.Likewise, I found myself in accord with the esteemed Deputy who spoke before me as she outlined what local government does for a local region.  Of course Deputy Kathleen Lynch is correct.  Local authorities, be they town councils or county councils, are what keeps the place afloat.I always remember from my years on local authorities that one was told the local authority is responsible for lighting, sewerage, water and housing, and therefore all that they do must be paid for by somebody.  Of course we all would wish that there were no rates on this or that, but that is what I call voodoo economics, of the kind put forward in this motion.  Who is to pay the county council workers?  Who is to keep the streets swept?  Who is to bring out the fire brigade when the call comes in the middle of the night?  Who is to pay the men on the fire brigade?As Deputy Lynch stated, the community employment schemes, which were beneficial in local authority areas, no longer exist.  At a recent meeting with the county manager — every three months he meets the Oireachtas Members of the constituency which is extremely helpful — we were brought up to date and saw the economies which must be introduced in the local authorities to enable even a tiny core of local authority workers to be kept in employment.Who is to pay for the running of one's town or county?  The chambers of commerce and all those worthy bodies would wish that there were no rates.  In fact, over the past decade there have been only minute increases in the commercial rates in most rateable local authority areas because they have sought to keep them in line knowing how difficult is the business environment.It is hugely daunting for anyone setting up a business or being in a business but one does not address this by chopping the nose off everybody who is working in a county council and taking away their income at one fell swoop.  It is a silly proposition.  I suppose the proposers of the motion meant well.  The previous Deputy was trying to be sweet but I have no inclination to be sweet about it.  I cannot understand the motivation behind it.Equally, while I am on my feet — the Acting Chairman will say it is not the issue but I will say it anyway — all of the Fine Gael Senators are lauding the great courage of Deputy Kenny in saying that he would abolish the Seanad.  I saw no courage in that.  I would see great courage if he said he would support the Government in the difficult task we face in the budget on 9 December.  Telling a poor, hapless group of Senators that they are to be abolished did not require mammoth efforts of courage or determination.  In the rush to get the headlines, he had to go one better than the Deputy Gilmore.  One would get dizzy looking at their deeds of daring, except they are not daring but stupid.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	408	I do not agree with the motion.  I agree with vibrant lively town councils and county councils which must have a measure of funding.  The grants which come from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government have increased dramatically in recent years although perhaps not so much of late.  The planning fees have not increased over the past decade either.  To strip whatever money they are getting from the rateable valuations within their town and county is not the way forward for vibrant lively urban and county councils.  I strongly disagree with the terms of this motion.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	409	I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate.  The Opposition Deputies have provided us with a timely opportunity to discuss the matter but, unfortunately, they have missed the point in an effort to gain political kudos yet again, something which is the detriment of this House and society generally.The motion is short and seems to indicate that the Government is responsible for all business costs and, therefore, for the difficulties in which we find ourselves.  That is fine but I am sure the public sees it quite differently.Any objective analysis of costs facing business today would look elsewhere and would focus, not on this motion but on issues which have been raised in a review carried out by the competitiveness council earlier this year under the auspices of Forfás.  That document is revealing because it identifies some areas that do not immediately come to mind as being significant in terms of the cost of doing business here.  We all know about the issues of energy and labour, but the report indicates that, from an Irish business point of view, our legal costs are the highest in the OECD.  That is something with which almost every enterprise now finds itself dealing.  If our costs are the highest in the OECD, it is something which needs to be looked at without delay.  It is not one of the Government related costs.Surprisingly, there is also an indication in competitiveness council report that IT costs in Ireland are the highest in the OECD.  I would have thought, since we had so many skills and so much IT development in this country, that we would have been lower down the scale.  It is clear, therefore, that both legal and IT costs are causing great difficulties from an enterprise and business point of view and are something at which we need to look.Labour is one of the biggest costs that all industries and businesses in the State must deal with.  It is important that we would work towards controlling pay, both at public and at private level.  It is vital to do that in terms of regaining competitiveness.As a society, we need to learn from some of the experiences of the past and we must question the decision on increases in pay that AIB made today.  That is not to take from the staff or any contractual arrangements that might have been there.  However, it is important to send out the most positive signals that we will work, at a minimum, towards freezing pay in those sectors.  There were also issues of pay increases for staff within the ESB, which is something we should look at.We must work from the top down.  We must look at the entire remuneration process for the higher end executives and ensure that we set a proper ceiling for pay.  We must move away from the notion of bonus pay and provide a much more simplified system of remuneration that rewards people for the work they do in a fair and equitable way but does not allow certain sectors to be paid in a manner that creates disharmony within the lower levels of employment.  That will help us in regaining our competitiveness.Energy costs also need to be addressed.  The regulatory regime that is in place to control costs was slow to kick into action because of the structures that have been put in place to encourage competition.  That is now starting to reap rewards, although we must be far more creative in resolving our energy needs through the use of green technology.  We operate on the western seaboard of Europe which gives us access to wind, wave and tidal power generation.  We need to invest more in this area to ensure we gain the competitive advantage that that energy, which is on our doorstep, could provide to industry for the future.

#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	412	Like other speakers, I, too, wish to make a contribution to the debate this evening.  The motion, as worded, is short and provides us with an opportunity to have a broader debate on some of the issues pertaining to us.  It is timely that we are discussing local government charges and their impact on business given our recent lengthy discussion in this House on Second Stage of the NAMA Bill 2009, Committee Stage of which will commence in the House tomorrow and continue next week.  We are all aware of the stresses and pressures on business in terms of accessing credit and the resulting job losses in that regard.On business, an issue often raised with me as a public representative is that of local authority charges, in particular the policies pursued by local authorities not in respect of commercial rates as mentioned by other speakers but in respect of water and waste water charges.  Local authorities are charging a particular amount per cubic metre for water going into business and a different rate for waste water, which is crippling businesses.There has been much debate in regard to the renewed programme for Government in terms of domestic water charges, a charge which it has been flagged will be introduced in the future.  We will need to bring the proposed domestic water charges and waste water charges which are being foisted on business under one umbrella and to ensure charges are equitably spread.  Business is suffering as a result of local authority charges.I would like to see the Houses of the Oireachtas have access to the local government auditor.  I am a member of the Committee of Public Accounts which has no power to bring before it for questioning the local government auditor in respect of any particular issue.  We must ensure more joined up thinking if we are to keep charges down.  There are many government agencies involved in the provision of social housing, a task which should be the responsibility of local authorities.  The Health Service Executive provides rent supplement to people living in private rented accommodation while they are on the local authority housing list.  There is no accountability in this regard.  If this issue was dealt with under one umbrella we would achieve economies of scale and savings which would help drive down costs in the future.Another issue brought to my attention as a public representative is that of the black economy, which as a result of the stresses and strains being experienced by people, is rife.  It is incumbent on our State agencies to establish more whistleblower mechanisms in an effort to snuff out what is happening in the black economy.  It was reported earlier on the news that social welfare fraud of the order of €200 million has been unveiled so far.  The target is to make savings of €600 million in respect of social welfare fraud.The main issue of concern for me is the water and waste water charges being imposed on businesses throughout the country and the banking issues surrounding NAMA.  I echo the comments of other speakers in regard to the proposed payment by Allied Irish Bank of pay increases at a time when we are discussing potential wage cuts and job losses right across the sector.  It is not acceptable that the banks which we are supporting are awarding themselves a pay increase.

I have no doubt the Acting Chairman would like to comment on the service provided by the local authorities in Tallaght.  I will not try to replace him but will stick to what I know in terms of my own area.This motion is probably the most lazy that has been tabled since my time as a Member of this House in that it has no regard for the workings of local authorities or the pressures and financial constraints they are under at the moment.  The motion has no credibility in that it does not set out any other area from which revenue could be achieved should there be a freeze on charges for businesses, as alluded to in the motion.  This is a cheap stunt by the Opposition, as was the call earlier this week that Seanad Éireann be abolished and the number of Deputies in this House be reduced.  That is cheap politics.

Deputy O'Rourke referred earlier to a Labour Party member who does not support this motion.  This shows that the Fine Gael and Labour parties, which for some time have been putting themselves forward as an alternative Government, are poles apart when it comes to devising policies.  One wonders what type of mess the country would be in if they were given responsibility for returning our economy to stability, a task with which the current Government is dealing well.  Neither of those parties has put forward any good or credible solutions.Many local authorities are now controlled by the Fine Gael and Labour parties.  This motion may be another cheap effort or stunt to remove the pressure from their councillors who must take tough action in terms of their budgets.  Politicians must act responsibly.  This motion does the opposite.  We are all aware of the constraints on businesses, in particular small businesses, in our constituencies.  Coming from a Border county I am aware of the extra constraints on businesses in that region.  A little over a year ago, the Tánaiste aided by the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, undertook a study of the difference in the cost of running business either side of the Border.  That study identified that difference to be approximately 40%.  A lot of work has been done——

The most recent figures I have seen have identified that difference to be just under 20% now.  The Government is working behind the scenes and is taking real action to try to reduce the costs imposed on businesses, including energy prices which have decreased in the past year or two.  These are the type of actions that are going on behind the scene.  The Government is making real efforts to tackle the difficulties being faced by business rather than engaging in cheap politics.  I hope this motion will be seen for what it is.  I am sure it will be defeated tonight.
#DarraghOBrien	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-party	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-dob	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	419	I am pleased to be given the opportunity to speak on the Government amendment to the Private Members' motion tabled by Fine Gael.  The Government remains committed to ensuring that Ireland remains open for business to both foreign and domestic companies and enterprises.  As a small nation we have been incredibly successful in attracting foreign direct investment against stern competition.  Indeed, even in these difficult times we continue to attract such investment, which is vital to creating jobs and maintaining the diversification of our economy.  Our continued success in attracting new research and development ventures into Ireland is a real example of how Government policy in areas such as taxation and up-skilling, in real terms, creates new high-end jobs.  As the Minister of State mentioned in his speech yesterday, a recent World Bank study rated Ireland 7th out of 180 countries in terms of ease of doing business.  It is important for me to put on record my praise for the work done by our State agencies on a daily basis to ensure people set up new business in Ireland.  In particular, I commend both Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland for the sterling work they do on behalf of this country.As I have said previously in the House, there is no doubt Ireland will come through this recession more quickly than some commentators and celebrity economists — one of whom is now a Member of this House — would have us believe.  To do this, however, we must regain competitiveness, and the signs are that we are going in the right direction.  A recent European Central Bank report on the top 15 countries showed that labour costs in those countries have risen by 3% in the past 12 months, while Ireland's have dropped by approximately 4%.  This is a sharp and badly needed correction.  We are now behind the EU 15 average.  Ireland, to ensure future economic prosperity, needs to reduce its labour costs further.  I commend the many people who have, in the interests of maintaining jobs and competitiveness, seen the bigger picture and agreed to wage freezes and, in many cases, reductions.  I sincerely hope people in other sectors will follow that example.Many of my colleagues have mentioned the recent salary increases granted to certain employees in AIB.  The board's decision to allow a 3% pay increase was nothing short of disgraceful and shows no regard for the taxpayer or the Government which has come to its rescue.  In the current climate, for AIB even to contemplate paying increases, which are effectively coming from taxpayers' money, shows how out of step it is with the times.  It also shows utter incompetence.  Over the next week or so we will have a further opportunity, on Committee Stage of the National Asset Management Agency Bill 2009, to ensure that this bank and others do what they are supposed to do, which is to support viable Irish businesses.  AIB, in particular, is not doing this.  We as a Government need to take a tough stand with the bank, by way of legislation, to ensure it supports viable Irish businesses and stops putting up barriers to progress and further investment.I also appeal to the Revenue Commissioners to take a more understanding approach to businesses, particularly in the SME sector.  I am extremely concerned about the feedback I am receiving on a daily basis from small businesses about the way they are being dealt with by the Revenue Commissioners in the current climate.  The heavy-handed way in which attachment orders are being used needs to be urgently reviewed.  I am fearful that because of the approach being taken with this sector in particular, the Revenue Commissioners are putting in peril the very existence of some firms.  I am asking it now to take a medium-term view when dealing with firms that have always paid their taxes and are now experiencing difficulties in doing so.  I am not asking them to write off any taxes owed but simply to look at the track records of businesses and take a realistic view with regard to the payment of outstanding taxes.  Its approach at the moment is counterproductive and is putting businesses at risk.  If businesses go to the wall, the Revenue Commissioners will never see the taxes that are due to them.  I urge the Minister for Finance and the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher, to seek assurances from the Revenue Commissioners that it will do business with business.The Government amendment to the motion shows the Government is taking the necessary steps to support our SME sector and, in particular, our export sector.  However, we need to do more.  We must ensure this area is prioritised because we will come through the recession with the assistance of Irish firms and businesses.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	420	I support the Government amendment.  As other speakers have said, it is all about restoring our competitiveness.  It is important that we remain competitive and return to where we used to be.  I acknowledge the measures taken by the Government to help enterprises, especially in the SME sector.  We are currently acting at too slow a pace and I urge the Minister and his colleagues to do more to speed up the process.  Access to funds is a major problem for small businesses.  I know many small business owners — indeed, I am one myself.  They are the backbone of our communities and provide great employment.  Many were set up in other recessionary times.It behoves all of us to ensure that our banking system, especially the banks which have been subject to our so-called bailout — I will call it support — release funds to these businesses because they are clearly not doing so.  Business people need overdrafts to survive.  I know of a couple of cases in which people were expecting cheques and had themselves written cheques to other suppliers and service providers, but when they received the cheques and lodged them to their banks, instead of going into their current accounts, the money was put in against their overdrafts.  This is not acceptable and it must change.We all understand that local authorities cannot survive without funding, and they probably should receive better funding than they do currently.  However, I recently took the unusual step of writing to the county and town managers to ask them to consider a moratorium on rates.  It is not that ratepayers do not want to pay; they have always paid and will pay again.  However, they are so hard-pressed at the moment, with so little business, that they need a moratorium not so that they do not have to pay the rates, but to give them some space.  That is badly needed.  I am also concerned about some of the other charges, such as water charges and planning fees.  We will need to consider this and be reasonable about payments, perhaps by spreading them over a period or providing a flexible system of payment.We are badly served in the area of energy costs.  While the ESB provided a good service for many years, it is now a monopoly, especially in the provision of services and lights to local authorities.  We must open this up to competition.  It is not good enough for the ESB to charge what it likes and give an appalling service, which it does, and sometimes no service.  This issue must be addressed.  I also ask local authorities to encourage their staff to take simple measures to cut down on energy costs, such as switching off equipment, lights and so on.There is a range of other costs, such as labour costs.  I too condemn the board of AIB for granting pay rises to some of its staff.  The debate on NAMA that will take place tomorrow and next week is timely.  AIB is giving two fingers to those of us who are trying to drive down costs.  I am not criticising the bank officials at the desks, who are doing a good job under tough conditions and are getting a lot of stick from a frustrated public, but this contractual arrangement flies in the face of what we need to achieve.There is a whole plethora of quangos, from that which implements HACCP to the National Employment Rights Authority to those dealing with health and safety, and back to the Revenue Commissioners and the sheriffs, which are now operating.  This is akin to State terrorism.  It is terrorising small business people who want to pay their money.  They have always paid their bills and intend to pay them, but they need space and to be treated kindly and sensitively.  This must be taken into account by our public service and those who are in positions of trust.  They are respected, but people are frightened and intimidated by them and this is not acceptable.

#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	423	This motion is clear in its call on the Government to freeze all Government charges on businesses until 2012.  We have had and will continue to have many debates to highlight the difficulties being experienced by small businesses throughout the country, businesses that employ more than 800,000 people between them.  These businesses which are found in every parish, community and every small and large town are the backbone of our economy, but they are suffering.  The Government could help them in many ways, but particularly in the area of charges over which it can have control, such as local authority charges for water, energy, waste, commercial rates and the charges involved in complying with the numerous layers of red tape concerning regulations for small businesses.The Tánaiste has often referred to the need to address the issue of competitiveness.  Fine Gael has clearly outlined its policy in this regard and our members outlined last night and will do so again tonight some of the areas where we can improve our competitiveness.  Lack of competitiveness is one of the major overhangs from the Celtic tiger era.  In 2000, we were fifth in the global competitiveness league, but last month we had slipped to 25th place.  Two areas mentioned as contributing to this fall were lack of access to financing and inefficient Government bureaucracy.  These areas were highlighted as significant problems for businesses in Ireland.Competitiveness in this regard is a measure of the capacity of our exports to compete with other products.  Irish exports are set to fall 13% in 2009 and services are expected to drop by 20% from their 2008 levels.  Overall, our exports were worth €154 billion in 2008.  The problem for exports is that they must compete against those of other countries and, as mentioned, we have slipped to 25th place in that regard.  The problem is our exports carry the excessive burden of costs when they compete with other products.I mentioned some areas over which the Government could have direct control.  In its pre-budget submission, the Small Firms Association has outlined the six major issues on which they want the Government to act and over which it could have influence.  The first of these is energy.  Last week the National Competitiveness Council stated we were significantly out of tune with other EU countries.  We are the fourth highest of the EU 27 in terms of energy costs and 35% more expensive than the average.  Large and small businesses throughout the country must deal with those costs.Water charges are also an issue.  Any Members who have been involved with local authorities are aware of the cost to businesses operating within the regime.  They must pay for water coming in and for waste water.  This is a huge burden on businesses.  They are crying out for transparency on charges.  Businesses are told they are only bearing the burden of costs relevant to themselves, but we need light and transparency on the issue because they seem to be taking an unfair share of the burden.Local authority rates are another issue.  Fine Gael has made a commitment that where the party is in control in a local area, there will be no increase in commercial rates.  It is far too easy an option for local government to concentrate on and increase commercial rates.  The rate must be forced down.  This will be a difficult issue for local authority members, but they must work within their budgets and not use the soft option of increasing commercial rates, particularly in the current climate.  The emphasis of this motion is on getting the Government to focus on the issues under its control.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	424	I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this motion.  The Government, the Minister and local authorities must begin to live in the real world this year.  Small businesses are collapsing.  They are under pressure and are sick and tired of keeping local authorities going, as they have done over the past number of years.The first issue of concern is rates.  Why do local authorities collect rates?  What services do they provide to small businesses who pay rates?  In my area all they provide is aggravation for people trying to create employment.  I will give two examples, of two people who visited my clinic last Monday.  The first was a man with a small abattoir.  He kills sheep for freezing for people in rural areas.  For every 30 sheep he kills, he must leave Westport and take the 30th sheep to Ballyhaunis for testing because of departmental regulations.  The other man who came to me employed six or seven people in the garage business.  He told me a story about the local authority.  Due to the fact he sprays cars, he had to apply for a licence from the local authority.  It costs him €540 to spray a car, and the licence from the council costs €600.  However, he told me that anyone could go into a shop and buy the same paint and start painting and do so from 5 p.m. until 10 a.m. when the local authority members return to work.  That is unacceptable.  This man is being put out of business by the State, while the State helps and encourages other people in the black economy.  They can travel to Northern Ireland and bring in the same paint and do the same work, but he is trying to be honest and pay his taxes and rates.  However, he is sick and tired of having inspectors come into his business every second day.The same is true of abattoirs.  We have closed down more abattoirs in County Mayo because they could not compete.  The man who came to me had a similar story.  When the inspector came in to him, the owner of the abattoir took up the paperwork, tore it up and said he had enough and was leaving the business.  He closed down his business, leaving three or four people without jobs.  He could not get up every morning worrying about who was going to come into his business next.  He was doing his best and making an effort.  Local authorities, inspectors and the Government must realise the private sector is finding things difficult.  It is not easy in business currently.  There should be no increase in rates this year.  I told the Mayo county manager he should cut back rates this year.  Why should we have an increase?  Businesses are not able to pay an increase.  Local authorities must conduct their business properly.Another area of concern is the new charges being brought forward by planning authorities.  When a man from my town applied for planning, the county council imposed a €90,000 betterment levy.  Then he went to An Bord Pleanála, which looked for further information.  He had to send in a revised plan but by then the local authority had imposed a parking levy of €250,000.  Do these officials live in the real world?  The man appealed this to An Bord Pleanála, which had some common sense and reduced the levy to €90,000.  The man, his daughter and family were about to set up a business, but before even getting started, he had to pay Mayo County Council a levy of €90,000.  Are we trying to tell people we do not want employment?  Are we trying to tell people we do not want work?  Can the public service just think up a figure, throw it out and say it is fine?  This must stop now.  If the recession does one thing, it may make the local authorities and the Government begin to realise how hard it is for small businesses to survive.My constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, is now in the House.  He knows what I am talking about.  Businesses are finding it hard.  They are unable to survive and are under a lot of pressure.  I warn the Minister of State and his officials that we are sick and tired of regulations.  The Minister of State can stop the regulation in his Department because all it is doing is creating jobs for the boys and girls in health, councils and everywhere else while the self-employed and the taxpayers have to pay to keep them in jobs.  They are doing their best to close them down and that type of attitude has to stop.  We have to encourage, help and tell the employers that we want them to help in this recession and we want to stop over-regulation.As somebody who canvassed for the Lisbon treaty ratification, I would not have done so were it not for the fact that we needed Europe this time.  People are sick and tired of the regulation coming from Brussels, but I do not blame Europe.  I blame the Minister of State, the Government and officials in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Every single official has to go ten times further, but while he or she is assured of a pay cheque on a wet day or a fine day, the person who is self-employed must go out and earn it.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	425	This is a very good motion and it is timely.  I believe it was the late President John F. Kennedy who said the time to repair a roof was when it was leaking.  This Government has received numerous warnings to the effect that the roofs of many businesses in the country are not just leaking, but about to cave in.  The clock is ticking for many businesses.  Red tape, as Deputy Ring said, high rental costs, lack of credit and cash flow are among some of the problems that have forced many businesses to close down.  On several occasions here I have cited the example of Parnell Street in Ennis where ten businesses have closed in the past 12 months and there are 20 more vacant on the street.  The rapid increase in unemployment and the deterioration in the aviation and tourism sectors have dealt a hammer blow to the mid-west region.Today it is reported that Ryanair is threatening to pull 75% of its services out of Shannon Airport as it negotiates a new deal with the authority.  It serves 27 destinations, so just imagine if Ryanair were to axe 75% of its services what that would mean for Shannon Airport, as regards jobs and indeed tourism for the entire region.  The Government might as well turn off the lights if this happens, and then there is the threat from transatlantic services as well that are about to close their cabin crew bases at Shannon.  These airlines, including easyJet and Aer Arann blame the €10 travel tax for killing off tourism.  I believe the Government should take note of what is happening in other European countries in relation to the travel tax.Take the Netherlands, for example, which introduced a travel tax in 2008.  It saw the detrimental effects the tax was having on tourism and axed it.  I would appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, as he is here tonight, to ask the Minister for Transport to get rid of this tax.  It is causing untold damage in the regions and for tourism, generally, in this country.  All the Minister has to do is to ask his counterparts with transport portfolios in the Netherlands, France or wherever these taxes were introduced to see that it is wrong and kills off tourism.We should be welcoming people here with open arms.  If the Government does not change its mind as regards this tax, it will not have to worry about tourists, because they will not be coming.  European Commission President José Manuel Barroso visited Shannon Airport prior to the Lisbon treaty referendum.  He announced, funnily enough, that €23 million was to be made available from the EGF to assist the retraining and re-skilling of workers who had lost their jobs, including the former Dell employees.  However, the Tánaiste admitted to me last week that this funding has not been put in place.  It has to get the stamp of approval from the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers.  Again I ask the Minister of State to appeal to the Tánaiste to put this funding on the agenda for the next Council of Ministers.  It is extremely important that this money is fast-tracked so that people do not have to wait until 2010 for the retraining process to begin.Foreign direct investment has had a significant impact on our economy over the past 15 years.  However, the major share of employment has been indigenously created by, for example, the local shopkeeper, the hairdresser, the butcher and the publican.  By their very nature such businesses make a big impact on local communities, yet many of them are closing down because of high costs and people going to the large retail stores.  Local enterprise boards, too, have played a significant role in assisting in the creation of local employment.  I was surprised the McCarthy report recommended they should be abolished.  They were established in the first place to fill a gap as regards support for local enterprise development, as identified in the small enterprise taskforce report.  Since they were first established in 1993 they have assisted in the creation of 33,800 throughout the country, giving financial support to more than 900 new projects per annum between 1993 and 2007.  They have assisted in job creation and the average cost per job is only €5,485.  In order for them to continue to create employment opportunities and promote enterprise at local level, I believe such local enterprise boards, including the Clare Enterprise Board in my constituency, play an important role in job creation for businesses and we should be very slow to abolish them.Chambers of commerce in Ennis, Kilrush and Shannon have long argued the need for reductions in rates and rents as well as for a freeze in local authority rates.  In spite of pre-election promises by the Government that action would be taken and a freeze put in place for three years, no legislation has been enacted to review these charges.  My colleague, Deputy Leo Varadkar, has consistently called for the introduction of such legislation.  Before last June the Taoiseach promised to freeze local authority rates for three years.  We in Fine Gael believe the freeze should be for five years.  The ball is now firmly in the Government's court.  Given it has failed to meet its previous commitments I do not know whether it will deliver on this, either.The Government cannot expect the economy to recover if it continues to ignore the problems that are forcing small and medium-sized businesses to close their doors.  The results of a recent survey conducted by Retail Excellence Ireland show the true extent of the problems facing businesses if rent reductions are not made.  More than 50% of the businesses surveyed pointed out that if rents were not reduced, between one and five people would be made redundant.  Some 40% of retailers believed they could not survive if rent reductions were not forthcoming — with 30% of those worried they would go out of business within six months.Small businesses are the backbone of the economy in every county.  The Taoiseach recently opened a small business in my constituency, Clare Springs, which employs ten people, and will, hopefully, increase its workforce to between 20 and 30.  It is managed and owned by Paul and Tom Conlon, who invested €4 million without any help from the State.  That is an example of people who identified an opportunity and saw it take off.  I would urge the Minister of State to support the Fine Gael motion in the House tonight.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	426	Time and again we are asked by the Government to be constructive, as I keep saying.  Over the last month we have introduced simple straightforward Bills that could have been accepted and the closest we have ever got to acceptance is the Government's amendment to this motion, which does not address the simple one-liner, "That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to freeze all charges on businesses until 2012", a three year freeze.  The amendment skirts around the issue entirely.  What catches the eye in particular is that it commends the Government on its strong focus on training and up-skilling of those in the workforce and those recently made redundant.  It cannot be serious when unfortunately all around us the dirtiest word in people's vocabulary at the moment is "FÁS".  There is not and there has not been a strong focus.  Preparation has not been made for the rainy day in the way it should have been.We in Fine Gael are trying to promote a situation whereby the Government does all in its power to protect every job it can from being lost.  Every job gives a human being the ability to earn a living and, where applicable, help him or her to support a family.  It also contributes to the tax revenue, which keeps the wheels of the State running — the public sector and its services.  It is important to bear in mind that there is a human side and an economic side to it.  The worrying aspect to the current downturn is the fact that we have low interest rates with relatively low energy prices.  Every time there is an indicator that the economy is improving, the price of oil has tracked upwards with it.  It is outside our hands to a great degree until we can harness our own resources.Before he was elevated to his current role, the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Calleary, was on the Joint Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security with me.  We all know the potential for alternative energy that exists off the coastline of his county.  As we are not there yet, we need to deal with what happens in the world energy sector.  Ireland's economy will lag behind every other economy, but it will not lag behind when it has to pay for its oil and gas.  That is a factor outside our control.  In everything else we do we should become competitive and drive down all our costs.Deputy Michael Ring mentioned abattoirs.  I could go on ad infinitum about how they have been closed and over-regulation by people who just do not seem to have a grasp.  I know of one case where an abattoir started its kill at 9 a.m.  The vet did not come in until 9.30 and made them dump the perfectly healthy animals that had been slaughtered.  That is not acceptable on the part of someone paid by public money that comes from private industry.  There was no question of anything untoward having gone on.  It is not right to have over-regulation instead of proper auditing and spot checks, which is a much more satisfactory approach as highlighted by Patrick Wall in the reports following the pork dioxin crisis.We need to take a stand to give people a chance to make a plan in the knowledge that they will not be faced with an increase in rates.  We would argue that there should be a PRSI holiday for anyone creating a job.  There should be a VAT reduction.  In the same way that the corporation tax reduction brought in more corporation tax, that calculation should be done for VAT.  The reduction should at least be applied for a year to see if it works.  One of the big arguments about the Lisbon treaty focused on protecting our integrity in determining corporation and other tax rates.  Corporation tax was the one everyone wanted to target.  Our low corporation tax means that we take in a large amount of corporation tax.  Everyone accepts that.  We have become a hub for companies involved in financial services, information technology and pharmaceuticals where corporation tax is applicable.  Why do we fear reducing VAT so much?  I do not see the logic.  I have heard the Minister for Finance defend maintaining high VAT rates.Our biggest market is outside the eurozone.  The sterling exchange rate of 92p to 93p to €1 is killing exporters.  As we are an export-based nation, oil prices and exchange rates which are outside our control have a major effect.  While we also do not control interest rates, that is not an issue at the moment.  We need to stimulate the economy, get people back to work and give some certainty and encouragement.  The Government should not come up with amendments that skirt around and praise everything that has been going when jobs are being lost on a daily basis.  Our proposal is to freeze all Government charges for the next three years, which is not difficult.  The ever-decreasing number of businesses that are paying rates and employing people should not be faced with the uncertainty about possible increasing charges penalising them for staying in business.

I compliment Deputies Phil Hogan and Leo Varadkar on tabling the motion.  The need to help small businesses should be a core value of any economic policy at any time.  It should be a core value of any economy at any time, but particularly now during a time of recession.  In the past 18 months this recession has come crashing down the tracks at unbelievable speed.Over the years thousands of jobs were provided by small businesses.  They would not grab the headlines.  There would not be a Minister rolling into town with his cavalcade to announce them.  There were five jobs here, ten jobs there and 15 jobs somewhere else.  However, they were the businesses that paid their charges.  They were able to absorb the increasing charges during the good years.  They paid their taxes.  They did not get millions of euro in grants from IDA Ireland, but they kept our economy ticking over.  Many of these businesses are now in difficulty.We all know and accept that businesses are being screwed by the banks.  I met a small businessman in Claremorris a few weeks ago.  He told me he looked for a loan of €50,000 a few years ago to expand his business and was offered €300,000 by the banks, which could not stop giving money out to him.  However, he was cautious and wanted to see if his figures held up.  As they held up, he went back a few weeks ago looking for the same €50,000, but now the banks will not lend it to him.  That is the real situation facing businesses at the moment.  If he had got that €50,000, he would have provided two or three new jobs.  That is not earth shattering and would not make news headlines.  However, repeated over thousands of small businesses around the country it would bring taxes into the economy and we would not have the major deficit of billions of euro we hear about every morning in the Chamber.Another hammer blow for many of the small businesses has been the hiking of VAT rates with the effect in the lead-up to Christmas in recent years of traffic jams heading out of the State to buy groceries and other goods.  We all know the effect it had on the motor industry.  The Minister of State, Deputy Dara Calleary, will be very aware of the 15 jobs lost in the Casey motor company in Ballina last week.  That company has been providing jobs in Mayo for the past 40 years, including coming through the difficult times of the 1980s.The motion effectively suggests solutions to the problems of small businesses that are evident in every city, town and village in the country.  On a walkabout in a few towns in my constituency of Mayo last week, I lost count of the number of small shops and businesses that have closed down and been boarded up in recent months.  The Government amendment refers to a focus on training and up-skilling, looking forward to future export growth.  It was not too concerned about export growth during the property bubble when billions of pounds were being given to developers to build hotels left, right and centre that are now closing down.  The reality is that small businesses cannot get money from the banks.  Their charges from local authorities and Government are going through the roof.  Their customers are disappearing and those who are left have no money to spend because of the levies imposed on them.Acceptance of the motion would send out a clear message that somebody cares and is willing to help in their hour of need.  It has long gone beyond time to get real on all these matters that would make a difference.  Earlier, I referred to all the boarded-up shops and businesses in the towns throughout the country.  Could new businesses not be given a derogation from the need to pay some rates for an initial period so that the business could get up and running?  These are not ordinary times and they need extraordinary solutions to get us out of this mess.  If we keep doing the same things that we have always done, we will end up with the same results.  Today's problems need different solutions from what would have been acceptable five years ago.  The upward-only rent reviews represent one example of legislation that is not sufficiently flexible.The Government amendment refers to a strong focus on training and up-skilling for those who have recently been made redundant.  The criteria, qualifications and availability of these courses need to be made much more flexible than they were in the past particularly at this stage.  I want to ask a serious question.  If the Minister of State took this Government amendment into the small shops and businesses in his own constituency of Mayo tomorrow morning, what would those businesspeople say to him about the support they are getting?  I think he and I know the answer.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	428	I want to thank the Deputies who have spoken for their contributions to the debate.  I would like to address some of the points raised.  In opening the debate yesterday, the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, pointed out that the motion is based on the relatively misleading premise that Government charges are the biggest cost faced by businesses in Ireland, which is not the case.  Costs such as energy and labour are of more immediate concern to businesses, large and small, and the availability of credit is the key issue facing the SME sector at present, as has been said by all Deputies during the debate.Let us also remember that improving the business environment for companies is not only about simply cutting percentages off costs and charges, although that is vital.  It is also about driving efficiencies across a whole range of areas that will, when achieved, lead to lower costs, greater productivity and improved working conditions, some of which were referred to by Deputies Ring and Doyle earlier.The Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, spoke yesterday of the Government's consciousness that the administrative burden of regulation falls more heavily on small businesses than on most.  This is recognised internationally, and makes the current administrative burden reduction programme all the more beneficial for small firms.  The need to foster entrepreneurship at every level is central to our economic recovery, and the Better Regulation agenda is a key pillar of this work.  Already, the high level group on business regulation, lead by my Department, has identified more than €20 million of administrative cost savings for business.  I would again urge business, especially small business, to continue to submit practical suggestions where they feel the current burden is greatest.  I, with the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, share a special commitment to this project in order to reduce this burden as soon as possible.The issue of workplace inspections was raised throughout the debate.  I recognise there is a need to streamline, as far as possible, the various inspections that are carried out by the State in order to ensure the laws of the land are being applied and that workers are not being exploited or put at risk in the workplace.  The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2007 provides for exchanges of certain information between the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, NERA, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners.  This facilitates the operation of joint investigations by the three parties, or a combination of the parties.  The focus of NERA in such investigations or inspections is on checking for breaches of employment law, while the Garda National Immigration Bureau may also participate.To date, such joint inspections are only undertaken where there is suspected serious non-compliance or where the employer is refusing to co-operate with one or more body.  NERA has undertaken 50 such joint inspections since the beginning of 2008.Further work is being undertaken to make greater improvements in this area.   An informal group of inspection agencies has been set up to discuss the issues around risk-based enforcement and to investigate how agencies and Departments may co-operate more closely to improve effectiveness.  The group is focusing on potential co-operation between agencies and Departments, as well as identifying cross-cutting themes.  The group intends to report its findings to the high level group by the end of 2009.  Again, I wish to reiterate my personal commitment in this area.The Government is taking a number of steps to support businesses, particularly SMEs, as was outlined earlier in the debate.  Not all of the actions are about new schemes or spending money but about providing practical solutions and advice for companies.  Even straightforward assistance such as the guide for boosting productivity in companies, which was recently produced by Forfás, is free to businesses and can make a difference on the ground.The Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher informed the House last night about recent trade missions to China, Canada and the US, where the Tánaiste is currently on a mission.  Each of these lead to new or extended contracts for some companies and opened important doors for others.  Separate to trading deals being done around those, however, there have also been a number of wider job creation announcements from multinationals already in Ireland or setting up operations here, such as Equinoxe AIS in Deputy Perry's constituency in Sligo, SITA in Letterkenny, McAfee in Cork, PayPal in Dublin and Citrix Systems.  Even today, there has been further positive development with the announcement from the Irish Technology Leadership Group in the US of the creation of a $100 million venture capital fund, and the setting up next year of an Irish technology centre in the heart of Silicon Valley.  In addition, the software company, Sajan, is to establish a new European headquarters in Ireland.Today's KBC consumer sentiment survey was more optimistic than it has been for the past two years.  Business sentiment has improved in regard to the broader economy and, while business conditions are still tough, they are not nearly as bad as they were earlier in 2009.We are very aware of the challenges.  I look forward to working with the Opposition and the committee in order to address them.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	429	I congratulate the Ceann Comhairle on his appointment and wish him the best of luck.The Fine Gael motion calls on the Government to freeze all Government charges on business until 2012.  Speaking as a Deputy who understands the needs of business, I know this motion is the most appropriate response to the circumstances facing every small rural business in the country.Recently, the Government organised a blue skies event at Farmleigh to look into a rosy future when we are next back in the land of plenty.  It took the focus off the current crisis facing the country which was probably a welcome relief for some Ministers, even if it only lasted for a day or two.  Now, however, we are back to reality with a vengeance.  Ministers are going around the country outdoing each other with the talk of cuts in Government expenditure.  The question must be asked, however, what about the current businesses struggling to create wealth and to maintain employment.  Nobody in the Government is sitting down with real business people working a 40-hour weekend at the coal face to ask them about the difficulties they are experiencing.We are in the midst of an unemployment crisis.  Unemployment is at record levels in the north west.  We must do everything we can to maintain existing jobs and to keep people in employment.  The Fine Gael motion puts it up to the Government to assist business in a practical manner by reducing the Government-imposed costs of carrying on a business.  It demonstrates that Fine Gael's priority is to listen to those already providing employment.  The motion is about the specific topic of Government-imposed costs on business.  The Government's amendment is about a general commitment to driving down the cost of doing business in Ireland.In case the Minister is not aware of the situation in the private sector, the Government is driving down the cost of doing business in that sector.  This Fianna Fail-led Government has crashed the national economy and the private sector is suffering the brunt of this crash.  Existing locally-based business are struggling to stay afloat, with the service sector on the floor at present, including hotels, restaurants and many other areas.  All the evidence on the ground is that private sector local businesses and service operators are making significant reductions in their cost base.  This is the only option they have to try to keep the business alive and keep people in employment.We are an open, exporting economy.  Some companies are closing down and jobs are moving abroad, in some cases to other EU countries.  This clearly shows that our costs are seriously out of line with competitor countries.  We must get our costs down in the public sector to match what is happening in the private sector.  Whatever about reducing the cost of the provision of public services, it is critical to maintaining employment in the private sector that there be no increase in Government charges on business until at least 2012.Over the past 12 months, Fine Gael has brought forward a number of specific proposals that focus on the preservation of existing jobs by providing immediate practical measures that will reduce the cost of doing business.  Regrettably, the Government has seen fit to block and frustrate every practical measure proposed by Fine Gael.  Keeping down and reducing Government-imposed costs is crucial for any business to survive in the current climate.  The Government must control and reduce its own direct costs on business as a key contribution to national recovery.  However, instead of reducing costs on business, the Government has maintained and in some cases actually hiked up charges and costs to business.  Energy costs are too high, VAT and indirect taxation is, unbelievably, the highest in Europe.  Every day, companies struggle with tax bills, needless red tape and bureaucratic road blocks.Many companies and small businesses are facing extinction in the present economic crisis.  The situation is even more critical for businesses in the Border counties, which are on the floor.  These companies struggle every day with the euro to sterling differential.  The Government must take action now to give viable business the best chance to survive the current economic downturn.  The motion is a valuable and urgent practical measure.  It fits into the bigger picture of improving competitiveness through minimising Government-imposed charges on business.  It is about the survival of small companies and small family businesses.  It is about trying to support the business people seeking to protect their businesses, including family businesses, and the staff employed in them.  These businesses are key to getting our country out of the mess created by the Government.  I call on Fianna Fáil Deputies to support the motion.

#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	432	I am pleased to support this motion, which goes to the heart of our economic problems.  There is no doubt that there has been a reduction worldwide in the overall amount of goods and services traded.  Our particular difficulty is that the amount of Irish goods and services being sold has reduced by more than the international average.  This is not just because our financial crisis is more extreme than elsewhere but because we have become grossly uncompetitive, declining from fifth in the world nine years ago to 25th in recent months.  The reality is that our economy cannot and will not recover if we are unable to sell our goods and services, and we will not be able to do so if our prices are higher than those of our competitors.  It is a simple equation.  My colleague, Deputy Bruton, has been saying for months that we cannot work our way out of the current budgetary crisis by increasing taxes; we must do it by reducing costs.All taxes, charges, levies, licence fees, rates and duties, no matter who initially bears their cost, eventually filter down to the consumer, whether domestic or foreign.  In other words, it is ultimately the consumer who must pay the extra charge.  It is up to central Government, Government agents and local authorities to reduce their own costs in the same manner as businesses have been required to do.  Moreover, it is not merely a question of charges.  The regulatory and administrative burden on every business, large and small, private and semi-State, has increased substantially in recent years.  I refer to costs arising from the accretion of legislation in recent years, including regulations relating to equal status obligations, freedom of information, health and safety, data control, accounting requirements, payroll costs and so on.  Even apparently minor issues have an impact, such as the cost of administering the travel tax or the burden imposed on local authorities in implementing the pension and income levies.  All these initiatives may be necessary and worthy in their own right, but the Government must be conscious that they increase the cost to every business and consequently the cost of every service and product.We must at least ensure there is some rationalisation of administration in order to reduce costs.  In the restaurant industry in Dublin, for example, there is a ridiculous arrangement whereby fat traps must be inspected by Dublin City Council.  Instead of arranging for this to be done by its environmental health officers, who call to every restaurant in the city several times a year in any case, the council has contracted a private firm to carry out these inspections.  It is not a case of collecting the fat but of inspecting it.  It goes without saying that the associated cost is imposed on businesses, amounting to an additional tax of €600 or €700 on top of the rates already being paid to the city council.  The issue of rates is of particular concern for the tourist industry.  I am aware of one hotel whose owner is paying rates in the order of €10,000 per week.  It is totally unsustainable to have to pay that amount before even selling a sandwich.  It is important that the revaluation of hotels be done quickly, but it currently seems to be taking forever.  Another issue is that revaluations are based on size rather than earning power, but empty bedrooms do not earn anything.In terms of the Government shooting itself in the foot when it comes to the tourism industry, the travel tax is the Daddy of them all.  Tourism supports some 250,000 jobs in the State and for an island country there is nothing more important than access.  Trade from our largest market, Britain, is falling dramatically largely as a result of this tax.  The trade between Ireland and Britain is hugely price sensitive and in some cases, the tax is greater than the fare.  It is a no brainer that something be done to address this.  Calls to that effect have come from all involved in the industry and all of the airlines.  The Government is sleepwalking into a situation where indigenous airlines are increasingly taking aeroplanes out of Ireland in order to serve more competitive locations.  We will never get those services back.  No matter what we have to offer, no matter how good our hotels or how attractive our tourism product, it is of little use if people find it too difficult or expensive to get here.  In that case, we are simply pouring away all the investment that has been made in recent years.The 20% increase in wine excise duty in the last budget slipped under the radar because it did not affect everybody.  However, such a substantial increase in the cost of wine has led to redundancies in the trade and the closure of many wine businesses.  Worst of all, the impact extends into the broader economy because alcohol is the major driver of cross-Border shopping.  People travel to the North to purchase wine and end up buying far more than that.  Money is being driven out of the country as a direct result of Government action, with inevitable job losses.Travel agents are also suffering as a consequence of regulatory requirements and have become something of a disappearing breed.  The onerous 4% bonding charge puts them at a disadvantage relative to on-line travel websites.  That charge made sense when most people booked their holiday through an agent rather than on-line, but it now amounts to inequitable treatment.  This must be revisited in order to reduce costs and save jobs.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	433	I thank my colleague, Deputy Hogan, for tabling this important proposal to freeze Government charges on business.  I had hoped there might be cross-party support for the motion because the measures it contains seem so obvious.  We are facing a multifaceted crisis, a large component of which relates to jobs and competitiveness.  We are relying on the private sector to create jobs because the Government is broke and cannot do so, but those jobs will not be created until we restore our competitiveness.  We must make Ireland a good place once again in which to do business, and that means reducing cost levels.  The motion, however, does not even go that far but merely proposes that the cost base not be increased for three years.  I am very disappointed that the Government is not prepared to support Fine Gael's proposal to assist businesses.Deputy O'Rourke observed earlier that the Labour Party's decision not to support the Fine Gael motion was indicative of a difference in our respective policies on this matter.  If we did not have different policies we would be the same party.  Deputy O'Rourke does not even seem aware of her own party's policy.  The Fianna Fáil manifesto for the local elections included a commitment not to increase local government rates for five years.  However, Deputy O'Rourke acknowledged earlier that this policy has changed and described the increase in rates as minuscule.  The reality is that the increase in rates has been massive, as have the increases in other charges imposed on business, such as water and waste charges.  In the case of a small business whose owner wishes to sell spirits, for instance, the budget increased the licence fee payable from €300 to €500, with the same sum applying for beer and wine.  A small shop with a very modest turnover must pay that licence fee in order to sell wine and must then pay the VAT, excise duty and other taxes associated with selling the product.We expect the private sector to reduce prices and it has done so.  We expect it to reduce costs and it is doing and will continue to do so, but it needs some assistance from the Government in that regard.  However, that assistance is not forthcoming.  Companies are being squeezed on one side by the effect of the recession on consumer spending and on the other side by Government charges.  The result is that businesses are going to the wall and jobs are being lost.  Until we reverse this policy of hiking more and more costs on business, the situation will continue to deteriorate.  The Government must begin with energy costs, which have increased from the second lowest in Europe when this party was last in office to the second highest today.  The existing regulatory structure should be done away with and an instruction issued immediately to the ESB to reduce its prices within two years to the European average.  That will make a difference.  If Ministers are prepared to show leadership by reducing their salaries in line with European norms, they must also have the courage to impose that leadership on entities such as the ESB and Bord Gáis in order to secure price cuts for consumers.The Government must reduce its costs, review the joint labour committee, JLC, system, which is holding up labour costs unnecessarily, and reduce regulation or at least hold it steady for the next three years.  That is all we ask.  We have called for a national action plan on competitiveness to reduce the cost of business in order to make it possible for businesses to survive and create jobs when the upturn comes.  However, we have not even gone that far in the proposal before us today.  All we are asking for in this motion is that the Government does not make things worse for the next three years.  The fact that the Minister of State's party and the other Opposition parties cannot support this really says it all.  Only one party in this country supports business and employment, and that is Fine Gael.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	434	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me an opportunity to raise this important issue on the Adjournment.  I am here to support the call that has been made by a constituent of mine, Ms Michelle Fitzpatrick, for the immediate roll-out of the cervical cancer vaccine to young girls.  Michelle has taken the brave decision to go public with her own diagnosis of cervical cancer to raise awareness of the disease and to call on the Government to reverse its decision not to proceed with the cervical cancer vaccination programme.  Michelle, who is seriously ill with cervical cancer, has made a public plea for the introduction of a programme of vaccination of young girls, including her own daughters.  If it is found that the cancer has spread, she will have a life expectancy of just two years.  If she is lucky, radical surgery will save her life.  Michelle does not want her daughters or any other young girl to go through the nightmare she is going through.  Many people say that life begins at 40, but in Michelle's case, her nightmare began at 40.  She is now 42 years of age and the mother of four young girls.  Her fear is that if the Government does not proceed with a vaccination programme, her daughters will face the same suffering and trauma she is going through.  She is pleading with the Government to offer this vaccine to all young Irish girls.The Minister for Health and Children recently reiterated that she is not prepared to proceed with the cervical cancer vaccination programme at this point.  She has chosen to focus on other competing priorities in the context of the current budgetary situation.  It is staggering that 2,900 women in Ireland are living with cervical cancer.  It is clear that the virus which causes this disease is on the increase in Ireland, as the mortality rate has increased by 1.5% each year since 1978.  Some 200 women are diagnosed each year with cervical cancer, which is a preventable disease.  The incidence of cervical cancer can be effectively reduced through a combination of the cervical cancer screening and vaccination programmes.  Organised screening programmes can prevent up to 80% of cases of cervical cancer and the vaccine can prevent seven out of ten cases of cervical cancer.  The tragic death of Ms Jade Goody, following a battle with cervical cancer, brought this issue to light for many young women.  The disease, which claims approximately 90 lives per year in Ireland, needs to be highlighted and women need to be made more aware of the issues surrounding it.Michelle Fitzpatrick is hoping her story will keep this issue in the public mind.  On 5 August last year, the Minister for Health and Children said she intended to accept the advice of the expert group on the introduction of a universal high-uptake vaccination programme for young girls.  The decision to withdraw the rollout of this vaccination programme puts 106,076 young girls between 11 and 15, the proposed target group, at risk of contracting this form of cancer.  It includes 906 girls in County Leitrim and 1,944 in County Roscommon.  This decision was taken to save funds the equivalent of one eighth of the cost of purchasing the electronic voting machines which are rusting away in a field in County Meath.  The Government is persisting with the decision while spending 6,700 times the amount required for the vaccination programme to bail out the banks of this country.This is a short-sighted action that risks women's health and penalises parents such as Michelle Fitzpatrick, who cannot afford to give her daughters the vaccine required to prevent them from contracting cervical cancer in the future.  I urge the Minister of State to accept the call being made by Michelle Fitzpatrick and other women suffering from cervical cancer and roll out the vaccination programme.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	435	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to this House the importance attached by the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive to the issue raised.The renewed programme for Government states the Government will take further progressive steps building universal health services that provide high-quality health care, fair access and affordability for all, with a focus on several key areas.  The first area mentioned is the implementation of the cancer control strategy.  Within this, the Government makes a commitment to "expand cancer prevention measures such as colorectal screening and cervical vaccination programmes at the earliest opportunity, in accordance with clinical priorities".  The issue is not, therefore, whether the case for a cervical cancer vaccination programme is accepted by the Government, because it is, but how to place such a programme in order of clinical priorities for the allocation of scarce resources available for public health services and for the cancer programme in particular.The Minister has stated elsewhere that, in respect of cancer prevention and screening measures, she believes the next highest priority now is for a population-based colorectal screening service to be put in place for men and women, subject to a cost-effective method being designed.  This is because of the high incidence of colorectal cancer in Ireland, with approximately 2,200 new cases diagnosed every year.  There are approximately 950 deaths each year with colorectal cancer as the major cause.On cervical cancer, all the clinical advice available to the Minister indicates that, in the context of the limited resources available, the national roll-out of a cervical screening programme should take precedence over the introduction of a HPV vaccination programme.  Population-based cervical cancer screening carries both immediate and long-term benefits.  It carries the significant advantage of delivering earlier benefits than a vaccination programme.The national cervical screening programme is now well under way.  The programme, CervicalCheck, is being successfully implemented at a full-year cost of €43 million.  Since its introduction just over a year ago, approximately 250,000 women have been screened.  Some 70 to 100 women present with cervical cancer each year.  The national screening programme for women aged between 25 and 60 years of age has the capacity to eliminate the incidence of cervical cancer by 80% to 90%.The highest priority must be attached to implementing and sustaining the national cervical screening programme, even in circumstances where a vaccination programme is added.  The Minister is keeping the cost of implementing such a programme under review so that, in accordance with the renewed programme for Government, it may be introduced at the earliest possible opportunity in accordance with clinical priorities.
#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	436	I thank the Minister of State for attending.This matter has been of concern to me for many years.  When I was a law student in Trinity College, I was taken by my lecturer at the time, Senator Bacik, to visit Mountjoy Prison.  I was stunned and appalled by the archaic and inhumane conditions in the prison.  At the time, there was much discussion on the need to relocate.  The Thornton Hall option became live and it was expected that the prison in Mountjoy would be relocated in the relatively near future.When I was studying in Kings Inns, I was taken again to Mountjoy as part of my course.  Far from having improved, conditions had deteriorated.  They could only be described as appalling and grotesque for any human being, irrespective of what crime one had committed.I have been contacted by members of the prison visiting committee.  Nobody could turn a blind eye to some of the reports contained in national newspapers over an extended period in respect of the living conditions and the security issues that arise in regard to the unsuitability of Mountjoy as a modern prison.  Let me outline some stark and illuminating headlines.  In July 2009, a headline referred to €40,000 damages being awarded to a prisoner assaulted with a blade in Mountjoy.  A headline in the Irish Independent in June 2009 asked whether the Mountjoy crisis would ever end.  In June 2009 The Irish Times contained a headline stating, “Mountjoy inmates being forced to sleep in showers”.  Also this year The Irish Times contained a headline stating “Prison reform long overdue”.  This is a theme in all the national newspapers.The theme is raised consistently by those associated with and who work in the prison.  Mr. John Lonergan, the longest-serving and most vocal campaigner, for whom I have immense respect, has done considerable work to draw attention to the plight of prisoners in Mountjoy and the appalling conditions to which they are subjected.  The prison has been described as cockroach-infested.  The list goes on and the conditions that exist are nothing short of degrading.  The practices in the prison are clearly inappropriate.  I refer to sleeping on floors in overcrowded cells, in the reception and shower areas, special observation cells and other unsuitable areas.  Other inappropriate practices include sleeping on cell floors infested with cockroaches, mice, ants and other assorted vermin.There is 23-hour lock-up for those on protection, with just one hour per day to socialise with other inmates.  Even this is in a confined, bleak outdoor yard.  Daily bodily functions must be performed while locked up in cells.  Slopping out when the doors are reopened still occurs in 2009.  This takes place regardless of the number of prisoners in each cell.  There can be up to five prisoners in a cell at any one time.  Prisoners must eat all their meals in the confined cell area where they sleep and slop out.  It is really disgusting and inhumane.I assure the Minister of State I am no bleeding heart and take a very tough approach to crime but I believe that, at this point in 2009, it is time that the Government dealt with this issue so prisoners can serve their time in prison with some dignity.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	437	I thank the Deputy for rasing this very important issue.  The issue of overcrowding in prisons is not unique to Ireland.  It is an international problem and this was acknowledged by the Inspector of Prisons in his annual report for 2008.No level of inter-prisoner violence is acceptable.  To that end, every effort is made by the Irish Prison Service to limit the scope of acts of violence.  Stringent security measures have been introduced which have resulted in the confiscation of contraband material such as mobile phones.  More than 2,000 mobile phones were seized in 2008 and figures to the end of August 2009 show that close to 1,700 were confiscated.  However, it must be acknowledged that it is not possible to completely eliminate the possibility of such violence in a prison system which is holding a high proportion of violent offenders without introducing a regime that would be so restrictive as to be unacceptable.Prison statistics show there has been a consistent increase in the total prisoner population over recent years.  Indeed, this situation is particularly apparent over the past 12 months where we have seen the total number in custody increase by 306.  This represents an 8.5% rise in the numbers in custody.  Looking at the figures for yesterday, 20 October 2009, there were 3,998 prisoners in custody as compared to a bed capacity of 3,942.  This is equivalent to an occupancy level of 101%.The Government has provided the necessary resources to improve and expand the prison estate in the past decade or so.  Putting figures to prison spaces provided by successive Ministers since 1997, we have provided in excess of 1,400 additional spaces including a new accommodation block for 100 prisoners which the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, officially opened on 15 September.As set out in our renewed programme for Government we will continue to progress our new prisons building programme including Thornton Hall.  Current projects will provide the potential for an extra 450 prison spaces during 2009 by the following means — a new block in Portlaoise Prisons will have the potential to accommodate approximately 200 prisoners; a new block in Wheatfield prison will have the potential to accommodate 200 prisoners; and the opening of the separation unit in Mountjoy Prisons will have the potential to accommodate 50 prisoners.Notwithstanding this significant level of investment, it is accepted that in some of our prisons we are operating in excess of bed capacity at this point in time.  I want to again reiterate the Government's commitment to replacing the outdated and outmoded Mountjoy Prison complex with a modern, purpose built, regime-focused new prison campus at Thornton Hall.There is no disputing the fact that there are many limitations to the existing Mountjoy male prison.  The Director General of the Irish Prison Service has instructed the governor of Mountjoy to address all local management issues raised by the Inspector of Prisons in his report on Mountjoy.In addition, to further reduce the volume of prisoners committed to Mountjoy, those sentenced prisoners committed by the District Courts sitting in Dún Laoghaire, Swords, Tallaght, Cloverhill and Blanchardstown will be committed to Wheatfield Prison. The Minister will make the necessary order when the additional capacity becomes available in Wheatfield Prison later this year.The Government and senior Irish Prison Service management are committed to taking all proportionate steps to limit, as far as possible, violence in the prison setting.  Stringent security measures will continue to be enforced and additional new prison accommodation will be brought into use in the short to medium term until the Thornton Hall campus allows for the closure of the full Mountjoy complex.  Other non-custodial options such as the greater use of community service orders and the potential to use restorative justice, to name but two options, will be evaluated as will making use of electronic monitoring as a management tool for the management of offenders.The Minister, his Department, the Director General of the Irish Prison Service and his senior management team are all determined to continue to strive to provide good quality prison accommodation and safe and secure custody for all.

Gabhaim buíochas leat as ucht seans a thabhairt dom an cheist seo, atá an-thábhachtach do mo dháilcheantar, a cur os comhair na Dála agus leis an Aire Stáit as ucht a bheith anseo chun freagra a thabhairt ar an gceist.There is a great need for the immediate opening of the operational programme for fisheries to allow for funding to the aquaculture sector and to restore a level playing field for Irish companies to compete fairly in Europe and on the world stage.  The representative organisation of this sector, IFA Aquaculture, has called on the Minister to honour the commitments made by the Government in signing up to the Cawley report on the seafood sector in 2007 and to ensure that in the 2010 budget there is a sufficient level of funding, at least €10 million, earmarked under the co-funding programme for fisheries to be drawn down in 2010.  As a Deputy from a constituency which has both a coastal and rural area, I support this call.  It is incumbent on the Minister to ensure that this vital capital grant aid is open for access immediately.The Irish aquaculture industry is worth €120 million per annum and provides more than 2,000 vital jobs in coastal and rural areas.  It is of particular importance in my own constituency, where jobs in primary production of shellfish are important earners which provide full-time and part-time jobs.  The aquaculture industry also provides vital business for companies supplying a range of goods and services, ranging from fuel to IT, engineering, chandlery and so on.  One company in the Dungarvan area of County Waterford provides 17 full-time and 12 part-time jobs.  The oyster industry as a whole provides approximately 50 full-time and 30 part-time jobs in the Dungarvan area.  Almost the entire product is exported to EU countries and this industry provides vital cash to local economies.The main competitors to the Irish industry come from the EU, Scandinavia, Africa and South America.  For the Irish industry to stay competitive it must continually improve and adapt technology and reduce costs.  This fact has already been recognised by the introduction of the European Fisheries Fund Regulations in 2007.  The regulations allow member states to fund capital programmes up to 40% to improve aquaculture industry efficiency, lower any environmental impact and improve the quality of the final product.I understand that, due to internal disputes between Departments, the funding under the EFF regulations has yet to be made available.  This must be taken against the fact that the governments in every one of our main competitor countries in Europe have opened access to funds from the EU and national exchequers to assist their industries under the terms of the EFF.  The programme runs from 2007 to 2013 and we are now almost at the half-way point.As a matter of the greatest urgency, I am seeking that the Irish small and medium industries involved in the primary production of shellfish are given immediate notification that the Irish national operational programme for fisheries is open for application.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	439	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta Brian O'Shea as ucht an ábhair thábhachtach seo a chur os comhair na Dála agus deis a thabhairt dom freagra a thabhairt air.Let me assure this House that I am actively working to address the current challenges and my objective is to have a scheme in place that will enable grant aid support to be made available to the sector in 2010.First, it is important to note that funding support for the fisheries and aquaculture sectors comes under the European Fisheries Fund Regulations 2007.  In Ireland, the seafood development measure contained in the National Development Plan 2007-2013 is divided between the EU co-funded operational programme and the national seafood development operational programme.  The EU co-funded OP commenced in 2008 with the implementation of the decommissioning scheme and grant aid totalling €36.6 million has already been paid over 2008 and 2009 for the decommissioning of 46 boats.  Following concerns expressed by DG Environment of the European Commission, it was agreed not to include an aquaculture development measure in the EU co-funded operational programme.The national seafood development operational programme 2007-2013 draft was advertised for public consultation in October 2008 as part of the strategic environmental assessment.  During the consultation both the Departments of Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on behalf of the Central Fisheries Board raised concerns regarding the granting of aid to projects where environmental issues arise relating to compliance with the EU birds and habitats directives and sea lice control on salmon farms.  Pending resolution of these issues, the national seafood development operational programme has not yet been adopted.The Deputy has raised the funding of the aquaculture sector specifically.  The delay in the launch of the national seafood development OP has not prevented grant aid from being provided to aquaculture developments in 2009.  The European Commission agreed to the continuation of grant aid under the previous operational programme 2000 to 2006 until 30 June 2009.A provision of €5 million was made available for aquaculture development in the Agriculture Vote for 2009 and I approved the spending of €4.5 million of this for aquaculture projects in both the Border, midlands and western and the southern and eastern regions.  This support has assisted the continued development of aquaculture projects in these areas and the employment that those projects support.In the meantime, this Department and its agencies working with the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government developed a comprehensive plan to deliver compliance with the EU birds and habitat directives for wild fisheries and aquaculture over a determined timeframe.  This plan was submitted to DG Environment for consideration and on 13 May 2009 a meeting between this Department, the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, relevant agencies and DG Environment took place in Brussels to discuss the plan with a view to securing DG Environment's support for the approach set down in the plan.  DG Environment advised at that time that it was, in principle, favourably disposed towards Ireland's plan, subject to a positive response to the issues raised and further clarifications from the Irish authorities on the details of the plan.  However, it has recently advised that it remains concerned about the planned approach to delivering compliance for aquaculture licensing.  The most recent views of DG Environment are being examined.In relation to the concerns of the Central Fisheries Board, a meeting at ministerial level was held in June between this Department and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Following the preparation and consideration of a follow-up report, I intend to engage with Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, who has responsibility for inland fisheries, with a view to agreeing an approach that will give the necessary assurances to that Department so that it can withdraw its objection to the operational programme.I will continue to work closely with all parties to drive both processes forward to deliver on and further develop the strategic change necessary to support Ireland's aquaculture sector.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	440	I am delighted to see my two Government colleagues from County Clare are present to support me in the Chamber tonight.  Such is their enthusiasm that I know they will give strong support to the project and facilitate a meeting between the Minister and a group from Quin so that we can get the extension to the school.I thank the Ceann Comhairle for facilitating me in raising this matter in the House tonight.  Quin national school is in urgent need of an extension to cater for the increased number of pupils, in particular, in the interest of the children's education and for health and safety reasons.  The school was originally built in 1960 and has had no extension to its facilities since 1980 when an extra classroom, general purpose room and a staff room were built.  In the meantime, the population of Quin has soared.  There was a 32.3% increase in population between the 2002 and 2006 census.In 2001, the application for major capital works was commenced under the former principal, Tomás Ó Síocháin.  In October 2005, an application was lodged with the Department of Education and Science.  In 2006, a technical visit was granted and the Department acknowledged that it would review the accommodation for a principal and 12 teachers.  Since then the entire process has come to a standstill.  When I raised the matter in the House with the Minister on the 19 June 2008 he said that a technical visit had not taken place but indicated that he would arrange a visit in the near future when resources allowed and when the project was ready to progress through the programme.  When the technical visit failed to take place, I raised the issue with the Minister again on 8 October 2008.  At that time the Minister changed his mind and could not give a timeframe for the further progression of the project.Last Monday, I visited the school and saw the conditions for myself in which the principal, Ms Anne Fitzpatrick, and her colleagues have to teach children every day.  They do an excellent job under trying conditions.  There are 224 pupils in the school and they currently have only four mainstream classrooms for nine mainstream teachers.  They have no rooms for three special education teachers, which means that two of the teachers work in prefabs and one teacher has to use the staff room.  The situation is intolerable.  The office of the school principal is a cloakroom.I saw the classrooms in the main building where 29 to 30 children were cramped into tiny rooms.  As far as I am concerned, overcrowding is a health and safety issue and it cannot be allowed to continue.  The general purpose and storage facilities are almost non-existent at the school.  The school operates with seven prefabs and the pupils and their teachers get drenched on a regular basis moving from one building to another.  They have applied for another prefab.  However, currently there is no place to put it and the only option appears to be to send 15 staff members to a tiny cloakroom to make room for it when it is provided.More than €500,000 has been spent by the Minister on temporary accommodation to date.  How much more will be spent given the likelihood of other prefabs being required up to 2013?  That money would go a long way towards covering the cost of the extension at the school and would provide much needed work for the construction industry.  The other problem facing the school is that by 2013 it might have to turn children away.  Even accounting for a slowdown in the construction sector, it is estimated that the school will have to cater for 310 children by 2013.Another big problem for the school is that most of its minor works grant is swallowed up by the constant need to maintain an old building.  That building is damp, outdated and has electrical and sewerage problems.  In 2009, it received a minor works grant of €8,793.00 and to date it has spent €18,517.00 on remedial works.  Quin has a vibrant community sector and the local school has an active and hard working board of management.  It has raised approximately €220,000 from the local community to purchase and develop a field to provide additional recreational facilities and to assist with the extension of the school.Staff, pupils and parents are totally disillusioned and fed up waiting for this extension to be given the green light.  I hope the Minister will shed some light on the issue tonight, given the presence of my two colleagues.  While teachers are made to teach in intolerable conditions in schools such as the one in Quin, €386 million remains unspent by the Department in the schools building capital allocation programme.  There is no excuse, therefore, why the project cannot be progressed.I appeal to my colleagues, to the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, and to the Minister for Education and Science, to meet with the teachers and the board of management.  They should listen to their valid case and give the children and people of Quin the extension they deserve and not leave them in the poor conditions that they have had to put up with in recent years.  This is a very important project.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	441	I am happy to reply on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe,who, unfortunately, cannot be present.  He has asked me to acknowledge Deputy Breen’s considerable input into this issue and that of the Minister of State, Deputy Tony Killeen, and Deputy Timmy Dooley, who are also present.I thank the Deputy for raising the matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the Dáil the Government's strategy for capital investment in education projects and also to outline the current position on Scoil na Mainistreach in particular.  In March 2001, Scoil na Mainistreach applied to the Department for an extension comprising one classroom, a resource room, a learning support room, a library, a medical room and a staff room.The school has a current staffing level of a principal and seven mainstream teachers, plus one developing post.  It also has the services of three learning support-resource teachers.  Its current accommodation consists of five mainstream permanent classrooms, three prefabricated mainstream classrooms plus some ancillary accommodation.  The school was recently approved for funding for the provision of additional accommodation for one mainstream classroom.As the Deputy will be aware, all applications for capital funding are assessed in the planning and building unit of the Department.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings and site capacity, leading ultimately to an appropriate accommodation solution.  As part of that process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.  Those criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  That is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.  In other words, a proposed building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.  There are four band ratings overall, of which band one is the highest and band four the lowest.  Band one projects, for example, include the provision of buildings where none currently exist, but where there is a high demand for pupil places, while a band four project makes provision of desirable but not necessarily urgent or essential facilities.  Each band rating has a number of sub-categories which more specifically describe the type of works needed and the urgency attaching to them.The application from Scoil na Mainistreach has been assigned a band rating of 2.2.  That reflects the fact that a school has a deficit of mainstream accommodation which constitutes a significant proportion of the schools overall accommodation needs but that the condition of the existing accommodation is adequate.  As the Deputy will appreciate, modernising facilities in our existing building stock as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth are a significant challenge.  The Government has shown a consistent determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure that the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.  However, the level of demand on the school building programme is such that all projects cannot be carried out together.  They will have to be carried out over time in a structured and coherent manner and that is the reasoning behind the Department's published prioritisation criteria.  The project for Scoil na Mainistreach will be carried out consistent with that approach.  In the intervening period, the school can apply for temporary accommodation to meet its needs if that is necessary.  I again thank the Deputy for raising the matter and assure him that the Minister is committed to advancing the project.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	442	In accordance with the provisions of section 8(1) of the National Tourism Development Authority Act, 2003, it is a day-to-day matter for Fáilte Ireland to encourage, promote and support either inside or outside the State (a) the development of Tourism traffic within and to the State and (b) the development and marketing of tourist facilities and services within the State.Fáilte Ireland administers the Tourism Capital Investment Programme (TCIP), which provides support for the development of major visitor attractions and visitor activities.Applications for support in the categories of Visitor Attractions and Visitor Activities were invited by way of public advertisement by Fáilte Ireland in Spring 2008.  The closing date for applications was end-April 2008.From time to time I receive representations from the promoters of projects, or from public representatives on their behalf, in relation to funding under this programme.  In my replies, I have always made clear that the administration of the programme is an operational matter for Fáilte Ireland, and that I do not have any role in the decision-making process in respect of individual projects.I understand that the Deputy's question may relate to a small number of projects that have been provisionally approved for funding by Fáilte Ireland, but are delayed due to difficulties promoters are experiencing in providing the matching amount of own funding required under the programme.  In this regard, the maximum level of the grant available as a proportion of the overall project is set out in the guidelines governing the programme and this takes into account the relevant EU State Aid rules.  While I appreciate that some promoters have had difficulty in securing adequate levels of finance, Fáilte Ireland have to abide by the terms of the programme, including EU State Aid rules, which require minimum levels of matched funding.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	443	The Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism was designated for relocation to Killarney, Co. Kerry, under the Government's Decentralisation Programme, which was announced in the 2004 Budget.  The Department, excluding the National Archives, was designated an "early mover" by the Decentralisation Implementation Group.A key objective in implementing the Government decision was to manage the organisational challenge while continuing to deliver a quality customer service to the Department's key stakeholders and customers. In order to meet the needs of new staff transferring into the Department, a comprehensive training plan was put in place, which was regularly reviewed and revised.  Procedures Manuals were also prepared in the financial area and in the case of the Department's major capital programmes.To specifically address the potential loss of institutional memory, the transfer of staff into the Department was planned carefully and carried out on a phased basis over a number of years with appropriate training given to new staff as required.  The Department continued to operate successfully and at full capacity throughout the process.To date, 79 members of staff (including two service officers who were recruited locally) have relocated to the new purpose built offices which opened last December in Killarney. In order to provide an efficient and effective service to its stakeholders including the Minister, Minister of State and the Houses of the Oireachtas, particularly when the Dail is in session,  20 posts were identified as requiring a predominantly Dublin presence while officers in those posts also spend periods of time in Killarney. In addition, extensive use is made of the video-conferencing facilities in the Department and every effort is made to co-ordinate and "cluster" meetings in order to keep the need for travel between the two locations to a minimum.I believe that the Department has managed the process  well and has continued to operate successfully and at full capacity at all times.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	444	As the Deputy will be aware, the World Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index was referred to in the Report of the Tourism Renewal Group which was published on 8 October 2009.  I welcome the Report as the central framework for a strategic response to the challenges facing the tourism sector.  I refer the Deputy to my response to the Priority Questions No.  96  and No.  97 put by Deputies Upton and Mitchell in relation to the Report of the Tourism Renewal Group generally.The Tourism Renewal Group examined the tourism policy and programme priorities, actions and targets, with a focus on the new challenges facing the industry.  The Renewal Group considered, inter alia, what targets might be most usefully employed to measure and direct tourism strategy.  In addition to recommending measuring the share of the global and domestic markets held by the Irish tourism industry, as well as visitor and holidaymaker numbers, the Report of the Tourism Renewal Group recommended the use of benchmarks of competitiveness.  This reflects the fact that tourism competitiveness is multidimensional and it is more than simply costs — it is also about the quality of service and experience of the visitor.  It is important to benchmark competitiveness, as performance in terms of visitor numbers is heavily influenced by economic conditions in source markets.In that regard, the Renewal Group identified the Tourism and Travel Competitiveness Report, produced by the World Economic Forum, as a potential source of such benchmarks.  The WEF Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report is similar in nature to its more widely known international Competitiveness Reports.  The WEF measures different regulatory and business-related issues, which it has identified as levers for improving travel and tourism competitiveness in countries around the world.  It scores and ranks every country across 72 different areas, grouped under 14 pillars. As with its other Competitiveness Reports, the WEF uses both hard statistical data and responses to the World Economic Forum's Executive Opinion Survey.As the Index is global, it uses a wide range of criteria, not all of which are relevant to a small, developed, Western European destination like Ireland.  The Renewal Group therefore proposed that Ireland's competitiveness be benchmarkedusing those criteria in the Index most relevant to Ireland andagainst countries, which are reasonably comparable to Ireland in terms of their tourism offering, taking account of their cultural and natural assets, size, location and GDP.The Renewal Group recommended that the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism work with the tourism agencies, with the assistance of the OECD and the WEF, on a suitable subset of indicators that can usefully benchmark Ireland's tourism competitiveness.  My Department has commenced an examination of the Group's recommendation and will be following it up with the other bodies in the coming months.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	445	The Department of Arts Sport and Tourism maintains contact with all other Government Departments regarding matters that affect the tourism industry. In keeping with this practice the Department has been in contact with the Department of Finance and the National Treasury Management Agency regarding the operation of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA).At this stage it is too early to say what impact the operation of NAMA will have on the hotel sector.  However, it is expected that a number of loans that are secured on hotel properties will be taken over by NAMA.  It is also expected that the Board of NAMA will carry out its own assessment of the hotels sector to inform its policy on how to manage those loans. It will be a matter for NAMA to determine how those loans should be managed.It is clear that the manner in which NAMA deals with non-performing loans and the hotel stock secured on those loans will impact on the future operation of the hotels sector.  In this regard, my officials, will remain in contact with the Department of Finance and NAMA to advise on the likely implications of any actions NAMA may take and to promote positive solutions for the future viability of the overall tourism industry in Ireland.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	446	I propose to take Questions Nos. 112 and 122 together.All applications under the Sports Capital Programme are assessed according to the Programme's published assessment criteria.  These criteria, which are issued with application forms, can be summarised as follows:the extent to which projects increase active participation and result in improved standards of sport especially in disadvantaged areas;the financial viability of the project; andthe need to achieve an equitable spread geographically and across different sports and community groups.In addition, projects identified as being located in areas designated as disadvantaged, or as serving disadvantaged areas, are targeted and prioritised.  A scoring system is employed which allocates marks to each application consistent with the extent to which it meets the assessment criteria.  Different weighting is attached to the various criteria depending on their importance.The applications are divided into two categories for assessment — local and non-local i.e. national, regional and municipal-multisport.  For local projects, the level of funding to each county is on the basis of a pro-rata distribution of the available funding on the basis of the population as set out in the most recent census of population.  All local applications from an individual county are assessed by one member of staff to ensure a consistent approach to applications from the county concerned.  These assessments are then subject to quality proofing by more senior officers to the officer which conducted the initial assessment.  Applications which meet the basic qualifying conditions each receive a score, which decides their order of priority within their own county.In cases where a sufficient number of eligible projects is not received from a county, any excess funding is typically distributed pro-rata among counties that have an excess of eligible projects.  Non-local projects are assessed on additional criteria such as the location of the proposed facility within the network of national, regional, municipal facilities and linkages with the Department's Local Authority Swimming Pools Programme.  Following completion of the assessment process, a list of recommended allocations is submitted to the Minister for approval.Both the assessment of applications and the payment of allocations under the Sports Capital Programme is subject to inspection by my Department's internal audit section and by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Any issues brought to the attention of the Department in relation to applications made under the Sports Capital Programme are closely scrutinised to ensure that they comply with the terms and conditions of the Programme.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	447	Any change in relation to the free travel scheme for senior citizens is, in the first instance, a matter for my colleague the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. While the scheme is free for those who are eligible, all of the transport companies involved, including CIE, are paid for the service by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  I understand the estimated cost of the scheme in 2009 is €76.4 million.  Any extension of the scheme to include other EU citizens would have potential cost implications. In addition, I am advised that it would not be possible to provide free travel only to British old age pensioners as this would discriminate on the basis of nationality within the European Union.With regard to tourism figures from Great Britain, I have acknowledged that this is a particularly challenging period for visitors from this market. It is important to note however, that outbound travel from Great Britain has fallen across the board in the face of challenging economic circumstances and the sterling exchange rate.To help address these challenges in the short term, I recently launched an additional €1.5M Marketing Initiative for the GB market which will run until year-end.   It will build on the work that has gone on in the market throughout the year when tens of millions of consumers in Britain have received targeted messages about Ireland, how easy it is to get here and what great value is available. The additional campaign will reaffirm the "Value" message and help demonstrate to the consumer that value and quality here have never been better.In addition, Tourism Ireland initiated its Project Britain review late last year with the aim of seeing where the best future opportunities and potential lie, to give us sustained growth for future years.  I understand that work on this review is being finalised at present and I look forward to launching the new Project Britain Strategy and Action Plan later this year as part of the Tourism Ireland Marketing Plans for 2010.  Future priorities in terms of marketing in Great Britain will obviously be influenced by the content of this review.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	448	As I have outlined in responses to Parliamentary Questions on this matter on the 16th June and 24th September last the operation of the Artists Exemption scheme is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners under the terms of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.The original intention of the legislation was, inter alia, to create an environment in which the Arts could flourish and to encourage Irish artists to remain here rather than going abroad to earn their living.I fully support this scheme, which is in operation now for 40 years.The Report of the Commission of Taxation has recommended the substitution of this scheme by a system of income averaging of taxation for artists.  Such matters will be addressed in the context of how to improve the efficiency of the scheme and streamline its operation so as to maintain the legislation's original intentions for the benefit of artists and their work and to maintain equity in the system.  This consideration will also be dealt with as part of the review by Government of the Commission's overall taxation proposals.When the then Minister for Finance introduced the Finance Act, 1969, he stated that the proposal for artists exemption from income tax was nothing less noble than to enrich our daily lives.  But a more immediate and pragmatic objective of the legislation was also to strengthen and expand the existing cultural milieu by attracting major established international artists to Ireland, thereby facilitating a synergy with the local arts culture.  This was the defining aim of the legislation and not, as some critics of the scheme would have it, to solely support struggling artists.  In any review of this imaginative decision it is worth recalling that these artists would not have come to live in Ireland if the tax relief was not introduced, nor indeed would many of our own artists have remained.  Therefore, artists availing of the scheme by taking up residence here did not cost the Exchequer anything but rather became additional taxable consumers.It is generally recognised that the Irish have a unique aptitude for words, written or spoken, but the relatively stagnant economy of the sixties meant that our artists, with just a very few exceptions, had low international profiles and low levels of income.  Given the economic climate, most artists were struggling to make a living and few could earn enough to be liable for tax.  There was little incentive for potential writers to risk undertaking full time writing.Section 2 of the Finance Act, 1969 and its successor, Section 195 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, transformed the artistic environment.  The inflow of established artists illustrated what could be achieved.  In effect, it created a climate for encouraging and sustaining other artists to enter, in increasing numbers, into full time practice of their art.  Thus the legislation's objectives were steadily realised.As regards the current proposal to review the scheme it is my belief that the 1997 Finance Act and the 2005 review were a comprehensive re-evaluation of the whole scheme and brought in several very worthwhile amendments, without interfering with the basic thrust of the legislation and they addressed the equity issue.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	449	I regard Culture Ireland as a key element of my Department. Culture Ireland's remit is to promote Irish arts and artists worldwide across all art forms including theatre, music, dance, literature, visual arts and film. Since its establishment in 2005 Culture Ireland has made a wide impact worldwide through the promotion and support of over 1,350 Irish cultural initiatives and events in 74 countries.The Report of the Global Irish Economic Forum at Farmleigh, which has just been published states as one of its main findings:- Recognition of the importance of culture in promoting Ireland abroad and developing a unique brand for the country in new markets.  Most participants agreed that our unique and strong cultural identity provides the Government and the private sector with a strong competitive advantage abroad.
Furthermore, several participants argued that our strong cultural identity offered Ireland a big advantage and distinguished us from other countries.  The Report states that in developing this advantage we need to be strategic and a well thought out, long term plan is required, fully funded, and fitting into the overall approach to Brand Ireland . I intend to pursue the recommendations of this Report and to work on the details of that long-term plan.
The outcome of the Farmleigh Forum echoed the Government's Strategic Policy Review of Ireland-US relations, which suggests that “Culture is the means by which most Americans now encounter Ireland... We need to actively explore how we can do better in this vastly underexploited field and we need to invest in the infrastructure that best allows us to do so.”
In investing in our promotional strategy for culture I regard it as hugely important that we ensure that it is coordinated with our strategies for trade, investment and tourism.  At a time when our artists are achieving major international success and recognition for Ireland, it is essential that we maximise the opportunities our arts, culture and creative talents afford our country.  Our global cultural brand is a unique asset which we can use to renew Ireland's international reputation.Culture Ireland has not been established on a statutory basis but operates on a cost effective basis as an agency within my Department sharing all the costs of back up services including finance, I.T. and H.R. as well as shared accommodation. The budget for Culture Ireland will be handled as part of the Estimates process and I will be making a strong case in favour of the strategic value of maintaining ongoing support for Culture Ireland during the upcoming discussions on Estimates.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	450	I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 234 to 236, inclusive, together.Latest figures from the Central Statistics Office show a reduction of 10.9% in the number of overseas visitors to Ireland for the first eight months of 2009 compared with the corresponding period of 2008. As I have said previously, while any reduction in the number of overseas visitors is disappointing, it must be seen in context.  Tourism worldwide saw a significant downturn in the second half of 2008 due to the global economic slowdown and loss of consumer confidence.  Great Britain, as a source market, was particularly affected with the Euro/Sterling exchange rate making it extremely challenging to attract visitors to Eurozone destinations.To assist the tourism sector through this current difficult period, an extensive range of marketing, product development, festival and sporting events, training and business supports have been rolled out by the Tourism State Agencies under the Tourism Services budget of the Department.   For example, despite cutbacks in public expenditure, the core overseas marketing spend has been maintained in 2009 at over €47 million Tourism Ireland is telling customers in key markets that Ireland is easily accessible and offers great value for money at present, as well as rolling out its new destination campaign "Go Where Ireland Takes You".  Earlier this month I launched a Tourism Ireland €1.5m marketing initiative for the remainder of 2009 which will focus specifically on the Great Britain market.On the domestic front, Fáilte Ireland committed to its largest ever campaign to promote home holidays in 2009. In September, Fáilte Ireland launched an enhanced Autumn domestic tourism marketing campaign with special offers and discounts. Fáilte Ireland is also continuing to work closely with tourism businesses all over Ireland, supporting enterprises and helping them to achieve real cost savings and efficiencies.While I know that our businesses and tourism agencies are responding positively to current challenges, it is just as important that the strategic framework for tourism development responds to the changing environment.  Accordingly, I established the Tourism Renewal Group, which was tasked with reviewing and, where appropriate, renewing the current tourism strategy. As well as being represented on the Tourism Renewal Group itself, the tourism sector was widely consulted during the drafting phase. The Group's Report has now been published and in that regard, I refer the Deputy to my reply to the Priority Questions put by Deputies Upton and Mitchell.  The Report can be accessed on my Departments website at www.dast.gov.ie.The industry deserves great credit for its commitment to quality in responding to the current challenging economic conditions through more flexible pricing and offering special value offers and packages. I am confident that, with the support of the agencies, the tourism sector here has the capacity to manage the current cyclical slowdown and that, looking further ahead, the Renewal Group's Review will help the sector to return to sustainable growth in the medium term.

It is allocated to both Tourism Ireland, for the overseas marketing of Ireland as a tourist destination, and to Fáilte Ireland for niche and regional marketing overseas. As a north/south body, Tourism Ireland also receives funding from the Northern Ireland Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment. Both Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland receive separate allocations from my Department for their general administration costs including pay. Accordingly, none of the Tourism Marketing Fund is spent on administrative and office costs.

In doing so, the Government must balance competing demands from every part of our economy and society.I am aware of the Arts Council's desire to have multi-annual budgets, having met with the Council on a number of occasions. I can appreciate the need for stability in budgeting that such a measure would provide, but my Department, is provided with and must work within annual current expenditure budgets through the Estimates' process.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	453	As one of our longest standing competitive and significant internationally traded services, tourism is a key driver of social and economic development at both national and regional levels in Ireland.  Tourism — through the strength of our tourism brand and the quality of the tourist experience — also plays a central role in creating a positive image of Ireland.  The recent Report of the Tourism Renewal Group, which was launched on 8 October 2009, endorses this view and clearly sets out tourism's contribution to Ireland's economic, social and cultural development. One of my priorities as Minister has been to ensure that the important contribution of tourism is widely recognised and that the tourism agenda is accommodated in all the relevant policies and programmes that impact on tourism.  This is being put into practice by my Department and the tourism agencies through engagement with the relevant Departments and agencies.For example, the importance of the tourism sector is recognised and reflected in the Government's Policy Document, Building Ireland’s Smart Economy: A Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal. This makes specific reference to the potential of the tourism sector, highlighting the importance of tourism as a competitive and significant internationally-traded services enterprise as well as its role in strengthening the image of Ireland abroad and its attractiveness as a place to live, work, invest and do business.I am a member of the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Economic Renewal, charged with driving implementation of the Government's Framework Policy Building Ireland’s Smart Economy.  Furthermore, while my Department is represented at the National Competitiveness Council (NCC), which has included tourism in its consideration of key exporting sectors.  Tourism was also one of the topics considered at last month’s Global Economic Forum in Farmleigh, the output of which again highlights the importance of tourism and raises its profile.Promoting public recognition of the importance of tourism to the economy is an ongoing task for Fáilte Ireland, the National Tourism Development Authority, and a number of different opportunities are taken to communicate this message.  For example, in summer 2008, Fáilte Ireland launched a nationwide billboard campaign designed to remind the public at large of the significant contribution made by tourism to the Irish economy.  A module on Tourism Studies has been developed for Transition Year students, highlighting, among other issues, the strategic importance of the tourism industry within the wider economy.  As a key element in its research programme, Fáilte Ireland also routinely monitors the economic contribution of tourism and publishes the key points in its annual Tourism Fact Cards, highlighting the economic and employment benefits of tourism.As I said at the launch of the Report of the Tourism Renewal Group, the very fact that tourism is so central to Irish life and prosperity can make it less visible and valued than it should be.  Nevertheless, much work is being done to raise awareness of the important economic, social and cultural contribution of tourism, amongst the general public and across the relevant Government Departments and agencies.  The Report of the Tourism Renewal Group will help me, my Department and the tourism agencies to build on this work and to heighten further the public recognition of the importance of tourism.

Some €56 million has been provided in the Department's Vote in 2009 for this purpose.  Although no decision has been made in relation to the timing of any future rounds of the Sports Capital Programme, payments are being made to sporting organisations allocated funding under previous rounds of the Programme.  In this regard, as of 19 October, the Department approved almost 1,300 payments with a total value of €47 million.  It is anticipated that all of the €56 million provision will be distributed to grantees in the current year in respect of allocations made in previous years.

The implementation of this Strategy is an operational matter for Fáilte Ireland.In the context of my Department's role as the parent Department for a number of agencies and institutions in the tourism and culture sectors, I gave an undertaking to the Fáilte Ireland National Conference in November 2008, to put in place an initiative to develop the exciting potential of cultural tourism, that would focus on increasing the extent to which the organisations under the aegis of my Department would combine their expertise and resources in this area.The Cultural Tourism Initiative was subsequently launched in  February 2009, when I hosted a meeting with the heads of the State tourism agencies, cultural institutions and arts bodies.  I set out the areas in which I wished to see progress, including enhancing the availability of information on cultural attractions and events and establishing a network for State agencies and institutions in the arts, culture and tourism spheres to improve interaction and further develop Ireland as a destination for cultural tourism.A Steering Group, consisting of representatives of the Department, State tourism agencies, cultural institutions and State arts organisations was established to identify and pursue specific actions in line with the goals of the Initiative.  Actions taken to date have includeda commitment to invest in improved directional and information signage in Dublin,more cohesive integration of marketing arrangements for cultural attractions,implementation of enhanced booking facilities for theatre and event tickets,development of downloadable audio guides, anda new online event guide.In addition, a new performing arts event is being used to evaluate best practice for future developments in cultural tourism.  The Cultural Tourism Initiative is also working with the Irish Film Board to encourage the use of locations of cultural value in Ireland as venues for film and television production, and Culture Night 2009 was successfully expanded to 11 towns and cities.Separately, the Department facilitated a recent meeting between the OPW and the Irish Tour Operators Association (ITOA) to assist in the development of the tourism potential of the heritage sites under the care of the OPW.Finally, the current Discover Ireland Autumn holiday supplement, which has been distributed through the print media and tourist offices, highlights the many cultural attractions available for free or at discounted rates across the country to encourage domestic tourists to explore our rich cultural heritage.

This application was one of a number received from the same employer for claims dating from June of this year.As indicated in that reply, and this is an aspect which is common to all lump sum applications, the Department requested the submission of additional supporting documentation from the employer to substantiate his claim of inability to pay the employee his redundancy entitlements.  This documentation has since been received and is in order.  I understand that the claim is currently being processed and will be paid within the next two weeks.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	461	I have no legislative responsibility in ensuring the payment of building subcontractors on public sector and private contracts.  Payment terms in commercial transactions are determined by the parties concerned and the responsibility for the collection of those payments and general credit control rests with the selling enterprise, in the first instance.Legislation relating to prompt payments is within my responsibility.  The issue of late payments in respect of contractors and sub-contractors is addressed by the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2002 (S.I. No. 388 of 2002). Regulation (2) of the Regulations defines a "purchaser" as follows:"(a) an undertaking which contracts with a supplier for the supply of goods or services to or on the directions of the undertaking, or(b) an undertaking ("the main contractor") — which obtains goods or services from another undertaking to supply to, or(ii) contracts with another undertaking for that undertaking to provide goods or services on behalf of the main contractor to an undertaking;"In accordance with these Regulations, it is an implied term of every commercial transaction that where a purchaser does not pay for goods or services by the relevant payment date, the supplier shall be entitled to interest ("late payment interest") on the amount outstanding.   Interest shall apply until such time, as payment is made by the purchaser.The current interest rate applicable from 1st July 2009 is 8% per annum (that is based on the ECB rate of 1% plus the margin of 7%). That rate equates to a daily rate of 0.022%. Penalty interest due for late payments should be calculated on a daily basis.   In the absence of any agreed payment date between the parties, late payment interest falls due after 30 days has elapsed. The 2002 Regulations also provide for compensation for debt recovery costs. Greater use of these provisions would assist in achieving earlier payments.In addition, under the Regulations, the use of terms that are grossly unfair may be unenforceable and such terms may be challenged in Court on the basis of criteria specified in the Regulations.  Organisations representing small and medium-sized enterprises may challenge any terms that they feel breach the above Regulations. It is open to any such organization to pursue this operation. However, I understand that this provision of the Regulations has not been availed of, to date.The enforcement of contractual rights, including any rights and obligations provided for by the Regulations, is a matter for individual suppliers (other than to the extent that representative organisations can take actions in certain circumstances, as outlined above).  The Regulations do not provide for any enforcement role for my Department in respect of these matters.A copy of the Regulations can be accessed at the Department's website link, as follows: www.entemp.ie/publications/sis/2002/si388.pdf

Details concerning contracts awarded to the company by other FÁS regions are being compiled and will be provided at a later date.  Following the discovery of a problem by a FAS Staff member during the normal monitoring process, the matter was referred to Internal Audit for investigation by the Regional Director in January 2008. Internal Audit commenced their work in February 08.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	464	FÁS has increased the range of training options available to unemployed persons including those with a 3rd level qualification to assist their re-entry into the labour market. Courses, such as Specific Skills Training (SST) and Traineeships which lead to major awards on the National Framework of Qualifications continue to be offered.  FÁS also offers a number of Short Courses (typically 2 modules) as well as Evening Courses, On-Line Courses and Blended Learning Courses which usually lead to component certification and/or industry recognised certification.Significant numbers of unemployed persons, including those with a 3rd level qualification, continue to participate on the above training options. For example in 2008, 27% of participants on SST courses had a 3rd level qualification as had 23% of those on Traineeships.  The choice of course follows a guidance interview and agreement of a Career Action Plan where the applicant in conjunction with the FÁS Employment Services Officer (ESO) deems the course appropriate to their career and employment aspirations.Some new courses are proving popular with those with a 3rd level qualification. These include Management Development programmes at Level 6, 7 and 8, Three- Dimensional CAD for redundant architects, Start your Own Business for a variety of redundant professionals, ‘Green’ technology courses for those who worked in the construction industry, as well as an Entrepreneurial Skills Programme for redundant workers in Financial Services.The Technical Employment Support Grant (TESG) is used where a FÁS Employment Services Officer meets a jobseeker and during the course of a guidance interview, identifies that the jobseeker has a support need to enter/re-enter the labour market, and that this need cannot be met by FÁS directly or any other state provider, within a reasonable timeframe or at a location convenient to the jobseeker.The Technical Employment Support Grant has a limited budget which is focused on short term interventions.  It is not the intention of this fund to support full time or part time third level programmes.  However FÁS is currently reviewing the feasibility of supporting short term upskilling programmes which may be provided by third level institutions.FÁS is also in the process of rolling out the programme Executive/Professional Networking and Support Programme into all FÁS regions to provide support, information and networking to redundant executives, professionals and senior technicians.  Typical participants include CEOs, Architects, Solicitors, HR Managers, IT Project Managers, Senior Technicians and Financial Services Consultants. Most have a 3rd level qualification. The programme will support participants to identify new strategies and develop new skills to meet the changing demands of the labour market, to re-engage quickly with the labour market in either a full or part time capacity, make a change in career direction or commence a business start up.Another initiative which is suitable for the highly educated unemployed is the Work Placement Programme, which is being managed by FÁS. The aim of this programme is to provide valuable work experience for 6 months to 2,000 unemployed individuals. 1,000 of these places are for people who possess a full award at or above level 7 on the National Framework Qualifications. Participants on the programme will retain their existing social welfare entitlements for the duration of their placement.The Department of Social and Family Affairs (DSFA) administers a Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) scheme for unemployed people, lone parents and people with disabilities who are getting certain payment from DSFA. The allowance can be paid to people who wish to do or take second or third level courses of education.  From the 1st May 2009, to qualify for the third level option, the length of time a person must be getting a qualifying social welfare payment was reduced from 12 months to 9 months in line with the National Employment Action Plan when recommended by a Facilitator from DSFA.In addition to the range of higher education courses on offer at under graduate and post-graduate level the Department of Education and Science (co-funded by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment): has put in place a programme for the provision of third level places for Jobseekers.  1,000 part-time postgraduate third-level places and a further 1,500 part-time undergraduate college places are available for jobseekers.  Successful applicants to the scheme will be entitled to continue to receive a DSFA payment and there will be no tuition fees for these programmes

The retirement package paid to the officer, encompassing a lump sum and pension, included an enhancement of 10 added years service, which was approved by the Department of Finance and took into consideration the officer's prior service with Irish Sugar, which had not been reckonable for benefit purposes under the FÁS Pension Scheme.  The package, for which Department of Finance sanction was given, comprised a lump sum of £61,780.89 (£56,232.29 net) and a pension calculated at £20,536.06 per annum.In 1992 a further payment of £75,000 (£39,322.50 net) plus the transfer of a car into the name of the former Director General to the market value of £2,000 was made in settlement of a High Court action in respect of a claim for an enhanced severance package taken by him against the Minister for Labour and FÁS.

The Labour Court issued its recommendation on 21 September.The Labour Court recommended that the company should offer a redundancy package along the lines envisaged in the SIPS (Single Island Production System) deal that had been negotiated between the company and the union in recent years.  The Court also recommended that the company and the union should have further discussions on the union's proposal to conduct a feasibility study in relation to its Dublin facility.I understand that the company decided not to accept the Court's recommendation.  I understand that the company subsequently received a clarification from the Labour Court on its recommendation, although the company has not found it possible to accept the Labour Court recommendation thus far.I understand also that a formal request has now been received from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions for a meeting of the National Implementation Body in regard to this dispute. While no date has been set as yet for a meeting of that body, I hope the parties will continue efforts to secure an agreed settlement in this matter.Ireland's system of industrial relations is, essentially, voluntary in nature and responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes is a matter for the parties involved.  The system of industrial relations in Ireland is designed to help and support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences, rather than imposing a solution on the parties to an industrial dispute.  Responsibility for the settlement of this dispute rests, ultimately, with the parties themselves.  The obligation lies with the parties to seek to resolve their differences and to carry their efforts through to completion.

It has considered the appropriateness and possible nature of an ethical investment policy for the NPRF, taking account of such developments as the UN-sponsored Principles for Responsible Investment, which seek to integrate environmental, social and governance issues, in addition to financial issues, into investment analysis and decision-making. The approaches to ethical/responsible investment taken in other countries have also been reviewed.Submissions from a number of civil society organisations have also been considered. Some of these submissions draw attention to the work of the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative on business and human rights.  The Committee is preparing a report which is expected to be finalised shortly.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	473	I can confirm for the Deputy that there is a 2 km restriction in place for the home carer income tax credit and that a similar restriction is not in place for the dependent relative capital gains tax principal private residence exemption.As regards income tax, Section 466A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for a tax credit known as the ‘home carer tax credit'. Criteria for eligibility for this tax credit includes that the subject of the claim must:be a relative of the claimant (including a relative by marriage);be aged 65 or over, or is permanently incapacitated by reason of physical or mental illness; andreside next door to the claimant in adjacent properties, on the same property or within 2 kilometres of the claimant. As entitlement to the home carers credit is based on the concept of active caring, a proximity requirement is appropriate.As regards capital gains tax, subsection (11) of Section 604 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that an individual may claim the principal private residence capital gains tax exemption in respect of the disposal by him or her of a dwelling provided:rent free and without conditions — by him or her for use by a dependent relative.  A ‘dependent relative' in this context means:the widowed parent of the claimant or of his or her spouse; anda relative of the claimant (or a relative of the claimant's spouse) who is incapacitated by old age or infirmity.There is no requirement for the owner of the house to live near the dependent relative. Only one dwelling can, at any given time, be the dwelling of a dependent relative for the purpose of this capital gains tax exemption.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	474	Approved Minimum Retirement Funds (AMRFs) form part of the Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) options. Under the ARF regime certain pensioners can, after taking their tax-free pension lump sum, choose between investing in an ARF, purchasing an annuity, taking the remaining value of their pension fund in cash (subject to income tax) or any combination of these options. In addition, in certain circumstances, part of the individual's pension fund must be invested in an AMRF.There is no specific age, as such, by which an individual is required to assign money to an AMRF. Indeed, whether an AMRF is required at all depends on the individual's particular circumstances. In order to exercise the ARF option in the first place, an individual must either be over 75 years of age or have, in his or her own right, a guaranteed pension income  for life of a minimum of €12,700 per annum, at the point of retirement ( this is referred to as ‘specified income' in the relevant legislation) . In this regard, the pension or pensions must actually be in payment — pensions anticipated at some time in the future cannot be brought into the reckoning. Pensions paid directly to a spouse or pensions/allowances received on behalf of a spouse or dependant may not be included. Where the minimum specified income test is not met, the legislation requires that the first €63,500 of the pension fund (after taking the tax free lump sum), or the entire of the remaining fund, if it is less than this, must either be used to purchase an annuity for the individual or invested in an AMRF. The individual can also satisfy this requirement by using part of the €63,500 to purchase an annuity and by placing the rest in an AMRF.The point at which the issue of an AMRF comes into the reckoning is generally, therefore, the point of retirement of the individual and the age at which this can occur is not fixed. I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that, while it is a condition of approval of an occupational pension scheme that the scheme rules specify the age at which members will normally retire, any age between 60 and 70 is generally acceptable. In the case of personal pensions such as Retirement Annuity Contracts and PRSAs, benefits can be accessed at any time from age 60, even if the individual is still working. In light of the foregoing, the question of modifying the age at which a person is required to assign money to an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund does not arise.I would add, that the specified income amount of €12,700 (originally £10,000) has been in place since the ARF legislation was enacted in 1999 and is not directly linked to the maximum personal rate of the contributory State pension (for a person under 80) — which stood at €5,876 (£4,628) at that time and currently stands at just short of €12,000 annually. The fact that the rate of pension has increased substantially in the last decade or so while the specified income amount for ARF/AMRF purposes has remained the same is simply an unrelated convergence of the two amounts.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	476	At the outset I would like to say that it is a particular priority of the Government to ensure as much as possible that difficulties in relation to mortgage arrears do not result in legal proceedings for home repossession. Home repossession should be and generally is the last resort for the lender and the preferred method of dealing with arrears cases should be early intervention. There are several important initiatives in place at this time to assist consumers who have fallen into debt or are in danger of falling into debt. These include:The Mortgage Interest Supplement Scheme which provides support for payments of mortgagesThe Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), which is a national, free, confidential and independent service.The Irish Banking Federation (IBF) and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service Operational Protocol on consumer debt.The Financial Regulator's Consumer Protection Code which sets out requirements that a regulated entity must contact the consumer as soon as it becomes aware that a mortgage account is in arrears and that it must have in place a procedure for handling accounts in arrears.The Financial Regulator Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears which, amongst other things, stipulates that a regulated institution must wait at least six months from the time arrears first arise before applying to the courts to commence enforcement of any legal action on repossession of a borrower's primary residence.Furthermore, as part of their recapitalisation scheme, A.I.B. and Bank of Ireland will not commence court proceedings for repossession of a principal private residence until after 12 months of arrears appearing where the customer continues to co-operate with the banks.As Minister for Finance, I have no function in relation to situations where personal bankruptcy law has been enforced against a person who has had their home repossessed. This is a function of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In situations where personal bankruptcy law does not apply, it is a matter for the individual credit institution as to whether they would be prepared to consider offering further credit in such a scenario. However, any decision they take in this regard must be cognisant of and compliant with exiting prudential and consumer protection legislation.In this regard, the Consumer Protection Code, introduced in August 2006 and in full operation since July 2007, puts in place consumer protections of suitability and prohibition of unsolicited credit offers. The Code has specific requirements in relation to suitability, requiring that all regulated entities must ensure that any products or services offered to consumers are suitable and that any product recommended is the most suitable product for the consumer. All regulated entities must set out in writing to a consumer why a product or service offered is suitable for that consumer and the reasons why a recommended product is considered to be the most suitable for the consumer.  The general principles of the Code require that a regulated entity must:Act honestly, fairly and professionally in the best interests of its customers through the integrity of the market; andActs with due skill, care and diligence in the best interests of its customers.In summary, I am satisfied that the existing legislation within the remit of the Financial Regulator provides sufficient scope for consumers to access credit provided that any such products are deemed suitable for the consumer and otherwise are consistent with the provisions of the Consumer Code.  I do acknowledge that the broader area of personal debt management and its legislative framework — an area which relates to the responsibilities of several Government Departments — is one which needs to be looked at. In this regard, the Law Reform Commissions recently published Consultation Paper on Personal Debt Management and Debt Enforcement has made an important contribution to this area and the relevant Departments are presently carefully examining their recommendations.

The notion of de-listing from the self-assessment tax system does not arise and notification that a taxpayer no longer has a source of income from self-employment will normally be made on the annual return of income. Such notification can also be made in the course of claims made to Revenue, (Relevant Contracts Tax claims, for example) or if the taxpayer acquires a new source of taxable income such as a PAYE employment.In the current economic climate, taxpayers in the construction sector may have periods of employment, self-employment and unemployment in a given year and in this context they remain within the self-assessment system and liable to make a return of income.There is regular exchange of information both ways between Revenue and Department of Social and Family Affairs in relation to areas of risk, and the two organisations work together in Joint Investigation Units where they also work with the National Employment Rights Authority.Payments to subcontractors are a contractual matter between the parties to a contract. The protection of such payments in the event of the main contractor going out of business is an issue for the contract to address. If a bond is required to deal with the issue then an appropriate provision should be included in the contract between main contractor and subcontractor. Furthermore, any interference by third parties external to a contract would be considered by the Courts not to be legally binding and therefore unenforceable.

It is not customary for the Minister of Finance to comment on the specific details of tax changes prior to publication of the legislation.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	480	The 2006 Budget and Finance Act introduced an imputed or notional distribution of 3% of the value of the assets of an Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) on 31 December each year, where the notional amount is taxed at the ARF owner's marginal income tax rate. Funds actually drawn down by ARF owners are credited against the imputed distribution in any year to arrive at a net imputed amount, if any, for the year.The imputed distribution measure was introduced because the internal review of tax relief for pensions provision undertaken by my Department and the Revenue Commissioners in 2005 (and which was published in early 2006) found that the ARF option was largely not being used as intended to fund an income stream in retirement, but instead was being used to build up funds in a tax-free environment over the long-term.The 3% rate was phased in over the period 2007 to 2009, with 1% applying in 2007, 2% in 2008 and the full 3% in 2009 and each subsequent year. This regime applies to ARFs created on or after 6 April 2000 where the ARF holder is 60 years of age or over for the whole of a tax year. The provisions do not impact on Approved Minimum Retirement Funds (AMRFs), although funds drawn from an individual's AMRF can also be credited against the individual's imputed ARF distributionThe imputed distribution measure is designed to encourage the use of ARFs as intended and restricts the capacity of individuals to use ARFs purely as long-term tax-exempt vehicles.  I have no plans at this point in time to change or alter the current legislation.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	482	I propose to take Questions Nos. 157 to 159, inclusive, together.The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2009 provides for a package of measures to address the difficulties being faced by pension schemes, one of which is the introduction of a Pensions Insolvency Payment Scheme.  Section 22 of the Act provides that the Minister for Finance may, after consultation with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, make a Pensions Insolvency Payment Scheme (PIPS) providing for the payment of monies to or in respect of relevant pensioners.One of the main aims of the scheme is to support pension schemes in the greatest need on a cost neutral basis for the Exchequer.  For that reason the Government decided to offer PIPS to insolvent pension schemes of insolvent companies, that is, companies which may not be in a position to assist schemes in meeting the original pension commitment made to pensioners.Work on the necessary regulations to give effect to PIPS is well advanced, and it is my intention that they would be brought forward shortly, allowing for the introduction of the scheme in early 2010.  It will then be open to any pension scheme that meets the criteria to apply to participate.  The principal qualifying conditions for PIPS are that the sponsoring employer must be insolvent (in accordance with the definition used in the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984) and the defined benefit pension scheme must be winding up in deficit.In the document Further Measures to Support National Recovery through Social Partnership (June 2009), the Government tabled a number of proposals including the establishment of a Pensions Insolvency Minimum Guarantee Scheme, which would provide for minimum payments to those schemes participating in PIPS, subject to an overall cap.  The Deputy will be aware that discussions are continuing with the Social Partners on a wide range of economic and budgetary issues.

Indeed work is already underway on the design of a carbon tax.  In relation to the issue of fuel poverty, it is acknowledged that appropriate measures may need to be put in place depending on the level of carbon tax introduced.

The Deputy may wish to note that the 2009 Budget publications announced that arrangements would end whereby the annual payment to the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund would be automatically calculated by reference to the previous year's betting duty or the contribution to the Fund in the year 2000 adjusted for inflation.In relation to betting duty generally, it has been my intention to widen if possible the tax base on which betting duty would be applied. Bets placed either on-line or over the phone are generally with out-of-State companies so applying betting duty is therefore problematic.  My officials, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, are looking at the scope to overcome legal and operational difficulties in this area and will continue to do so, on an ongoing basis.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	485	As the Deputy is aware, I announced in Budget 2009 that an air travel tax would come into force in respect of passengers departing from Irish airports on and from 30 March 2009. A general rate of €10 per passenger would apply, with a lower rate of €2 for shorter journeys.The Finance (No.2) Act 2008 confirmed the introduction of an air travel tax from 30 March 2009. However, I took account of concerns raised by the regional airports particularly those on the western seaboard.  The lower rate of €2 applies to departures from any Irish airport where the destination is 300 km or less from Dublin airport. This means that all Irish departures to locations such as Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow are subject to the €2 rate.Ireland is not unique in regard to applying a tax on air travel. Other countries within the EU apply similar taxes such as the UK and France, as do Australia and New Zealand. The rates for the Irish air travel tax are not unreasonable both for shorter and longer journeys, when compared to rates in other countries.It should be recognised that tourists are only subject to the tax on their return journey.  The additional €10 or €2 in the context of a much larger purchasing decision involving travel, hotel expenditures etc. should have only a very limited effect on tourist numbers. The Government appreciates the airline industry continues to go through a difficult period.  However, this difficult trading period arises primarily from weak world economic activity.It should be noted that at present the decline in air travel is an international phenomenon and as a result aviation services are contracting on a global basis. Indeed the decline in the number of people travelling is also evident in those countries where there is no air travel tax in place.We currently face significant financial challenges and the air travel tax is an important revenue raising measure. The Government has tried to be as fair as possible in looking at areas for additional tax revenues.  It is also worth noting that fuel used by commercial airlines is completely exempt from tax, so it's a sector that already has considerable preferential treatment.I do not consider that there are sufficient grounds to abolish the air travel tax as suggested by the Tourism Renewal Group.

Under the provisions of this Act, rateable valuations for all local authorities are determined by the Valuation Office. The local authorities have no role in determining the valuations of property for commercial rates purposes.The basis of rateable valuation for all commercial property is net annual value (NAV) i.e. the rental value of the property. Like all commercial properties, the valuations of hotels are determined by reference to the values of comparable properties on the same valuation list.The Valuation Act 2001 also provides for the revaluation of all commercial and industrial property in the State. The revaluation programme began in November 2005 in the South Dublin County Council area and has since been rolled out to Fingal and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Councils. The revaluation of South Dublin was completed in December 2007. Fingal will be completed later this year and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown will be completed in 2010.  When this first phase of revaluation is finished, it is proposed to extend the programme nationwide. However, a decision on which local authorities are to be revalued in this next phase has yet to be finalised.Once a local authority has been revalued, the Valuation Act provides for a subsequent revaluation not sooner than 5 but not later than 10 years. The Act also provides for the rates income of the local authority to be capped in the year following a revaluation.  The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system and to distribute the commercial rates liability more equitably between ratepayers. Following revaluation there generally will be a much closer and uniform relationship between rental values of property and their commercial rates liability.In those local authorities where a revaluation has not yet taken place, properties will continue to be valued on the existing valuation lists by reference to the valuation levels prevailing on those lists as provided for in the Valuation Act 2001.

Briefly, the main points of this letter are outlined below.I do not accept that Government support of an institution provides any argument in favour of any particular group.  In fact, taxpayers will naturally look to bank employees to understand and respond to the financial situation in which these institutions find themselves.  Jobs in the financial sector are now being protected by enormous taxpayer support.  While ordinary financial sector workers are not to blame for this situation, they are getting more assistance than many other workers in other sectors.  While I will not be participating in the negotiation process regarding this dispute, directly or by seeking to influence directors, and am not giving an opinion on the merits of this particular case, I feel this general background must be borne in mind by financial sector employees generally.

Accordingly, and in line with contract terms, the performance-related bonus in respect of 2007 for the chief executive officer of the Health Service Executive was properly assessed and decided by the board of the Health Service Executive.  In that year, too, all other eligible employees in the HSE received performance-related bonuses.  In regard to future payments, the board of the HSE has agreed to suspend consideration of all performance related awards in respect of 2008.

This Statutory Instrument gave effect to a number of EU directives, including Commission Directive 2003/40/EC, and establishes, among other things, the labelling requirements for natural mineral waters, spring waters and other waters.  Under these regulations the labels for natural mineral waters and spring waters are obliged to give the source of the water; this is not the case for other waters.  However, the label for other waters cannot purport that the water is a natural mineral water or that it came from a spring.  I am satisfied that the provisions of Statutory Instrument 225 of 2007 requires bottled water producers to provide sufficient information to the consumer as to the source of the water to enable them make informed choices when purchasing bottled water.

The operation of the parliamentary affairs division of the HSE (PAD) allows for the centralised receipt, assignment and tracking of Parliamentary Questions within the HSE's extensive network of operations.  More generally, PAD monitors overall performance in relation to the timely issue of replies and provides a central contact for all requests from Oireachtas members for information relating to matters within the statutory remit of the executive.  It reports on a regular basis to the chief executive officer and his management team.In 2008, a timeframe of 15 working days for replies was introduced for Parliamentary Questions referred to the executive for direct reply.  The most recent statistics provided to my Department by the executive show that in the period from January to October 6 2009, 62% of questions referred to the Executive were answered within the 15 day timeframe.

The application of the age range is being interpreted as generously as possible, to include children who are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months at 1 September each year.  This will mean that, in January 2010, children born on or after 2 February 2005 or on or before 30 June 2006 will qualify.  Children born between 2 February 2006 and 30 June 2007 will qualify for the free preschool year in September 2010.  It is of course open to parents to choose to send their children to primary school rather than avail of the preschool year.I should point out to the Deputy that the Early Childcare Supplement (ECS) which is currently payable in respect of children aged under 5 years, will cease to be payable from January 2010 rather than from May 2009.

The primary function of the Review Body is to advise the Government from time to time on the general levels of remuneration appropriate to certain public sector posts, including higher management grades in the health service not covered by the Public Sector Benchmarking Body process.The level of awards made to individual senior managers in the HSE is solely a matter for the HSE Board and my Department has, therefore, asked the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy.No bonus payments have been made to senior managers in the HSE in respect of 2008. At its meeting on 9th July 2009, in response to a request from my Department, the Board of the Executive formally decided to suspend consideration of all performance related awards for 2008 in the HSE pending receipt of further guidelines from central government. All eligible employees were informed of that decision.Since the payment of bonuses is related to performance in the preceding year, no such payments have been made in respect of 2009.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	514	Under the 1970 Health Act, the Health Service Executive may arrange for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition, for the treatment of that condition, through the Long Term Illness Scheme.The conditions are: mental handicap, mental illness (for people under 16 only), phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia. There are no plans to extend the list of eligible conditions covered by the Long Term Illness Scheme, or to provide medical cards on an automatic basis to persons suffering with Crohns Disease.Under the Drugs Payment Scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than €100 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.   Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.

Budget 2009 provided €55 million for the introduction of the new Scheme this year.In advance of the introduction of the scheme, a dedicated subhead for long-term residential care was established within the Health Service Executive's Vote (Subhead B16 in Vote 40). The total funding in Subhead B16 currently stands at €909 million. This represents the total State funding available for long-term residential care in 2009.From the 27th October onwards, Subhead B16 will be dedicated in its entirety to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, A Fair Deal.  However, commitments made to existing residents in nursing homes must also be honoured.  Accordingly, arrangements in respect of these existing residents, including those in the public nursing home referred to by the Deputy, will be funded from Subhead B16 in the immediate transition phase of the scheme. Apart from these transition phase commitments, all other funding within the subhead will be used to support residents qualifying under the Fair Deal scheme.Finally, it should be noted that a person's entitlement to services under any other statutory schemes, such as the medical card scheme, remains unaffected by the introduction of the Fair Deal.

In accordance with the Act, the companies are required to take all proper measures for the management, control, operation and development of their harbours and are required to conduct their business in a cost-effective and efficient manner. Capital expenditure by the port companies is reported upon in their annual accounts, copies of which are laid each year before the Houses of the Oireachtas.As indicated in the Ports Policy Statement, the port companies, as commercial entities, are expected to fund their operations and infrastructure requirements without recourse to the Exchequer. There is no Exchequer funding provided for under the port sub-programme of the current NDP. However, the port companies themselves are projected to spend between €300 million and €600 million on capital projects over the course of the plan.Dublin Port Company did receive €6.9 million of Exchequer funding for two projects under the Seaports Programme of the NDP 2000-2006.

In accordance with that legislation, private bus operators apply to my Department for licences to operate scheduled bus passenger services within the State. Applications are dealt with in date order from the date of their receipt.Two applications have been lodged with my Department for bus services to operate on the route in question. Following the consideration of the first application, a licence offer was issued by my Department on 16th January 2009, in which certain restrictions to the overall proposals made by that operator were proposed.  In a response dated 19th June 2009 the operators declined to accept the terms of the offer and, as previously informed on 12th June 2009, no further consideration was given to their application.My Department is currently finalising the consideration of the second application from another operator for an express service between Dalkey and Dublin Airport and the licence is expected to be issued shortly.  Details of applications are confidential until a licence is issued.

The Garda Síochána Analysis Service and Criminal Intelligence Officers identify crime trends and patterns and utilise pin-mapping of such crimes reported to An Garda Síochána to identify hot-spots. These hot-spots are then profiled and subjected to high-visibility policing, including by Garda foot and mobile patrols and Garda mountain bike patrols. Intelligence is gathered, evaluated and analysed to identify persistent offenders, who are then the subject of specific targeted operations. Garda personnel throughout the Region are regularly briefed on high-profile targets and identified hot-spots, to be targeted during regular patrols.I am further informed that all vehicles involved in this type of crime are subject to technical examination by Divisional Scenes of Crime examiners which, in conjunction with the policy of finger-printing and photographing of arrested persons, are entered into the Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) to assist investigating members of An Garda Síochána in identifying suspects for such crimes. In addition CCTV systems are monitored to prevent and detect vehicle crime.Community Policing Units and Crime Prevention Officers in every Garda Division organise campaigns to provide crime prevention and personal security advice to members of the public. Owners of vehicles are advised against leaving property, exposed in vehicles, which attracts criminals to target their vehicles. Vehicle owners are also encouraged to park responsibly, in a well-lit area or a designated carpark to prevent opportunistic vehicle crime.

Additional gardaí, including a dedicated Public Order Unit, are deployed in this area, particularly during weekends and when events are being held, to prevent and detect anti-social behaviour and other public order offences.  Inspections are carried out of all licensed premises in the area to ensure that the provisions of the liquor licensing and other relevant legislation are being complied with.A policing strategy, in the Garda District concerned generally, has been put in place by local Garda management to target public order and other anti-social type behaviour offences.  The numbers of patrons attending licensed premises and other venues within the District, trends in public order offences and concerns and issues raised by local residents' associations and community groups, local representatives and the local authorities with An Garda Síochána are taken into consideration in implementing the strategy.Local Garda management closely monitors patrols and other operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and policing needs of the communities, to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.

Legislation in relation to the Code and bank law in general is the responsibility of the Department of Finance.  The law in relation to directors of companies is the responsibility of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.In so far as my Department is concerned with jurisdiction of the courts in relation to repossessions, policy is reflected in the recently-enacted Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 which gives the Circuit Court exclusive jurisdiction where cases in relation to the family home are concerned.  The aim is to facilitate those who may be facing repossession proceedings in such cases to enter a defence and to reduce the costs involved.

My thoughts are with them during what is a very difficult time for them.My Department, through both the Consular Section in Dublin and our Embassy in Madrid, was in contact with the family of the person concerned during the week following her death and offered consular assistance to them.  However, while the person concerned was an Irish citizen, she had travelled to Spain on a British passport.  The Spanish authorities, carrying out their responsibility under the terms of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations made initial contact with the British authorities in Tenerife on her case.  The British authorities subsequently provided consular assistance to the family.The family have since expressed the wish that the Irish authorities liaise with the relevant Spanish authorities on their behalf regarding the investigation into the person's death.  The Embassy in Madrid and our Honorary Consulate in Tenerife are making contact with both the Spanish and British authorities on the issue.  Officials from my Department's Consular Section have agreed to meet with the father of the person concerned.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	538	The Government is concerned about the recent reports of violent incidents in Camp Ashraf and also the more general predicament of its residents.Camp Ashraf is home to over 3,000 members of the People's Mujahideen of Iran (PMOI), an Iranian opposition group that established itself in Iraq in 1986 at the invitation of Saddam Hussein.  However, following the war in 2003 and the collapse of the previous regime, Iraq's new Government have made clear their unhappiness at the continued presence in Iraq of the PMOI.Camp Ashraf and its inhabitants were afforded protection by the US military when the US occupied Iraq in 2003.  Earlier this year the Iraqi Government resumed full control of responsibility for security in Iraq from the US military.  It is therefore incumbent upon the Iraqi authorities to ensure the safety and well-being of those still living in the Camp and to prevent the recurrence of violence such as that which took place recently (after residents had clashed with Iraqi police following an attempt to establish a police station in the Camp).  A positive development in this regard has been the release of 36 camp residents initially detained by Iraqi security forces last July and their safe return to the camp.The determination of the Iraqi authorities to establish sovereign control throughout their territory and to resist the establishment of any "no-go" areas is understandable.  The critical point, however, is that there must be no question of a forcible return to Iran of the residents of the Camp.  The Iraqi authorities have so far stated that they have no intention of doing this.This year the Government, through Irish Aid, provided €200,000 in support to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) for its programming in Iraq.  This includes emergency assistance to those affected by the conflict as well as the promotion of international humanitarian law and protection activities, such as visits to detainees.  The ICRC regularly visits Camp Ashraf in fulfilment of its protection mandate, and has regularly reminded the authorities of their obligation to ensure that those living in the Camp have access to such basic necessities as food, water and medical care.The Government will continue to follow developments closely, both regarding the future of the Camp and the wider security situation in Iraq itself.

A specific Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland is a central and vital provision of the Good Friday Agreement.  In this context, the Government has consistently looked for early progress on the issue.As the Deputy is aware, the British Government is currently preparing a Consultation on the Bill of Rights.  I am aware of the concerns expressed by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission in relation to the publication of the Consultation.  Officials from my Department are in regular contact with the Commission regarding progress on the Bill of Rights process and have also maintained regular contact with the relevant officials in the Northern Ireland Office.  I have also raised the issue in my discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, most recently when we met on 19 October 2009.  Based on those discussions I would expect to see some further progress shortly.

The National Gallery remains open until 8.30 p.m. on Thursdays; the Crawford Art Gallery Cork remains open late on Thursdays (until 8 p.m.), whilst the National Library of Ireland remains open until 9 p.m. on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays.  This is in addition to the National Concert Hall, which is of course open in the evenings.Based on information received from the Institutions, my Department estimates that extension of late opening hours to all of our national cultural institutions for two evenings each week would incur additional combined costs of in the region of €18,000 per week, which, over a year, would come to almost €1 million.  The Deputy will appreciate that the provision of such additional funding to our national cultural institutions, in order to facilitate late opening on two evenings, would prove very difficult at the present time.My Department, however, continues to liaise with our national cultural institutions, and encourages the provision of additional public access within current budgetary constraints.  The recently held Culture Night, when all of our national cultural institutions remained open until late in the evening thereby encouraging people of all ages and from all backgrounds to experience a wide range of cultural activities, is a key example of the efforts being made to provide the public with access to our national collections to the greatest extent possible having regard to the current financial restraints under which we must all operate.The Boards of the national cultural institutions are statutorily responsible for all operational matters in relation to the institutions.

Although the figures are down compared to 2008, we still welcomed almost five million overseas visitors in the first eight months of the year.While any reduction in the number of overseas visitors is disappointing, it must be seen in context.  Ireland enjoyed several years of successive growth in visitor numbers, reaching a record of just over 8 million in 2007.  There is no doubt that the period to date in 2009 has been very difficult for tourism globally.  With regard to the Irish tourist industry, there have been significant declines in GDP, personal spending and consumer confidence across all our major source markets.  Exchange rates, particularly the dollar and sterling, and reduced air access to the island of Ireland have also impacted negatively on the flow of visitors.The domestic market is an increasingly important component of the tourism business in Ireland particularly in terms of seasonal and regional spread, accounting for 28% of overall visitor revenues in 2008.  Statistics on the regional spread of tourism in 2008 also show that 94% of holiday nights by domestic tourists were spent outside the Dublin area with 92% of domestic holiday expenditure being generated outside the capital.  This offsets, to some extent, the relative strength of Dublin in the overseas visitors market where it accounted for almost 37% of visitor revenues in 2008.While the regions outside of Dublin earn 70% of all Tourism revenue (based on 2008 figures) the fact that all regions and sectors are not benefiting to the same extent from our tourism industry continues to be a matter for attention from the Department and the State tourism agencies as tourism policy and programmes evolve.I am confident that the regional tourism development strategies for the period 2008-2010 that have been prepared by the Regional Tourism Development Boards and are currently being implemented are facilitating the tourism industry to maximise its contribution to the regions, and that the various region-specific initiatives managed by Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland Limited will further help to address this situation.

The purpose of mortgage interest supplement is to provide short-term income support to eligible people who are unable to meet their mortgage interest repayments in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.The supplement is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance, appropriate to their family circumstances, less a minimum contribution of €24 per week, which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.The Executive has advised that the entitlement of the person concerned to mortgage interest supplement was terminated as his weekly mortgage interest payment of €20.13 is less than the current statutory minimum contribution of €24 per week.The person concerned appealed this decision to an Appeals Officer of the Executive who upheld the decision to refuse mortgage interest supplement on 15 October 2009.  It remains open to the person concerned to appeal the decision of the Executive to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.

No proposals have been received to date but Department officials expect to meet with them in the coming weeks.The future of the dental benefit scheme will be considered as part of the Estimates and budget process for 2010.  This will include consideration of the report of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes, and the decisions on all of the issues arising will be a matter for the Government.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this stage pending the outcome of these deliberative processes.

This year it has been necessary for the Government to take steps to reduce overall public expenditure so as to restore order and stability to the public finances.In this context, the decision was made that the Christmas Bonus would not be paid in 2009.  The decision was announced in the April 2009 supplementary budget to give people advance notice so that they could adjust their finances accordingly.The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive (HSE) on behalf of the department.  The operational arrangements for processing of applications and payment to qualifying individuals, is a matter for the respective community welfare division areas.The issue of any increased demand that may arise this winter on existing resources is a matter for the HSE in the first instance to prioritise workloads and re-deploy resources where necessary so that frontline services are maintained.  The question of any increase in expenditure for staffing within the community welfare service above that currently provided would have to be considered in the context of overall Government policy on public service manpower levels.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	559	The child benefit scheme has, in recent years, experienced significant expansion in the volume of claims received, the rates of payment and the diversity of the customer base.  The annual cost in 2008 was approximately €2.46 billion and the payment is now made for children of some 190 nationalities living in Ireland.Against this background, the control policy for the child benefit scheme has been reviewed to ensure that controls against fraud and abuse of the scheme continue to be effective and relevant.  As a result of the review, enhanced and updated control measures have been devised.  These include the issue, on a quarterly basis, of certificates to sub-sets of customers for completion and return to the Department to confirm that they continue to satisfy the conditions for receipt of child benefit.  Claims are normally registered to the mother and, as the person receiving the benefit, it is her nationality that dictates the status of the claim.In the case of non-Irish national recipients who are resident in Ireland with their children, certification is requested that the children continue to reside here — the proof of such residence can be provided via  details of the school or college their child attends or, if the child is not of school-going age, details of the doctor or crèche they attend.  This information is used to verify that the children are resident in Ireland, and for no other purpose.In the case of EU nationals who are working in Ireland but who have qualified children living in another EU state, certification by their employer of continuing employment is requested.  Again, this information is not used for any other purpose.In 2008 some 80,000 certificates issued to non-Irish customers who qualify on the basis of employment or residency.  In the course of this exercise, it transpired that some 24,000 had changed residence of which 8,000 had left the country and did not therefore have entitlement to benefit.  Certificates are now issued on a quarterly basis to all customers who qualify for child benefit on the basis of employment or residency.  Some 80,000 certificates were issued in 2008 and 315,000 is the likely total issuing in 2009.  The cost is an estimated €1 per transaction — including a postage-paid envelope for the customer's reply.  Savings in 2008 arising from the issue of the certificates were just under €27 million.  In 2009 to date, savings are €58 million and are expected to be in the region of €80 million by the end of the year.The issue of certificates to Irish national customers is being assessed in the light of some recent mailshots.  A mailshot issued to 80,000 mainly Irish-national customers, concerning the early childcare supplement scheme.  Some 1,000 were returned undelivered and the claims were suspended.  The number remaining suspended is 290 and investigation of these claims is continuing.  A mailshot was also issued to 1,500 Irish customers who had not cashed their child benefit payment within the six month period allowed.  Replies are awaited in 51 of these cases.  Both these mailshot projects will conclude in November — when the outcome will inform the nature of further initiatives.Regarding the Deputy's suggestion concerning cross-referencing with current records on the Revenue, schools and unemployment sides, work is in progress to match records of those signing-off unemployment against the child benefit file and it is expected that this system will soon be operational.  The records on the Revenue and Department of Education and Science sides only provide a yearly snapshot as of the end of the tax year or the start of the school year and are not therefore suitable for establishing the position regarding employment or school attendance in individual cases.  The issue of certification forms is monitored on an ongoing basis in the Department.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	564	I propose to take Question Nos. 256 and 259 together.Economic instruments such as the levy on plastic bags can contribute to the achievement of environmental objectives.  Directive 94/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on packaging and packaging waste (the Packaging Directive) is based on the concept of producer responsibility, which effectively requires producers to contribute to the waste management costs of products which they have placed on the market at end-of-life.  Under the original directive, Ireland was required to achieve a 25% recovery rate of packaging waste by 1 July 2001, increasing to a 50% recovery rate by 31 December 2005.  All beverage containers, including plastic bottles and aluminium cans, are considered packaging.Practical implementation of the directive in Ireland is organised mainly through a collective industry-based compliance scheme operated by Repak Limited which is working successfully.  Directive 2004/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council amending the Packaging Directive introduces a new increased packaging waste recovery target of 60% (with 55% by way of recycling) as well as material specific recycling targets for glass, paper/board, metals, plastics and wood.  The National Waste Report 2007 states that packaging waste recovery increased to 63.6% in that year, indicating that Ireland has met and exceeded the target recovery rate of 60% set by the Packaging Directive for 2011.The recycling target for plastics, which Ireland has to achieve by 2011, is 22.5%.  Ireland is well on the way to meeting this target, with the recycling rate for plastic packaging in 2007 at 22.1%.  Where there is no material specific target under the Packaging Directive in relation to aluminium, Ireland achieved a recycling rate of 26.8% in 2007.I fully recognise that despite progress on recycling we need to continue to improve our performance.  The comprehensive review of waste management policy, which I initiated in July 2008, will be informed by the major international report on waste management policy recently concluded by consultants.  My Department is currently examining this report and its recommendations with a view to determining what further measures may be necessary to underpin sustainable waste management services.  As part of the review process, the inter-related issues of enhanced producer responsibility (including the broadening of producer responsibility to a wider range of products) together with the increased use of economic instruments on specified materials are under examination.

The draft Bill proposes to give statutory effect to the recommendations of the working group that had been established to review the management of dog breeding establishments.  The working group recommended that a dog breeding establishment be defined as ‘a premises containing more than five female dogs, aged over four months, with breeding potential'.The draft Bill proposes that dog breeding establishments be required to register with the relevant local authority, that they pay a registration fee and that they meet a minimum set of veterinary, welfare and other standards, together with some associated requirements.  The operation of the dog control regime is a matter for individual local authorities.I intend to publish the draft Bill as soon as possible.

There are no legislative provisions in relation to the minimum proximity a telecommunications mast can be located to schools or houses.There are certain exemptions from planning permission for the placement of antennae on masts by a statutory undertaker.  These include — the attachment of additional antennae to an existing antenna support structure, subject to a maximum of 12; the attachment of antennae to certain existing structures, such as lamp posts, flag poles, CCTV poles, electricity pylons and certain public or commercial buildings.  However this exemption does not apply to the attachment of antennae to educational facilities, childcare facilities or hospitals.The above exemptions are conditional on, among other things, the field strength of the non-ionising radiation emissions from the site not exceeding the limits specified by the Commission for Communications Regulation.  In addition, in the case of the exemption for the attachment of antennae to certain existing structures, there is a requirement on the statutory undertaker to notify the planning authority, in writing, of the proposed location of any such structure at least 4 weeks before the attachment of the antennae.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	576	The objective of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) is to provide access to affordable, scalable broadband services to rural areas, many of which do not currently have any broadband service.  The NBS is being rolled out on an electoral division basis and will address electoral divisions (EDs) that are without adequate broadband services.The terms used to determine the areas that will receive broadband services under the NBS were based on levels of the existing combined broadband coverage in relevant EDs.The NBS, which was approved by the European Commission, seeks to strike a balance between reaching as many un-served premises in Ireland as possible while minimising the impact of the scheme on businesses already providing broadband services in rural areas.After compiling existing broadband coverage maps in the State, the Department was faced with a decision to determine which EDs should be addressed by the NBS, based on the levels of existing coverage in relevant EDs.Where an ED was completely un-served by any existing service provider it was included in the NBS.  EDs that, at the time of the mapping exercise in 2008, were completely served were excluded from the NBS.Where an ED was not substantially covered by existing service providers, it was included in the Scheme.  It is accepted that some of these areas already had a certain level of service.  However, in such cases the entire ED was deemed not substantially covered and consequently was included in the NBS in order to ensure that all residences and businesses in the ED could benefit from broadband services.It is accepted that even after the full roll-out of the NBS there will still be a small percentage of premises that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).  The European Economic Recovery Programme contains a specific provision for broadband services to rural areas and my Department is currently considering options for the design and implementation of such a scheme.  It is hoped to commence this scheme in 2010 and have it completed by 2012.  Discussions have already commenced with the European Commission on the critical first step of applying for and securing State Aid clearance.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	577	I propose to take Questions Nos. 270, 271 and 273 together.The enabling of exchanges for broadband purposes is a matter for the owners of the relevant exchanges.  It is anticipated that the facilitation of greater competition via the introduction of broadband from different technology platforms should encourage the more rapid enabling of exchanges.Broadband services are provided by private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e over the telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, satellite and fibre.While the provision of broadband is a matter for the service providers, there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  In this regard, my Department has undertaken a variety of initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage including the now concluded Group Broadband Scheme and the current roll out of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).Details of the areas of counties Leitrim and Roscommon that will be served by the NBS are available from the service provider, 3, at www.3.ie.  Under the terms of the NBS contract, 3 are required to have service fully rolled-out in the NBS area by September 2010.The widespread acceptance of the benefits of broadband has motivated the EU Commission to set aside a portion of European Economic Recovery Package (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.I am considering how the provision of broadband services to un-served rural premises can be achieved through an appropriate intervention under the European Economic Recovery Package (EERP).  My Department is currently considering options for the design of such a scheme.  It is hoped to commence this scheme in 2010 and conclude it in 2012.  A critical initial step is to apply for and secure, State Aid clearance from the European Commission.  Discussions with the European Commission on this have commenced.

Licences, which are time-bound, are issued under this legislation only if the applicant, following an inspection by officers from the Agricultural Inspectorate of my Department, is found to be compliant with a number of conditions.   Inspecting officers complete their inspection report form, having consulted, as necessary, with the fur farm management who supply statistics in relation to numbers of animals etc.   Any issues relating to non-compliance are highlighted to fur farm managers and appropriate corrective action is recommended.  Completed inspection report forms are copied to the section responsible for issuing the licences, together with a recommendation as to whether a licence should be issued.Licensed fur farms are also inspected by Veterinary Inspectors from my Department to assess their compliance with the Council of Europe recommendations concerning fur animals and Council Directive 98/58/EC concerning the protection of animals kept for farming purposes. These inspections have, to date, found that the licensed fur farms have been operating in compliance with current legislation.Veterinary Inspectors complete an inspection report form and make an assessment of animal behaviour on-farm on the basis of their professional judgement.   Inspecting officers complete the inspection report form, having consulted, as necessary, with the fur farm management.   Animal health and welfare inspection report forms are forwarded to Veterinary Management.   Corrective action is recommended, as necessary, to the fur farm management.

The Agency is self-financing and raises funds by means of a levy on milk purchased for liquid consumption. The levy was increased from 0.127 cent per litre to 0.145 cent per litre with effect from 1 June 2008. The levy finances the annual running costs of the Agency.Under the Milk (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979 as amended, a fee of € 0.001 per litre is imposed on all milk intended for manufacturing or for the preparation of drinking milk.  The fee contributes to the cost of providing the food safety inspection service and other work involved in the administration of EU market management schemes and is a requirement under EU legislation.Under the Bovine Diseases Levies Act 1979 as amended, all milk received for processing from a herd is subject to a levy at a rate of €0.0006 per litre.The total receipts from the above levies for the years 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 are set out in the table.LevyBasis for collection2005200620072008€m€m€m€mDairy Inspection FeeMilk (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1979 (as amended)5.0844.8695.1584,867Bovine Disease LevyBovine Disease (Levies) Act 1979 (as amended)5.6535.3753.2652.890The National Milk AgencyMilk (Regulation of Supply) Act 19940.5620.5830.5840.626The National Dairy Council and An Bord Bainne are both private enterprises.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	583	Having reviewed its decentralisation scheme, and having regard to progress made, commitments entered into and costs involved, the Government announced, on 14th October 2007, the priority projects which should proceed.Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) the Irish Sea Fisheries Board, was amongst the projects identified to proceed.   It is important to note that BIM is the independent, statutory agency with responsibility for developing a sustainable Irish Seafood industry.  The deployment of staff and the general management of the agency are matters for BIM.BIM is planning to officially open the new Seafood Development Centre based in Clonakilty, on Tuesday next, 27th October.  This facility has been developed in response to the key recommendations of the Government led ‘Steering a New Course' seafood strategy 2007-2013. A key element of that strategy is to drive value enhancement, quality improvement, product development, and innovation in the seafood processing sector. The overall objective is to enhance the value generated for the Irish seafood sector from the raw materials sustainably harvested by the Irish fishing industry. Traditionally, much of the fish landed has been exported in raw, bulk form and added value has been captured downstream outside the country. BIM currently estimate that 85% of all Irish seafood produce sold is commodity based. They estimate that each 10% switch from commodity product sales to added value product sales would generate approximately €34M per annum in additional seafood revenues for the Irish industry.The new Seafood Development Centre, which is the first dedicated innovation facility for the Irish seafood sector, will provide commercially focused innovation and new product development capability services to the Irish seafood industry. BIM anticipate that by focusing on delivering value-added seafood relevant to consumer needs the seafood sector can develop more stable high end markets and new products which generate greater profitability for the whole of the Irish Seafood sector.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	588	Working through the arts helps to nurture and develop cognitive, communicative, emotional, imaginative, aesthetic, social, and spiritual intelligences and skills. Arts education in primary schools, through the subjects of  Music, Visual Arts, Drama, and through language, provides opportunities for a child to express ideas, feelings and imaginative insights, to make sense of and express his/her world in visual tangible form; and to make, listen and respond to art.At post primary level, education in Art and Craft, Music, and in the literature, drama, poetry and film dimensions of language subjects, provides an important vehicle for self expression and creativity, and a way of bringing to the fore themes of everyday life which warrant exploration and group discussion as part of the learning process. This education also builds foundation skills in a key vocational/business sector of the economy. The Artists in Schools Guidelines, developed jointly by the Arts Council and my Department provide practical help for primary and post primary schools on how to plan and implement "arts in education" practice.  This is where practising artists give of their time and expertise to work closely with schools, and students get the opportunity to get real experience of the arts in action in communities, both as visitors and participants.In addition to supporting Music in the curriculum an additional allocation of the equivalent of 93 whole time teaching posts are allocated to a range of VECs to support Music education. This takes the form of individual tuition in instrumental and vocal music education, and provision of supports for choirs, orchestras and ensembles.  Through this some 68,000 hours of music tuition are provided annually.This investment is supplemented through a series of summer programmes in the Arts in disadvantaged schools, and a Music Initiative under which schools in disadvantaged areas are given once off funds to purchase or replace musical instruments.  More recently with the support of philanthropic donations from U2 and the Ireland funds, and with the collaboration of Music Network, it has been found possible to announce the establishment of a Music Education for All project, under which 12 additional Music Education Partnerships will be established throughout the country building on an existing model which has been successfully piloted. The initiative will be co-ordinated by Music Network and will be implemented on a phased basis over the coming years.  My Department also provides for substantial levels of investment in Arts Education at Further and Higher level.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-10-21 00:00:00	Prelude	590	The Board of Management of each school is required to prepare a code of behaviour in accordance with Section 23 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000.  My Department further requires each school to have in place a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of an overall school code of behaviour and discipline. Such a code, developed through consultation with the whole school community and properly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.The education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is part of the SPHE curriculum. SPHE is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools.  My Department has issued guidelines as an aid to schools in devising measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness among school management authorities of their responsibilities in this regard. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of their school.My Department has also published policy templates for post-primary schools in five key areas, including anti-bullying on its website of as part of our ongoing efforts in this regard. The template documents are not prescriptive, but rather highlight possible approaches and potential material for inclusion in school policies.  The anti-bullying policy template is based primarily on the key document Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour. However, it does take account of more recent legislative and regulatory changes, and reference is also made to issues of contemporary concern such as the need to tackle text bullying, cyber-bullying and homophobic bullying.My Department has been working with the Gay Lesbian and Equality Network (GLEN) on the development of guidance material for school leaders in supporting lesbian, gay and bisexual students in second-level schools. "Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Students in Post-Primary Schools: Guidance for Principals and School Leaders" produced in association with the education partners and published jointly by GLEN and my Department was recently launched by my colleague, Minister of State Sean Haughey TD.In relation to school staff, Boards of Management, as employers have a responsibility to provide for the health and safety of their employees in accordance with The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act of 2005.  The Health and Safety Authority has also issued a Code of Practice on the Prevention of Workplace Bullying.  It defines workplace bullying as repeated inappropriate behaviour, direct or indirect, whether verbal, physical or otherwise, conducted by one or more persons against another or others, at the place of work and/or in the course of employment, which could reasonably be regarded as undermining the individual's right to dignity at work.I am also aware that the INTO Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Teachers' Group has recently launched Guidelines on Creating an Inclusive Staffroom for Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Staff.  As a supportive resource, teachers can now also access an Employee Assistance Service (EAS) specifically tailored to meet their particular needs. The EAS now available to teachers throughout the country is designed to support the health and well-being of teachers.  The service incorporates confidential counselling on issues such as health, relationships, addictions, bereavement, stress, conflict, critical incident and trauma.  As with all bullying in schools, homophobic bullying is unacceptable and I can assure the Deputy that supports are in place to enable schools both to prevent such bullying and to deal with any cases that may arise.

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. The qualifying criteria for the allocation of SNA support is outlined in my Department's Circular 07/02 which is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.The NCSE has responsibility for deciding on the quantum of resource teaching and/or care supports to be allocated to individual schools to enable them to meet the needs of pupils with special educational needs. Assessment reports carried out by relevant professionals are provided by schools to the SENOs as part of the application process for support. The relevant professionals are determined by reference to the disability of the child concerned.  The SENO takes professional reports into account along with other relevant factors such as the existing level of SNA support in a school when determining the level of SNA support sanctioned to a school.All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.

These professionals may be employed by a number of statutory, state funded or voluntary organisations or operate independently in private practice. The main provider of such services within the education sector is the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) and within the health sector through the Local Health Office and/ or Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service.Such professionals, where suitably qualified, may in turn apply a range of psychometric tests or diagnostic tools, or form judgements by observation or consultation with education practitioners relating to the nature and severity of a child's learning abilities / disabilities. Within an education setting this process would normally be subject to periodic or ongoing review assessment by the teaching practitioners involved and by the appropriate professionals and services over the course of the child's school life.While it is difficult to generalise, in the absence of specific detail in relation to an individual, children with severe learning disabilities would normally present with significant needs and undergo medical/psychological assessment prior to entry into the education system. Liaison in relation to special needs provision and/or placement would take place between the NCSE, the parents and HSE services.  Under the Disability Act 2005 a child with disabilities is entitled by right to an assessment of need. The NCSE facilitates the provision of relevant education services for the child as part of this process.In practice a professional assessment report will be provided to the individual for whom it is commissioned or to their parents/guardians. Within the context of parental or individual consent to so do, copies of the report would be furnished to a range of educational or health practitioners to assist the provision of the appropriate intervention, remedial support or therapy.

The erection of such masts is subject to normal planning regulations which are administered by the relevant Local Authority and subject to guidelines issued by the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government to Planning Authorities.In 2005 the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources issued a report titled "Report on non-ionising radiation from mobile phone handsets and masts". On foot of the recommendations of the report that Department established an inter-departmental committee to examine the health effects, if any, of non-ionising radiation. I understand that this committee in their report concluded that no adverse short or long-term health effects have been found from exposure to the radiofrequency signals produced by mobile phones and base station transmitters.

The recoupment arrangements are being kept under continuous review particularly in light of the current economic climate, where grant assessing authorities may face additional challenges in terms of financial management.A number of local authorities have indicated a need for funding and my Department has facilitated them by making an early payment based on an estimate received.  The Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968-1992 provide for the making of grants by local authorities to enable persons to attend approved courses of higher education. The process, whereby local authorities assess eligibility and make grant payments under the Higher Education Grants Scheme is provided for under these Acts.The arrangements for the payment of grants under the Grant Schemes are a matter for the Local Authorities. The terms of the Higher Education Grants Scheme for the 2009/10 academic year provide for the payment by the Local Authorities of each maintenance grant in three equal instalments as early as possible in each term with the individual payable orders being addressed to the grantholder c/c the Bursar's Office of the College.Under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, each County and City Manager is responsible for staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible.

The position in this case is that a child with special needs is picked up at home in accordance with the terms of the School Transport Scheme for Children with Special Needs. The bus then proceeds to the next pick up point which is close to the catchment boundary.While I understand the Deputy's concerns, I would remind him that the children in question are not attending the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside. They are availing of concessionary transport for which a separate application is made and is only approved once all eligible children are accommodated. Such approval is given on an annual basis. Children availing of concessionary transport cannot be facilitated in the same way as children attending a post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside. In that regard, the most that can be offered is concessionary transport from the catchment boundary.My reply of 13th October set out the general rules which apply to the post primary transport scheme. In this case, due to the fact that the special needs child is being collected at home there would currently be no extra cost or re-routing of the service involved. I will ensure that this particular aspect of concessionary transport is considered as part of the Value for Money Review.

The means test for a grant application is normally based on income in the last full financial year. Therefore, eligibility for a student grant for the academic year 2009/10 will be assessed on income from the 2008 financial year.However, if there has been a change of circumstances in the meantime that is likely to be permanent, then eligibility for the grant may be assessed to reflect those changed circumstances.  For example, where a dependent student's parent experiences a permanent change in income level, for example, through a reduction in working hours or unemployment, then they can apply to their local authority or VEC to have their eligibility for a grant assessed on the basis of the new income level.If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of maintenance grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to the relevant awarding body.  Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant awarding body and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his/her case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to my Department.

A new principal has been appointed to the school and took up this position on 1 September 2009.  I can assure the Deputy that my officials will continue to engage closely with the school authorities to ensure that the issues identified in the WSE report are addressed.

In applying this moratorium generally, teaching and research activities in the education sector have been afforded significant exemptions relative to other areas of public expenditure. Nonetheless, the Deputy will appreciate that the sector has to contribute towards overall public sector numbers reductions.In the area of higher education, the Government agreed that an employment control framework be developed to provide for the application of the moratorium arrangements to higher education institutions, subject to the continued oversight and review by the HEA and both my Department and the Department of Finance. This framework allows flexibility around recruitment into posts that are considered essential to maintaining core teaching and research activities, subject to an overall ceiling on numbers employed. The Government is anxious to work with the publicly funded higher education institutions in achieving necessary reductions in public expenditure within the sector as an essential part of overall budgetary strategy. The employment control framework aims to enable this while providing sufficient flexibility for the protection of frontline teaching and research activities.It is a matter for the individual higher education institutions, including Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT), to manage their staffing resources in the context of implementing the framework. I understand that, within the terms of the employment control framework, the HEA are currently in discussions with DIT in relation to options for addressing some specific operational issues that have arisen there.

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.  I have arranged for the details supplied by the Deputy to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.
