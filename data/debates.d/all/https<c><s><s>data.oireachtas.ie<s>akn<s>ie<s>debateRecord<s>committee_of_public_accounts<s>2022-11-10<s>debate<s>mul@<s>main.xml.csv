If attending in the committee room, people are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19. Members of the committee attending remotely must continue to do so from within the precincts of Leinster House. This is due to the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit. The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, sends his apologies. He is represented today by Mr. Andy Harkness, director of audit, who is accompanied by Mr. Mark Brady, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. This morning, we will engage with the following officials from Rasaíocht Con Éireann, Greyhound Racing Ireland, to examine its financial statements for 2021. We are joined by Mr. John Tuohey, interim CEO and chief financial officer, Mr. Frank Nyhan, chairman, Mr. William Fitzgerald, veterinary director, and Mr. Patrick Herbert, director of regulation. We are also joined by the following officials from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine: Mr. Gordon Conroy, assistant secretary general; Ms Caroline Ball, principal officer; and Ms Louise McAlavey, assistant principal officer. All of our guests are very welcome. I remind all those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off. Before we start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and the practice of the Houses as regards the reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence. Witnesses within the precincts of Leinster House are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the presentation they make to the committee. This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting. However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that this privilege is not abused. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction. Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 218 to the effect that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government, or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies. Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I now call on Mr. Harkness to make his opening statement.

Organisationally, it operates a group structure comprising the statutory body and four subsidiary companies. It operates racing at nine tracks around the State and oversees racing at a number of privately owned or operated tracks. Rásaíocht Con Éireann operates in one of the sectors most affected by restrictions put in place in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Its results for 2020 were substantially affected and a full recovery of activities was not achieved in 2021. As a result, Rásaíocht Con Éireann incurred a loss of €1.4 million in respect of tote betting and other race-related activities in 2021. This followed a loss from those activities of €1.8 million in 2020, and compares with a surplus of €400,000 generated from racing activities in 2019. Rásaíocht Con Éireann relies substantially on Exchequer funding, and received €19.2 million in 2021, up from €16.8 million in 2020. This funding was sourced from the Agriculture, Food and the Marine Vote via the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund. The other main source of income in the year was the contributions from owners and sponsors towards racing prize money, totalling €1.9 million. On the expenditure side, Rásaíocht Con Éireann incurred costs totalling €16.7 million in 2021. This included €8 million paid out in prize money, €3.3 million spent on racing regulation, welfare, and integrity costs and €1.4 million spent on marketing and promotion. Overall, Rásaíocht Con Éireann made a surplus for the year of €3 million. The 2021 group financial statements received a clear audit opinion.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	2	On behalf of Rásaíocht Con Éireann, Greyhound Racing Ireland, I thank the committee the opportunity to come before it today. I am the interim chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the board and I am accompanied by our chairperson, Mr. Nyhan, Mr. Fitzgerald, our veterinary director and Mr. Herbert, our director of regulation. As set out in the invitation to attend, the accounts for examination before the committee today are the financial statements for Rásaíocht Con Éireann for the year ended 31 December 2021. It was a positive year for Rásaíocht Con Éireann from the greyhound racing perspective as a full racing calendar was completed consisting of 1,384 race meetings compared with 1,085 in 2020, accommodating 15,533 individual races in comparison with 11,651 in 2020.Some 91,778 greyhounds were entered into these races. Covid-19 restrictions severely curtailed attendances. However, 158,029 patrons attended greyhound racing events in 2021, which was an increase from 2020, when the attendance was 126,376. Financially, Rásaíocht Con Éireann operated prudently within budget with the aid of Government Covid-19 supports and careful cost management. The organisation is reporting an operating surplus before interest, depreciation and taxation for the year of €3.8 million, increasing from the €2.2 million surplus achieved in 2020. Food and beverage sales from stadia operated by our events and hospitality services division amounted to €0.9 million for 2021, generating a gross profit of €0.6 million. Tote turnover for the year was €7 million, with €1.7 million being received in international co-mingling income.  The sale of media rights from race meetings generated €1.9 million in the year. Total prize money paid for the year was €8.1 million, increased from €6 million in 2020. Care and welfare of greyhounds is the main priority of the board and expenditure in 2021 totalled €3.3 million, increasing from €3 million in 2020. The defined benefit pension scheme, which is closed to new entrants, is now closed to future accrual. The net defined benefit liability at 31 December 2021 amounted to €568,000 and a funding plan has been agreed with the trustee to address this liability. Significant improvement has been achieved in addressing the working capital deficit, moving from a negative €1.4 million at 31 December 2020 to a positive €1.4 million at 31 December 2021. I once again thank the Chair for the opportunity to come before the committee. We will endeavour to respond to all members' questions. However, if there is any additional information required arising from this meeting, we will be pleased to provide that information in a prompt manner.

I will start on the issue of animal welfare. I refer to the income and expenditure accounts for the overall care and welfare programme. On the disclosure of all expenditure that has occurred in relation to greyhound welfare, why did the Accounting Officer not prepare this in a singular note so the user of the account could easily identify the type of expenditure? Can he give us an explanation on that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	4	This would be in respect of the two categories - the racing regulation welfare and laboratory integrity and governance section and then, separately, the greyhound care fund. Are those the two items the Deputy is referring to?
#AlanDillon	unknown-#AlanDillon-party	unknown-#AlanDillon-dob	unknown-#AlanDillon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	5	That is correct. The care fund, specifically.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	6	The background to the care fund dates from 2019 when it was established with the purpose of ringfencing certain income which would then be used specifically for greyhound care fund purposes. That income was to come from 10% of gate receipts, 5% of net tote revenue and 50% of most of our sponsorship. We then expended those funds in specific categories of expenditure around fostering, welfare homes and those areas. That was the reason that we identify it as a separate line on the income and expenditure account.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	8	The majority of the expenditure in 2020, approximately €1 million of it, was in respect of a Covid support scheme that we brought in to effectively assist in feeding the greyhounds while racing was suspended. It was €2 per day per racing greyhound. In total it came to just under €1 million. The other aspects of it were in relation to the fostering and so on.
#AlanDillon	unknown-#AlanDillon-party	unknown-#AlanDillon-dob	unknown-#AlanDillon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	9	For 2020, the expenditure was €1.1 million. What was the total expenditure for 2021?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	10	In 2021, the total expenditure from the fund was €523,000.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	12	It is specifically because in 2020 we had to expend additional funds during the period when the greyhounds were not racing. The Deputy will see also that our prize money was reduced in 2020 compared to 2022, and that is where the greyhound owners and trainers receive their income.
#AlanDillon	unknown-#AlanDillon-party	unknown-#AlanDillon-dob	unknown-#AlanDillon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	13	Does Mr. Tuohey have an estimate for 2022 in terms of what percentage of overall expenditure is utilised on animal welfare?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	14	We will probably be coming in or around the same figure - in excess of €3.3 million for the year.
#AlanDillon	unknown-#AlanDillon-party	unknown-#AlanDillon-dob	unknown-#AlanDillon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	15	How about for the care fund?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	16	The care fund would be in and around €0.5 million by the time the year is up. It depends on attendances and so on. However, any shortfall that occurs in relation to any of the programmes, we have we make up from other funds.
#AlanDillon	unknown-#AlanDillon-party	unknown-#AlanDillon-dob	unknown-#AlanDillon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	17	Can Mr. Tuohey give us an explanation of the respective roles Greyhound Racing Ireland and the Irish Kennel Club have in relation to animal welfare?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	18	I might pass over to my colleague, Mr. Herbert, in relation to that specifically.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	19	The Greyhound Racing Act 2019 chiefly assigns Greyhound Racing Ireland as the promoters and developers of greyhound racing in Ireland. The Irish Kennel Club is very much based on greyhound breeds. It has its own microchipping database as well. In Greyhound Racing Ireland, the registrations are carried out through the offices of the Irish Coursing Club, which is based in Clonmel. It is the statutory appointed body that looks after all areas of registration, breeding, mating, whelping and litter registration. Chiefly, under the provisions of the 2019 Act, we are the purveyors of racing regulation and welfare maintenance relating to the greyhound industry. We also have authorised officers under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 in addition to being operators Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011, which is the only set of statutory legislation in this country chiefly assigned to one canine breeds, that being greyhounds.

In relation to traceability around these, how many does he estimate are not chipped to date?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	21	Under the microchipping regulations, every canine in this country has to be chipped, outside of greyhounds. It is national legislation. It is a racing requirement that every greyhound is chipped. The Irish Coursing Club, ICC, operates its own microchipping and it is an authorised database.
#AlanDillon	unknown-#AlanDillon-party	unknown-#AlanDillon-dob	unknown-#AlanDillon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	22	Mr. Herbert said every racing-----
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	23	I apologise. Every greyhound in this country is microchipped, chiefly by the ICC stewards who are the operators of an authorised database called MicroDog.
#AlanDillon	unknown-#AlanDillon-party	unknown-#AlanDillon-dob	unknown-#AlanDillon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	24	Are they signed up to Greyhound Racing Ireland's traceability system?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	25	Yes. I would take the opportunity to talk a bit about that, but there is extensive communication between the Irish Coursing Club that feeds into the traceability system from our side, in addition to a race management system. I would love the opportunity to talk a bit further about that if it would interest the Deputy.
#AlanDillon	unknown-#AlanDillon-party	unknown-#AlanDillon-dob	unknown-#AlanDillon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	26	The question was in relation to the traceability system. How many greyhounds does Mr. Herbert reckon have not been signed up to that? How does Greyhound Racing Ireland monitor the welfare of greyhounds that have not been signed up?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	27	The provisions of the microchipping regulations require that every canine is microchipped at 12 weeks. The information on greyhounds chipped by the Irish Coursing Club is immediately fed into the traceability system.
#AlanDillon	unknown-#AlanDillon-party	unknown-#AlanDillon-dob	unknown-#AlanDillon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	28	How many inspections have the welfare officers carried out?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	29	I have the figures to hand. As the chief executive has already pointed out, the board has a very clear focus on animal welfare. It is stringently supported by our board, thankfully. Just over 2,000 welfare inspections have been carried out to date in 2022. The figure for last year was just over 1,200. This covers all greyhound establishments including owners, trainers and breeders.
#AlanDillon	unknown-#AlanDillon-party	unknown-#AlanDillon-dob	unknown-#AlanDillon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	30	How many premises have licences to train greyhounds? How many of these premises have been inspected in 2022?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	31	All trainers' premises are routinely inspected in the course of a year. They are also subject to an application process whereby they must reapply on an annual basis for a trainer's licence under the trainers' regulations of 1961. In advance of any licence being issued, an authorised officer inspects the premises from an operational and welfare perspective to make sure it complies with the requirements of the code of practice that we published last November.

Has it taken appropriate action to address them?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	33	Greyhound racing is a sport. As with every sport, there are people who excel at it and people who do not. There are people who will transgress regulations and people who will not. We are no different from any other sport in this regard. Are we a perfect industry? No, we are not. We have regulations and I assure the Deputy we have ramped up our regime on welfare adherence and regulation. With regard to the inspection figures in 2021, there were 235 welfare investigations and the figure to date this year is 485. Arising out of these, in 2021 we issued 82 fixed penalty notices under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act.
#AlanDillon	unknown-#AlanDillon-party	unknown-#AlanDillon-dob	unknown-#AlanDillon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	34	There were only two convictions.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	35	Absolutely. We issue a number of fixed notice penalties. The whole essence of the Welfare of Greyhounds Act is to try to bring people with us. We have an aged participation in the industry. It is very much about trying to drive compliance. We are not afraid to bring people before the courts where the case arises.
#AlanDillon	unknown-#AlanDillon-party	unknown-#AlanDillon-dob	unknown-#AlanDillon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	36	What are the disciplinary measures?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	37	The provisions of the Welfare of Greyhounds Act and the Animal Health and Welfare Act allow cases to be brought to the District Court. In recent years the board has issued a number of exclusion orders arising out of court prosecutions pursuant to the Greyhound Industry Act 1958. These exclusion orders chiefly exclude that person from attendance at a track, coursing meetings and authorised sales.

How many greyhounds are rehomed with financial assistance provided by the board to private rehoming agencies?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	39	I will defer to my colleague on this. Mr. William Fitzgerald is the veterinary director.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	40	There are a number of strands to this particular question. The IRGT is a registered charity that is 25 years old this year. It operates under a deed of trust. In 2021 the IRGT rehomed 2,234 greyhounds. There were 1,001 directly rehomed and 1,233 rehomed through the private rehoming organisations we work with.
#AlanDillon	unknown-#AlanDillon-party	unknown-#AlanDillon-dob	unknown-#AlanDillon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	41	Were these a combination of racing greyhounds and standard greyhounds? Is there a differentiation between types of greyhounds?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	42	No, we do not differentiate. They are greyhounds that no longer race. They are greyhounds that are registered in the Irish greyhound studbook. We do not differentiate. To the end of October 2022, we rehomed 1,509 greyhounds through the same channels. The breakdown of this is 740 directly through the IRGT and 769 through our private rehoming partners.
#AlanDillon	unknown-#AlanDillon-party	unknown-#AlanDillon-dob	unknown-#AlanDillon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	43	What is the contribution made by Greyhound Racing Ireland to provide financial assistance or Exchequer funding to support them?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	44	The assistance comes on a number of levels. Preparing the greyhounds to be rehomed involves a number of facets. The first of these is getting the dog neutered. A contribution of €50 per greyhound is made towards this. There is also a contribution towards the cost of vaccinations and preparing health checks of the greyhounds to the amount of €80 per greyhound. Since the beginning of February this year there is an additional €50 per greyhound for any dental work required.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	46	It is €180 per dog for the direct preparation of the greyhounds.

Is this figure available for 2021?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	48	Through the IRGT we spent €450,000 in respect of veterinary fees.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	50	Funding for the IRGT comes through Rasaíocht Con Éireann. A contribution of 2% is taken from winners' prize money and allocated to the IRGT. This amounted to €101,000, matched by Rasaíocht Con Éireann and supplemented further to the tune of €363,000 in 2021.

It has provided more than €450,000 of Exchequer funding to put the dogs through the right processing system. How is welfare monitored on an ongoing basis?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	52	In the process of rehoming these greyhounds, each individual application goes through a process of assessing whether the dog is the right fit for the person or family. This includes home checks and conversations with prospective owners as to whether it is a good fit for them. Their level of experience of owning a dog is assessed as is what having a greyhound in their life would mean and the changes they may expect as a result. This is particularly acute at present. I am quite sure the Deputy has seen reports not only from us but from other rehoming charities, specifically Dogs Trust, on dogs being surrendered. Dogs were taken into homes during the Covid pandemic but surrendered when people returned to work in the office. The transition from being a racing dog to a retired dog is a two-pronged process. It is not only about getting the dog prepared but also that the people who take the dogs in know exactly what they are dealing with.

I will begin by calling a spade a spade. People who are unfamiliar with the sport ask questions about why it should be in receipt of such a degree of money. A good opening question from my point of view is to ask what benefit this has for the economy. I know Greyhound Racing Ireland undertook extensive economic research in the Power report. What does this do for rural Ireland and the circular economy in return for Exchequer funding?What economic benefits does it provide society?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	54	Initially, the Jim Power report was commissioned in 2021. The economic benefit on an overall basis was highlighted in a number of categories within that report. It is primarily of benefit in rural Ireland, where the greyhound racing community, owners and trainers are primarily based. It is in their local economies. It is also a spin-off where the stadiums are based, so employment is generated directly and indirectly from all of the stadiums. Obviously, that is not confined purely to rural Ireland. Shelbourne Park is our flagship stadium, located in Dublin, and it is the largest generator of income from an events and hospitality perspective.

How many people are employed in it? How many breeders are there? Do the witnesses have those figures available? It is very important for Greyhound Racing Ireland to give the public at large some idea of why that investment from the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund is worthy of going to it and what the knock-on positives are. I ask the witnesses to give a bit of depth and scope there. How many people are involved overall on the breeding side? I would also like a bit more detail on the level of attendances at the tracks.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	56	I will take the direct employment first. Approximately 118 people are employed directly full time within the organisation as we speak. Part-time casual employees, which include workers in our restaurants, in our tote, track maintenance services and so on, would make up a further 480. That figure fluctuates and will increase as we come into the Christmas season. Indirectly, on the breeders-----
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	57	We would have somewhere in the region of 4,000 active owners. When I say "active" I mean registered in the last 12 months. Our racing pools indicate the number of greyhounds actively available for entry at any one time. The Deputy will appreciate that this changes. It is a very fluid thing when bitches come into season and greyhounds are laid off from the racing period. Our racing pools would fluctuate on a monthly basis from somewhere between 4,500 and 5,000 greyhounds that are actively available for race entry across our licensed stadiums.

Incomes collapsed as a consequence of people not being able to attend race meetings and from the drop in income from the tote. How much is made from media licensing? SIS has the contract there. How much income comes from that on an annual basis?

The interim CEO has already briefly referred to this. During the period of inactivity around Covid, we introduced a Covid-19 greyhound care payment scheme. It provided for a subsistence payment for each active racing greyhound during the period and it covered 6,650 greyhounds. The scheme was introduced to ensure basic needs were met during the period of inactivity while prize money was not being paid. The expenditure on that for the period in question was €998,000.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	64	For the Irish greyhound studbook?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	66	Under the provisions of the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011, the responsibility is very clearly with the Irish Coursing Club.
#JamesOConnor	unknown-#JamesOConnor-party	unknown-#JamesOConnor-dob	unknown-#JamesOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	67	Okay. From the perspective of the future of greyhound racing, the number of dogs produced is a concern for animal rights activists. I am sure the witnesses are going to hear a lot more about that today. What work could be done, within reason and not damaging the sport, to try to improve the transparency around breeding and reduce the number of dogs in breeding? If that were done, would there be consequences for the level of meetings and the income for the organisation? That is a question that needs to be asked for those who are unfamiliar with the sport. The vast majority of the Irish public do not have any in-depth knowledge of greyhound racing.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	68	It is not insignificant that we would have seen a decline in breeding during Covid. Thankfully, numbers are returning at the moment. The Deputy may or may not be aware that all brood bitches in this country are DNA profiled. All whelps, in addition to being microchipped under national legislation, are ear tattooed and identified that way as well. I mentioned the Welfare of Greyhounds Act. It specifically provides for a code of practice, which we published in November of last year and which sets out provisions for the absolute minimum care for greyhounds and how they should be maintained. That covers all greyhounds - retired, racing, the whole lot. That statutory legislation is the only legislation in this country that is specifically directed towards one canine breed. There are provisions in that legislation for breaches in how greyhounds are kept. Our board takes a very serious view of any cases that come before the courts deals with people accordingly.

Looking at this year so far, how are attendances going? Are they recovering to 2019 levels in any shape or form?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	70	I will defer to the interim chief executive on the attendance figures.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	71	We are seeing a strong recovery in attendances this year. At the end of October, on an overall basis we had in excess of 250,000 people attending the meetings. There has been a strong recovery. We are obviously targeting to improve that further. Post Covid, it was a good outcome because people were a little reticent to return to crowded areas and so on. It has been building momentum right through the year.
#JamesOConnor	unknown-#JamesOConnor-party	unknown-#JamesOConnor-dob	unknown-#JamesOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	72	I will return to the issue of the studbook. I asked this question and I would expect to get a proper answer. The level of dogs being bred per year is a huge concern. That would be the view of the general public overall. If you were to take a straw poll of a random sample of the population, I am sure that is what would come back as the biggest problem. Could Greyhound Racing Ireland do anything to try to tighten that up or increase the regulatory standards? Could the witnesses look at that and come forward with a plan? It is the way business is done in the racing industry with horses. I know the breeding of dogs is very different and obviously involves a different number of pups being born. A horse normally has one foal but that is not the case with a dog or bitch. Is that something that could be looked at, to try to bolster the level of accreditation and confidence in greyhound racing in this country? That should be done, if it can be.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	73	We are always looking at areas to try to improve standards, whether that is in how greyhounds are kept, breeding standards, racing standards or welfare initiatives. It is important to note that there is also an active export market for greyhounds. That is supported by the numbers being bred. In 2017 there were 6,767 Irish-bred greyhounds registered in the UK, which would have been exported there.The number decreased in 2021 to 5,882. That is a sizable proportion. Over 80% of greyhounds that race in the UK are of Irish extraction. There is active support for owners and breeders in this country and an active, fluid market which exports greyhounds to the UK. It is an important part of the greyhound industry. It provides support and a rationale for the numbers being bred in this country.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	74	I welcome our guests. I think I am the only one here who was on the committee a few years ago when Bord na gCon, as it was then known, was in front of us. There were two meetings which we do not forget lightly. I am glad to see there have been some changes, with a new financial controller coming in a couple of years ago. I understand a new commercial director has been appointed and will be in place early next year. I regret that the CEO left, because I think things were beginning to change. The process to appoint someone is ongoing. I hope whoever is appointed has a lot of commercial sense and knowledge of the whole racing industry because it is specific knowledge. I have questions regarding figures. In the 2021 report, prize money is given at €8.1 million. I want to get a sense of this. If the contribution from owners, sponsors and Sports Information Services, SIS, is subtracted, what is the prize money? Is it closer to €3.75 million or €4 million?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	75	On page 28 of the annual report, the contribution to the prize money noted under expenditure, excluding the contributions from owners and sponsors, is €6.2 million or €6.3 million.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	76	What if SIS is deducted?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	77	I would not see it as a straight deduction, in that the prize money comes from the horse and greyhound racing fund. Media income is additional income generated.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	78	It is generated because of that. If those are all added up, the direct contribution to the prize money is approximately €4 million rather than €8.1 million.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	79	I would not consider it fair to deduct the income that we generate from the SIS, which contributes to the prize fund-----
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	80	I know what Mr. Tuohey is saying and respect that. I am trying to get to how much from the horse and greyhound racing fund, which contributes to the organisation, is used for paying prize money versus running the organisation. By my calculation, while one can argue the toss over a couple of those contributions, that fund, which was set up to deliver prize money, was used for approximately a 70:30 split between running the organisation and the prize fund over a few years. Horse Racing Ireland is the only organisation to compare this with. It spends approximately 65% on prize money. The organisation is taking up a vast amount of the fund. Is that fair to say?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	81	I would not agree. The activity of greyhound racing is generating the income. Other commercial activities are taking place. We generate income and revenue from events and hospitality. It would not be fair to say that it should be deducted from the money paid from the fund. If we generated no income from the media rights, the prize money would still be provided to races.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	82	I appreciate that, but the bottom line is that approximately 70% of the fund given to Greyhound Racing Ireland from the tax created by the Government is used to run the organisation. In any scenario, that is lopsided. The only organisation to compare with is Horse Racing Ireland, which spends 35% on the organisation and 65% on the prize fund. I allowed for Covid. The previous figures go to nearly an 80:20 split, while the previous year is a 65:35 split. The point is a large majority of the funding is used for running the organisation rather than for prize money. Page 28 is on media and other income. There is a sum of €65,500. Why is SIS funding not in this part of the report on media and other income? Page 28 indicates that there was a loss of €1.48 million from racing activities. Why is that not part of this? Why is the spending on SIS not here?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	83	We would consider SIS income as part of our total turnover from racing activity. That particular category of media and other income covers sundry income that is generated. It is not a significant amount.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	84	I know that. Why is all media not together?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	85	Because we believe we rightly categorised SIS income as part of the income from racing activities.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	86	There is a racing activities loss of €1.48 million and spending on marketing of €1.469 million. I know we have had a difficult year, so I am allowing that, though it is not the answer to everything. Some €1.469 million was spent on marketing, for a loss of €1.48 million.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	87	One would need to look specifically at what is contained within our category of marketing expenditure. It is not purely marketing campaigns. It involves the staffing of our marketing department, commercial and sales department, and the staffing and running of our sales centre. There are a number of different elements to it.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	88	I appreciate that and Mr. Tuohey's honesty. In my eyes, if one added the marketing activities and the SIS revenue, it would be €3.381 million for a marketing spend of €1.469 million if one adds the coverage through SIS and the marketing. It is extraordinary to have spent €1.469 million on marketing for a loss of €3.381 million. I will move on. I have a question for the Department officials. Concerns have been expressed here and in reports about the board. I know a new CEO is being appointed. Best of luck to the interim CEO who is doing the job. In every Department, there are certain criteria when it comes to appointing people to boards, as well as the Public Appointments Service, which was the right thing to bring in. There is a concern that there is not actually anybody on the board with distinctive, extensive knowledge of the industry. Is the Department concerned about that? How does it know that the board has enough knowledge to adapt greyhound racing to modern times?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	89	As the Deputy is probably aware, vacancies on the board are advertised. We select a number of different possibilities and their names are put to the Minister. On any board, our approach is to ensure that there is a mix of different skill sets, including financial governance, as well as industry experience. We look to ensure that that happens. We are satisfied with the current board composition.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	90	I would not be satisfied with it, so it is a matter of opinion. There is not enough industry expertise. Take the stadiums, for example. This was referenced in a number of reports, including that compiled by Indecon. Many of the stadiums are in an awful state. I am not sure some of them would pass health and safety. It is an issue that must be addressed and I would appreciate it if there was more board expertise. I have a question in respect of the catering company. It is very hard to delve into the figures in the report, but how much of a profit has the catering company made over the past three years?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	91	I will take that one. On a gross profit basis in 2021 we generated €600,000. During the period 2020-21, it was obviously in-----

The officials could write back to the committee and do a comparative analysis of the past five years of expenditure and income and then profits with respect to how catering was done prior to it being insourced versus when it was outsourced. They can take 2020 out. That can be supplied to the committee; I do not expect the officials to have it here. I would appreciate that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	95	I would like to elaborate a little on the extent of the responsibilities of our events and hospitality function.

We can delve through the figures to see. I just want to see if it was a good idea to do it and whether it is covering itself because there was some profit had from it under the old system.

Some of the numbers imply that the dogs are in Ireland until they are at 24 months old. That is not the case, is it? Thus we are six months short on some of these numbers. If one looks at the number provided to Jim Power, Greyhound Racing Ireland is counting them as still being in Ireland at 24 months but, in reality, they might be exported to the UK at 18 months.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	205	Yes, an age profile.

If exports are included, we are double counting those figures. We are then using the figure of just under €6,000 for cost. Let us take a person who has a litter of six pups and, being kind, let us say three or four pups get to a point at which they can race. You are talking about a massive outlay for a trainer. The sales figures do not necessarily indicate that there is any payout for them. It seems to be a huge loss-making exercise.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	207	The sales figures track greyhounds sold at authorised auctions in Ireland. The Deputy will be aware that, with the advent of the Internet, there are also private online sales in the UK that are not tracked by our figures of licensed sales.

Based on the report, there is double counting of numbers in terms of pups, the dog pool and exports. It does not add up. It seems this industry is not about racing at all but about breeding, as some 85% of dogs in the UK are from Ireland. Irish greyhound racing is a peripheral industry to the breeding industry. It goes directly to the United Kingdom and is propping up the gambling industry there, which is a £2.7 billion industry. I do not know if they need €19 million of Irish taxpayers' money to prop up their gambling. The Greyhound Board of Great Britain, GBGB, has just announced that because of concerns over Irish welfare, they are going to start breeding. The business model, even based on the GRI report, will be under pressure. We will no longer be able to export at the level that we do now. Are there concerns about the export levels to the UK based on the GBGB announcement?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	211	By way of a general comment on the export of greyhounds, GRI can only track the sales price per the sales that go through official auctions.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	213	I put it to the Deputy, why would a person raise greyhounds at a loss?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	230	I happen to have to hand the number of Irish-bred greyhounds exported to and registered in the UK for the past five years. In the period from 2017 to 2021, the figures were 6,767, 6,392, 6,005, 5,707 and 5,882.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	232	It has been consistent. While we do have licensed auctions, the majority of greyhound sales are done by private arrangement via Internet sales etc. and we would not be privy to their disclosure value. As was said, that is the litmus test for sales activity in this country.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	233	I move on to the issue of legal costs and settlements. In 2021, the total amount incurred due to legal costs was in the order of €374,000, an increase of more than €174,000 since 2020. As that was nearly a 100% increase, is there an explanation as to why there was such a substantial increase in legal costs?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	234	We had some High Court cases.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	250	As of this month, it would be 118 full-time employees.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	252	It varies a bit but it is approximately 480 at the moment. That fluctuates up and down, however, and will increase as we go to Christmas.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	254	No major change.

Rásaíocht Con Éireann obviously has a five-year plan. How does Mr. Tuohey see that giving a return for the investment that has been made by the Department?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	256	At this moment, we are in the process of finalising a strategic plan for the next five years.

The overall aim of the board is to reduce our dependency on the horse and greyhound fund grant by increasing the commercial activity associated with the industry.

If we take prize money, for instance, 75% of the prize money in real terms is coming from the Exchequer.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	259	We see potential for increasing sponsorship in the industry as it becomes more popular and as we increase footfall. We also see potential for an increase in income in media streaming in co-mingling and also in general commercial activity, particularly around the use of stadia on days other than when there is racing. We have completed a process of hiring a new commercial manager who will be commencing work in January and who has experience in that field.

The number of new young people coming into it is extremely small. When Mr. Nyhan looks at that five-year plan, does he believe that can change?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	261	Yes, we do. We believe that we had an extremely bad period from 2019 forward. Part of that was because of our lack of advertising about what we do and how we care for animals. We believe we have turned that corner and we that we are attracting new people into the industry. The profile of persons who have been appearing at our tracks in recent times is encouragingly much younger.

As the Deputy knows, the basis of the industry generally tends to be people with small numbers of greyhounds racing them. The numbers of dogs in our dogs pool are quite encouraging.

As I said, a large proportion of the prize money in races is coming from the Exchequer in real terms. Does Mr. Nyhan believe looking forward that we can reduce the amount of money from the Exchequer going towards the provision of prize money? I understand that in order to keep the industry going, there has to be prize money. Does Mr. Nyhan believe that over the next five years, however, the funding from the Exchequer can be reduced and that the organisation or whole structure can become far more self-sufficient?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	267	The basis of the plan will be to reduce our dependency on State funding over the five-year period and longer into the future.

Basically, Rásaíocht Con Éireann signed an agreement with a third party with regard to debt of €0.5 million.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	278	Okay. The particular figure is with regard to €250,000 in respect of capital debt forgiven. That was the figure that was written off. It is not a figure of €0.5 million. To explain, that particular item was historical debt that dated back to 2012 and 2013 when expenditure was being incurred in the development of the Clonmel stadium. At that time, it received a grant for the works that were being done. There was a shortfall in the order of €250,000 to complete the project. The particular circumstances are that Rásaíocht Con Éireann owns the greyhound stadium in Clonmel. We lease it to a private company called Davis Road Greyhound Stadium on a long-term sporting lease. The money that was spent at the time on that building is in respect of a building that is ultimately owned by Rásaíocht Con Éireann. It should maybe have been structured differently at the time. Having not being around at the particular time, it was probably treated as a loan to finish the job to try to ensure that all the works were completed.

We invited the then CEO and the board to a meeting in early September, but we were told that it would not be possible because the Irish Greyhound Derby semi-finals and final clashed with the invitation, even though those took place on Monday nights. We learned shortly afterwards that the CEO had resigned. She had only been in place since January. Why did she resign?

Eight months later, she announced that she was leaving for another opportunity, but no one on the board decided it would be a good idea to talk to her and find out why she was taking that course of action.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	411	I believe it is approximately €130,000. There is a band within which it falls.

It is a well-remunerated position for someone to leave after eight months. I am not aware of any public announcement of the previous CEO taking on a major new role.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	413	Nor am I, but that is the position.

I do not understand why Greyhound Racing Ireland accepts the funding model to which it is tied. We could debate whether it gets too much or too little and people will have their own views on that, but the funding it receives annually is directly linked to what another organisation receives. I asked the Comptroller and Auditor General whether there is anything even remotely similar anywhere else in the public finances, but he could not think of any. Why has the board accepted this position and not sought to have it changed?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	415	I do not understand. Changed in what way?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	417	It is a percentage of the fund.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	418	A precise percentage of the fund. Every year, Greyhound Racing Ireland gets 20% of that fund regardless of what plans, proposals or ambitions it has for reform, expansion or reorganisation. Greyhound Racing Ireland's funding depends on what another organisation is getting. I do not know how Mr. Nyhan as the chair or how the board have not been kicking up holy hell about this.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	419	Both organisations are dependent on what the fund is, given that there is a split between us. It is a statutory split. We accept the percentage that we are getting and are grateful for the State's support.
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	420	The support Greyhound Racing Ireland gets could decrease if Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, brought a bad proposal to the Department and the Department decided that, since HRI got €70 million in 2022, it only needed €60 million next year. Automatically, Greyhound Racing Ireland's funding would be reduced. If the Department decided that the greyhound racing sector needed to be maintained at €18 million per annum, HRI would get €70 million even though there was an adjudication that it only needed €60 million. Does Mr. Nyhan not see the problem?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	421	This matter is dealt with at departmental level. My understanding is that each organisation submits its proposals, budgets and requirements to the Minister and that the combination of these determines what the fund is.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	423	Yes. We submit a proposal to the Department on what we believe our funding requirements will be for the following year. We meet the Department and our figures are tested.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	425	That forms part of the process.

How much did it ask for for 2023?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	427	The Minister is also involved in that process.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	429	I cannot remember what the figure in the proposal was. We sought more than €18.2 million.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	431	I do not have the exact figure, but it was not too much more than that. It was in or around that amount.

Does Mr. Nyhan not believe this is a bit strange? I am asking him about his organisation's submission on how much it felt it needed in State funding for next year. Greyhound Racing Ireland has been allocated €18.2 million - that is subject to Dáil approval, which has not been given yet - yet Mr. Nyhan does not know how much it wanted.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	437	I believe it was approximately €1 million more than that, but I do not have the figure with me.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	438	We can get the committee the figure.

What will lose out? What was in the organisation's plans that will not be achieved next year as a result of receiving €1 million less than was sought?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	440	The budget will be determined by the amount of money ultimately allocated by the Dáil, as to what we will do with next year's money.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	442	It is on an annual basis.

It is a flat rate saying this is how much will be paid on salaries, welfare, prize money, etc. Then Greyhound Racing Ireland gets its allocation, so then it does up a new-----
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	444	Then we prepare our budget for the year.

This is a unique situation. Does Mr. Nyhan understand how it makes no sense to say his organisation sought a certain amount, got less and is taking it on the chin? No other organisation comes before an Oireachtas committee and says it got €1 million less than sought, but that is life.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	446	That is a matter entirely for the Oireachtas.

I will go the Department. What evaluations are happening in relation to the horse and greyhound fund? Does the Department still believe that it is appropriate to allocate funding to either organisation in a way that one is dependent on the other?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	450	We sought advice from the Attorney General in 2020, and the advice was to continue in this way using the horse and greyhound fund.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	483	Yes. We respect the report prepared by Jim Power, who is an eminent economist.

This is according to the information available to me. If it is wrong it is wrong. It was that "the IGB is not actually a racing-centric organisation and that the primary focus of the organisation is actually on Breeding. That focus causes some 15,000 pups to be bred for racing each year, for a Dog Pool with approximately 3,600 dogs." Do the witnesses disagree with that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	485	That is the one we spoke about earlier.

It is stated as a fact. Which of those facts does Mr. Herbert disagree with? "That focus causes some 15,000 pups to be bred for racing each year, for a Dog Pool with approximately 3,600 dogs." Is that correct?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	488	With due respect, that statement is drawn from the analogy of the number of greyhounds purported to be euthanised in the industry. That is the subject of the defamation case. I would prefer not to comment on it.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	489	Do the witnesses agree with the assertion that Rásaíocht Con Éireann is not a racing-centric organisation and the primary focus is on breeding?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	490	Greyhound Racing Ireland is chiefly involved in greyhound racing under the provisions of the Act.

It went on to say that in excess 6,250 dogs - this is 2017 and my understanding is not much has changed since - are exported to England, Scotland and Wales for prices less than 50% of the production cost, a fact that has enabled Irish greyhounds to take over 83% of the British pool of dogs. Is that correct?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	492	The percentage quoted in relation to the percentage of the British pool being of Irish origin is correct.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	494	Correct.

Earlier Deputy Hourigan dealt with this. I welcome the traceability system. That is a positive step. It is important that the industry or sector - "sector" is a better word; "industry" is not good when talking about dogs - should have its reputation protected. I do not have a problem with it once animal welfare is looked after. We want it to be successful. The traceability is there from 12 weeks on. Do the witnesses accept there is an issue with traceability prior to 12 weeks?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	498	Absolutely. That was the chief impetus of the traceability system. It was taken in the context of "Prime Time" programmes and Preferred Results. We did not have an accurate track of greyhounds in this country prior to that. Since the traceability system was launched, we have.A considerable amount of work was put into the system in the two years in advance of rolling it out in January of last year. The board, as of last month, has approved further work on the system for expansion in 2023
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	499	Rásaíocht Con Éireann makes no direct payments to anyone for breeding greyhounds. Our payments are made through prize money which is to the racing greyhounds. I find it very difficult to understand why one would breed greyhounds and sell them to the UK at a loss.

I think the witnesses would accept that. The report outlined that the root causes of the mass culling of pups needed to be addressed and that it could threaten the industry. Do you accept there is an issue to be dealt with?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	503	I will interject because I knew the Chairman would go down this road. I do not accept that there is mass culling of pups in this country. I fundamentally do not accept that. The traceability system and our increased care and welfare programme have addressed many of the issues. I am not saying there were not issues in the past but we have made significant inroads. I have mentioned before that we are not a perfect industry. We have made considerable inroads in the area of care and welfare. It is no accident that it is the chief focus of our current board. It is also the chief focus of the strategic plan to which the chairman alluded earlier on. It is to the forefront of this. If this is industry is to have any longevity, let there be no doubt among the members, the clear war chest of the industry has to be the care and welfare of the greyhounds in this country.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	505	I wanted to say what Mr. Herbert said in that there is no mass culling of greyhounds in this country, nor is there any evidence of such.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	509	We cannot do anything for the first 12 weeks but from the time from when they are microchipped, we can account for all greyhounds. That is the whole point of the traceability system.

I understand you cannot account for greyhounds from the moment of birth. You are telling me you can account for all greyhounds but we know you cannot account for anything up to 12 weeks. Are the 12 weeks statutory? Can it go beyond 12 weeks? Can an owner let it run to 13 or 14 weeks? Is there flexibility or is set at 12 weeks?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	517	It is important to note that the traceability system refers to racing greyhounds in this country for which we are responsible for by statute. It does not relate to coursing greyhounds. However, we capture information on whelping; location; controller; age; sex; and microchip to age two. We also capture information on the death, sale and export of greyhounds and their retirement as a pet and potential for racing. We have the ability to edit details such as change of location, loss, theft and provision of a routine update of when they are kennels or transfer location. More importantly, there is a provision that anybody who does not comply with the updates that are required of traceability is immediately suspended from entering greyhounds at tracks and does not get the option to draw down any past prize money won.

The board of which I was a member handled that report very badly. The board received a commissioned report which it did not pass on to the Department or make public. It should have done so. That has been ventilated here previously. That aspect of it is indefensible. The figures in the Preferred Results report are not correct as far as I and the board are concerned. That is why we introduced a traceability system which establishes beyond doubt that the assumptions made by Preferred Results are incorrect.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	539	I will indeed. There are two Preferred Results report as I understand.

Some €524,000 went into the greyhound care fund in 2021. That is a decrease of €668,000 from 2020. There was €464,000 and €235,000 for both years for the retired greyhound fund. Will you provide us with a simple note for the three years to break down how the care fund is funded and managed? How does the money go in and out? I cannot figure it out and there seems to be a considerable decrease from one year to the other. That cannot explained by Covid because care has to happen regardless of Covid.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	544	Approximately €1 million of what was categorised under the care fund for 2020 was a direct subvention to racing greyhounds during the period in which they could not run.

I was looking up the Department's organisational structure and he is not on it. I was wondering how that was. He may wish to update it. Under what section of the Department does the greyhound industry fall? I cannot find it.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	548	The Deputy is right.

I want information on dates and attendees of every meeting between the Department and the organisation, as well as a copy of any Min-MAC minutes relating to welfare within the greyhound industry.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	552	Of course. I will make one brief point in relation to that, which is that care and welfare is a key part of all discussions we have with them. However, I will provide the Deputy with full details on that.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	553	We will find that out from the Min-MAC minutes. That is good. I have two more quick questions. There are four private tracks and the rest are publicly owned. Is that correct?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	554	Yes.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	555	In relation to private tracks and in respect of subsidies for private tracks versus the money that is sent into public tracks, can we get the breakdown of how much funding and how many employees, both full-time and part-time, there are across every track in Ireland? I ask this so that we can see that subsidies or moneys that are given to each track, whether it is public or private, as well as the number of employees. That information would be interesting. My last question is in relation to attendance. This is probably a question for the chairman or for the chief executive. The targeted attendance for race meetings is 630,000. Now that we have come out of Covid-19, do they think this will be achievable? Another question that I get asked a lot is that there seems to be a huge number of concessionary tickets when it comes to greyhound venues. The witnesses have produced figures regarding revenues and attendance records but if they deduct the concessions, what would they then be? Can they provide us with a table on that per year, if possible, particularly in relation to Shelbourne Park for the last three years?  My last question is probably to the chairman and is on the issue of greyhound racing and coursing. Are there any plans to try to draw a distinction between the two? That is my last question. I think it would be supportive of the greyhound racing fraternity and the ethos of that, as well as the issue of people attending races and community groups and families attending race groups and not being concerned about welfare. Has any work been done on that or is it in gestation?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	558	The two have diverged in separate ways along their own ways. Both industries are regulated but we have diverged. The strategic focus of Greyhound Racing Ireland has been in developing its own industry from a regulatory perspective. Many of the legacy issues, such as consent to exclusion orders and issues like that were contained in the 1958 Act and involved the direct input of the Irish Coursing Club in such regulatory matters, have been dispensed with and addressed in the Greyhound Racing Act 2019. Section 28 additionally provides for the traceability system, which was heretofore unheard of. All such matters had been previously managed by the Irish Coursing Club from a registration perspective. The 2019 Act gives us the statutory basis to do what the Deputy is talking about-----

We have already established that the traceability system covers racing greyhounds. Is that correct? Correct. We have also just established that the greyhound racing industry produces a large number of dogs that do not necessarily end up racing. Would it not be more appropriate to have a traceability system that covers all non-coursing greyhounds? I am short on time so quick answers would be helpful.

Would the definition of non-coursing greyhounds be more appropriate for the traceability scheme?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	567	I do know. There are all different sorts of classification of greyhounds, such as retired greyhounds and pet greyhounds. There are greyhounds in this country do that do not belong to coursing or track.

For clarity and for traceability and to do what it says on the tin in the spirit of traceability, would it not be more appropriate to define them as non-coursing greyhounds?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	571	I put it in the context that-----

I will put my answer in the context of the fact that we have a traceability system that is specifically designed for racing greyhounds. The Deputy may or may not be aware that the Irish Coursing Club is doing something similar for coursing greyhounds.
#NeasaHourigan	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-party	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-dob	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	576	Yes, for coursing greyhounds but my point is that both those industries produce dogs as a result of their activities that do not end up coursing or running in a race and this traceability system does not cover them.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	577	It covers the racing greyhounds.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	581	Yes.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	583	No, access is given by way of an ICC number, a trainer’s number and a password.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	589	Yes. I would like to refer to veterinary colleagues in relation to that because the traceability of animals and so on would be in the remit of that side and I can follow up on that.
#NeasaHourigan	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-party	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-dob	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	590	I would put it to the Department that it is a basic principle of a traceability scheme that we all know what is happening. If I cannot look up a dog and check what has happened to them, it is problematic. It is not truly transparent, and it is not something that we can rely on. I want to go back to the numbers that the chairman raised because we have established in earlier contributions that on average every year, 14,000 to 15,000 pups are born. Mr. Herbert told me earlier that 4,500 of those go to racing, 5,800 to go export and 2,000 are rehomed. That leaves 2,500 that are unaccounted for. 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	591	I think that I said that approximately 4,500 are actively entered into the racing pool.
#NeasaHourigan	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-party	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-dob	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	592	Yes, but that still leaves 2,500 that are unaccounted for. Is Mr. Herbert saying that are 2,500 that are retired and not rehomed?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	593	I put that in the context of it being a fluid model that changes on a month-to-month basis by greyhounds that come into the system, that are exported or that are retired. It changes and it is a fluid model.
#NeasaHourigan	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-party	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-dob	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	594	Is it not the case that those retired greyhounds are mostly in the rehomed number?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	595	Correct.

I know that earlier Mr. Herbert said that they fell over on the farm and I know that he thinks that I am a townie but come on.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	597	Respectfully, if the Deputy is going to quote me, I would rather that she would quote me correctly.

As much as I live in town, I do not think that that could account for 2,500 dogs.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	599	It is no different than with any with any other pet or dogs. There are naturally certain death rates with animals.

It is a simple question, therefore. Where are the 2,500 dogs?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	601	People breed and raise greyhounds in this country with the specific purpose of having winners on the track.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	607	In relation to retired dogs, there is a difference, because there are dogs that are in the active pool and there are dogs that race. It is a racing pool, so when a greyhound is entered for a race, it enters the racing pool, but when it races it comes off it. It does not stay in it until it is re-entered to the next race.

A couple of years ago it was 3,500. Mr. Fitzgerald now seems to be saying it is in the region of 6,000. That is a completely different number from the one he provided in the report.

The data set includes greyhounds that raced, trialled and were microchipped from 2021 on. Some 23,760 greyhounds were subject to traceability in 2021. Of those, 18,538 were active, in other words, raced or trialled, and 5,222 were inactive.

If that includes export and the figure is 5,000 dogs, we have already established that the export numbers are much higher than that. That does not add up. I am asking Mr. Herbert where the 2,500 dogs are.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	630	The traceability system does not cover greyhounds that were bred in previous years and did not race or trial on track in 2021 but were subsequently exported. That is important to say.

Does Rasaíocht Con Éireann not use the export numbers in its business case? Mr. Herbert has just said the export numbers are fundamental to the business model.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	632	We had to make a data set for traceability, and it includes greyhounds that raced or trialled from January 2021 and greyhounds that were microchipped from January 2021.

I said the initial figure for debt owing for Clonmel was €500,000. We have the capital debt, but then there was a figure of €277,000 that reduced to €212,000 in 2021. Does that have to be paid before the lease expires or before it is renewed?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	638	There is an ongoing debt repayment.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	640	There are a number of elements to the Clonmel debt. In order to create a solid repayment schedule, there is an agreement relating to a telecoms mast that is in the greyhound stadium. The income from the mast was originally going to the Davis Road Greyhound Stadium company. That was legally reassigned to RCÉ. The income from that is €18,000 per annum. Over a ten-year period, that was to take care of €180,000 of the debt. It was ring-fenced as part of an overall agreement.
#VeronaMurphy	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-party	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-dob	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	641	Every year, €18,000 will come off that until the debt is cleared.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	642	Absolutely. It is guaranteed.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	644	It was valid. It was legally entitled to do so under the lease.

Thank God for that. I want to come back to the issue of the CEO. There is no point in beating around the bush. The elephant in the room is that there have been a number of rolling CEOs and nobody lasts for very long. It is an industry that is just like Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, when it comes in here, in that the whole industry is based on integrity. The integrity of the industry is what allows the funding and the transparency but when we have CEOs who only last for six months, it does not bode well for the sector as a whole. What concerns me is that when Deputy Carthy asked Mr. Nyhan if an exit interview was done, the answer was "No". Mr. Nyhan is a professional man - I was in that profession for eight years - and nobody could credibly say they did not carry out an exit interview with a CEO who only lasted six months. Is there a reason he did not do an exit interview?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	646	No, I thought, and I still think, I had very good, positive relations with the outgoing CEO. I was on the committee that appointed her. I was chairman at the time. I thought we worked very well together. I was very disappointed when she left, but I must say she co-operated fully in the handover. She was present and assisted until Mr. Tuohey took over. There was no issue between us.
#VeronaMurphy	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-party	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-dob	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	647	I accept that, but what I am asking is why Mr. Nyhan did not think to ask her why she was leaving.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	648	She told me why she was leaving. It is because she got an opportunity she wanted to take up. I have to respect that.
#VeronaMurphy	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-party	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-dob	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	649	That was a kind of an exit interview, even if it was probably only a chat. Is the reality that she had no issue and that the job she was taking was paying more or the RCÉ was not her cup of tea?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	650	I do not know. All I know is that as far as I was concerned, we were working very well together and she was doing a good job.
#VeronaMurphy	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-party	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-dob	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	651	I know that, but Mr. Nyhan is the common denominator between the two. How is he going to know whether he will make the same mistake again when he does the next interview?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	652	I am not sure I can characterise it as a mistake.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	654	In fairness, the previous chief executive, Mr. Ger Dollard, was in the role for four years. It is not fair to characterise him as a six-month CEO.

It is a concern for me when people in the sector say that it is an issue. What they frequently say is that they need somebody with experience of the sector as the CEO.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	656	It is also a concern for me because I am a non-executive chairman and I would like to stay as a non-executive chairman. The vast sums of money the Minister pays me do not mean that I can be an executive chairman. I am as interested as everybody else in getting a person into this role. We have gone through two rounds of a very vigorous interview process and I am pretty confident that we will find ourselves with a very good CEO before the end of the year.
#VeronaMurphy	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-party	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-dob	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	657	My concern is we have one who lasts. My point is whether Mr. Nyhan takes on board that there should be someone with sectoral experience in the role. Before I became a politician, I came from a very difficult sector. It is a role that I can say here and now that nobody understands if they are not in the sector. I refer to road transport. One could not come in as a CEO with a business degree and just operate it. One must have an understanding of the sector. I am not saying that is the case; Mr. Nyhan's own patrons are saying it.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	658	It would be helpful for a new chief executive to have some knowledge of the industry. I would say to Deputy Murphy, however, that Ger Dollard, who did a very good job and I do not think anybody would characterise him as other than a good chief executive, had no experience of the industry before he joined. It really does depend on the character of the individual and their capacity to learn and get involved.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	666	The concept behind the scheme was that there was a grant of €2,500 available to kennel owners. There was a strong welfare basis behind it. When kennel owners applied, kennels were inspected. If no issues were encountered during the initial welfare inspection, they were given the green light to proceed with the works required. Again, there was an emphasis that the works to be undertaken had to have a strong welfare benefit. It could not just be for want-----

It appears there has been a significant drop-off since 2010. I would like to see the graph going the other way. It is an important sector. The turnover in 2010 was €33 million. Granted, the figures for 2020 and 2021 are not real figures because of Covid but if you look at 2019, turnover was down in the region of €22 million or €23 million. That is a significant drop off in turnover. I looked at the surplus each year. There was a spike in 2018 but that was due to the sale of Harold's Cross. There was a bump there that managed to stabilise Greyhound Racing Ireland's finances. Regarding the fall in turnover from €33 million in 2010 to €23 million in 2019, what explanation is there for that consistent fall-off in revenue? What happened in those nine years? 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	680	There was a decline in attendance during that period. That was evident. Obviously, it had an impact on revenue-generating ability. If we look at where we are now and the future, we need to focus on how we address that. We are at a point where we must start rebuilding the industry and attendances. We have taken steps with regard to that commercial sector.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	682	We have also started looking at other income-generating opportunities we have for stadia. There are a few existing ones. For example, we rent out the car park in Shelbourne Park and generate quite a significant income from it.

Is the Department concerned about that? Have there been discussions with the Minister around it, in view of the fact that funding for the sector is increasing?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	684	There was a clear fall in the numbers in the period outlined by the Chairman. That was probably reflective of the controversies linked to this. We all saw the "Prime Time Investigates" programme. It has been much more positive recently in terms of the interaction with the sector. Attendances are rising, greyhound racing is back on television and sponsors are getting involved again. This is probably reflective of Rasaíocht Con Éireann's efforts, including its animal welfare measures. The strategic plan we will get early next year from Rasaíocht Con Éireann will certainly advise us in terms of how proceed and how the sector-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	686	When we see the strategic plan, it will be linked into attendances and other measures. Our funding each year is set out and is linked to certain parameters we agree with the sector. It would not necessarily go into the detail of attendances and so on. It would be more high level than that.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	687	The issue of attendances is key. Will a target be set in that strategic plan?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	688	In response to Deputy Colm Burke earlier, I said that part of the plan would be to reduce our dependence on State funding. Obviously, a significant part of that has to involve increasing attendances. The Chairman asked about the period from 2009 onwards, which was probably the nadir in terms of attendances. A number of things happened. Public practices and habits changed. People stopped going out as much as they did previously and started watching greyhound racing and other sports on television and elsewhere and there was a change in public perception of dogs and their treatment. We were probably slow to react to public perception. In the past few years, we have changed our emphasis entirely and moved to an emphasis on the welfare of the dog, an emphasis that has always been there but has never been properly publicised. Once we have established that in the minds of the general public, we can start tackling the question of attendance but we had to do that first and I hope we have done that.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	689	Attendances in 2019, which is the last realistic year by which you can judge this, went down to 463,000. Rasaíocht Con Éireann aims to get that up to 630,000. The last time this figure was seen was in 2015. If we go back to 2008, over 1.1 million people attended race meetings. It is significant. We are looking at less than 40% of that figure. That is a shocking figure in terms of commercial activity and the promotion of the sector. Would Mr. Nyhan agree with that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	690	I agree with the Chairman. This is a big shortfall to be made up. I do not think we will ever get back to those attendance figures because public habits have changed. Our sister organisation Horse Racing Ireland has the same issue. I do not think people are going to go out as often so we are going to have to look at other revenue streams.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	691	I would like to ask about attendances at race meetings. In 2021, there were 1,384 race meetings. Would that be a typical year?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	692	2021 was an average year in terms of numbers. The Chairman mentioned 2015. To be helpful, the attendances at this year's Derby final and the Laurels final in Cork last week were back at 2015 levels.That is hopeful for the future.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	693	That is good. However, if we take the last year for which we can realistically assess the attendance it is 463,000 and there is an average of, say, 1,400 race meetings per year, that tells us the attendance at race meetings is in the region of perhaps 300 per meeting. Would that be correct, as an average?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	694	There is a difficulty with that in that some meetings are not really run for the public. Some of the races, like Sports Information Services, SIS-type races, are run early in the morning, on Sunday afternoon and other times like that which are not public-friendly. Therefore, it does not work out as a straight average.

I have another question Mr. Nyhan might answer for me. With other sports, attendance has shot up in 2022. I am told soccer is one and GAA is doing quite well, but greyhound racing attendance does not appear to have lifted.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	702	I do not think GAA did as well as other years in 2022. Certainly there were tickets available for the All-Ireland on the weekend of the match, which is very unusual.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	704	Horse racing figures are not back at previous levels. I saw yesterday that Tourism Ireland and Bord Fáilte were talking about the tourism rate being at around 75%. This year we are coming in at about 70% of the 2019 figure. That is probably okay. It will need to be better next year but it is okay for this year.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	714	The average attendance for this year, October year to date, is 223 per meeting.

I want to stay on the strategic plan, that is, the existing one, and seek updates about what was implemented. There was an aim in the plan to extend the racing life of dogs from I believe 48 months to 72 months. Where are we with that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	723	There were a number of races that were designed and for a period of time they were extended for older greyhounds to extend their racing life. Over a period, they were less and less subscribed. As such, they are no longer in run. My colleagues may confirm if that is accurate.
#NeasaHourigan	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-party	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-dob	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	724	Are we saying there is no longer an aim to extend the life of a racing dog to 72 months?

I was under the impression the reason it was in the strategic plan and we wanted to do it was A, it would cost the taxpayer less and it would require fewer dogs and B, it would improve animal welfare outcomes because there would be fewer collateral pups. Is that a fair categorisation of why we would extend to 72 months?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	729	That is reasonable, yes.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	764	It is quite significant.

It would seem in RCÉ's strategic plan there is a considerable revenue stream open to it but the organisation has not done any strategic work to complete it. Is that a fair observation?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	771	It is an observation.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	775	As I understand it, it has been the remit of the ICC since the 1920s, I think, and so I suspect-----

As I understand it the ICC goes across to Northern Ireland as well. Is that right? It has some jurisdiction in Northern Ireland.

I am therefore asking the Department what its guidance or interaction with RCÉ has been on the organisation setting up its own stud book? Has the Department identified the fact there is a conflict there if we leave it to coursing, which it seems we are? We are just accepting this considerable income stream is just going to be left to a different group.

I do not know about minutes. Was it a throw-away comment or was there serious strategic discussions about how it would be achieved?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	791	We are certainly aware that it is something that RCÉ desire. It was in its strategic plan. We are aware of that. I just cannot recall at the moment.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	793	I suspect there is no problem at all with that. I can read out the main part if the Deputy would like.
#NeasaHourigan	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-party	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-dob	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	794	No, if Mr. Conroy could just send it on to the committee, that would be very helpful. We just discussed Exchequer funding. We were told there was a desire to move away from Exchequer funding if possible and that the board would build its own income sources. Is it challenging to move away from Exchequer funding in the context of being locked into a fund where an entity receives money regardless of its own plans?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	795	It would be challenging at any time to walk away from funding in the region of €18 million.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	797	The plan is that over a period - and there is no point in saying otherwise because this will not be over five years but a longer period - that we would be independent of State funding.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	799	Probably not fully independent but more independent than we currently are.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	801	In the previous plan, yes.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	805	The previous strategic plan was during Covid and so on, so it was probably a very challenging period, that is, not only when it was developed but when it ran. We would need to see a new strategic plan and consider that in terms of future funding.

I refer to an Irish-born greyhound. Am I allowed to name it? Yes, I am because it is public knowledge.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	816	Yes, if it is in the public domain.
#NeasaHourigan	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-party	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-dob	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	817	Laughil Roxy broke her hock at a UK track. The UK trainer did not take the dog to the vet for immediate treatment despite instruction from the track vet. On instruction from the owner in Ireland, she was transported to Ireland against track vet advice. The Irish owner did not seek vet treatment for the dog for a week and then she was euthanised. Based on the traceability system now in place, was Laughil Roxy entered back onto the RCÉ traceability system on her return to Ireland?
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	818	I just want to clarify that the Deputy is quoting from a media report.
#NeasaHourigan	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-party	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-dob	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	819	Yes.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	820	That is okay.
#NeasaHourigan	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-party	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-dob	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	821	In the case of a dog that is injured on a UK track and renters the country, does that go on the RCÉ traceability system?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	822	To put it in context, a number of matters are being investigated around that greyhound. On traceability, once a greyhound is exported and the update is provided that the greyhound is exported to the UK, the greyhound will fall off the owner's account and there are no further requirements on traceability.
#NeasaHourigan	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-party	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-dob	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	823	Therefore it never comes back on the Irish traceability system. The dog is in this country. It is not now, because it has been euthanised.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	824	Okay but from a traceability and monitoring perspective, when greyhounds return and compete by way of race or trial at a GRI-licensed stadium, they are automatically reincorporated to the traceability system.
#NeasaHourigan	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-party	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-dob	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	825	Okay. The answer is "No". That dog that was euthanised on Irish soil by Irish trainers is not covered by our traceability system. Is that correct?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	826	By the fact that it had not raced or trialled, that is correct.
#NeasaHourigan	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-party	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-dob	unknown-#NeasaHourigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	827	It came home very badly injured and was euthanised here. Does the Department want to comment? Does it fulfil the spirit of the traceability system?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	828	I am unaware of the specifics of that.

To be honest the details of the particular dog do not make any difference and I believe that that case has been dealt with by UK authorities. However, the dog comes home to an Irish trainer - it is an Irish dog - and it is euthanised here because it is so badly injured but it is not covered by our traceability system. RCÉ has just confirmed that is correct. Is the Department happy with that level of traceability?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	830	I think the traceability system has come on a long way since its inception.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	832	Genuinely I would really like to have a look at this particular case before I would comment.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	845	Why would one produce a greyhound and sell it at a loss?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	847	RCÉ does not directly subsidise the breeding of greyhounds.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	848	Not directly. Okay.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	849	If somebody is in the business of breeding greyhounds and exporting them, one would expect that they are in that to make a profit.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	850	Indirectly though, could the €18 million or €19 million provide the sector with the means to do it.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	851	No, I do not see the logic in that at all.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	852	Okay. Obviously the authors of the report disagree with that. The report also outlined the need for an export levy or controls over exports to ensure that market prices prevail. Would RCÉ agree with an export levy?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	853	Market prices obviously prevail because the majority of sales to the UK and within Ireland are private sales. The sales conducted through RCÉ only relate to a small number of greyhounds. I can give the figure for our sales. I think it was 10% or 12%. The majority are private sales.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	854	That report said that any reduction in exports is an opportunity to expand the sale of racing content into the UK betting market. Does RCÉ agree with that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	855	I do not see the logic in that. I do not know how we could prevent the sale of greyhounds to the UK in the first place. Any individual has the right to sell their greyhounds.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	856	My concern is that the board commissioned the report but it has not agreed to any of its key findings. I often ask someone questions and the answers might not be what you want but of five answers there might be two or three that you agree with.Here one has a detailed report carried out and Mr. Tuohey, as the CEO, and Mr. Nyhan, as the cathaoirleach of the board, are telling me that they do not agree with any of the key findings of that report. Does Mr. Tuohey not find that odd?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	857	On the findings the Chairman has asked me about, I do not see that there is any logical basis to them.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	858	Does Mr. Nyhan find it unusual as the chairperson of the board? Boards will commission reports. They will look for papers on various different things. One might not agree with everything that comes back but in this case, fundamentally, they have agreed with every one of the key findings of that report.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	859	They actually all probably follow from one fundamental finding with which we disagree.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	860	Okay. I thank the witnesses for the information they supplied. We have had a good examination of the sector this morning. There is a lot done. We accept that there are improvements to traceability, etc. That is happening. That is good. There are figures for the past ten years. Other members and I quote data that show there would be issues for concern. Hopefully, it can be lifted. I hope it is accepted that the welfare issue is directly linked to the attendance and the credibility of the sector. We want to see improvements. I am sure the Department officials do as well. It is really important that that happens. That is the message going from here this morning that there have been improvements made and we want to see significant improvements. I look forward to the strategic plan, hopefully, that can point the way forward for the sector over the next eight or ten years. I thank the Rasaíocht Con Éireann representatives for attending and the officials from the Department for the work involved in preparing for the meeting. I also thank the staff from the Comptroller and Auditor General's office for attending today and assisting the committee. Is it agreed that the clerk to the committee will seek any follow-up information and carry out any agreed actions? Agreed. Is it also agreed that we note and publish the opening statements and the briefings provided for today's meeting? Agreed. The meeting will suspended until 1.30 p.m. when we will resume in public session to address correspondence and any other business of the committee.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	861	The business before us this afternoon is the minutes, accounts and financial statements, correspondence, the work programme and any other business. The first item is the minutes of our meeting of 27 October, which have been circulated to members. Do members wish to raise any matters in regard to the minutes? If not, are the minutes agreed? Agreed. As usual, they will be published on the committee’s web page. The next item is accounts and financial statements. Three sets of accounts and financial statements were laid before the Houses between 24 and 31 October 2022. I ask Mr. Harkness to address these before I open the floor to members.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	862	The first accounts relate to the National Concert Hall, which received a clear audit opinion for 2021. Attention is drawn in the audit report to the recognition of the deferred funding pension asset, which occurs in a number of bodies. The second is the Insurance Compensation Fund for 2021, which received a clear audit opinion. The third is the Social Insurance Fund for 2021, which, again, received a clear audit opinion. The Comptroller and Auditor General drew attention to a number of matters that were detailed in his recent annual report on public services. The first is the chapter on welfare payments and excessive entitlement. The second is the Department's process to recover social welfare payments from compensation awards. The third is an examination of the classification of workers for PRSI purposes and related matters. I understand those chapters will come before the committee in due course.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	863	With regard to the final point on the Social Insurance Fund, chapter 14 of the report on the accounts for public services for 2021 examined the classification of workers for PRSI and related matters, as Mr. Harkness outlined. What did his office find in that regard?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	864	I would have to check as I was not directly involved in that.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	865	I suggest we hold that back for approval at a further meeting in order to get clarification. It is fine if Mr. Harkness does not have that information today. Does Deputy Verona Murphy wish to come in?
#VeronaMurphy	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-party	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-dob	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	866	No, I am happy with that.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	867	Are the first and the second parts of the financial statements agreed? Agreed. As usual, those two will be published as part of the minutes. We will hold back the third one until next week. We now move to correspondence. As previously agreed, items that were not flagged for discussion for this meeting will continue to be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated to members. Decisions taken by the committee in relation to correspondence are recorded in the minutes of the committee’s meetings and published on the committee’s web page. The first category of correspondence under which members have flagged items for discussion is that from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up. We begin with No. 1532 from Kerstin Mey, president, University of Limerick, UL, dated 20 October 2022. This is information requested by the committee regarding non-compliant procurement. The committee has a standing agreement to request explanations for instances of significant non-compliant procurement which the Comptroller and Auditor General has drawn attention to, that is, procurement in excess of €500,000 in a given set of accounts that is not in compliance with procurement rules and guidelines. This response provides an explanation for, and steps taken to address, non-compliant procurement in UL, which amounted to €551,000 in its 2020-2021 financial statements. It is proposed to note and publish this item of correspondence. Is that agreed? I note Deputy Devlin is contributing remotely. Does he wish to raise anything on this point?

#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	869	Likewise, I confirm that I am in Leinster House as well.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	870	There is a table outlining the issues involved. There were several issues, including one in regard to website hosting. I asked why that was not previously tendered. UL said it is under review but I want to ask what the term “under review” means. In any given locality, there are a number of people who do website hosting. Another point concerned occupational health assessments, occupational therapy assessments and safety officers’ reports. UL is currently reviewing that and it is said that it will be progressed. Another issue concerned landscaping works to a value of €30,000, which was also to be progressed. I want to ask why it was not tendered up to date. We want an update on those three issues of website hosting, occupational therapy assessments and the turf and landscaping suppliers. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next category is correspondence from and related to private individuals and any other correspondence. First is No. 1549 from Deputy Hourigan, dated 27 October 2022. It is a proposal for the committee to consider reports of the HSE’s former CEO being approached by a consultancy firm. It has been reported that while approaches have been made, there are no commitments, although the consultancy firm is reported to have stated that there may be some advisory work next year. We could write to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to request information regarding what is termed a cooling-off period, which I think is two years. There was a lot of talk about this a few years ago.
#VeronaMurphy	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-party	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-dob	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	871	I am sorry but I asked the Chair yesterday whether we could look at contracts having exactly such a cooling-off period. That is not what they are called but it is the same thing. I do not know how it has not arisen in all of the reports that this might be undertaken. It does not make any sense to me that senior executives can apportion contracts and be involved in tender processes and then go to work for those who benefited from them. It is outrageous.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	872	What does the Deputy propose?
#VeronaMurphy	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-party	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-dob	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	873	It is effectively the same thing.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	874	The former chief executive of the HSE was here with the committee fairly recently, just a few weeks ago. Deputy Hourigan wrote to the committee to raise the engagement of the former chief executive of the HSE, Mr. Paul Reid, who stepped down last month, with the consultancy firm Ernst & Young in respect of advisory work.
#VeronaMurphy	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-party	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-dob	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	875	I am saying we should consider the appropriateness of the timing. It is outside consultancy rather than direct employment in this case. Even if it is not prohibited, it certainly should be for the future. We probably need to look at this. One way or the other, we need to write and find out if it is.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	876	We can seek clarification as to how long the cooling-off period is supposed to be and on the specific question the Deputy is asking, which is whether there is a differentiation between employment and contract consultancy.
#VeronaMurphy	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-party	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-dob	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	877	Correct.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	878	We will include that question and try to get a reply on it.
#VeronaMurphy	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-party	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-dob	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	879	One former senior official in the HSE is already in employment in EY. Is that not correct?

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	882	I am not aware of this but we will get clarification from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on those two matters. It is important that we do so. That other person might have been in a different body, perhaps a health-related body.
#VeronaMurphy	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-party	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-dob	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	883	I thought it was-----

#VeronaMurphy	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-party	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-dob	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	885	It does not really matter. The point is that we need to be aware if people from a given sector are involved with contracts or tendering with anybody in a Government Department.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	886	That it is particularly so when they move into an area related to their work here. That is fine. There is one other matter in respect of correspondence. It has not been flagged for consideration but I just want to mention a response we have received from St. James's Hospital, No. R1534B, dated 19 October. It concerns a request for an explanation of non-compliant procurement. The reply states that €395,000 is accounted for but non-compliant procurement noted in the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit certificate amounted to 14% of €207 million, amounting to the sum of approximately €29 million. The hospital has given us tables relating to €395,000. The problem is that what we are actually seeking clarification on procurement in the region of €29 million. Members will see on the table attached to the reply that a breakdown is given of six different items or services that were procured but, as I have said, this expenditure only comes to €395,000 whereas the actual figure we are seeking clarification on is the full 14% of non-pay expenditure, which is a figure in the region of €29 million. Does any member wish to address this? I propose that we write back to the hospital seeking an explanation for that because we got an explanation for €400,000 when the figure is €29 million. In fairness to the hospital, there may be legitimate reasons this expenditure cannot be tendered for. It may be a case of sole suppliers or specialised services that are only available from one provider. That may be the case but we need to know.

Are such companies outside the system because the UK has left the EU? While there may not be an issue for us, it might be more difficult. Does it make any difference?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	888	The same rules apply.

They would have to do the same thing. We will get the secretariat to write back to seek a full explanation of that. Is that agreed?
#VeronaMurphy	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-party	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-dob	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	890	Agreed.

That concludes our consideration of correspondence. Moving onto the work programme, there are five public hearings between now and Christmas. Next week, on 17 November, the Department of Finance is to come before us. On 24 November, we have the Regulator of the National Lottery. We have two public engagements on 1 December. In the morning we have an engagement with the Department of Social Protection and, in the afternoon session, we have the operator of the national lottery. There is a differentiation there. We will have the regulator in one week and the actual operator the following week. On 8 December, we have the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. The final meeting for this year is scheduled for 15 December and is with the Office of Public Works. We also agreed to meet with An Bord Pleanála in the first sitting in the new year, on 19 January. Are there any matters that members wish to raise regarding the work programme?
#VeronaMurphy	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-party	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-dob	unknown-#VeronaMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	892	No, I do not think so. We have been through it a few times now.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-10 00:00:00	Greyhound Racing Ireland: Financial Statements 2021	893	Next week's meeting with the Department of Finance is a big one. If there are specific areas on which members wish to raise matters - they may come to mind over the coming days - I suggest they notify the clerk, who will flag them with the Department of Finance and its Secretary General for when they come in. That concludes consideration of the work programme for today. The last item on the agenda is any other business. There are no matters under that heading. We will briefly go into private session before adjourning until 9.30 a.m. next Thursday, 17 November, when we will engage with the Department of Finance. Go raibh míle maith agaibh.
