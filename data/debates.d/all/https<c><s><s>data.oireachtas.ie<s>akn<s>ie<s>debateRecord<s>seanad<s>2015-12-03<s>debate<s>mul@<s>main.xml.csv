#CatherineNoone	unknown-#CatherineNoone-party	unknown-#CatherineNoone-dob	unknown-#CatherineNoone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-03 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	1	I will be brief. The debate I have asked for is on the need for the Minister for Defence to outline the policy now being implemented by his Department on security matters in the Middle East. I should have gone further and asked how it impacts on us in Ireland with regard to security. A number of people have raised this issue with me when I meet people in the community and on the doorsteps. Many feel we are somehow vulnerable in Ireland and in Europe generally, especially in the wake of the Paris attacks. People wonder what policy Ireland, and the Department of Defence, has in place to ensure our safety when it comes to the war in the Middle East, ISIS and everything that is going on there and how it might impact on Europe. I would be grateful for the Minister's comments.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-03 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	2	As Minister of State in the Department of Defence, I thank the Senator for raising the matter of the policy now being implemented by the Department in relation to security matters in the Middle East. The White Paper on Defence sets out Ireland's defence policy framework for the next decade. It is based on a forward-looking assessment of the security environment, reflecting the wider defence and security policy framework, the increasingly complex nature of security threats in the world today and the need for a full spectrum comprehensive response. A feature of Ireland's policy response to these security challenges is continued strong support for the multilateral system of collective security represented by the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security. Ireland's approach to international security is characterised, inter alia, by our willingness to participate in peace support operations throughout the world and by our commitment to achieving collective security through the United Nations, in particular. As of 1 December, 492 Defence Forces personnel are serving overseas, of whom 359 are serving in the Middle East. Of the 359 personnel serving in the Middle East, 198 are serving in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, 149 are serving in the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, and 12 are serving in the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation, UNTSO. The 51st Infantry Group deployed last month to the UNIFIL mission in Lebanon. The Irish contingent, comprising 198 personnel, is based primarily in Camp 2-45 as part of a joint battalion with Finland. The joint Finnish-Irish battalion is tasked primarily with patrolling, reconnaissance and occupying two static posts on the "blue line" separating Israel and Lebanon while operating in close co-ordination and co-operation with the Lebanese armed forces in sector west of UNIFIL's area of operations. The battalion implements force protection measures appropriate to operational and security developments in the region. The battalion has a wide range of capabilities, affording excellent operational effectiveness while also providing extensive force protection capacity. I am advised by the Defence Forces that commanders in the mission, at all levels, liaise with the host nation, the Lebanese armed forces and local stakeholders to ensure all aspects of the mission, including freedom of movement, are achievable. Ireland will take command of the joint contingent in November next year and will deploy approximately an additional 160 personnel with the contingent. The security situation in Lebanon will continue to be kept under review by the Defence Forces and departmental officials. The 50th Infantry Group, comprising 141 Irish personnel and serving with UNDOF is based in Camp Ziouani in the Golan Heights. The contingent comprises a force reserve company and support elements. Their role includes the provision of a quick reaction force, which is on standby to assist with ongoing operations within the UNDOF area of responsibility. The Irish infantry group is also tasked with carrying out patrols and convoy escorts as necessary. In addition, eight Defence Forces personnel are also based in UNDOF headquarters in Camp Ziouani, including the deputy force commander, Brigadier General Anthony Hanlon. The current Irish contingent which deployed to UNDOF in September 2015 undertakes regular drills and exercises to ensure all personnel are aware of the force protection actions to be carried out in the event of a deterioration of the security situation. The UNDOF mission has faced a challenging time, especially during the past year or so. The escalation of the conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic has affected the mission's area of operations. While the security situation in the UNDOF area of responsibility remains volatile and unpredictable, with ongoing fighting between different elements, I am advised that UNDOF has not detected any significant increase in violence or attacks on UN personnel or facilities. Following the significant events in August 2014 in the area of separation, there was a fundamental realignment of the UNDOF mission with a view to minimising unacceptable risks to peacekeepers, while continuing to implement the mission's mandate. Most UNDOF personnel are now deployed on the Israeli side of the area of separation. A number of enhancement measures were undertaken at Camp Ziouani since the relocation of the Irish contingent in September 2014. Ongoing threat assessments are carried out in the mission area and personal equipment and force assets are continually reviewed to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are appropriately equipped to fulfil their role. In this regard, following a recent review of the locations in the UNDOF mission area occupied by personnel of the Irish contingent, a Defence Forces engineering team was deployed in early September to undertake additional protective works. I am satisfied that all appropriate security measures are in place to ensure the safety of all Defence Forces personnel serving in the UNDOF mission. The decision by the Government to send troops overseas is never taken lightly. The safety of all Defence Forces personnel serving on all overseas missions is always a concern to the Government and to the military authorities. Troops selected for overseas service undergo a rigorous programme of mission-specific training. Such training which is updated on an ongoing basis in the light of increased threat has been designed to allow Defence Forces personnel to carry out their tasks and to provide for their protection. The presence of the UNIFIL, UNDOF and UNTSO missions remains an important element in ensuring stability in the Middle East region. Ireland remains committed to supporting UN missions in the Middle East in support of international peace and security.

It is very comprehensive. I may need to bring another question another day in regard to steps being taken to make people aware of the security measures we are taking in Ireland in the wake of recent happenings in Europe.
#JamesHeffernan	unknown-#JamesHeffernan-party	unknown-#JamesHeffernan-dob	unknown-#JamesHeffernan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-03 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	4	I welcome the Minister of State. I congratulate him and Oulart-The Ballagh on the terrific win at the weekend. It has been a long time coming for the club and well done to them. I would also spare a thought for Clough-Ballacolla. They threw it away against Oulart-The Ballagh a few weeks ago and it would have been great for Laois hurling if they had succeeded, but I wish the best of luck to the club continuing in the all-Ireland series. The reason I have asked the Minister of State to come to the Seanad relates to the very tragic and quite frightening case of two missing persons. One is Anastasija Varslavane, a Latvian national, who lost her mother here in Ireland at the age of 17 years and is left without anyone belonging to her. She has distant relatives and a grandmother in Latvia, but no one here in Ireland. At 21 years of age, Anastasija has disappeared, with her partner, William Maughan. William is from a very well respected family in the Killinarden estate. His father, Joe, is a very prominent member of the community there, who has given his heart, soul and life to the community in Killinarden through his involvement with the Sacred Heart soccer club. William who was about the same age as me and his young, beautiful and three months pregnant girlfriend went missing in April this year. They are missing, presumed dead. William and Anastasija are known to have fallen into company with a very dangerous and violent gangland figure who offered a large sum of money to William to carry out an assassination on behalf of the gang. William refused to comply and he and Anastasija are now missing and presumed dead. If this case happened anywhere else, there would be uproar. If it happened to an Irish citizen in a foreign country, we would all know about it. We saw in the cases of the murders of Karen Buckley in Glasgow and Jill Meagher in Australia how there was uproar among the relevant Irish diasporas and involvement by the Irish authorities, including An Garda Síochána. When it comes to taking on gangland persons in this State who have links with international crime and are involved in drugs, trafficking, theft of vehicles and murder, everything should be done to bring their activities to an end. Will the Minister of State indicate whether it would be possible or appropriate to invite the Latvian authorities to come to Ireland and be briefed on the case by gardaí in Ashbourne who are doing their absolute best to get justice for these two families? I ask that consideration be given to the issuing of such an invitation through the offices of the Department of Justice and Equality.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-03 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	5	I thank the Senator for his congratulations on the victory of Oulart-The Ballagh. Although it is not my local club, I have a personal interest in its fortunes because my nephew, Barry Kehoe, is the captain. I hope he and his team mates are victorious against Na Piarsaigh in February and go on to bring an all-Ireland title back to Wexford. On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality who is in Brussels this morning, I thank the Senator for raising this matter. The Garda authorities have informed the Minister that the ongoing investigation into the disappearance of Anastasija, or Anna, Varslavane remains entirely focused within this jurisdiction. Should the need arise to engage with the Latvian law enforcement authorities in respect of the investigation, that will be advanced through Europol channels. Under mutual legal assistance provisions, a judicial authority in one state may seek the assistance of the authorities in another state in obtaining evidence required in the course of a criminal investigation of criminal proceedings. The Minister is informed by the Garda authorities that the missing persons bureau has been conducting a full review of its existing policies with a view to ensuring the force's policies and procedures are in line with international best practice and that missing person incidents are afforded the best possible policing response. The review is ongoing and includes a consultation process with partner agencies concerned with missing persons. The third national Missing Persons Day was hosted by the Minister yesterday, 2 December 2015, at Farmleigh in Dublin. The inaugural day was held on 4 December 2013 and has since been developed into an annual campaign with a number of objectives. It commemorates those who have gone missing and recognises the ongoing suffering of their families and friends. It also serves to raise public awareness of open or unsolved missing persons cases and provides a platform to highlight the support services available to people who have lost a loved one. Last month, the Minister announced the commencement of DNA legislation allowing for the launch of a new state-of-the-art DNA database system. The database became operational on 20 November and is based in Forensic Science Ireland in the Phoenix Park. The new database will assist An Garda Síochána in finding and identifying missing or unknown people. A missing and unknown persons index will hold the DNA profiles developed from biological samples relating to missing persons, which come, for example, from their clothing. It will also hold profiles from their close blood relatives, with the consent of those relatives, who will have similar DNA. The DNA legislation also provides for the exchange of DNA profiles of missing or unknown persons with law enforcement authorities in other jurisdictions. The database will, therefore, facilitate searches for missing or unknown persons abroad as well as in Ireland. The Senator asked about the possibility of representatives of the Latvian authorities being invited to Ireland to speak with gardaí about the ongoing investigation into this case. I will convey that request directly to the Minister who will, in turn, pass it on to the Garda Commissioner. If any member of the public has information on the case, I encourage him or her to bring it to the Garda. It is very sad for any family to have a loved one missing.

I realise the Garda authorities are doing everything in their power to get to the bottom of this. Ambassador Apals is quite pleased with their work on the case. However, the fact remains there are ruthless, violent and callous killers on the loose. The Maughans attended the Missing Persons Day event yesterday to which the Minister of State referred. I have met Joe and Nell and their lives are absolutely torn apart by this. This is the second child they have lost, one of William's siblings having died from meningitis. There have been ongoing efforts to harass and intimidate members of the Maughan family for raising the case. In fact, William's sister was forced out of her home by this criminal gang. Such activity is truly frightening and must not be tolerated in our society. I welcome the introduction of the DNA database, which may help in solving this case. I join the Minister of State in appealing to anybody who has information to come forward. There are people who know what happened to William and Anastasija. I urge them to be brave and convey that information to the Garda. It could allow Joe and Nell to give their child a decent Christian burial. William's parents feel he and Anastasia are dead and their bodies have been disappeared. That adds to their trauma. Anybody who has information that will help in locating their bodies should come forward and help to ensure the Maughans are able to bury their son.

When the Government came into power we were told there would be a new way of doing politics, a new Government, new procedures and a new legislative scrutiny. What we have this week is what we have had for the last number of years - a ramrodding through of legislation in the last few weeks before the recess. It is the same in the summer. Senator Paul Coghlan is shaking is head.

There is no time for scrutiny. What we saw in this House yesterday with regard to the Legal Services Bill, which was reported by The Irish Times, was a shambles. That was an understatement. The legislative programme and all the promises made by Fine Gael are now in chaos, including the universal health system promised by Fine Gael. The five-point plan has been reduced to a four-point plan and we will be very lucky if there are three points left in it before 2015 is out. I ask for a debate on immigration reform in the United States and the 50,000 undocumented Irish people there who, similarly to last year, are unable to return home to family and friends this Christmas. It is estimated that about 500,000 people in Ireland are affected by the situation faced by the undocumented Irish people in the United States. For every person in the United States who is unable to come back there are ten family members affected - brothers, sisters, mothers and fathers whose loved ones cannot come back because their legal status in the United States is in the process of being remedied. The US President, Barack Obama, has issued an executive order. I asked that the Government intervene to ask for a humanitarian visa clause in the executive order in order that in situations of bereavement or family illness those who are undocumented can return home to see their families and loved ones. Unfortunately, the Government took no action. I ask for the debate because there are issues regarding visa waivers whereby those who have overstayed their visas can seek a waiver to obtain legal status within the United States, but the Government has not informed them. The sad reality is that this Christmas, again, 50,000 people will not be able to return home. We need more action. I will conclude by referring to the Government inaction which was crystallised in an event on Capitol Hill at the Speaker's lunch on St. Patrick's day two years ago. A press release given to the Irish press corps stated that the Taoiseach was going to address the issue and his speech was distributed. It contained two paragraphs on the undocumented Irish in the United States, asking the legislators there to do something about it. There were no press allowed at the Speaker's lunch, but the Irish Government was unaware that when the US President attends an event every word is transcribed by a stenographer. In the Taoiseach's address to the legislators on Capitol Hill there was not one mention of the undocumented Irish. I am sure all the Congressmen and Senators walked away from that meeting saying, "I hear a lot about the undocumented Irish in the United States, so why did their Prime Minister not mention it here in front of us?". When one has the opportunity in the United States one should seize it. That is the level of concern the Government has for the undocumented Irish people in the United States. When it has the opportunity, it does not seize it. I ask for a debate on the undocumented and why, once again this year, they are unable to come home.

I know that he has worked on this issue for a long time and I absolutely agree that it is a pressing matter for many families. There are two related topics that this House may have a chance to debate in the new year. The first concerns stateless persons. I raised this last night in the debate on the International Protection Bill and it will be raised again on Committee Stage of that Bill today. We need to make provision in the State for those who are stateless here and whose legal position is precarious. The second related topic, which does not come up in discussions of international protection but is very much related to the subject of the undocumented Irish, is votes for emigrants - those Irish citizens resident outside this jurisdiction. Colleagues who were involved in the Constitutional Convention will recall the very moving session during which we heard from Irish emigrants all over the world via video link. They spoke about how much it would mean to them to be given the right to vote. The proposal to allow them the right to vote in presidential elections would have had no difficult logistical implications in terms of determining geographical constituencies and so on. I would like the House to have a debate on that issue in the new year and to look at the recommendation of the Constitutional Convention. I have spoken about the problem of the amount of legislation being pressed through the House, as has the Leader, and both of us regret that we are again, as in previous Decembers, facing a large amount of legislation being pushed through very late in the day. While we have been looking for legislation earlier in the year, we always end up coming up against a deadline at this time. This year it is particularly evident in the Department of Justice and Equality. I have looked at the Bills to be debated next week in this House. The Courts Bill 2015 and the Prisons Bill 2015 are hugely important Bills which I believe will receive a broad welcome from all colleagues. The aim of the Courts Bill 2015 is simply to increase the number of judges and, in particular, to reduce the waiting time for Central Criminal Court trials. Colleagues may know that the President of the High Court has recently appointed a fifth judge to the Central Criminal Court because there is an 18-month delay. This is appalling for people who are victims of crime and for all of those involved in prosecuting and investigating crime. It is simply untenable. It is welcome that the mechanism will be put on a statutory basis and the number of judges increased - by just two, I understand - to tackle these dreadful waiting times. That Bill will be uncontentious and is clearly urgent, and I welcome it. The Prisons Bill 2015 is also a short Bill which will receive a broad welcome from colleagues. It is to facilitate the complete closure of St. Patrick's Institution. One of the real achievements on penal reform by the Government has been the phasing out of the awful practice of sending children to St. Patrick's Institution. To see a Bill which will facilitate the complete closure of that institution will be hugely welcome to all of us who have worked on criminal justice, penal reform or children's rights. The Bills are important and I absolutely believe that this House needs to see them though as soon as possible. With regard to the International Protection Bill 2015, we did commence the debate last night and will continue it today. It is long-overdue legislation promised by previous Governments which could not deliver. At last we will see a single unified procedure for the protection of those in direct provision, which will tackle the serious problem of long delays. My colleagues and have met people who have been in direct provision for long periods, some for ten years or more. It is untenable and needs to be tackled. There is an urgency about these Bills and, despite the unfortunate fact that Senators are again facing a large number of Bills so late in the day, it is important that the House see these through.

I agree with the Senators who have spoken already, including Government Senators, who are concerned about the amount of legislation being brought before the House before the Christmas recess. The Leader spoke about this last week and expressed his frustration, but that does not solve the problem. There are three Bills to be guillotined next week.

It states Second Stage of the Prisons Bill 2015 will commence at 1 p.m. and conclude at 2.30 p.m. Not all spokespersons will get a chance to speak, and not everybody who wants to contribute will be able to. Perhaps the debates will not be guillotined on Committee and Report Stages, but we do not know. There are two weeks remaining before the Christmas recess is upon us; therefore, at some point it will have to conclude, or is the Leader going to say these Bills can roll over until the new year? Perhaps the Leader would respond to this. It is a clear concern that they could potentially be guillotined. Speaking time is being narrowed: allowing only one and a half hours for Second Stage is not really how the House has done its business up to now. The same goes for the Courts Bill 2015, for which 90 minutes are allowed, which means that not all Senators may get a chance to contribute. There is a guillotine planned for the International Protection Bill, the debate on which must conclude by 7 p.m. with a final question.The Government promised us a new way of doing politics and a democratic revolution. It promised us that debates on Bills would not be guillotined, but it has guillotined debates on more legislation than the previous Government. It is the same story every year as we move towards Christmas. There is a rush of Bills coming through, but we sit here in September and October looking for legislation and cannot get it. It always seems to be from the Department of Justice and Equality; therefore, they could do with getting their house in order. We will strongly oppose No. 1 and will not co-operate with the Government next week if it seeks to guillotine debate on any of these Bills.

Following media reports concerning the jailing of a borrower at the behest of a vulture fund earlier this year, I secured the agreement of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform to invite representatives from some of the vulture funds operating in Ireland to appear before it. There was a unanimous decision of the committee to invite them to appear and a meeting was scheduled for Tuesday next, 9 December. However, I have been informed that all of them have refused to attend. As Members of the Oireachtas, we have a duty to represent the general public and many people with personal home loans and business loans have found that their banks have sold off their mortgages to these debt investors. We have heard from the banks on how they treat people in mortgage arrears, but we have not heard from the debt investors and there are real concerns that people are not being treated fairly, with strong indications that some of these entities have been behaving disgracefully by jailing people whose loans they have bought and breaching the terms of personal insolvency agreements by putting pressure on customers who had reached a deal. There are real concerns at the extent of the discounts at which some loans were acquired and questions as to whether borrowers were getting a fair deal or were being screwed by these companies. These vulture funds are unaccountable and, unfortunately, largely unregulated in Ireland. They are in line to make considerable profits from the loans they acquired from Irish banks. That is fine but they cannot gouge huge profits on the backs of distressed borrowers. As they have apparently declined a reasonable invitation of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform to appear before us we need to ensure they do not give this Parliament the slip, hoping they can spin us along until the election. I am sure there would be widespread support in this House for measures to make these vulture funds accountable and responsible. We can look at compelling them to attend and should probably widen the review to other funds operating in the market in Ireland. I will speak to my colleagues on the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, but I hope I have the support of this House in seeking to hold these entities to greater account.

I hope action is taken by his colleagues in government because what he said is true. I was very impressed by the leader of the British Labour Party, Mr. Jeremy Corbyn, who has been very consistent in his views on war and the question of taking action to bomb Syria. He voted against the war in Iraq when Mr. Tony Blair decided, with President Bush, to bomb Baghdad, which is the kernel of all the problems in Iraq, Syria, Libya and elsewhere. He took a courageous stand, which is very consistent with his views that he has expressed all of his political life as a man of peace. Ultimately, his action will be vindicated. I believe he will continue to lead the Labour Party. Other leaders would change and go along with the general consensus in the House of Commons but he stood alone and he led the majority of his own party to vote against it. The bombing of parts of Syria to destroy ISIS, or Islamic State, will be futile because on the ground it is very strong. The oil from the fields it has taken over is being sold to the west through Turkey or Saudi Arabia and President Putin has accused the Turkish Government of buying it. Somebody is buying the oil and surely the CIA and others know where it is going and from where ISIS gets its funding. They are funding terrorism throughout the country in response to the bombing of ISIS and, in time, an Islamic state will probably be formed and the first people to do business with them will be the United Kingdom Government and other governments. With the RAF extending its bombing campaign to Syria, there will be collateral damage with the death of women, children and people who are not involved. There will be chaos. I wish Jeremy Corbyn well and I believe he will be vindicated in the not-too-distant future

During a recent visit to the hospital the leader of Fianna Fáil shed a lot of crocodile tears about the state of the place but he neglected to explain why, during the boom, no investment was put into the facility. I call on the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, to ensure that a new facility is included under the HSE capital plan, which I expect to be published early in the new year. It is unfair to patients using the facility and to staff, the nurses and doctors, who are attempting to give safe care to people accessing the emergency department at UHG. The time for talking is over and we need to see action soon.

I hope, therefore, that the management of the hospital will do everything possible - structurally and in the context of the existing facilities there - to alleviate some of the pressure in the emergency department. I welcome the Exchequer returns which, for the first time since 2007, show a surplus - some €343 million - at the end of November. Tax receipts are 11.9% higher than the same month last year and this is an indication that the economy is coming back on track. There is now more spending in the economy and, hopefully, from now on our income and expenditure will balance and we will cease borrowing for day-to-day expenditure.

I have just been at the human dignity award ceremony where the Ceann Comhairle presented an award to Barney Curley. I did not know the story of Barney Curley but the amount of work he does in Zambia, for which he is totally unpaid, is just wonderful. It is great that we in this House can recognise such actions because it is important to do so. It is also important that the State as a whole does so and next week I will bring forward a Bill suggesting a Gradam an Uachtaráin, an official award from the President to people of standing who have done work such as this. Barney Curley is exactly the sort of man who would deserve that award. I will take up another point to which my attention was drawn, that is, the question of private inquests in the case of suicide. Under the Coroners Act 1962, there is a legal requirement for an inquest to take place where the death has been violent, sudden or unnatural. In September, Mr. Paul Kelly of Console delivered an address on the impact of inquests on the family of a person who dies by suicide. He suggests we should be able to find a solution in order that, when it is clear that the death came from suicide, the family could agree to have the inquest in private. His suggestion is worthy of consideration. It is something we should be providing for. Mr. Kelly's suggestion is, at the behest of the next of kin, to allow for inquests for suicide to be conducted in the normal way but in camera, thereby relieving the significant amount of attention that families must go through whenever such a thing happens. It is worth considering this. I suggest the Leader find a way in the new year to do something about that.

I concur with the comments of Senator Mark Daly and agree with his call for a debate on the undocumented in the United States and the other issues he raised. These are important issues and we cannot let them fall by the wayside. It is particularly poignant coming up to Christmas that many of these Irish citizens in the United States will not be able to come home to enjoy Christmas in the way others are able to. I am gobsmacked by some of the comments made by Senator Michael Mullins this morning about University Hospital Galway, UHG. We have been banging this drum for at least five years since I came into the Seanad. That we now have a road to Damascus-type turnaround from the Taoiseach and he realises that there is an issue in UHG is astounding, but the time for talking is long over. We certainly need action - we need not only bricks and mortar, but staff in the hospitals and reorganisation of the system in order that the emergency department in Galway is not under as much pressure as it is currently. We could go on and have a full debate on that particular emergency department. I would welcome a debate on the emergency department in Galway hospital, if that is at all possible. I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to the effect that we do not take No. 1 on the Order Paper today. I am not 100% clear whether it is being proposed. It is quite obvious, since Senator Michael Mullins was saying he had been talking about UHG, that the Taoiseach was not listening. I am afraid that the Government is not listening to the Leader when it comes to justice Bills. We should check the bill for Red Bull in the Department of Justice and Equality this week because they seem to have been up all night writing legislation, amendments and so on. It is ridiculous what has been happening this week with the Legal Services Bill with regard to the number of amendments that came through and how late that legislation came to us. I am concerned that we will make mistakes in the legislation that is being passed. I have similar concerns about the International Protection Bill, which we are seeing rushed through the Houses. I oppose the imposition of a guillotine on the debate on that Bill on Monday. It is a discredit to those who are seeking asylum in this country and those who claim to care about human rights. We must back the Leader on this one. I believe the Government is saying to him that he must put this motion to the House and he needs our support to oppose that motion. We will not have a battle on our hands in that regard, because I believe the Leader is as frustrated with the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Department as we are. It is unacceptable that two new Bills are being brought before us on Monday when we have not even seen them properly. It is not the way to legislate and rushed legislation will be bad legislation. Let us stand up for the Seanad. Let us stand up for our democratic rights. We have a mandate. It is not right for business to be rushed in this way. We need to put a stop to it. Perhaps it is merely the fact that the ink is drying on the election posters in Fine Gael headquarters. Perhaps that is the reason this is being rushed through at the end of the year. Certainly, it is a disservice to the people who will be affected by this legislation if it is rushed through in the manner proposed.

It is not on. It is time this Chamber stood up for itself. I would gladly support that amendment. I was interested to hear Senator Ivana Bacik, who has a sincere interest in the area of direct provision, state that the system of direct provision, as it stands, is untenable. That is why we should not take the International Protection Bill at all.

It is a frightening development. In the words of Edwin Starr's famous single, "War, what is it good for? Absolutely nothing." I would very much agree. This is an issue that I have raised here and that we should be concerned about in this country. It is one that came up, interestingly enough, this morning by way of a Commencement motion proposed by a member of Fine Gael, in response to which the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Kehoe, outlined a position, although, to be quite honest, I was not too sure what it was. Our neutrality is being called into question again. I for one do not want to see Irish troops or the Irish armed forces involved in any aggressive military campaign headed up by the United Kingdom, the United States, NATO or any of these alliances. Our traditional neutrality, which people voted to protect when they voted against the Treaties of Lisbon and Nice when they thought there was a threat to it, should be protected and given a sovereign status. Following on from that, it is high time - I called for it last week or the week before - we had a debate about Ireland's neutrality, particularly the use of Shannon Airport by the US military, the Russian military and any other military. It should not happen, and there should be a phased reduction and eventual withdrawal of that service to give aid to foreign militaries. Given the recent developments, especially from the United Kingdom, that involve the bombing of Syria, which will continue to exacerbate the refugee crisis and our problems with the direct provision services, I would hope that we have no hand, act or part in such military intervention tactics. That debate on neutrality should happen soon.

The International Protection Bill 2015 is important legislation and it should be given time to go through this House in an orderly manner. I appreciate, as Senator David Cullinane stated, that the Leader is being put under pressure in this regard, but the guillotine should not be used unless it is necessary to do so. It is not necessary to do so in this case. We still have two weeks remaining here and, if necessary, part of the following week. There is plenty of time and the guillotine should not be used. I ask the Leader that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, come to the House. The Minister has been here to discuss other legislation. I make this request while defending the fact that debates on legislation should not be guillotined, but we have an urgent need to debate rural crime. It is something that has been raised on all sides of the House in the past few weeks and months.It has reached a crisis. Recently, a public meeting was held in Swanlinbar in west Cavan. The situation regarding rural crime has deteriorated to such an extent that locals have taken matters into their own hands and formed the local area protection group with the aim of assisting the Garda in trying to stamp out rural crime and, in this case, cross-Border crime. A number of weeks ago, Senator Terry "the Scobe" Brennan lauded the decision made by the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Garda Commissioner to put additional gardaí in County Louth. Such deployment is welcome but the gardaí were taken from one region and put into another high-profile Border area.

That is what has happened. Rural crime is at crisis in this area of County Cavan and the matter needs to be addressed. I welcome the formation of the local protection group but unfortunately its members are not properly trained and they also do not have the law behind them if something goes wrong. That community should not have had to set up a group. Will the Leader arrange, as a matter of urgency and before the Christmas recess, a debate on rural crime with the Minister for Justice and Equality? I support what Senator Feargal Quinn has said about Barney Curley who is the second person this year to receive an award from the Human Dignity Group. I reassure the Senator that my party will support his Bill to create an honours system.

As the Deputy Leader mentioned, we must deal with the Courts Bill and the Prisons Bill. I do not think there is any chance the debates on such legislation will be guillotined and I think both Bills will be well received by the House. As the Deputy Leader said, there are some matters dealt with in them that need attention and the Government is attending to them. It is unfortunate that they have reached the House so late in the legislative cycle of the Government and I regret having to guillotine the debate on the International Protection Bill on Monday. I cannot understand how the Department of Justice and Equality could publish a Bill only last week, yet produce 80 or 90 amendments this week.

I question why the Bill was published in the first place when so many amendments have been produced. In saying this, we will debate the Bill for two hours today on Committee Stage and will have a further three hours of debate on Monday which should be more than sufficient time to deal with the amendments tabled. Many of the Government's amendments are technical.

Senator Mark Daly mentioned the undocumented Irish in the United States, a matter to which several Senators alluded. The action must be taken by the US Government to change its laws to provide visas for the undocumented Irish. I can assure the Senator that, irrespective of what speech from which he quoted, the Government, including the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora, has made strong representations to representatives in the United States to have the laws changed and deal with the question of the undocumented Irish. In many instances, the response has not been very positive from both sides of the Houses of Congress when it comes to voting and bringing forward proper legislation. There is, therefore, still an amount of work to be done. The Government will continue to address the matter and lobby as much as possible, but at the end of the day it is a question for the US Administration and legislators in the United States to legislate. We cannot dictate what other countries should do, but we can suggest what they should do. We do not have the power to tell them what to do. We will continue to lobby as much as possible to find a solution to the problem. Senator Ivana Bacik raised the issue of votes for Irish citizens living abroad. I am sure the matter will be addressed in future legislation. We will debate it, possibly in the next term of the Government, if we are returned to power, but nobody knows what the outcome will be.

I believe their provisions will be generally acceptable to everybody. Senator Paul Coghlan mentioned so-called debt investors or vulture funds. It is regrettable that they have refused to come before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform. I am sure the Senator will make his points to the Minister for Finance when we debate the Finance Bill later today. Senator Terry Leyden sided with the Labour Party leader in the United Kingdom on the stance he had adopted on the issue of bombing Syria, a move also supported by Senator James Heffernan. In between the votes last evening I turned on my television set and heard the speech made by Mr. Hilary Benn, the shadow Foreign Secretary. He made one of the finest speeches I had ever heard and for which he was applauded in the House of Commons, which was most unusual.

I note the points made by Senator Feargal Quinn about inquests. He has called for inquests to be held in private in the case of deaths by suicide. I concur with him and ask the Department of Justice and Equality to consider doing so. It is something positive that it could address. I hope these points can be made when we debate some of the Bills and perhaps when we debate the Courts Bill on Monday. I have addressed Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh's point about No. 1.  Senator James Heffernan mentioned the International Protection Bill. Irish troops cannot get involved in aggressive tactics abroad. There is a triple-lock system under which a vote in both Houses is required before the Defence Forces can become involved in any action. There is no question of Irish troops being involved in an aggressive action on the side of any country. Irish troops are lauded for their peacekeeping efforts throughout the world and recognised as one of the best peacekeeping forces and always will be.

The end-November Exchequer returns show very robust tax figures, reflective of the continued recovery in the real economy. While corporation tax is the stand-out performer against profile, the year-on-year increase in taxes is broad-based. For example, VAT receipts are up 9% and income tax receipts are up 5%. As a result of these stronger than expected revenues, our deficit forecast for this year is below 2% of GDP and we are well on our way to a balanced budget earlier than originally forecast. Ireland's debt, which peaked at 120% of GDP in 2012, is forecast to be below 100% of GDP by the end of this year. While all of these metrics are going in the right direction, the Government is not complacent. Far from it. Budget 2016 which delivered a tangible return to the public through reduced taxes and focused increases in expenditure was framed to comply with our fiscal rules which are designed to prevent a return to the boom-bust policies of the past. The economy is growing strongly and we have made significant progress, but the job of recovery is not yet complete. There is work to do and the Government and the country will continue to do it.The Finance Bill 2015 as passed by the Dáil contains 90 sections and is 124 pages long. I turn to those sections now, although Senators will understand that time does not permit me to cover everything. Part 1 of the Bill deals with the universal social charge, income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax. Sections 2 and 3 provide for income tax and USC changes. From 1 January 2016, the entry threshold for USC will be increased from €12,012 to €13,000, thereby removing more than 40,000 workers from the scope of the charge entirely. It is estimated that more than 700,000 income earners will not be liable to USC at all from next year. It should be noted that this statistic includes individuals with incomes in excess of €13,000, as not all income is within the scope of USC. For example, social welfare payments are not liable to the charge. The Bill also provides for reductions in the three lowest rates of USC. The amount of income liable at the second USC rate is also being extended to ensure a full-time worker on the newly increased minimum wage does not become liable for the third rate of USC, which is itself being reduced to 5.5%. In addition, section 2 provides for an exemption for employees from USC on employer contributions to PRSAs, to bring the USC treatment of such contributions in line with employer contributions to occupational pension schemes. I brought forward these changes following the significant discussions on the USC treatment of PRSAs, to which I listened carefully, during the course of the debate on the Finance Act 2014 last year. Section 4 provides for an increase in the home carer tax credit to €1,000 per annum and also increases the income threshold for home carers at which the credit begins to be withdrawn. The change is from €5,080 to €7,200.  Section 9 extends the home renovation incentive for a final year to the end of 31 December 2016.  Section 11 provides that an employer may provide an employee with a single annual voucher or non-cash benefit to a maximum of €500 without applying PAYE, PRSI or USC.  Section 14 removes from the list of specified reliefs for the purpose of the high earner restriction the exemption from income tax for profits and gains from the management of woodlands. Section 15 introduces an incentive to encourage landlords to make their properties available to tenants in receipt of social housing supports. It is one part of a package of measures developed by the Government to improve rent stability, which was introduced on Report Stage in the Dáil. The incentive will be available to landlords who enter into a three-year commitment to rent a property to a tenant in receipt of housing supports. When the conditions of the incentive are met, the landlord will be allowed to claim a deduction for 100% of relevant mortgage interest, an increase on the 75% which is currently available. The increased deduction will be claimable on an arrears basis at the end of the three-year period provided the conditions of the scheme have been met. Section 17 amends the film tax credit following the budget announcement of an increase in the cap on qualifying eligible expenditure at €70 million per production. Section 18 makes a number of amendments to the employment and investment incentive. Certain changes to the terms of the employment and investment incentive are made in order to ensure it complies with the European Commission's general block exemption regulations from a state aid perspective. In addition, the incentive is being extended to companies which already own and operate nursing homes for the purpose of raising funding which can be spent on extending such nursing homes or residential care units associated with them. The changes are included in a financial resolution that came into effect on budget night. The increased amounts a company can raise in single year and over its lifetime which I announced last year have now come into effect. Section 19 makes a number of amendments in relation to certain tax reliefs for farmers. It extends the period for which stock relief is available to 31 December 2018. This includes standard stock relief, stock relief for young trained farmers and stock relief for registered farm partnerships. It also makes a number of amendments to the registered farm partnership regime. These clarify certain conditions and introduce a requirement that all participants in the partnership are active farmers. A provision to allow the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to appoint inspectors to determine whether registered farm partnerships are operating as required is also included. Section 19 also introduces limited tax relief for succession farm partnerships, a succession planning model that encourages older farmers to form partnerships with young trained farmers and to transfer ownership of the farm within a specified period to that young trained farmer. The section also provides for an appeals mechanism with regard to decisions made by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on registered farm partnerships or succession farm partnerships. Section 20 introduces the petroleum production tax. The tax will apply to petroleum profits from discoveries made under petroleum authorisations issued from June 2014. An Oireachtas joint committee report on Ireland's offshore oil and gas regime published in May 2012 recognised that retrospective changes to fiscal and licensing terms carry a risk of long-term reputational damage, and recommended that existing agreements be adhered to, irrespective of changing circumstances. Therefore, the new terms are designed to strike a balance between maximising the financial return for the State from future discoveries and attracting high-risk exploration investment to prove the potential of our offshore natural resources. Sections 26 and 28 make minor amendments to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 regarding the introduction of Irish collective asset management vehicles and alternative investment funds. These changes bring the tax regime into line with the regulatory regime and ensure that Ireland will maintain its place as an internationally renowned centre for fund management and administration.  Section 27 amends the tax code in respect of capital allowances for certain aviation services facilities to comply with EU state aid de minimis guidelines. These amendments were brought into effect by a financial resolution on budget night.  Section 29 provides that additional tier 1 or AT1 capital instruments are to be regarded as debt instruments for corporate and withholding tax purposes. This will ensure the same tax treatment applies to these instruments as in other European countries.  Section 30 extends the three-year start-up corporation tax relief for new start-ups that begin trading over the next three years. Section 32 contains the legislative provisions to implement the knowledge development box tax arrangement that I announced in the budget. The section provides that a 6.25% rate of corporation tax will apply to profits attributable to certain patents and copyrighted software which are the result of qualifying research and development carried out in Ireland. The intention behind the knowledge development box, or KDB, is to encourage companies to develop intellectual property and thereby engage in substantive operations that have high added value for the Irish economy. The Government has already made a commitment that the KDB will comply with OECD rules and, once introduced, it will be the first OECD-compliant box in the world. This puts Ireland in a unique position to offer long-term certainty to innovative industries planning their research and development investments. Section 33 introduces country-by-country reporting in line with the approach agreed as part of the OECD's BEPS project. This introduces a requirement for multinationals with Irish parent companies to file country-by-country reports of their income, activities and taxes with the Revenue Commissioners.It will apply for fiscal years beginning on or after 1 January 2016 and the first reports must be filed with Revenue by the end of 2017. Section 35 replaces the existing capital gains tax relief applying to disposals of qualifying business assets by individual entrepreneurs and business people with a simplified relief which will apply, from 1 January 2016, a capital gains tax rate of 20% rather than the general rate of 33% to the first €1 million of qualifying gains. Section 38 amends section 542 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in order to put individuals who dispose of land used as part of their business before and after 1 January 2016 but who receive compensation payments in 2016 in the same position for tax purposes, particularly with reference to the capital gains tax entrepreneur relief, by specifying that, in respect of compensation payments received on or after 1 January 2016, the date of receipt of the payment will be treated as the date on which the disposal of the land occurred. Section 43 provides for the budget announcement that the reduced rate of alcohol product tax available for beer brewed in small breweries may be claimed upfront or by repayment. This is subject to a commencement order and will come into operation once the Revenue Commissioners have made the necessary changes to the collection system. This section also updates the definition of “counterfeit goods” to reflect the new definition in EU legislation.  Section 45 gives effect to the increase in the rates of tobacco products tax, which came into effect on budget night. This measure is expected to raise €8 million in 2015 and €61.4 million in 2016. Part 3 of the Bill deals with value-added tax, VAT. The VAT-related sections in the Bill, sections 51 to 60, inclusive, do not signal major policy changes and are largely technical in nature. Their primary focus is to prevent fraud, provide clarity and correct anomalies in the existing VAT Consolidation Acts. Part 4 of the Bill deals with stamp duties. Section 62 adds an additional qualification for the purposes of the young trained farmer stock relief. The new qualification is the bachelor of science honours degree in agriculture awarded by the Dundalk Institute of Technology.  Section 63 extends the relief from stamp duty on transfers of agricultural land, including farm houses and buildings, to young trained farmers until 31 December 2018.  Section 64 provides for the new stamp duty charge on cash cards and combined cards. The current position is that stamp duty is charged annually at the rate of €2.50 for each cash card and €5 for each combined card, subject to certain exemptions, which are to remain unchanged. This flat rate charge is being replaced with a 12 cent charge on withdrawals of cash from ATMs using these cards, which will be capped at either €2.50 in the case of cash withdrawals or €5 in the case of combined card withdrawals. The new basis of charge and the revised reporting requirements for issuers of cards will come into effect on 1 January 2016. Part 5 of the Bill deals with capital acquisitions tax. Section 67 increases the group A tax-free threshold for transfers of gifts and inheritances from parents to their children and below which capital acquisitions tax does not apply by approximately 25%, from €225,000 to €280,000, with effect from 14 October 2015. That is a full summary of the main aspects of the Finance Bill. There were a limited number of amendments in the Dáil and I have referred to them and explained their purpose. I commend the Bill to the House and thank Members for their attention.
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-03 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	61	The Minister is very welcome. It is a pleasure to listen to him. I congratulate him on his expertise and, if I may say so humbly, his application to his job and his ambassadorial skills, representing us in Brussels on all occasions. As I said before, I used to love listening to him reviewing the Fianna Fáil budgets when he was in opposition, at 6.30 p.m. the evening after the budget. He was as clear as a bell, succinct and did not use any jargon we could not fully understand. There are two very important issues which arise. I will be as brief as possible. I want to speak about the budget and capital gains tax. Ireland was innovative when it introduced the 12.5% corporation tax. The beauty of it has been that all Governments, consistently, whatever their composition, supported the 12.5% corporation tax rate. We dare not think where we would be without the multinationals. I have come here today to say we have to be innovative, as we were on the 12.5% corporation tax for multinationals to come to Ireland. We are too dependent on them. We have to be innovative in terms of our own high-tech entrepreneurs, of whom there are many. On budget day, the Minister reduced capital gains tax from 33% to 20% on net gains from the disposal of a business or assets up to €1 million. As a business person, I am of the view that we are not at the races on this ossie. I believe passionately that we have to be as innovative with our indigenous entrepreneurs as we have been with the multinationals. The British came down from a 28% capital gains tax to 10% over the last five years because they had a brain drain of entrepreneurs fleeing to the United States and to Australia because they had a better capital gains tax. I cannot comprehend how Department of Finance officials do not understand that although they reduced the rate to 20%, it is not as attractive as the British ones. There is a possibility that many Irish entrepreneurs will go to Britain because of the attractiveness of their capital gains tax rate. I am coming from the perspective that the success of any business lies in innovation. We have to be as innovative as possible in our taxation systems for Irish entrepreneurs and have to come down as close to zero as we can. We have to be better than the British because the Irish entrepreneurs will leave the country. I am very upset about this matter because I know it is critical that action be taken. Where will we be if we do not have people setting up businesses? We still have an unemployment rate of 19.5% among young people. That is 37,000 individuals. I meet many young people in an affluent area of the city who have no jobs. They do not have third level education and they are falling out of the system because they have not achieved any serious academic qualifications that will assist them in gaining employment. They are in dire straits. I am here on behalf of potential Irish entrepreneurs in the high-tech industry who have very innovative products and have become very successful and very profitable. Ireland's is a small economy, floating around on the periphery of Europe. We need exporting companies to earn our income. I am starting to believe many people in this building do not understand that one cannot run an economy on the basis of a services sector. We have to have a productive sector of the economy to make money and keep the rest of the place going. Unless we have people selling goods and growing their markets, we cannot keep the country running.The officials of the Department of Finance and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation would want to get their act together in acknowledging the requirements of being an entrepreneur. The Minister knows as well as I do that being an entrepreneur is quite like trying to win an election in that the work is 24-7. Ms Connie Doody and I worked 24/7 for 16 years in Lir Chocolates. In saying that, I mean it. We innovated day in, day out. If we had said we would wait until the following year to produce a new product in the hope of getting business, we would not have succeeded. We had to innovate relentlessly day in, day out, and week in, week out. We are not at the races. Ultimately, the politicians are the people who make the decisions, not officials in the Department of Finance. That said, and I am not being personal in saying this, those officials do not understand what it is like. We need a very innovative capital gains tax regime to encourage people to set up business and Irish entrepreneurs to stay in Ireland. We cannot let them run off to the United Kingdom. Another point that is very dear to my heart and about which I spoke to the Minister concerns inheritance tax. I live in the south County Dublin area where, very quickly in a matter of a week, we got more than 2,000 people to sign a petition on inheritance tax. I do not understand the rationale behind inheritance tax or why the hell we bother with it. People in this country, particularly in Dublin, have saved all their lives for the one little capital asset, but when they hand that property over to their child, he or she must raise the money to pay the awful inheritance tax or sell it. It is communism. I have said this to the Minister before. I do not understand why we would do that to citizens. I meet people in Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown who are heartbroken because their children will have to pay inheritance tax at such a high rate. I found my own party to be very parochial about this. The threshold should be changed back to €500,000, which applied in 2008. I am not being personal and would not like to hurt the Minister's feelings because I have respected him so much over so many years, but I believe his change to the inheritance tax regime was miserly. It was meaningless. In respect of a house worth €500,000, one only saves an extra €18,000 on inheritance tax. These are two passions of mine. We really have to grab the issue of capital gains tax for Irish entrepreneurs by the scruff of the neck. I hope the Minister's adviser who is sitting behind him is listening to me because we are not at the races with the British. One has to be better than one's competition. We have to have a better capital gains tax regime than the British. Many countries have abolished inheritance tax, including Portugal, Norway, Sweden, Russia, Hungary, Austria, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. It is deemed double taxation. Why are we imposing it? I do not approve of it whatsoever. I meet older people in the Churchtown area who are devastated. They are only copping on to this. They say they have paid off the mortgage on their house, their one capital investment, but that their child will have to pay a very serious tax on it. I wish the Minister continued success because he is a role model for us all.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-03 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	62	I welcome the Minister. I am substituting today for my colleague, Senator Michael D'Arcy.  There are a few points in the Finance Bill I wish to address. I have spoken to the Minister about these matters prior to the budget. No more than my colleague on the other side of the House, Senator Mary White, and others, I have hobby horses. I recall how long it took the Minister to deliver the budget on budget day and the number of pages in his statement. Despite this, many people said to me the following day that they took only one line from the budget, the line implying there was an extra week's wages in it for everyone. Subsequently, the ESRI stated there were three weeks' wages in the budget for everyone. I do not know whether the Minister was underestimating himself in that regard. Budgets and finance Bills in recent years have been to get the country back on track. Everybody on both sides of the House understands that. Senators understand all the holes cannot be filled in one budget. In the most recent Budget Statement, it was specified that the universal social charge benefits were directed primarily towards people on low incomes or those the media call "the coping classes". This was the right decision in the interest of a fairer society. However, the sector that contributed a lot to the economy comprises older people. I was disappointed, therefore, that the telephone allowance was not reinstated for them. This could have been achieved at a nominal cost to the State, and it would have meant so much to them. I would not write off the fact that the Minister will keep this in mind. He might be able to reinstate the allowance at another stage. Another issue for which I will continue to fight concerns that the fact that Down's syndrome ought to be included in the qualifying criteria for a primary medical certificate. I hate using the word "burden", but there is a burden on the parents of children with Down's syndrome. They have to bring them everywhere. There are great services now and I hope we will never again treat people with disabilities and the disadvantaged as we did years ago but it should be acknowledged that children with Down's syndrome are the whole life of their parents for all their lives. I have four children and hope they will be reared and independent in the next ten to 15 years but parents of a child with Down's syndrome must focus on their child all their life. I hope that in the future the Minister will be in a position to include Down's syndrome among the conditions that qualify for a primary medical certificate. I congratulate the Minister on the way he has brought the country back from where it was. I acknowledge that there is a good bit to go. Having spoken to people in the business community, I have learned there are many more people back working. We are going the right way although we are not there yet. I hope the people in the sectors of society that have not yet benefited will get their just reward for the sacrifices they made after the financial meltdown. As the saying goes, "A rising tide lifts all boats."

As with Senator Mary White, I wish to talk about the changes the Minister is effecting. I was delighted to see he started the journey. He took a step but never even got his shoe off the ground. He intends to reduce the capital gains tax rate for Irish entrepreneurs should they ever reach the welcome day on which they wish to sell their businesses. The rate is to be reduced from 33% to 20% of the first €1 million. As with previous speakers, I so admire what the Minister has done. I will never forget the feeling of despair when, having been fortunate enough to become a Senator, I read some of the documentation from Europe. I looked upon this Oireachtas as a business and there was fear in my heart. Today, however, we note the wonderful positivity that the Government has driven.The Minister is to be congratulated.  Our mantra now is that Ireland is the best small country in which to do business, but I can tell the Minister with certainty that Ireland is most definitely not the best country in which to start a business. I am not sure if the Minister was in the room at the Global Irish Economic Forum in Dublin Castle two weeks ago when a wonderful young man from Cork spoke about his new business. Unfortunately, however, he is based in London, and I do not blame him. I am going to invest in his business. He has an amazing idea involving the food industry which will help diabetics. I was talking to him yesterday and I told him he would be mad to start his business in Ireland because he will pay 10% of £10 million in England and this boy's product will sell out. Unfortunately, the Seanad is not allowed make amendments to this Bill. I wish that were the case, because I would have fought tooth and nail to get the Minister to take a much braver step. He is in a position to do that. Why let the English have it? Part of my business has been sold and if I want to start a new business I may go to Northern Ireland to do so. I remind the Minister that, like the previous speaker, Senator Mary White, I started a business. One goes through the feasibility stage, the excitement stage, the risk stage, the borrowing of the money stage, the mortgaging of one's house stage, the worry stage and the 24/7 stage that lasts for about ten years, following which one gets to look the way I do at 55, which is about 90. There is the ongoing stress, an incredible amount of work and then the employment stage and dealing with employment law, which is very difficult for a small company like mine, but I employ 220 people and will employ more before I am finished. There is also the question of VAT, the universal social charge and PRSI. At the end of the journey, the more value one adds to one's business, the more tax one will pay to the Government.  We want more entrepreneurs not only in the technology space but also in the crafts, services and manufacturing spaces to create businesses, rural employment, thriving communities and innovation. There are many people with ideas who will help us in the climate change space but there is no incentive in that regard. I hope the Minister is hearing what I am saying and I hope he will go much further. We are in a position to do it and therefore we should level the playing field so that our young entrepreneurs can have a go, because the situation is madness. I will not read out the relevant section of the Bill, but we are not talking about people who buy tracts of land or big properties that they leave idle and on which they make a fortune. We are talking about people who give their blood, sweat and tears to employ people. They put their life and soul into their businesses. They love this country. We should re-examine that situation. I thank the Minister for listening to me.

The economy is one of the fastest growing economies in Europe, if not the fastest growing. The latest ESRI forecast states it will grow by 6% this year and 4.8% next year. The ESRI previously forecast in its quarterly economic commentary that the growth rate would be 4%; therefore, we continue to exceed expectations, which is a very good place for the economy to be in.

The Government has been determined to see the economy return to full employment and has pledged to achieve this by 2018. At the start of the year the ESRI predicted that unemployment would fall to 9% by the end of the year and we have already reached that target. In fact, we are ahead of it. That is down from 14% at the height of the crisis. I do not want to be political about this in the way Senator Mary White has been, but the reason the country is in this crisis-----

In spite of commentary to the contrary, we have a highly progressive income tax system, with a tax wedge for those in receipt of 160% of the average wage in comparison with those who are on 60% less than the average wage, placing us second highest in the OECD in this regard, and this budget ensures that it is more progressive. The Irish tax and welfare systems have been highly effective in reducing inequality during the crisis. A recent OECD report pointed out that Ireland, in comparison with France, for example, reduced inequality during the crisis, which is some achievement. We are a more equal society now than we were at the beginning of the crisis. The Finance Bill before the House today is one element of a package of measures designed to secure the recovery of the economy. The Social Welfare and Pensions Bill which is before the House contains a package of measures to support families and restore some of the unavoidable cuts made necessary by the mismanagement of the economy by other Governments during the worst years of the recession.

In recent weeks we have seen a package of measures designed to combat homelessness and safeguard the one in five families who are renting in our society, together with another package of measures designed to improve housing supply. That follows on from the announcement in last year's budget of resources for one of the largest social housing programmes in the history of the State. There is no doubt that the country is in recovery. The unemployment figures, more than anything else, are an indication of the extent of the economy's recovery. Tax receipts are almost €3 billion ahead of target and, as the Minister stated recently, Government borrowing will be eliminated in a few years. We expect the debt-to-GDP ratio to fall to 100% by the end of this year, well exceeding expectations. I believe it was Foreign Policy magazine that had Ireland reaching 109% by the end of the year. Again, we are exceeding expectations. On the specific budget measures, I welcome the tax and universal social charge changes. I am particularly pleased that they target the lowest paid and middle earners. I welcome also section 9, which deals with the extension of the home renovation incentive for an additional year. That has had some success, particularly in improving the housing stock. That it was extended to include landlords renting private rented housing means that those people renting are not forgotten. Section 15 which introduces tax relief for landlords who make properties available to tenants in receipt of social housing supports is also to be welcomed because we know it is particularly difficult for tenants receiving rent supplement or housing assistance payments to secure housing. However, I would like to see tax relief extended to all landlords because it is one area where there is inequality between landlords renting domestic housing and commercial renters. It is only fair to treat landlords equally, whether they are in the domestic market or the commercial sector. Regarding section 32, I welcome the legislation to implement the knowledge development box. It encourages companies to develop intellectual property in this country, which brings in a higher added value for the economy. One of the criticisms of foreign direct investment is that we do not get the additional value added that the economy requires. In terms of my overall concerns, as the country-specific recommendations for Ireland pointed out, the level of private debt in our economy remains worryingly high. I highlight, for example, the mortgage arrears issue. I very much welcome the decision the Government made recently to change the bankruptcy laws, as I believe it will encourage more lenders to reach realistic settlements with people in mortgage arrears. We continue to struggle with the banking sector. I am particularly concerned about the equity gap in the housing market. There is a 40% equity gap in terms of access to finance for developers which is forcing them to secure expensive funding from the venture capital funds. Recent research done for the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland identifies access to capital as the factor that most limits development in the country.The additional cost of finance is in the region of €7,000 per unit. The operations of the banks generally need to be reviewed. Recently, Bank of Ireland attempted to introduce a €700 minimum for over-the-counter withdrawals. That was subsequently withdrawn. However, it is an indication of the activities that banks intend to pursue in order to improve their profitability. The budget represented a missed opportunity to secure movement on variable interest rates. Ours remain the highest in the eurozone. That is unacceptable. They are being paid by people who are in mortgage arrears and negative equity. This issue must be addressed. Lending to small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, was highlighted as a leading challenge. This banking issue needs to be addressed as part of a wider policy, as the banks continue to fall short and there is not likely to be any improvement in the lack of competition in the near future. The future looks good for Ireland. We have issues that need to be addressed, in particular mortgage arrears, but Europe is proving resilient to the shocks of recent months, for example, those owing to difficulties in China. Energy costs remain low. Of most importance is the fact that the European Union has shown itself to be willing to engage in quantitative easing to support the European economy. We might have an additional rate cut soon, which is a matter on which the Minister might be able to comment. It would assist in dealing with the mortgage arrears issue.

I welcome the Minister. Senator Tom Sheahan mentioned that he was standing in for Senator Michael D'Arcy. We are working on the banking inquiry report. I thank the Minister for the evidence he gave when he appeared before us. We have robust tax receipts. It is wise that mention has been made of keeping some of these out of financing day-to-day expenditure in case they are one-offs or exceptional. I welcome the debates between the Minister and Professor John McHale and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, because they have been useful and form part of a democracy. In other spheres of Government policy, there is a certain dislike of contrarianism but it should always be present, including in the Seanad. Let us debate the issues. I hope it will lead to better policy-making. Vigilance of public expenditure is always required. That is substantially the reason that we got into trouble. My white elephant prize for this year goes to the seven-digit, non-sequential address code, which was rightly criticised by the Comptroller and Auditor General. It cost €38 million and no one uses it. From the evidence given to the committee, it was obvious to every member that there was no great appetite for the code. If 98% of post is delivered the next day why spend €38 million on trying to improve Postman Pat, who is doing well? In many other ways, we are going in the right direction. The 9% VAT rate for tourism and the abolition of the air travel tax gave rise to proven results, but there are concerns about some hotels, particularly in Dublin. I do not know whether the 9% VAT rate can be geographically differentiated but many Senators have told me that the cost of staying in Dublin has increased in the past year, which is not quite what the Minister and the House had in mind when we introduced the lower rate. The Minister stated that debt-to-GDP ratio would fall below 100%. He also mentioned USC. While I welcome the reductions, a peculiar feature of USC is that the allowance does not apply once one exceeds it. If one earns more than €12,012, the entire €12,012 below the exemption limit becomes taxable. I have never seen this with any other Irish tax. I hope that there will be genuine attempts to take people out of the net. Similarly, no full-time worker on the minimum wage should be liable to tax. The Minister stated that the third rate of USC had been reduced to 5.5%. That is what "minimum wage" means, namely, the amount that people need to live. We should remove it from the tax net if possible. In conversations with the Minister's distinguished predecessor, Mr. Brian Lenihan, I detected that there was a view within the Department of Finance that low-income earners did not pay enough tax. That might be true but it is because they are low-income earners. Going after them did not strike me as being a progressive way of running the tax code. Some of that thinking was reflected in tax measures in recent years. Turning to section 9, the banking commission would have serious reservations about all of the tax breaks for housing. They are difficult to get away from once we start. They begin as a Keynesian mechanism and continue even when the economy is growing at 6%. I am wary of such measures. Another of the Minister's predecessors, Mr. Alan Dukes, stated in his evidence to the banking inquiry that a prosperous economy made for a prosperous construction sector, but that it was not necessarily the other way around. We might bear that in mind as a principle. Section 11 on vouchers from employers for rewarding staff is interesting. Senator Aideen Hayden referred to housing issues. On the Order Paper is the National Mortgage and Housing Corporation Bill 2015. We introduced it when the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, were away, so three of their ministerial colleagues from other Departments sat in for it. There is some potential to emulate the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation experience in order to borrow money at low interest rates on the condition that it is channelled into houses at below-average prices. I have misgivings about the ability of the construction industry and financial sector to solve our housing problem. According to evidence given by Mr. Michael O'Flynn to the banking inquiry, housing in Ireland has priced itself out of the market. We used to be able to provide houses at 2.5 times the average income but that increased to 12 times before falling to approximately six times now. Pressure must be applied to re-orient it to address our serious housing problem. Section 17 on the film tax credit will cap qualifying expenditure to €70 million per production. My inclination is to put a €70 million cap on the whole lot. I have different priorities than allowing movies to be made for €70 million each for a tax credit, but I have discussed this matter with the Minister in the Seanad in previous years. I note the fuel tax provisions under sections 81 to 83, inclusive. Between the authorities in Northern Ireland and the Republic, there must be a clampdown on fuel laundering and smuggling in Border areas in order to address criminality as well as the loss of revenues. Section 35 relates to entrepreneurs. The problem is that, as proposed, it gives the tax break when one becomes an ex-entrepreneur and sells the business. One might buy another business but are there other ways of channelling assistance to entrepreneurs than requiring them to sell their businesses? I note the Minister's interest in the knowledge box. I wish that project every success. We must get away from inversion and the type of adverse publicity that we get, in particular in the United States, for being seen as a place where companies buy small subsidiaries in order to avoid their corporate tax responsibilities in the United States. The United States is our great partner in economic development. The fact that the Minister is implementing the OECD rules by setting up the first OECD-compliant knowledge box in the world is to his credit. I wish him well in that endeavour.We are supposed to be espousing technology. The ATM is a form of technology. It makes no sense to charge people a tax every time they use an ATM, particularly if their finances are not looking well. It seems a puny thing to do to annoy people. The measure is contained in section 64. As the other speakers have said, the Minister for Finance has brought the finances to a far better place than they were in. We must keep vigilant on expenditure programmes. There are far more Ministers, aside from the Minister in the House now and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, who are working on new ways to spend money. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has a role in advising and debating with the Minister on tax. We need something similar on the expenditure side rather than waiting until the Comptroller and Auditor General turns up after the event to tell us that €38 million was spent on the seven-digit address code. It makes no sense but we know that already. A better appraisal of projects on the expenditure side would help to complete the journey that we have undertaken remarkably well in recent years.

One measure of the success of the Minister can be garnered from the Exchequer returns at the end of November. They show a surplus of €343 million for the first time since 2007. At the end of November, tax receipts were up 11.9% on the same period last year. One good thing about those figures is that the strong performance is across all tax headings rather than only one tax heading. This is an indication of improved trading and of how consumer confidence is improving. The signs of the recovery are all around us. One need only take to the roads to see the increased traffic, particularly in the past year. There are far more commercial vehicles on the roads and many more builders and tradesmen who are particularly busy now. Some of them tell me they are finding it difficult to recruit staff. That has a knock-on effect on builders providers, hardware stores and shops. All of that is adding significantly to the tax take. The hospitality and restaurant sector is doing exceptionally well in many parts of the country. This was due to the innovative measure the Minister introduced in his first year, namely, the 9% VAT rate for the hospitality sector and the reduction in the travel tax. Like Senator Barrett, I am concerned that some hotels are abusing the measure. The Minister was right in the recent budget to issue a warning and set out how if the measure continued to be abused he would have to reconsider the measure in future budgets. I was concerned this week following the comments of the chief executive of the Restaurants Association of Ireland. He said restaurants were now likely to start charging €1 for a glass of water.

I caution the restaurants association to be careful with that measure. We still have not seen the level of improvement and benefit spreading to some more rural areas. One measure we can all help with coming up to Christmas is to consider shopping locally to boost the local economy. One measure in particular in the budget should be helpful. Some of the larger employers give Christmas bonuses to employees. The measure in the budget now enables employers to give vouchers to the value of €500 to employees. The figure has gone up from €250. That should certainly help to pump more activity into the local economy. It should help smaller towns in particular. Senator Mdary White referred to the inheritance tax issue. I know this is something she feels passionately about. The fact that the Minister has adjusted the limit from €225,000 to €280,000 in the budget is to be welcomed. I hope this is simply a start. We need to see that significantly increased in the future.

I very much support that. The measures being taken in An Action Plan for Jobs will address some of issues. However, from a taxation point of view this is something I know the Minister will keep under close review in future. Another measure I very much welcome is the VAT refunds for home improvements. The Minister has continued the measures for next year. This has certainly been of major benefit to small builders. It has kick-started some economic activity in some of the smaller rural areas. Now that people are spending a little more, there is no doubt that tradesmen, electricians, plasterers and plumbers are beginning to benefit from that measure. I am keen to see that continue.

We have a great deal of work to do between now and Christmas. Let us consider some of the issues that have not been covered or addressed. All of us welcome the improving economic climate in the country. Having said that, we must recognise how this is not impacting on thousands of people in this country, especially those in middle Ireland. There are no provisions in this Bill in real terms to alleviate child care costs. There is no direct tax credit for that. There remains an anti-urban or anti-Dublin slant on the local property tax. Let us consider the VAT decreases to which Senator Michael Mullins referred. He commended the Minister on the reduced VAT rate on the hospitality sector. I agree with him in this regard. However, let us remember where the money came from. Fully €2.4 billion came from private pension funds. It has been taken out of peoples' savings. I am unsure where that balances the books because there was certainly no €2.5 billion reduction in VAT with that requisite amount. Let us consider the mortgage arrears issue. There are no measures in this budget for mortgage arrears. There are no measures relating to the variable mortgage rates. We have repossession rates and civil bills, more than 6,000 of which have been issued this year already. These have been facilitated by the Government through the passing of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act. The Minister of Finance watered down the code of conduct on mortgage arrears to make it easier for banks to attack mortgage holders in difficulty.While we look at some of the positives in the Bill, it is only fair for people to see where actions are required in other areas where no progress whatsoever has been made. More than 200,000 people are in mortgage arrears and people have repossession orders hanging over their heads. Some people are working simply to pay the bills and are paying an extra mortgage in terms of child care, in particular those living in urban areas in Dublin. I did not get an opportunity to speak to the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, but perhaps the Minister of State might consider those who are paying for everything and getting nothing, that is, middle Ireland, where couples are out working every day and are paying for everything. I do not want to burst the Labour Party's bubble, but the fact is that this budget is better for high-income than low-income earners. That has been the trend with the Government over the past five years. Senator Aideen Hayden can shake her head, but she should read the figures.

#DarraghOBrien	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-party	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-dob	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-03 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	97	Let us consider the budget. The highest benefit in terms of tax changes will be felt by higher income earners. Tax changes will result in a gain of 1.9% for those earning €75,000 a year and 0.8% for those earning €20,000 year. They are the figures and the facts. Senators can dispute them all they want, but that is the way it is. I want to raise one matter which has been brought to my attention with the Minister of State, namely, the employment and investment incentive scheme, which I would like him to address on Committee Stage. It is a vital scheme for domestic firms which want to raise non-bank finance. However, changes being made will have the effect of ruling out trading SMEs over seven years old unless they can raise funding equivalent to over 50% of the average of the most recent five years' turnover. For example, an eight year old company with a turnover of €4 million cannot, under the current rules, take in employment and investment incentives unless it raises more than €2 million. This may be more than it can raise. I would like the Minister of State to examine this because it is an unintended consequence. Growing bank funding for the SME sector was mentioned. It is still incredibly difficult for small firms to get loans from banks. This could be a very good scheme to allow SMEs to raise funding. I do not think the Government intends for an eight year old company which is growing to have to put up 50% of the finance, while a business that is seven years old or less can access the scheme. Obviously on Second Stage we cannot table amendments, but I will put forward recommendations in this regard on Committee Stage. It is worth examining the issue. I will give the Minister of State an example when he concludes, and he might ask his officials to consider it. We will have a better chance to unpick this Bill on Committee Stage. This and any future Government needs to consider those who, in the main, are carrying the tax burden. We have to look after those who need assistance and I have always stood over a good social welfare system. The reality is that thousands of people are working simply to pay bills and see their tax burden increasing each year with water charges, local property tax, child care costs and high variable mortgage interest rates. They are the people on whom we need to focus. They believe no one is speaking for them. I look forward to Committee Stage. It is up to Members on the Government side to commend their Minister for the work he has done. I commend the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, for some of the work he has done, but in doing so one has to consider areas that have not yet been addressed and how we got to this situation. It might not suit Members on the Government side to realise that 70% of the adjustments that were required were made by the previous Government and were opposed by the Labour Party and Fine Gael at every single stage in the Dáil, yet effectively the same plan was followed. They cannot have it both ways. People do not want to see us arguing over political points. We have to try to include those who have been left behind, something I understand cannot be addressed in one Bill. Those people who are paying for everything and getting nothing can be the focus after the next election. I welcome the Minister of the State to the House and look forward to his response. I will give him specific details on the investment scheme.

I am delighted to have him here. What is particularly pleasing in the finance results that are coming through is that we have a surplus way beyond that which we anticipated, on which I congratulate the Minister of State and the Department. I got one piece of advice from Senator Sean D. Barrett, namely, not to forget the shoe box. I asked him what he meant. I am not sure who came up with the shoe box idea. I understand it was Brian Farrell who said when one got a one-off benefit, one should put it in a shoebox rather than spending it or including it in a budget because suddenly it would all be gone. There is a temptation to do that. Let us remember the shoebox and any surplus money we have on that basis. The debate today was very interesting. I listened to Senators Mary White and Mary Ann O'Brien, both of whom are entrepreneurs and started businesses. I remember someone telling me he had huge confidence in anybody who has ever run a business because they lie awake wondering where they will get the money to pay wages at the end of the week. It seems that is what the two Senators have done. They spoke of the importance of running a business. The fact that they are both in the chocolate business is very useful.

I would like to raise some issues relating to business, in particular, SMEs. Part 3 deals with various VAT issues. I would like to see the Minister doing more to help the retail sector, something Senator Michael Mullins mentioned. In particular, we need to make it easy for retailers to succeed online. As we saw with black Friday and cyber Monday, this is where the future of sales is likely to be. Unfortunately, many retailers are still not very good at getting their business online and, therefore, are missing out on thousands of potential customers from all over the world. I mentioned that I visited Estonia a few years ago. I went into a shop which had, if I recall correctly, three people on the shop floor but 11 people working upstairs trading online all over Europe. They succeeded in doing business on that basis. It is possible to do something. We are missing out on thousands of potential customers from all around the world. One proposal is that the Government could introduce a measure that would offset the cost of web development against VAT costs. That has happened in other countries and we could do something. Perhaps there is still time to introduce this small, but possibly very beneficial, incentive. It may give those retailers which need to get online the knowledge that they need. It would be at a small cost to the Government and would involve setting the conditions to create jobs in that sector. If this cannot be done now, I hope we will return to it at some point in the future. Senator Darragh O'Brien raised an issue about which I feel very strongly, namely, the employment and investment incentive scheme, which allows for tax relief on investments in SMEs. In particular, it seems that in the new rules, companies over seven years old will not now be eligible. I do not understand that. Perhaps the Minister of State could explain the reasoning for it. The Government should implement measures to protect established businesses rather than just helping new businesses. As Senator Darragh O'Brien said, banks are often not lending enough. Given that the economy is still relatively fragile, it seems that measures such as the employment and investment incentive scheme should help all SMEs, not just the newer ones. The scheme requires that a qualifying company now has to be a company that never traded, a company within its first seven years of trading or that the funds the company raises must be higher than 50% of the company's average turnover in the past five years. I do not understand the reason for these conditions. Perhaps the Minister of State will be able to explain them. These changes were not communicated during the budget. They appear to have been agreed only very recently. This proposed change essentially rules out trading SME companies over seven years old, unless they can raise an investment amount of over 50% of an average of five years' recent turnover.An eight-year old company with a €4 million turnover cannot take in investment unless it raises over €2 million in funds. Most companies simply would not need that funding. The provision has been sprung on us. The thinking behind it needs an explanation and I think it needs to be changed. The Minister of State may say, "Here is the explanation and here is the change we are going to make," and I hope we do make a change. I believe the change can be done through recommendations on Committee Stage. I will e-mail my suggestions to him because the matter needs careful attention and I know he will give the matter the scrutiny it deserves.  I welcome the Minister of State. I welcome the Finance Bill and the steps that have taken place. In particular, I welcome the success of the tax incentive in the past year. Let us make sure we do the right thing in the future and continue to improve the economy, which would benefit us all.

We all know that there is an election coming; it is inevitable. An election is about choices, but when we were faced with making choices to substantially address income inequality and deprivation, for example, it was not done in this legislation or in the budget. The fact that economic recovery has led to worsening inequality should be of major concern to everyone. Having said that, my party recognises that there are some positive elements in the Bill, and we support them. The extension of the tax credit to self-employed workers is overdue, although my party would have chosen to phase it out. Sinn Féin proposed the removal of people in receipt of the increased minimum wage of €19,572 from the USC net. However, I welcome the removal of some people who earn less than that sum from the USC scheme. We believe a high earner will gain €900 and the top 14% of earners will gain €190 million from this budget and the Finance Bill. It is our belief this Bill is the embodiment of the Government's ideological commitment to tax cuts above the protection of public services. It is some statement that tax cuts for top earners trump all other considerations. We have been told everyone can see there has been an economic recovery, particularly when travelling on roads, where one can see that there are a lot of new commercial cars and more builders. What I see in the real world is homelessness, people on hospital trolleys, people sleeping on hospital floors, poverty, deprived children and people struggling to feed and heat themselves, let alone live comfortably. Hard-working families are living on poverty wages, the squeezed middle are struggling to cope day to day, and there are families with children in school and college who are struggling financially. Plus, young people will be less well off than in previous generations. Families have been torn apart by emigration, and elderly people are struggling to meet their basic needs. I am not asking the Minister of State to take my word for what has happened. Dr. Rory Hearne, for example, has carried out an interesting analysis of inequality within the economic recovery that is based on the results of last week's survey of income and living conditions by the CSO. Based on the survey and his analysis, it would appear that Ireland is deeply unequal and that the level of inequality is worsening. Perhaps the Minister of State might respond to some of his points. Dr. Hearne claims:The share of income going to the top 20 percent in Ireland has increased each year since 2011 and is now back at pre-crisis levels. In contrast, the share of income going to the bottom 40% of the population has fallen.As has been said, inequality has increased since 2011. Dr. Hearne continued:Ireland's Gini co-efficient worsened between 2013 and 2014 as it increased from 31.3% to 31.8%. As the CSO notes, “this indicates an increase in income inequality across the total income distribution." This is the highest the level of inequality in Ireland since 2006, when the Gini coefficient was 32.4. As we sit here discussing the Finance Bill, discussing its provisions and measures, I want to ask the following: what effects have the past number of budgets had on the economy? What about the significant amount of social scarring that is evident to everyone? We need only look at the reality. There has been an increase in the proportion of the population who suffer deprivation and are at risk of poverty. In 2004, for example, 12% of the population experienced two or more types of deprivation, but in 2014 that figure had almost trebled to 29%. Before coming here this morning I calculated that the 29% figure means there are 765,000 people suffering from deprivation, which is the equivalent of the entire population of Cavan, Monaghan, Meath, Louth, Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon. My calculation may be a few digits over or under. We need to include social and human impact indicators when we discuss the budget and the finance Bills. The historically high rate of deprivation is of major concern to me. Unfortunately, neither economic growth nor Government policies have addressed these unacceptably high rates. Therefore we need to question successive budgets and finance Bills. CSO statistics have revealed that poverty and deprivation rates for those at work have increased significantly in the past year. The deprivation rate for households with one person at work rose from 33.8% in 2013 to 35% in 2014. The at-risk-of-poverty rate for these households rose from 13.4% to 15.9%. Looking at those figures, I strongly refute the claim made here this afternoon that a rising tide lifts all boats. I ask the Minister of State to comment on this.  I want to briefly mention how the Government's attitude to the budget has worked in reality. For example, local authorities use the housing assistance programme, the rental accommodation scheme and long-term leasing schemes for social housing. They have funding for 2015 to 2017, yet they have signed leases of between five and ten years' duration without knowing for certain how much money will be allocated for the schemes after 2017. Most local authorities have signed up for rate harmonisation for periods of between five and ten years. When central government reduces the allocation for social housing schemes while local authorities are tied into contracts costing €14 million plus a year, where will they make up the shortfall in funds? Let us bear in mind that under fiscal rules, any increase in expenditure by local authorities counts towards expenditure benchmarks. Therefore, even if it is a good year for rates and other local funding, the money cannot be spent. That is just one example of short-term thinking. Regardless of how much corporation tax is brought in this year or next year, we still have a fixed amount of money to spend over the next five years. Local government, health, child care, housing and public services do not seem to be in the plan. When the Minister for Finance was here this morning, he commenced by talking about the growing economy and having yet more people in work. One can see that having a job is not enough any more. Now one requires a living wage and affordable housing, child care and health care to ensure that low-paid workers can get out of poverty and deprivation. According to Social Justice Ireland, budget 2016 has widened the gap between rich and poor. Also, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council does not think the budget is prudent and the European Commission has warned that it has not been built on solid foundations. At the beginning of my contribution I mentioned that my party agrees with some elements of the Bill. However, it is not a Bill to stand over and my party will not support it.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-03 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	104	I shall begin by thanking all of the Senators for their contributions on the Finance Bill. Any time I have come to the House we have had an interesting and informative debate and today has been no different. On my own behalf and that of the Minister for Finance, I thank everybody for their comments and viewpoints. There were some suggestions and advance warnings about matters that Senators wish to pursue further on Committee Stage. Some of the issues raised, while relevant in terms of fiscal policy development, relate to areas which are beyond the direct scope of the Finance Bill under debate. Therefore, I hope Senators will understand if I focus in the first instance specifically on the issues raised about the Bill and then the related issues, if I have time. Senator Mary White raised the issue of inheritance tax while the Minister was here. I know that she has strong feelings about it. The Minister raised the group A threshold that applies to gifts and inheritance bestowed by parents to their children from €225,000 to €280,000, which represents an increase of about 25%. The Minister did so in recognition of the improving state of the national finances and the concerns expressed to him and to many Members by people making and receiving gifts and inheritance, particularly in the context of rising property prices. The scale of the increase may not be considered sufficient by some. I understand that is the point that was made by the Senator.

#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-03 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	106	A significant change has been made and it is as much as we could afford on this occasion. The Minister has, however, indicated that he sees a change to the group A tax-free threshold in this year's budget as the start of a process. Provided, among other factors, that our economic recovery continues, and if the Minister remains the Minister for Finance, he intends to examine the scope for further improvements in the tax-free threshold in the future. The yields from capital acquisitions tax only represents 1% of overall tax revenues and generates about €400 million per annum. If that yield was not there, obviously other taxes would have to be increased or expenditure reduced to fill the gap had we gone beyond what we did in this budget. Taxes on certain fixed capital are much less distortionary for economic activity than taxes on income and employment. However, I take the point made. Senators Mary White and Mary Ann O'Brien referred to the revised CGT entrepreneurial relief and the issues around competition with the United Kingdom. The level of gains qualifying for relief under the UK scheme commenced at £1 million and was subsequently increased over time. We are setting out a similar roadmap here. The Minister did as much as the resources allowed him to do in this space.

#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-03 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	108	The United Kingdom started in the exact same way as we are doing. Unfortunately, we must remain within the fiscal rules. If we put more into one area, we have to take it away from another. It is about getting that balance right. The relief will be kept under review and subject, among other factors, to the economic recovery continuing, we see significant scope for further enhancing it into the future. Moreover, on foot of issues raised with him regarding aspects of the relief as set out in the Bill, the Minister put forward amendments as the legislation went through the Dáil which further broaden the scope of the relief and ensure it will operate as it was intended to do. As well as changes to the CGT entrepreneurial relief, the budget included other tax measures to improve the environment for business, including the earned income tax credit, for which organisations such as the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association have been campaigning since the 1980s. We have an opportunity now to ensure there is tax equalisation for the self-employed in this country by 2018. My colleague, Senator Tom Sheahan, rightly referred to the focus in the budget on the benefits for the coping classes and low and middle-income earners. The Department of Social Protection has conducted a social impact analysis of the budget package, including both tax and expenditure measures. This analysis shows that while 98% of households benefit from the budget, the gains for individuals in the lowest two fifths of the income distribution are the greatest, while the smallest gain is experienced by those in the top one fifth. In fact, it was shown that households with children, particularly those headed by working lone parents, are the greatest beneficiaries of budget 2016. The Senator indicated his preference that the free telephone allowance be restored. In addition to the cuts to the three lowest rates of universal social charge, budget 2016 preserves the exemption from the higher rates of USC for medical card holders and persons aged over 70 whose income does not exceed €60,000. This measure, in addition to the age tax credit and age exemptions, limits the exposure of older individuals to higher rates of USC and income tax. Budget 2016 also provides for the first increase in State pension in several years and the partial restoration of the Christmas bonus, both of which are of much higher value to recipients than the restoration of the telephone allowance. That was the basis on which the decision was taken. All of these measures will support the net incomes of our older population. Senator Tom Sheahan also referred to the eligibility criteria for the disabled drivers and passengers scheme, an issue about which I feel strongly. Although constrained by expenditure limits, the Minister has said he will consider and reflect on the Senator's contribution in this regard. I thank Senator Aideen Hayden for her welcome for the USC changes, the extension of the home renovation scheme and the inclusion of landlords in that incentive. Those measures are important if we are to have high-quality rental accommodation. The scheme has proved very successful and we hope it will continue to incentivise both home owners and landlords to employ legitimate contractors to carry out works on their homes and properties. I thank the Senator for her support for the knowledge development box, in particular the additional benefit for the Irish economy these measures will seek to incentivise. Senator Sean D. Barrett likewise welcomed the knowledge development box, particularly the focus it will bring to substance. That is the important thing. We want people to come to the country and we want our own companies to do their research and development and carry out their copyright and patenting here in Ireland. If we can ensure the knowledge development box is absolutely linked to substance, we can only benefit in terms of jobs and investment and also in terms of ensuring our economy is well positioned for a fast-changing and innovative economic environment. The Senator also raised concerns about the extension of the home renovation scheme. To clarify, this is not seen as a property relief but rather as very much a modest tax credit that is designed to encourage home owners and landlords to employ legitimate contractors to carry out works on their homes and properties. The incentive is designed to provide a boost to the tax-compliant construction sector. Next year, 2016, will be the final year of the incentive. Senator Feargal Quinn had wise words about not forgetting the shoe box. Every political party should probably have those words framed and placed in members' offices. Certainly, it is a mantra by which this Government is living. We do not accept that the increase in Exchequer returns in regard to corporation tax amounts to a gift to put in a shoe box. The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners advised the Minister by way of a letter dated 20 November that he expects all bar €300 million of those returns to be recurring. In addition, while we have made some supplementary budgetary decisions in regard to the health service, schools and roads, of the overwhelming amount of additional tax revenue that has been taken in this year - above €3 billion on profile - most of it will go to paying down debt. It is never attractive or exciting to talk about paying down debt but it does help to future-proof our economy from any external shocks that might arise. The Senator's point about online trading is very important. The local enterprise offices run an online trading voucher scheme which offers incentives to business to set up an online presence. I will reflect further on the concerns expressed by Senators Mary O'Brien and Feargal Quinn in respect of the employment and investment incentive. We can provide a briefing with officials on this element of the Bill in advance of Committee Stage if Senators would find it useful. Senator Kathryn Reilly entered the Oireachtas as its youngest Member and I as the youngest Member of the Dáil. While I admire the work she does, I do not accept several of the points she raised. First, the Fiscal Advisory Council did not describe the budget as lacking in prudence. Although it expressed a view on the supplementary expenditure for 2015, it did, in fact, describe the 2016 budget as prudent. While one overenthusiastic journalist put it to a member of the council during a radio interview that the council had criticised the budget, the council member clarified that it had both criticised and praised the budget. I become rather frustrated when the debate around economic and fiscal policy is reduced to a question of tax cuts versus public spending. In fact, if we go about it in the right way, we can do both. In budget 2015, for example, the Government reduced the two lower rates of USC, reduced the marginal rate of tax and increased the entry point into tax. In other words, we decreased rather than increased taxes and the result was that we took in more tax, which, in turn, enabled us to provide for extra spending in the important areas Senator Kathryn Reilly highlighted. The argument about tax cannot be dumbed down to a type of Robin Hood scenario. It is about more than redistribution. The latter is important, but it is also about economic stimulus. If we use tax as a policy to create economic growth, it can do much more in an economy than just redistribute. I fully agree that there are many challenges remaining to be addressed, including housing, health and so on. The Senator can list them off, as can I. She sees them in her constituency and I see them in mine. The question in the forthcoming election will be about who has the plan to fix them and I look forward to debating that question with her. We need to be careful when talking about progressive versus regressive budgets. For example, the ESRI described the 2010 budget as progressive even though it was the budget that introduced USC and cut all social welfare payments, including the blind pension and disability pension. I would not have described it as terribly progressive. We must be careful about the terms we use because they sometimes can suggest a level of social fairness that does not tally with the economic realities. The OECD has a very different outlook on our progressive tax system and some of the reports to which the Senator referred do not take into consideration the issue of social transfers. When they are taken into account, alongside the taxation system, we can see that Ireland has a very progressive system. The idea that most people who are working are not earning a decent salary does not tally with the fact that average earnings have increased somewhat this year. We have, moreover, increased the minimum wage. Ultimately, however, it is by reducing the tax burden that we will put more money in people's pockets. The Senator's party has a different view, which I respect. She is probably proud I do not agree with it. Policies like having a marginal tax rate that is 19% higher than the corresponding rate in Britain and Northern Ireland would clearly lead to highly mobile individuals and companies deciding to relocate to those jurisdictions. Having a capital gains tax on business that is 10% higher in this State than up the road in Belfast does not make much sense. Ironically, it amounts to partitionist economics. However, we will debate these issues more fully next year. I commend the Finance Bill to the House and look forward to discussing the provisions in more detail and hearing the recommendations of the Seanad on Committee Stage.

It was stated by the Minister and a number of Senators last night that 26 of the recommendations set out in the report of the working group that was initiated by the Minister of State were included and covered in the Bill.

If the Minister of State does not want to give us that clarification now, I do not mind going through all 170 recommendations individually and asking the Minister of State whether they are in. This is a matter of huge importance. We have been waiting for this Bill for quite a long time. The Minister of State has made strong statements on how he would like changes in the system to happen.

We are seeking clarification from the Minister of State regarding where we are at with the recommendations in the specific Bill before the House.

When we all spoke about this on Second Stage last night, I was one of the many Senators who highlighted the need to reform the direct provision procedure and deal with the implementation of all the working group's recommendations. I accept that they cannot all be implemented. I think most Senators will agree it is reasonable to say they cannot all be addressed in a single Bill. As everyone knows, this is a specific piece of what was originally a much bigger Bill. This legislation is designed to address the length of time applicants have been spending in the direct provision system. This issue is the subject of perhaps the most significant recommendation of the working group and is the most significant issue we all have with direct provision. As I said this morning, it is unfortunate that we are getting so much legislation from the Department of Justice and Equality so late in the day. As the Labour Party's justice spokesperson in this House, I am conscious, as are all the other justice spokespersons, that a great deal of work will have to be done within a very short space of time. The principle of this important Bill has been welcomed by all the non-governmental organisations. They are all pleased that for the first time, a reformed single procedure will be put in place to replace the unwieldy, cumbersome and deeply flawed process that is currently in place under the Refugee Act 1996, as amended. I think all of us should recognise that while we address the flaws in the Bill. This is a Committee Stage debate. I do not think it is appropriate to be having Second Stage speeches on direct provision more generally now. The Bill is designed to address the particular issue of the enormous delays currently being experienced by applicants for refugee status because of the length of time our flawed process takes.

Chapter 1 of the report provides an overview of the protection system and application trends. Does the Bill cover the recommendations made in that chapter only? Are these recommendations the only ones we are discussing? Does the Bill also cover the recommendations made in chapter 2, which sets out the views of people in the protection system? Does it have anything to do with the suggested improvements to the existing determination process as set out in chapter 3? Are we touching on the system of direct provision? Are we looking at chapter 4 which talks about suggested improvements to living conditions in direct provision accommodation centres? Chapter 5 of the report relates to suggested improvements to supports for people in the system.

People have said we should get rid of it. I wonder, therefore, why the Bill is not called the international protection (abolition of the direct provision system) Bill. Can I put that question to the Minister of State? Are we discussing-----

It deals with a large number of the recommendations set out in the report of the working group on direct provision. The system of direct provision has been a disaster for the families involved. It was a six-month solution that turned into a 12-year or 13-year solution. Nobody who is engaged in this process ever suggested the direct provision system be abolished. I never said it. Nobody I know who has a sense of what the issues are would suggest that it be abolished. If we abolish direct provision, many asylum seekers will end up homeless. That was the reality in 2000 when the system came into operation. There were reports of people seeking asylum in this country sleeping in parks. The system of direct provision was entered into to provide short-term accommodation for individuals who are in desperate need. I could stand over that system if the accommodation was of an excellent standard, if the system was family-centred, if the individuals within the system were treated with dignity and if applications were dealt with speedily, transparently and fairly. I cannot stand over it if the accommodation becomes somebody's long-term home. Is the Senator is suggesting we put everybody who seeks asylum in this country on the housing list or in homeless accommodation?That will be the direct result of the abolition of the direct provision system. The overarching problem with the system of direct provision is the length of stay. I have always said I can stand over a system in which people live with dignity and respect for a period of months in a centre that looks after them and cares for their needs. I cannot stand over a system which effectively becomes an institution in which families and children grow up. The length of stay is the issue. If we abolish direct provision we must prepare for 3,000 applicants a year on housing lists throughout the country and parks filled with people sleeping on benches. That is what we had in 2000 and I will not return to it. I will stand over a system of direct provision as a short-term solution which solves people's accommodation needs as they seek an application for protection in this country. If it is positively received they will have leave to remain and if it is not they must leave. This is the reality. It comes as no surprise to me that those who protest about the abolition of direct provision have slogans with no effect on real life. In fairness, Senators have worked very hard on this issue. There is no far-right lunatic conservative voice in this or the other Chamber demanding a tougher stance. We are all looking for a humanitarian response. Throwing out one-liners and hashtags to abolish direct provision is fine but it is not a solution. This is the solution. This is why I say we should pick through the individual amendments and work collectively to achieve something and not waste our time on grandstanding.

I would have thought from debates in the Seanad previously that a number of Senators on all sides of the House have called for the abolition of the system of direct provision. I am certainly one of them. It is now clear there is nothing in the Bill which will abolish direct provision and that it is here to stay as a system. Nothing in the Bill will change the conditions.

They relate mainly to the insertion of references to an international protection officer instead of an authorised officer. Authorised officer had been used initially as a standard formulation. The new insertions better reflect the functions to be carried out by such officers under the Bill. Not surprisingly, therefore, according to amendment No. 1 the old references to authorised officers or persons are deleted. As work is ongoing on the definition, which will be shaped by the functions under the finalised Bill, I will not move amendment No. 3 but instead will come back to it at a later point if it proves necessary. I will not move amendment No. 159 for similar reasons. Amendment No. 231 proposes the insertion of a reference to a valid search warrant. I wish to clarify the purpose of this section is to address a number of loopholes which emerged in the existing section 5 of the Immigration Act 1999 relating to the State's capacity to remove from the State persons who have no entitlement to be here. The existing provisions of section 5(1) of the 1999 Act, which I restate in the proposed replacement section, already permits the arrest of persons against whom a deportation order is enforced on various grounds. The proposed text of the new section 5(11) of the 1999 Act permits entry to a dwelling for the purpose of making the arrest. The provision follows very closely the term of section 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999. That section also permits entry to a premises without a warrant. In both cases there are safeguards in that the consent of the occupier will be required, save where the person to be arrested normally resides there or the immigration officer or member of An Garda Síochána believes on reasonable grounds that the person is within the dwelling. Clearly, the provision does not permit speculative entry without consent. It should also, therefore, be borne in mind that if a person leaves the State when he or she is supposed to this situation does not arise.

It is unfortunate we must do so and that it was not published with references to the international protection officer. Most colleagues would agree that international protection officer appears to be a better term. I have no difficulty with the substance of the amendments, it is just the timing.

I agree with Senator Ivana Bacik. Ministers and their civil servants should take note that this is an appalling way to deal with legislation which is only a few weeks old. It is very difficult to follow. I was not expecting amendment No. 231 to be grouped here because it is not on the list of groupings. The page is different to the screen. Can we rely on the sheet we have been given on the grouping of amendments? It is nice to be prepared as amendments come up. Someone at senior Government level should address this issue. They may be called technical amendments, but many of them are substantial and it seems like a crazy way to do things. It is all being rushed now because the Houses of the Oireachtas and certainly the Dáil will probably not sit after Christmas and Ministers are keen for their legacies.

In fairness, the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill was in preparation for a considerable period and much work had been done in this area. It is very disconcerting to receive a Bill and have so many amendments tabled by the Government within a couple of days of receiving it. It strikes those with whom I have been discussing the Bill, particularly in the NGO sector, that it is very much a half-baked Bill which is being rushed at the last minute to push it through.I want to register our major concerns about the way this is being pushed through and the fact that the debate will be guillotined on Monday.

I support the renaming of the authorised officer as an international protection officer. While it could be argued that we are getting into semantics, it sends out an important message. I am concerned that amendment No. 3 is not being moved because it contains the definition of an international protection officer. Perhaps the Minister of State might advise us on that because if Report Stage is taken on Monday we will need to know what is being put in its place. I have tabled two amendments, but they refer to an authorised officer. What terminology should be used? I do not want to table amendments which are then out of order with the Bill because the same language is not being used. Perhaps the Minister of State might clarify why it is not being moved.

Where an organisation is appointed as a representative, it shall designate a person responsible for carrying out the duties of representative in respect of the unaccompanied minor, in accordance with this Directive;”.I am stepping in at short notice for the Leas-Chathaoirleach, who is obviously indisposed with regard to making the arguments because he has to be neutral, and I am delighted to do so. There is no such thing in Standing Orders as technical amendments. The Bill has to be read very carefully, and that can be very difficult to do when things are rushed at the last minute. Senators and the Government, in particular, have an important role in making sure things are done right. The worry is that rushed legislation becomes bad law. The amendment comes from the work of the Irish Refugee Council which recommended that a new provision be inserted into the Bill for the appointment of an independent representative or guardian to act in the best interests of a child in line with EU and international obligations under section 2 of the Bill. Representatives should be free of potential conflicts of interest. The Irish Refugee Council said Ireland could adopt the definition of representative under Article 2(n) of the asylum procedures directive. Amendment No. 7 is also in the name of the Leas-Chathaoirleach. Although section 14 goes some way towards defining an unaccompanied minor, there still seems to be a lack of clarity as to how a determination is made as to whether someone is taking responsibility for the care and protection of the child concerned. The amendment, which I understand has also been drafted by the Irish Refugee Council, will bring the Bill more in line with the Separated Children in Europe programme and the UNHCR definition of separated children. The definition was also recommended by the Irish Human Rights Commission as part of its observations on the 2008 Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill. I will discuss the other amendments at a later stage. They are not all Fianna Fáil amendments.
#TrevorOClochartaigh	unknown-#TrevorOClochartaigh-party	unknown-#TrevorOClochartaigh-dob	unknown-#TrevorOClochartaigh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-03 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	211	I concur. I am speaking about amendment No. 8, which states: " "separated child" means a child under the age of 18 years who is outside his or her country of nationality or, if a stateless person, outside his or her country of habitual residence and who is separated from both parents, or from his or her previous legal or customary caregiver". Although section 14 goes some way towards defining an unaccompanied minor, there is still a lack of clarity, as has been said, on how a determination is made as to whether someone is taking responsibility for the care and protection of a child. This is particularly concerning in light of a potential situation in which a child has been trafficked. The proposed amendment would bring the Bill more in line with the Separated Children in Europe programme and the UNHCR definition of separated children. This definition was also recommended, as Senator Thomas Byrne said, by the Irish Human Rights Commission as part of its observations on the 2008 version of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, CRC, and the UNHCR also define separated children and unaccompanied minors in their guidelines. I would also like to speak on amendment No. 19, which states: "In page 18, line 8, to delete “that” and substitute “or when a person self-identifies that they are”." Given the important ramifications, if a person is determined to be an adult it is imperative that this decision is reached in a cautious manner and based on the guidance of other actors, including the Child and Family Agency, as opposed to on the basis of one officer's subjective opinion. When a person presents as a child, it is imperative that he or she is treated as such. This also reflects the principle of the child's right to be heard under Article 12 of the CRC. In cases of doubt the person should be treated as being aged under 18 years of age until such time as there is sufficient evidence to the contrary. Amendment No. 20 seeks to insert the phrase "a parent or legal or customary caregiver". The rationale is that, as it stands, there is a lack of clarity in the Bill about whether a minor is deemed accompanied or unaccompanied. In law and international best practice, a child is either accompanied by a parent or guardian or is an unaccompanied or separated child. Sections 14 and 15 of the Bill make reference to a responsible adult.The term is not defined and does not accord with Irish law unlike the term "guardian". This responsible adult has extensive powers, enabling him or her to make an application for international protection on behalf of a potentially unaccompanied or separated child under section 15, including the power to consent to a medical examination of the child without that person's relationship to the child ever having been established. The adult could be a friend, brother, sister or, equally, the child's trafficker. That covers amendments Nos. 19 and 20. We are suggesting amendment No. 27 with a similar rationale. Amendment No. 136 would delete the word "of" and insert the phrase "and competency to take into account". The examination of a separated child's asylum claim requires not only expertise in children's rights but also child protection needs in the context of refugee status and subsidiary protection. Children may often present with different protection needs from adults and, therefore, such cases require particular expertise and skill to identify correctly any persecution or serious harm the child may fear or face if returned to the country of origin. This amendment serves to clarify the knowledge required by authorised officers who conduct interviews with separated children. The new subsection would also guarantee that children would be able to be heard in a safe environment during their personal interview and that the interview would be conducted in a child-friendly manner. The other two suggestions, amendments Nos. 138 and 142, follow a similar rationale.

It requires that the interview be conducted in a child-appropriate manner and that the officer conducting the interview should have expertise in communicating with children to ensure the child's voice is heard and considered in line with his age, maturity and capacity. The amendment speaks for itself. Is the Minister of State going to support it?

The relevant term does not need to be defined. It is not a term used in the text of the Bill. All children who arrive in the State are protected by the provisions of the Bill and the best interests of the child are paramount. Amendment No. 8 is next. The Bill reflects the EU directive in respect of where a stateless person is not defined and therefore the amendment is not being accepted. I will not accept amendment No. 19. The applicant will be asked his or her date of birth as part of his or her initial interview. That is how the situation will be dealt with. Amendment No. 20 is next in the grouping. My view and the view of the Department is not to accept the amendment. We are concerned that the suggested amendment is too narrow. A child may be accompanied by a responsible person. That is not covered in the suggested amended text. Amendment No. 26 would replace “information” and substitute “information, including legal advice” as the basis on which the Child and Family Agency shall arrange for the appointment of an employee or other person to make an application for international protection on behalf of a child in respect of whom he or she is providing care and protection. This reflects the reality that legal advice may be relevant in the operation of the subsection by the agency in respect of an individual child. Amendment No. 27 is next in the group. Is that correct?

Perhaps the Minister of State might explain what he means by not accepting the amendments. The issue here is about unaccompanied minors coming in, the competency of people to interview them and having the proper training in place. I ask him to talk us through the procedure envisaged by the Department in that scenario in order that we are all clear as to how things will change under this new protection regime.

I was very heartened to hear the Minister speak about this last night in her speech and in her response where she pointed out how much the practice has improved and how much better it is now. As colleagues will recall, at one point unaccompanied minors were housed in hostels where they were extremely vulnerable to being trafficked or exploited. There were real concerns about child protection issues. As colleagues are aware and as the Minister reminded us last night, much better practice is now in place through ensuring unaccompanied minors are now accommodated in foster homes, which is very welcome. I appreciate the sentiment behind the amendments. As the Minister of State said, all of us seek to ensure we have adequate humanitarian protections in place, particularly for children and child applicants. I am very encouraged by the explicit wording in section 35 which provides that the authorised officer, to be renamed the international protection officer after Committee Stage, shall take the best interests of the child as a primary consideration. By having those words right at the start of the section it is clear that all the other provisions of the section must be read in light of that consideration. That is the primary consideration and it is fairly clear that the Child and Family Agency will appoint a person who will then be given the opportunity to inform the child about the meaning and consequences of the interview and so on. A number of practical points are set out as to what will be done, but they all must be done in the light of the best interests of the child as the primary consideration. That covers a great deal of the child protection issues we are all very concerned about.

Therefore, individual amendments to underline that fact are not necessary. The Bill does that in its entire form.

Concerns have been raised with us that the Bill makes no provisions for the training, qualification and skills of personnel engaged in the protection procedure. Although section 62 empowers the chairperson to convene a meeting to make provision for training programmes, there does not seem to be any equivalent provision relating to training requirements for personnel involved in the examination of international protection claims in the first instance. Limited reference is made to the specific knowledge of authorised officers examining unaccompanied children, but no substantive provision is included in the Bill for the comprehensive qualifications and training of personnel involved in all aspects of the protection procedure. As we have mentioned previously it is essential that the authorised officers, the border officials, gardaí and other personnel who come into contact with persons seeking international protection have those necessary competencies, skills, knowledge, aptitude and training for their respective roles. There is a concern that these amendments are necessary which is why we tabled them.

Clearly, it must be read in the context of the other relevant provisions. Section 34 applies to the personal interview and section 34(7) refers to an applicant who has not attained the age of 18. Section 14 refers to unaccompanied minors seeking international protection. In section 14(2) it is very important that after it appears that a person has not reached the age of 18 and is not accompanied by an adult who is taking responsibility for him or her, it shall be presumed that the person is a child, meaning that all the necessary protections are then put in place. Under section 15 it is clear that the Child and Family Agency will then assume responsibility. While all of us absolutely agree with Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh's concern about the need to ensure adequate training and that the person appointed is an appropriate person, I believe that is provided for already because clearly a person could not be appointed by the Child and Family Agency who does not fulfil those criteria. I do not believe it is necessary to insert the extra detail for which the Senator is looking.

I have spoken to representatives of some of the migrants' rights bodies, including the one operating in Limerick, Doras Luimní. They are concerned that the Bill represents a missed opportunity to bring Ireland in line with a common European asylum system.

I note that the Irish Refugee Council, IRC, in particular has recommended that a definition of statelessness be included in the Bill. Under section 2, Ireland must, as a signatory to the 1954 UN Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons, uphold its commitments in this regard. This would also require establishing a procedure to identify stateless applicants. The IRC supports the Immigrant Council of Ireland's recommendations with respect to statelessness which it made under the general scheme of the International Protection Bill. Guidance as to the content of a definition of statelessness could be taken from Article 1 of the 1954 UN Convention which states, "For the purpose of this Convention, the term 'stateless person' means a person who is not considered as a national by any State under the operation of its law". I would like the Minister of State to clarify the position of children who have been born in direct provision centres. Under a previous Government there was a change to the constitutional rights of certain children who were born to non-nationals here which rendered them stateless. Will the Minister of State also outline whether the matter will be addressed in the context of the Bill? We have discussed the rights of the child. We have a constitutional amendment which says that all children are to be treated equally, but Ireland does not treat children in an equal manner, particularly if we render them stateless which has ramifications on very practical issues such as children in direct provision being eligible for child benefit and so on. Statelessness is an important issue. Perhaps the Minister of State might elucidate for us where the Department stands on the issue and how the Bill will rectify some of thdse issues.
#IvanaBacik	unknown-#IvanaBacik-party	unknown-#IvanaBacik-dob	unknown-#IvanaBacik-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-03 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	303	I raised the issue of statelessness previously and stressed that we must ensure adequate procedures are in place for the identification of stateless applicants as well as some means to clarify their status. It is a major issue on which many of the NGOs working in this area have been active. I know Migrants Rights Centre Ireland has done some work on the matter. I agree in principle with Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh. As the IRC and the Immigrant Council of Ireland have said, there needs to be a procedure in place, perhaps underpinned by statute, to identify stateless applicants. I am not sure this Bill is the appropriate place to do so. As we have said and as the Minister of State said earlier, this Bill specifically addresses one aspect of the much larger immigration law reform that is required. It was, as we know, at an advanced stage of preparation by the previous Government and then ultimately fell because there was such complexity surrounding some of the issues. The Bill very much deals with one aspect which, as we have said, is the need to establish a single and unified procedure for assessing protection applications. In particular, the Bill will deal with delay. We have all spoken about the fact that so many people have languished for so long in the system of direct provision. The issue of statelessness is one on which we need a longer and considered debate. We need to see some procedure put in place to identify stateless applicants and to regularise their status.
#AodhanORiordan	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-party	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-dob	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-03 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	304	I am minded that many of these amendments are focused on the status of children. I am not in a position to accept the amendment because the Bill reflects the EU directive where a stateless person is not defined. However, I concur with many of the sentiments that Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh has outlined. The entire composition of the working group that was established to investigate and report back on conditions and the entire nature of direct provision has the rights of children and child welfare at its very heart. In fact, the composition of NGOs and individuals who took part in the working group was central. I will comment on one of the issues that has been outlined by the Senator already, when he spoke about welfare payments that are made to children in direct provision. It is my understanding that the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Justice and Equality are making arrangements to work proactively, in a very short space of time, to ensure the recommendations made in the working group's report on those payments are followed through in very short order. I can appreciate where he is coming from. The idea that a child in the protection system would live in a direct provision centre for years on end is not something we can stand over, and that is the point of this Bill, although there has been criticism of it today.The point is that this issue has been kicked around in these Houses for 12 years or more. A section of the wider Bill has been removed in order to deal with the protection issue.  Senators should be aware that the number of new asylum applications in Ireland is rising again. Applications which numbered in the hundreds in recent years are now in the thousands as a result of the biggest movement of people since the Second World War. The Bill is seeking to change, reform and fix a broken system. The aim is to ensure anyone who seeks protection in this country is dealt with in a speedy and humane fashion. That is the intention of the Bill and children are at the heart of that intention. I concur with the Senator on one point in the context of the referendum that was held in 2004. My party and the Senator's party stood in opposition to that move at the time but the provision is enshrined in the Constitution now and that is the reality of the situation. At that time, the Senator may recall, some of the sentiments expressed were shocking. I remember an Irish-African family were reportedly booed in a polling station when they went to cast their vote. Some of what was said during that referendum campaign, at the height of the boom, was remarkable. It was an unfortunate move on the part of the then Government but in terms of asylum and immigration policy and a collective will to reform this area, no political party in these Houses is standing on an anti-immigration, far-right platform. It is to the credit of this democracy that we do not have the types of debates that are happening in other parts of Europe. We should try to hold onto that and build on it because we cannot be complacent in that regard. These are my comments on the amendment but my commitment to the Senator, in terms of the payments, is that there will be clarity on that matter from the Department of Social Protection very soon.
#TrevorOClochartaigh	unknown-#TrevorOClochartaigh-party	unknown-#TrevorOClochartaigh-dob	unknown-#TrevorOClochartaigh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-03 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	305	I welcome that clarification because senior officials from the Department of Social Protection attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions about two weeks ago and they had not been given the go-ahead from the Department of Justice and Equality on those payments at that stage. That would be welcome and it is high time it happened. I concur with the Minister of State's view on the referendum which took away citizenship from children who were not born here. That was a retrograde step. However, I must put it to the Minister of State that he is in the ministerial chair now. I take on board comments made by Senator Bacik that only certain matters can be dealt with in this legislation. While we all welcome the single protection procedure, we have been waiting for this legislation for 12 years. When is the statelessness issue going to be dealt with and how? Where is the legislation that will address it? Why not put it into this legislation to clear it up once and for all? It is both the place and the time to do it. Where do those children who are now living in direct provision accommodation, some of whom were born in that system but who do not belong to a state, stand under this legislation? What is being done, in the spirit of the work done by the working group, to give children in direct provision a sense of belonging to a country? What is being done to allow them to express their Irishness and to feel as Irish as any other child? How is that going to be dealt with? Surely the statelessness issue is one that must be dealt with in this Bill, as has been outlined by the organisations I mentioned.

However, the technical reality is that children in direct provision are currently in a legal lacuna, as no application for protection can be made on their behalf, but section 15(3) of the Bill addresses that issue.

They will be very disappointed if they are listening to this debate that nothing has been done on this issue. They are calling on us to try to push this type of amendment in order to rectify the situation. It is retrograde that the Government is not seeing fit to take this on board now. I am told by people who are living in direct provision accommodation that they have seen many reports and working groups and have heard many statements, but they are not seeing much change. They do not trust the Department of Justice and Equality to deliver on promises that are made in these Houses. Unless a provision is included in legislation, it never comes to pass. They have no faith in the Department and believe that unless something is inserted into legislation, it will not happen. With all due respect to the Minister of State, all of the good will in the world will not make it happen. Ministers will come and go, but the reality is that after 12 or 13 years of the direct provision system, there have been many promises but no change. This is yet another empty promise.

The number of asylum applications that have been processed and leave to remain permissions granted has grown by around 60% in that period of time. The recommendations of the report are being implemented. There have been approximately 80 deportation orders revoked since July. The direct provision working group report is being implemented. Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh asked for an outline of the number of recommendations being built on within the Bill and I can go through them now if the Senator wishes, although I know we do not have much time left and must deal with many amendments. My commitment to the Senator and this House is that the scandal of direct provision, in terms of the length of time people are living in those centres, will be addressed. The report of the direct provision working group is the only game in town. It is the only document that we are working off. That is the report and it is being implemented.  If the Senator visits the direct provision centres, he will meet families who are getting their papers and who have seen a change in the speed with which the Department operates. An additional €6 million was allocated in the budget to facilitate the recruitment of extra staff to carry out these duties and the statistics show that what we sought to achieve is being achieved. Those who have been more than five years in the direct provision system are having their applications worked on and processed faster. I am glad to see that the rates for people being granted leave to remain have greatly increased and deportation orders have been rescinded in the numbers that I have already outlined. People in direct provision centres know it is happening and I am glad to be part of the process. I am also glad that these Houses have stood up to the plate collectively, as a political entity, to make it happen and it is happening.

That would be very useful for us, particularly prior to our deliberations on the Bill on Monday next. My concern is that the legislation does very little to change the direct provision system as is. The Minister of State argued in his opening statement that the biggest issue is the length of time people are in the direct provision system, but I do not agree. The system itself is also a big problem. It is a privatised system of accommodation provision where families, sometimes four or five people, share a single room; where individuals who are strangers to each other are forced to share rooms; where children cannot be let out into public spaces such as corridors in hotels because of child protection issues; and where children cannot invite their friends from school over for parties and so forth. These are institutional issues and I know the Minister of State has raised them in the past. The system of direct provision itself is broken and that is why this Bill should provide for changes to that system. The Minister of State has talked the talk on reform and change but that should be in the Bill. This legislation deals with the protection element of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, but I have no faith that further legislation will be coming down the line any time soon.As such, I am very concerned for all those people who have been waiting for ten, 11 or 12 years to have their cases decided. Good luck to those who have been granted subsidiary protection, leave to remain or refugee status. However, there are many others stuck in a system that is causing harm while they are in it. This is not just about the length of time people are waiting but the system itself. We know abuses have happened in various direct provision centres. Now is the time - before the Government leaves office - to address these matters. If we do not do it now, I am afraid it never will be done.

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-03 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	315	I am pleased to speak to the House today on Second Stage of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2015. As Senators will be aware, the Bill concluded its passage through the Dáil yesterday unopposed. Health insurance in Ireland is based on a core principle of community rating and for many decades it has operated alongside our public health service. During this time it has grown and developed. Under community rating all policyholders are charged the same premium for a particular plan which is adjusted to reflect any loadings applicable under lifetime community rating, irrespective of gender, age or health status. This system of health insurance necessitates inter-generational solidarity, whereby younger and healthier people effectively subsidise older and less healthy people. The understanding is these younger people will themselves be subsidised by future generations when they reach old age or suffer ill-health. Risk equalisation is essential to the operation of a community-rated health insurance system. The purpose of the scheme and the purpose of this annual update is to ensure health insurance is affordable for older people and those with a chronic disease, not only for the young and healthy. The past 12 months have seen a number of changes in health insurance. Significantly, in July this year VHI Healthcare was regulated as an authorised company by the Central Bank of Ireland in line with the regulatory position of the three other health insurance companies. This is a major achievement by VHI. It is a vote of confidence in the health insurance sector and the improved Irish economy in which it operates. Encouraging more people to take out health insurance at a younger age helps to spread costs across all policyholders and ensures affordable premiums for all insured people. Health insurers require a steady influx of younger healthy people in order that they can continue to offer affordable health insurance to older and sicker people. Clearly, the economic downturn had a significant negative impact on the number and age profile of the insured population. The number of policyholders fell from a little under 2.3 million at the end of 2008 to a little over 2 million in 2014. In response to the decline, the Government introduced two important initiatives from May this year, lifetime community rating and young adult discounts. These measures work to secure the future feasibility of community rating and protect access to affordable health insurance. Without these necessary measures, there would be a continued deterioration in the age profile of the insured population. This would, in turn, contribute to claims inflation and higher insurance premiums. Under lifetime community rating, late-entry loadings apply for those aged 35 years and over who buy health insurance for the first time. This is applied at a rate of 2% per year. Since January, 74,000 people avoided loadings by taking out health insurance before the deadline of 1 May 2015. Young adult discounts are based on a sliding scale of maximum chargeable rates up to 26 years of age. This new approach helps to ensure the smooth phasing-in of full adult rates and eases the effect of dramatic price increases experienced when student rates no longer apply, effectively removing the big-step effect that had been in place. The vast majority of policies now held by people aged between 21 and 26 years offer young adult rates. These rates range from 51% of the full adult rate at 21 years of age to a 100% rate at age 26. These two measures aim to increase the number of younger people with health insurance as well as retaining those already with policies. I welcome the significant growth in the number of people with health insurance in the past 12 months. We have seen an increase in membership of 100,000. My objective is to keep health insurance affordable for as many people as possible. As a necessary support to community rating, I am committed to making the risk equalisation scheme as effective as possible in a way that promotes fair and open competition. The risk equalisation scheme has operated in Ireland since 1 January 2013. The scheme is funded by stamp duties payable by open market insurers based on the number of policies written. The money generated is used to pay risk equalisation credits to take account of the higher costs of insuring older and sicker people. Currently, the scheme provides credit based on age and gender, as well as a utilisation credit based on an overnight stay in hospital of €90. From 1 March, the credits payable in respect of age and gender for those aged over 65 years on policies written from that date will be increased. I propose to set credits for the 60 to 64 age group at zero as of 1 March 2016. It is not only old people who have high claims, so I remain committed to developing a refined health status measure in the risk equalisation scheme using data based on diagnosis related groups, DRGs. This will also be necessary for the move to activity based funding. This will require the collection and coding of all hospital activity data for public and private hospitals under the system overseen by the health care pricing office, HPO. Legal and structural changes will be required over time. The immediate priority for the pricing office is to provide the main technical support for implementation of the activity based funding in public hospitals.Next year, 2016, is the conversion year for this new funding system which will see hospital budgets translated into activity-based funding allocations for the first time. In the meantime, I want to improve the health status measure we have. In addition to allowing for the overnight credit of €90, I propose to expand the setting in which utilisation credits will be payable to include day case admissions. These will be paid at a lower rate of €30. This enhancement to the scheme will increase the support provided for less healthy people of all ages. Providing a utilisation credit reflects that 30% of hospital inpatient activity for insured members is now carried out on a day case basis. It will also incentivise clinically appropriate treatment on a day case basis, freeing up overnight accommodation for those who need it more or need it at all. Under the scheme, health insurers receive risk equalisation credits from the risk equalisation fund to compensate for the additional cost of insuring older and less healthy members. The credits are funded by stamp duty levies payable by open market insurers for each policy written. The stamp duty levies are collected by the Revenue Commissioners and transferred to the fund which is administered by the Health Insurance Authority, HIA. In previous years, it has been necessary to increase significantly the stamp duty on all policies to fund the rising costs of an older and less healthy population of insured people. Last year, to make health insurance more affordable, I took the decision to reduce the stamp duty rates for non-advanced products by €50 per adult and €20 per child to 60% of the rate for advanced products. At the same time, there was no increase to the rates for advanced products. I am pleased to confirm that the levy on the lower level products will be reduced again in 2016 to 50% of the rate for advanced products, down by €38 per adult to €202 and down by €13 per child to €67. There will be a slight increase of €4 per adult to €403 for advanced products and a reduction of €1 to €136 in the case of children. The decision to set credits at zero for those aged under 65 years was taken primarily on the basis that retention of credits for this age group would have led to an increase in stamp duty by approximately €34 for everyone holding health insurance. I believe the credits and levy rates proposed for 2016 strike a fair balance between the need to sustain community rating and the need to ensure younger people continue to avail of health insurance. The credits proposed by the Health Insurance Authority do not fully compensate for the cost of insuring older and less healthy people. The risk equalisation scheme benefits all consumers by encouraging insurers to compete on the basis of value for money, customer service and product design rather than competing on the basis of risk segmentation. This approach supports a fair and open competition, giving those who wish to avail of health insurance access to a range of affordable policies from which to choose regardless of their age or health status. I will now turn to the Bill before the House. Its main purpose is to specify the amount of premium to be paid from the risk equalisation fund in respect of age, gender and the level of cover from 1 March 2016 and to revise the stamp duty levy required to fund the risk equalisation credits for 2016. The Bill provides for consequential amendments to the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999. A technical amendment to the Health Insurance Acts is also included. I will now outline the specific sections of the Bill. Section 1
defines the principal Act as the Health Insurance Act 1994.  Section 2 amends section 6A(1) of the principal Act by the proposed amendment of three definitions. Regarding section 2(1)(a), the proposed amendment replaces the current definition of "hospital bed utilisation credit", HBUC, with a definition of "hospital utilisation credit". The scheme provides for a HBUC as a proxy for health status. Currently, health insurers receive a retrospective payment of €90 per night for an overnight stay in hospital by one of its members. The proposed amendment will expand this credit to include day case inpatient admissions. The HBUC payment will be replaced with a hospital utilisation credit. Under this credit insurers will receive a payment from the fund for day case inpatient admissions and for inpatient admissions on an overnight basis on all policies written on or after 1 March 2016. Section 2(1)(b) proposes a technical amendment to the definition of private hospital accommodation. The amendment reflects the enactment of section 55 of the Health Act 1970, as amended by the Health (Amendment) Act 2013, where private patients incur a hospital charge in respect of inpatient services provided in a public hospital. Section 2(1)(c) amends the definition of "relevant amount" to include day case inpatient admissions in the calculation of the hospital utilisation credit. Section 3 amends section 11C of the principal Act. It provides for 1 March 2016 as the effective date for revised risk equalisation credits to be payable from the risk equalisation fund. Section 4 amends Schedule 3 to the principal Act. It provides for the amounts payable from the risk equalisation fund for the hospital utilisation credit in respect of health insurance contracts renewed or effected from 1 March 2016. Schedule 3 will now contain two amounts, one for the provision of inpatient services on an overnight basis and one for the provision of inpatient services on a day case basis. Section 5 replaces Table 2 in Schedule 4 to the principal Act with effect from 1 March 2016. The applicable risk equalisation credits payable from the risk equalisation fund for certain classes of insured persons are revised. Section 6 amends section 125A of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999. It specifies the applicable stamp duty rates from 1 January to 29 February 2016 and from 1 March 2016 onwards. Section 7
provides for the Short Title, collective citation and construction of the Bill. The intention of the Bill is to ensure health insurance remains affordable for more people by ensuring that, irrespective of whether one is young or old, well or sick, or male or female, one pays the same for the same policy. On this basis, I commend the Bill to the House.

The Minister has given a reasonable explanation of what is intended by the Bill. The health insurance market could do with a major overhaul, but perhaps that is not the business of today. We are supporting the Bill. This type of legislation seems to arrive at this point every legislative year. The measures seem designed to support risk equalisation, sustain community rating, possibly sustain VHI and sustain the health insurance market in order that older citizens and those with illnesses can afford health insurance and will not be discriminated against in favour of younger people, as would happen in an open market. The Minister is making these changes. This is the first Bill in this area after the introduction of lifetime community rating. We sought this in the past. It was the first tangible sign that the Government was abandoning the model of universal health insurance. We spoke about this at the time. We welcome the moderate increase in the number of people with health insurance following the introduction of the age discounts and lifetime community rating in last year's legislation, but it is time that we examined this issue because there is significant consumer confusion in the health insurance market. People do not know what they are buying. The HIA's website does its best but, naïvely I believe, very much fails in providing the type of information consumers need because it is very complicated in itself to shop around and gain a knowledge of the add-ons, exclusions and requirements of particular policies. Considerable work must be done on this. I have suggested that we examine what US President Barack Obama has done. The United States has bronze, silver, gold and platinum policies in very generalised categories. We used to have that kind of system under VHI, with plan A and plan B, but there is now a ridiculous number of plans. We need to bring back some simplicity to the market and some regulations on what can be excluded in respect of policies at particular levels and what co-payments can be insisted upon. It comes as a shock to some people when they seek insurance to be told they owe a certain amount of money to get what they want in addition to what is provided. Some of these practices are quite outrageous and will come back to bite consumers in the coming years. That is a debate for a different day. It is one we should have in terms of making overall changes to and developing health policy. The members of Sinn Féin are not present. If they were, they would be giving out about half the country having private health insurance. However, the reality is that approximately half the population has health insurance. Many have paid for it for a considerable number of years and expect to benefit from it. They are entitled to a benefit from it, although not to the exclusion of people in need who cannot afford health insurance. They are entitled to the extra benefits they have paid for, particularly in terms of accommodation in hospitals. Consumers need to be protected and those who have contributed to the private health insurance market over the years must be recognised. They have made a huge contribution to the health service and it should not be forgotten. Their contribution should be protected, as should their consumer rights. We support the Bill.

It is legislation that must be introduced annually. The Bill makes proposals for 2016. It is welcome that we have risk equalisation in order that people will not be penalised as they get older.We have a huge and increasingly older population and it is important that they have access to health care and health care insurance which is affordable. Risk equalisation has done this. It is welcome that we have special provisions in respect of younger people who are new to the market and that they are not being penalised at an early stage. The 2% additional cost once a person goes over a certain age is also welcome. The structure in place is a good one and it is the reason there has been an increase of more than 100,000 new people in the private health insurance market. This is a welcome change from the downward trend in the past six to seven years and long may it continue. I thank the Minister for bringing forward the legislation. I do not think there will be any amendments tabled and it should be through the House in a short period of time.

The Bill is clear. I also support what Senator Thomas Byrne said on the explosion of different plans available and the opt-ins, opt-outs, add-ons and exclusions. People should know what they are purchasing. There may be an issue on the consumer side in respect of plain English and what exactly the consumer is getting. I have an experience from 15 years ago when I lived in Belgium where there was a much clearer sense of what plan a person could take and the options available. It was much more streamlined. Parents are getting health insurance because they are concerned for their children, but when they claim on it, they realise they are not covered for some of the everyday things for their children which they thought would be covered. That is a more general issue but I absolutely support the Bill.

It is good to see that it travelled unopposed through the other House and is likely to do so through this House also. I am not a great fan of health insurance at all but, in the absence of anything else, it is the best system we have at the moment. Senator Thomas Byrne is quite right in drawing our attention to the need to overhaul, to use his language, the entire health insurance system. The number of people who have discontinued health insurance in the recent recessionary years is approximately 300,000 but the number is gradually increasing again. The way we use language in the House is funny. Senator Thomas Byrne said it was an insignificant number but 100,000 people in a year, which represents approximately 5%, is a very significant number. That is an example of the emphasis that can be placed on language. Is the young adult discount achieving the effect the Minister hoped it would and has it been as successful as he hoped? I do not have very much else to say about the Bill except to welcome and support it. I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments.
#SeanDBarrett	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-03 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	320	I welcome the Minister. I speak as a total unbeliever in risk equalisation payments. I believe in open enrolment community rating and lifetime cover. No one was ever refused cover on any basis by the new competing insurance companies that came into the market after the turn of the millennium. The success of BUPA, in particular, was that it could insure both young and old people for a lower price than VHI. I have always believed the legislation was designed to benefit VHI as it was the operator longest in the market. In a sense, we are going through what is an annual charade, the object of which was to keep VHI solvent. There was a massive increase, which should be documented officially, in premiums and that drove the 300,000 people out of the market. To say the competing insurance companies were not interested in old people and would not insure them was a myth invented in the VHI HQ beside the Abbey Theatre. It turns out VHI was similarly theatrical and managed to persuade successive Ministers that this was the way to proceed. I want a system which will insure both old and young people cheaper. I left VHI to join one of the newer companies. I am supposed to be a beneficiary under the Bill, but I see it entirely as being for the benefit of VHI. There were plenty of good products offered by the other companies but this constrains their ability to compete. VHI is by far the biggest beneficiary of this particular payout. The bureaucracy to run the Health Insurance Authority costs €1.4 million a year. All that was required under the old system was for old people, who VHI said were locked into its policies, to shop around and avail of the available bargains. That is what competition does. It was also necessary to have competition among insurance companies to extract a lot of the high costs out of the public health system such as the cost of hospitals and medication. We lost a competitive edge by introducing the measure. It is interesting that a lot of young people got out because they did not feel like subsidising an insurance company, which had mostly old people. Those old people had been with VHI since the 1950s anyway, so presumably they had paid in advance. I do not wish to cause any dissent among learned friends but I do not believe in risk equalisation payments and that is what is in the Bill. I will not propose any amendments. I agree with the harmony proposed by Senator Colm Burke but, at the same time, it could have been done differently. It was wrong to have the Department of Health own a health insurance company and regulate the market under which the other health insurance companies compete. This Bill is the result. As always, I wish the Minister well in his onerous task. An unfortunate aspect of what was happening is that we have moved further away from universal health care. At one stage, 55% of the population had health insurance and 30% had medical cards. We have lost people out of the health insurance sector. The Minister was right to postpone universal health insurance until we had thought it out properly. We were closer to it seven or eight years ago than we are now. I do not know if anyone else in the Oireachtas has welcomed his decision to postpone the introduction of universal health insurance. I have heard a lot of criticism of the decision but in the circumstances the Minister was correct.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-12-03 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	321	I thank Senators for their contributions and welcome their broad support for the Bill. To pick up on some of the points mentioned, currently there are approximately 400 different plans available. There is no doubt it causes confusion for people and the matter is being examined. However, we have to take competition law into account. Competition law and principles allow people to have different types of products and we have to bear that in mind. When I have met insurers about it, they argue they use all these different plans to encourage new people to take up health insurance and say that if we were to reduce the number of plans significantly, while it might reduce confusion, it may increase premiums and that would be counter-productive. Just because they say it does not mean it is so, but it is one of the things they say and it needs to be considered. The minimum benefits to be provided in every policy are provided for in legislation. They could be changed in the future, potentially, and could be amended to include more benefits, but that is not in the pipeline. The young adult discount does seem to be working. The number of people who drop health insurance when they move, if one likes, from their parents' account to their own account seems to be lower. Some argue we should increase the age limit to 30 years of age. Currently it applies to those under 26 years of age. That could be done, but we decided against it last year. It is a matter for future review and a review is provided for in the legislation.  In respect of Senator Sean D. Barrett's comments, I do not think it is a myth that insurers would like to avoid older customers if they could. I see the way health insurance is marketed and we see the advertisements on television. They are very much about young people, young families and people getting sports injuries. I have yet to see a television advertisement from any insurer about an older person who had a fall. They are all about someone who plays hockey and gets a sports injury or a young mother with her young family. I do not think that is a coincidence.If I see advertisements over the winter from insurers about old people who have had a fall on snow or ice, I might change my mind but I do not expect to see that. As for where matters stand, it is correct that the number of people with insurance fell but it now is up to a rate of approximately 45% or 46%. However, the number of people with medical cards has risen dramatically. That is a perhaps unnoticed development in recent years, largely because incomes have fallen so much and because so many people lost their jobs. However, the Government found more resources to increase the number of people with medical cards, which at one point was down to approximately 28% of the population but now is quite close to 40% which is often forgotten. While those numbers are falling again on foot of the recovering economy, that point is forgotten. If one adds together those two things, approximately 85% of the population has either health insurance or a medical card but of course it is not as simple as that because there are people who have both a medical card and health insurance and then many who have neither. However, that is the current position and again, I thank Senators for their support in the easy passage of the Bill.
