Ní mór dúinn meas agus ómós a thaispeáint do na focail uaithi, focail a chur in iúl nach raibh moladh á lorg aici ná gealltanais bhréaga. Is é an rud a bhí ag teastáil uaithi ná gníomh de réir ár mbriathar. Today we remember Vicky Phelan, who has passed away, and all the other women who have lost their lives as a result of the failures and the mistakes made in the cervical screening services.I am very conscious of the words of Vicky Phelan and what she sought from the system. I know leaders are anxious to say a few words and I will leave it to the leaders to do that. I am mindful of her words that she was not seeking praise, thanks or false promises. What she was seeking was action. Fágfaidh mé ansin é agus ligfidh mé suas le nóiméad do na ceannairí. Iarraim ar gach duine na focail sin a choinneáil os a gcomhair. I ask speakers to keep those words in mind.

Vicky Phelan did not want eulogy or tribute. She did not want us making speeches about her in this House. It was a mark of the woman that even though her life, her illness and, ultimately, her passing was the catalyst for so much, she wanted action and she did not want it to be about her alone. She made an extraordinary impact on her country and contributed to public life and debate. She was committed to righting the wrongs that had such a devastating impact on her and her family's lives. It is right and proper that we mark and mourn her passing. On behalf of the Government, I extend my deepest sympathies to her husband, Jim; her children, Amelia and Darragh; her parents, John and Gaby; her sister and brothers; and her entire circle of family and friends. At a personal level, I am deeply saddened at Vicky's passing. She was a woman of extraordinary bravery, integrity and generosity of spirit. I am confident very few people would have been able or would be able to summon the poise, determination, courage and compassion she showed in her battle not just with cancer but also with the system that failed her and so many others so dismally. In her decision to reject the demand for confidentiality in her court settlement, she opened the door to truth for hundreds of other women, empowered a generation of people to demand better and forced a fundamental re-evaluation of the nation's crucially important CervicalCheck programme. Her passion for the principle of full public disclosure in the area of public health has ensured the principle is front and centre as we progress new patient safety legislation, and we need to bring that to a conclusion before the end of the year. Her remarkable advocacy for women has shifted the culture and has made a real and positive difference. D'fhulaing sí go pearsanta ach bhí sí i gcónaí ag lorg seirbhísí agus cearta níos fearr do mhná na tíre seo. Rinne sí obair den scoth agus gaisce ar son chearta na mban in Éirinn. Bhí sí cróga misniúil agus labhair sí amach ar son an chirt i gcónaí. Ba bhean neamheaglach láidir í a lorg cothrom na Féinne do mhná na hÉireann. Leaba i measc na naomh go raibh aici.

I met Vicky on a number of occasions and she was one of the most impressive people I have ever met. There was something about her that was hard to define. She is an example to us all, a woman of limitless strength, courage and compassion. Without Vicky, the CervicalCheck non-disclosure debacle would never have come to light. Thanks to her advocacy, we can start to build a better culture in our health service, one that treats patients with respect, which is never paternalistic, gives them all of the information about them that is available and always tells the truth. In one of her most powerful statements, she demanded action, change and accountability. She did see some of that come to fruition in her lifetime through the implementation of the Scally report. The action taken means a new and more accurate way to examine the smear test is now in place and the vaccine has been extended to boys. In respect of change, funding has been allocated for a new laboratory in the Coombe to reduce the need for outsourcing. In respect of accountability, the Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill 2019, which is working its way through these Houses, requires mandatory open disclosure and restorative meetings between women and their consultants. I know that work must continue and it is far from complete. As the Taoiseach said, we must enact the patient safety Bill as soon as possible.Cervical cancer is a terrible disease, but it is a disease we can eradicate in our lifetime and we should strive to do so. Before I finish, I restate the apology I made on behalf of all of us, as Taoiseach, to the women and their loved ones who were hurt by the failures in how cervical screening operated in Ireland. When preparing for that apology, I met many of the families whose lives were turned upside down. I know that for those who campaigned and travelled this journey with Vicky, particularly those in the 221+ patient support group, her loss will be more painfully felt than we can ever imagine. I know they will continue to stand up for the women of Ireland and we must continue to listen.

The mother of two's refusal to sign a confidentiality clause and her court action over misread smear tests ultimately exposed what was a system failure of CervicalCheck. Vicky's battle took an enormous personal toll, but that was borne with steadfast and unwavering commitment to the truth. In finding that truth, Vicky has done a great service to all women in this country. I do not think it is yet possible to grasp fully the scale of her contribution to our society. I am deeply conscious Vicky's wish of the political leaders was not for tributes, but for action, change and accountability. Women should never feel voiceless or invisible. The burden should not have fallen on Vicky to stand up for women and for what is right. We must change. With poise and through her determination and grit, Vicky taught us that. I cannot adequately express my admiration for Vicky's courage, resilience and generosity of spirit. I have heard her friends say she met every challenge with grace and good humour. We are all grieving an enormous loss today. To Vicky's husband, Jim, and to her beloved children, Amelia and Darragh, I say I cannot begin to imagine the pain and heartbreak they are feeling. I want to say "Thank you" to Vicky and "Thank you" to every person who supported her in her courageous battle to seek the truth for women in Ireland. I will remember and I hope others will remember Vicky's own words from her autobiography:There will be others who will continue this fight without me when I'm gone, because we are all in this together at the end of the day. We all come from that same place, from a mother's womb. This is everybody's story. A Vicky, tá muidne, mná na hÉireann, thar a bheith buíoch díot. Labhair tú amach ar ár son uilig, ar son na máithreacha, na hiníonacha, na seanmháithreacha, na gariníonacha, na deirfiúracha, na deirfiúracha chéile, na neachtanna agus na cairde. Fágann tú léas solais i do dhiaidh. Mhúscail do mhisneach misneach ionann. Go ndéana Dia a mhaith ort.

That's what breaks my heart." Yesterday, at just past midnight, Vicky's battle with terminal cervical cancer ended, her young life ended, her life stolen by a vicious disease, her life stolen by profound failures of the State, of Government and of the HSE. Enormous and endless tributes flow now for this remarkable, irreplaceable woman. She was a study in resilience, determination and grace under pressure. No words of mine will fully capture the depth of her courage or of her love.No words will fully capture the scale of devastation at her loss for Jim, Amelia, Darragh, Gaby, John and all those who loved her dearly. Ireland has lost one of its brightest stars in the firmament of noble women Ireland. Ireland must not forget. Ireland must change. Safe, respectful healthcare for mná na hÉireann was Vicky's battle cry. Let it echo from the rooftops. The women of Ireland thank you, Vicky. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a h-anam.

Our condolences also go to all of the 221+ group, Lorraine Walsh, Stephen Teap and to many others, to Vicky's friends and to our own colleague, Deputy Kelly, who was very close friend of Vicky's. Vicky bravely raised her voice. She decided to fight a system that had failed her. As we all know and as is acknowledged today, her activism prompted such a chain reaction that changed Irish society and that changed things for the better for so many women particularly in our health system. Today I am remembering, as we all are, many of those other activists who also fought for women's health alongside Vicky and who have sadly died, namely, Ruth Morrissey, Emma Mhic Mhathúna, Lynsey Bennett and Laura Brennan. Vicky’s contribution, like theirs, cannot be understated. Since Vicky spoke up in 2018, the number of women going for screening in Ireland has continued to increase. Free smear tests have become available in the wake of the controversy but of course more is needed. The reforms that Vicky and others prompted must continue, the Scally report must be implemented in full and we must see the actions that Vicky so eloquently called for being implemented in full. She was an inspiration to us all, but it is our responsibility to ensure that her legacy does more than just inspire us and that it feeds further into more actions that need to be taken. As she put it herself:I don't want your tributes. I don't want your aide de camp at my funeral. I don't want your accolades or your broken promises. I want action.Rest in peace, Vicky.

The women of Ireland in particular are grieving her death because she was their champion. She was central to uncovering the CervicalCheck failures. Without her courageous decision to go public about what had happened to her, at great personal cost, the likelihood is that none of us would have discovered the serious issues with the screening programme that were subsequently uncovered. Vicky was a tireless advocate, not just for herself but for everyone who had been failed by the health service. She was not willing to accept the status quo or the condescending paternalism that women too often experience in the health service when she knew that reform was possible. Even though it was really difficult, she persevered with her campaign until the very end, determined that the promised reform would be implemented. The courage she showed throughout her campaigning for more transparency and accountability in the health service while battling a terminal illness was truly awe-inspiring. Today, my thoughts and the thoughts of all of my colleagues in the Social Democrats are with Vicky’s husband, her children, her extended family, her many friends and her colleagues in the 221+ group.

Her family and close friends knew that this day would come. Vicky herself knew, deep down, that this day would come. We took Vicky into our collective hearts and now all our hearts are broken. I got to know Vicky a number of years ago in relation to the issue around assisted dying and she was vocal about that issue. She said to us that no matter what the circumstances, you need to pledge to keep supporting and campaigning for the issue around assisted dying.Her other wish was that the cervical screening programme not be outsourced and that it be brought home. That wish needs to be honoured. We owe it to her memory and her family. Our condolences go to Jim, Darragh and Amelia.

I want action. I want change.As we know, the Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill was initiated in the Dáil on 5 December 2019 to provide for mandatory open disclosure, placing a legal obligation on doctors to explain a mistake to a patient impacted by that mistake. The Bill's publication was a complete turnaround from the statement in January 2016 issued by the Department of Health to the effect that it would be counterproductive to enshrine open disclosure to patients in legislation. Open disclosure needs to be embedded in legislation to bring about a complete culture change in our medical profession. The cervical cancer scandal has reinforced the fundamental need for laws of this nature. The Bill was referred to a committee on 12 December 2019, seven days after its publication, and its Final Stages are currently before Dáil Éireann. The late Vicky Phelan said, "I want action." I would ask as a matter of priority that this legislation be passed and enacted before the end of this year, answering Vicky's call, sadly posthumously. I wish to extend my sympathy and the sympathies of the members of the Regional Group to all the women and their families impacted by the cervical cancer scandal, to Vicky Phelan's family, her many friends and those whom she touched throughout her far-too-short life, but most especially to Jim, Amelia and Darragh.

We were devastated to learn of her passing at the young age of 48. Indeed, the whole country is now one way or another in mourning at the passing of this courageous, heroic and remarkable woman. Vicky Phelan refused to sell her soul for a settlement and she refused to remain silent. Vicky Phelan was not afraid to speak out and she fought hard for some support in fighting her illness and looking after her family, but when a requirement of confidentiality was presented to her, she refused point blank. I salute her for that. She was a woman who knew the difference between what was right and what was wrong. Vicky Phelan was the victim of failures of clinical governance, failures of leadership and management, as well as failures to tell the whole truth and to do so in a timely manner. This and previous Governments failed Vicky Phelan. The HSE, including its senior leadership, failed Vicky Phelan. This is just not good enough. The Government has failed to respect her wishes and requests. There has been nothing short of deceit and false reassurances, which is difficult to swallow. After the death of her fellow cervical cancer sufferer, the late Ruth Morrissey, Vicky Phelan wrote two years ago:I don't want your apologies. I don't want your tributes. I don't want your aide de camp at my funeral. I don't want your accolades or your broken promises. I want action. I want change. I want accountability.Is that too much to look for in this day and age, when we are pandering so much to what we are doing in this century? The change and accountability that she demanded must be delivered. Ministers and other Government politicians can no longer hope that their failure to act will quietly go away. Vicky Phelan's spirit was untameable and her loss is immeasurable.So many people have been inspired by her. She will never be forgotten. Her vision and her passion will never be forgotten.

Death always comes too soon, but at 48 and after suffering so many years of pain, both physical and mental, it was just heart-breaking for Vicky, for her husband Jim, for her children Amelia and Darragh, for her wider family, and her friends in the 221+ support group. Vicky will be remembered for her courage in refusing to walk away quietly when she knew that her stand would make a real difference in improving Ireland's cervical screening services. Vicky will be remembered for her brutal honesty regarding her illness. Her words opened the door for other women to speak up and speak out about how certain women's health issues have been hidden as if shameful, and neglected as if they were not important. Vicky will be remembered for her compassion for others and the many ways she reached out giving hope, for it was badly needed. Vicky was fully committed to all women who were using CervicalCheck, despite the fact that she had been failed in this regard. She also expressed her full support for the human papillomavirus, HPV, vaccine. She saw both of these services as essential to women's health. Vicky was a strong, warm, beautiful, and tenacious woman. We in this House have a duty to ensure her legacy of a quality cervical screening service and full transparency to patients is ensured. I thank Vicky and may she rest in peace.

Her two children, Amelia and Darragh have lost their beautiful mother so early in their lives. Our hearts go out to her husband Jim, to her heartbroken parents, Gaby and John, and to Vicky's family and friends who are devastated by her death. The nation mourns with them. Vicky Phelan was a force of nature. In pursuit of justice she was fearless and relentless. She was unstoppable. If it was not for Vicky's courage, the CervicalCheck scandal may never have been exposed. With inspiring dignity Vicky took on the State that had failed her so badly. It was a battle she should never have had to fight but fight it she did until her very last breath. Vicky endured her illness and she never backed down in campaigning for the women and girls of Ireland. Her legacy will live on. We owe her so much.  Vicky, as has been said, did not want fame or adulation; she wanted purposeful change. The best way to honour Vicky's memory is to complete the work she did. That means bringing the testing of screening samples back to Ireland. Testing continues to be outsourced to labs in the United States at the centre of the CervicalCheck scandal. Currently, 85% of CervicalCheck sample testing is outsourced abroad. The national cervical screening laboratory was due to open in September, yet the women of Ireland are still waiting. Completing the work also means delivering the long-promised legislation for open disclosure. The Scally review recommended a statutory duty of candour be established to ensure people are told the truth when something goes wrong in their healthcare. Yet, incredibly, the Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill published by the Government in 2019 would not cover disclosure of the incidents at the heart of the CervicalCheck scandal. We in Sinn Féin have proposed amendments to rectify this issue but the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, has for seven months failed to progress the legislation. Again, the women of Ireland have been left waiting. We must also see the reinstatement of the cancer audit review of screening, which was suspended four and a half years ago. It is the wish of Vicky’s family that these specific issues be raised today because she cared so passionately about this change. Everyone in the Dáil is committed to ensuring that we never again see the failures of the CervicalCheck scandal. We will have to work together to deliver the change that Vicky wanted to see. Is é an bealach is fearr chun ómós a thabhairt do chuimhne Vicky ná scagthástáil a thabhairt ar ais go hÉirinn agus reachtaíocht a chur i bhfeidhm i gcomhair nochta oscailte. We are all waiting for the national cervical screening laboratory to open. When will this happen? Will the Taoiseach ensure that on its opening, it has the capacity to test all cervical screens conducted in this State? When will the Minister for Health progress the open disclosure legislation? That legislation must be amended to ensure it covers the type of incidents at the centre of the CervicalCheck scandal. The law must provide for open disclosure. Vicky Phelan was very clear. She said:I want action. I want change. I want accountability.Let us get this done together for Vicky, for all the women we have lost and for those women who continue to suffer and fight for justice.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-15 00:00:00	Death of Vicky Phelan: Expressions of Sympathy	13	I thank the Deputy for raising the issue and for the manner in which she raised it. I agree wholeheartedly that it is extremely important that the work of Vicky Phelan is reflected in action in terms of legislation, in terms of the framework and architecture of the screening programme itself, insofar as it is located in Ireland, and in terms of the renewal of an audit of the screening programme. It is important to her family in particular that her advocacy continues to change things after her passing and that her legacy will be more effective and respectful treatment for the women who come after her. That is extremely important and is an issue we want to follow through on. On the CervicalCheck programme, the ultimate goal, supported by Vicky and many involved in the 221+ group, is population-based screening, the continuation of the cervical screening programme and participation by women in that programme. Population-based screening has ensured better survival rates regarding different cancer types.  I was involved in the roll-out of BreastCheck. We did it differently insofar as it was a much slower roll-out from one region of the country to the next and took much longer. The CervicalCheck screening programme has saved thousands of lives but, as we know through the work of Vicky Phelan and her decision to ensure there would be no confidentiality, there were significant flaws within the programme. The Government wants to eliminate and eradicate cervical cancer. That is the objective.We can achieve this through the HPV vaccination programme and an effective screening programme. The Minister recently announced the Laura Brennan HPV vaccination catch-up programme, which will be implemented by the HSE shortly. On Dr. Scally's recommendations, I am informed that actions on all 170 recommendations are near completion or have been completed. The Minister for Health has asked Dr. Scally to conduct a final progress review of implementation. The report in that regard is expected to be submitted to the Minister shortly. The new national cervical screening laboratory at the Coombe, which will provide enhanced capacity to meet the future needs of the national cervical screening programme will be the national base for training, education and research. The building works for the new lab were completed in October. It is expected to become operational by the end of the year. A workforce plan is in place. Recruitment for the new laboratory is an ongoing priority for the HSE, which is working with the faculty of pathology to build the required expertise. I understand that Dr. Cillian De Gascun was recently appointed as interim director of the national cervical screening laboratory. The new laboratory is designed to ultimately become CervicalCheck’s main provider of cervical screening laboratory services. The HSE is working flat out to see if that can be done before the end of the year. In respect of the legislation, my understanding is that there was agreement among all parties on Committee Stage that on Report Stage an agreed amendment in respect of full disclosure would be brought forward. There have been many different perspectives among health professionals for a long time although many would support the duty of candour and the spirit, idea and principle of candour in the context of full disclosure to patients. I have had discussions with the Minister and he has indicated that, working with the Office of the Attorney General, we will have that amendment prior to the end of the year. Working with all parties in the House, we can bring this to a conclusion.

All of us who avail of the service are well aware of its absolute value. Vicky’s ambition to bringing screening home can be achieved. It was a catastrophic error for the laboratory services not to be available and for screening not to be carried out in this jurisdiction. I want to put that on the record. Can the Taoiseach assure us that when the national laboratory opens - and he says he hopes this will happen by the end of the year - that it will not just be additional capacity but that we work for sufficient capacity that screening in its entirety can happen here in Ireland? On open disclosure legislation, can we just confirm today that we will get this done by the end of the year, namely, before we rise for Christmas? Can the Dáil agree that we will get this done rather than speculating or giving speculative target deadlines? Can we agree that we will work together for that happening? I asked the Taoiseach about the cancer audit review and its reinstatement. Will he say something on that matter?

It will take time before it will have sufficiency to offer full national coverage, although I would point out - and we have to be objective as best as we can - that Dr. Scally did not find, in respect of the particular lab, that there was a higher or lower incidence than elsewhere. Be that as it may, it is desirable that we would build up the expertise and education in Ireland and that, similar to BreastCheck, we would recruit the proper experts and personnel over time and have this as not only a national centre but also ensure that it will have the capacity to cover the entire programme. That is the objective. I already articulated that there should be an audit because audits inform best practice. They are part of the broader approach to ensuring that the programme is effective and is benchmarked against international peer review and international best practice and standards. I want the legislation concluded by the end of the year. We will work might and main to make sure that happens.

While battling terminal cancer, Vicky took a case to the High Court. She won her case and was offered a settlement if it remained confidential, as we know. It would have been easier for her had she acquiesced, but she refused to accept the culture of secrecy that too often accompanies scandals in Irish public life. This was not in her interests but was in the public interest. Vicky was concerned that if she stayed silent, nothing would change and other women would face the same fate as her, namely, to die of a treatable disease because of faults in the screening system. She was not willing to accept that. Crucially, she felt that when things go wrong, patients and their families must be informed. They should expect openness and honesty. If the health service does not recognise a problem, how can it deal with it? There has been reform of the cervical screening programme because of Vicky Phelan and many other women who became involved in the cervical check issue. However, some of the important changes that Vicky advocated remain outstanding. The Taoiseach has referred to some of them. I want to pursue a number in more detail. The HSE introduced a national open disclosure policy in 2013, but we all know that open disclosure does not always happen. The purpose of the patient safety Bill is to change this. It is to make the policy of open disclosure mandatory rather than discretionary. Unfortunately, as we have just discussed, the progress of the Bill through the House has been desperately slow. It was introduced in 2019 and there has been an eight-month delay in moving from Committee Stage to Report Stage. The Taoiseach has to bear in mind that it still needs to make its way through the Seanad, so I ask him whether the commitment he has just given, which is to have the Bill completed before the end of the year, includes its passage through the Seanad. Progress on another important development has also been far too slow. The State's only cervical screening lab, at the Coombe hospital, is currently only screening private smears. Public screening, including screening for CervicalCheck, stopped after the cyberattack, although private work continues in the laboratory. Meanwhile, 160,000 slides were sent to the United States for analysis in just the first seven months of this year. There was a commitment in the wake of the CervicalCheck failures that the analysis of these slides would be carried out in total in Ireland. Four years later, that has not happened. Vicky Phelan was always adamant that action was important to her, not platitudes and empty promises. When can we expect that the commitments made to Vicky and the other women who are victims of this failure will be honoured? When will mandatory disclosure be the law of the land in its entirety? I am talking about the passage of the legislation through both Houses. When is it expected that the new national cervical screening laboratory will be fully staffed with appropriate staff and operating? When can we expect all CervicalCheck slides to be processed in Ireland?

It was completed in October. It is expected that it will become operational by the end of the year.

A workforce plan is in place. Recruitment for the new laboratory is an ongoing priority for the HSE. It is working with the faculty of pathology to build the required expertise. As already stated, Dr. Cillian De Gascun was recently appointed as interim director of the national cervical screening laboratory. A lot will depend on the pace of recruitment. It is a matter of high-level expertise. Thankfully, new technologies that reduce the capacity for human error have emerged for cervical screening. There is a far more significant and enhanced process now than pertained originally.That is positive. Ultimately, the new laboratory is designed to become CervicalCheck's main provider of cervical screening laboratory services. The HSE is of the view, however, that a secondary laboratory contractor will remain necessary at all times to ensure resilience in the system. The route to go is to create our own national service in respect of this. That then, combined with the HPV vaccine roll-out, would give us a very robust approach to cervical cancer and a real opportunity to eliminate it or significantly reduce it in this country. In respect of the legislation, Deputy Shortall will know that down through the years there have been various debates around mandatory reporting in different areas of life, for example, child protection, where many professionals believe it can be counterproductive, or at least that was the argument that was advanced. I have never been of the view that the world collapses if we do certain things. My view is that open disclosure is imperative and can be of benefit to the system. On the legislation, the Government and I are at the mercy of the House. To be fair, we do need to produce the amendments, complete Report Stage and the Bill then needs to go to the Seanad. If there is agreement on the amendments and if the Bill satisfies all parties, then I think we can move it through both Houses in a timely manner. We are committed to doing that. I will ask the Minister to engage with his respective counterparts on the legislation. I will make a general point, which is that the cervical screening programme has saved thousands of lives. It is very important that we continue to advocate for participation in the programme. We can certainly improve and enhance it, and that is what we are about.

We would all encourage women to participate in CervicalCheck. However, we must deliver on the promises that were made when the failures in CervicalCheck were identified. In addition to the two points I raised with the Taoiseach, there are three outstanding commitments from the Scally report that must be actioned. These include the commitment to ensure that clinicians meet with their patients or the families of patients who are deceased in order to discuss the failures of the system and the failure to inform them of the outcome of the review of smear tests. That has not been actioned yet. Two other commitments relate to data retention and the implications for other Departments in terms of the learnings from the Scally report. In December 2020, Judge Meenan issued a report on medical negligence. That has also not been actioned yet. Can the Taoiseach update the House on when we are likely to see progress on each of those issues?

That should have happened. It has happened in a number of cases. On the implications for other Departments, all Departments will take on board lessons learned from the CervicalCheck scandal and will follow through on best practice in respect of disclosure. The medical negligence report has been completed and more work is required in regard to it. I will come back to the Deputy with a more comprehensive and detailed response in respect of that issue.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-15 00:00:00	Death of Vicky Phelan: Expressions of Sympathy	22	This morning, I attended the press launch of the Raise the Roof campaign at which trade unions, student unions, housing groups, anti-poverty groups and many more, including Opposition parties, outlined details of the national housing demonstration that will take place in Dublin city centre on the Saturday after next. We expect many thousands of people to take to the streets to demand action that has not been forthcoming from the Government to address the shameful, intolerable, ever-worsening housing and homelessness crisis.There are many reasons for the crisis. I urge those affected by or angry about the crisis to come out on the Saturday after next. The reasons for the crisis include: the failure of the Government to control rents and house prices to make them affordable; the failure of the Government to stop the constant flow of families and individuals into homelessness and emergency accommodation; the failure to deal with the scandal of empty properties; and the failure to deal with vulture funds and property speculators that profiteer and benefit from the housing and homelessness crisis. I want to ask the Taoiseach about another reason that people should come out on the streets, that is, the Government's commitment to the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, between Canada and the EU. Last Friday, as a result of Deputy Costello's Supreme Court action, we found that CETA is, at least at the moment, unconstitutional because it has the potential to bypass the sovereignty of the court system and fundamentally undermine democracy in the interests of multinational investors. I want to ring the alarm bells about this matter for the public and remind them what is at stake here. In simple terms, the agreement gives multinational companies the right to sue governments that introduce progressive legislation or regulation to deal precisely with matters such as the housing crisis, environmental issues or workers' rights by means of a system that bypasses our courts. I refer here to the investor court system. Despite this, the Government continues to be committed to this attack on democracy in favour of the profits of multinational companies. This opens up the potential, for example, for property speculators and investors to sue governments that introduce measures to protect tenants, control rents and regulate the behaviour of vulture funds, property speculators and so on. Yet, the Government remains committed to this unconstitutional agreement and refuses even to agree-----

However, he has done it in a very disingenuous and, dare I say, dishonest way in his presentation and his attempt to conflate the two matters. Suffice it to say that I have repeatedly stated in this House that housing is the greatest social issue facing this country and the Government's number one priority is to deal with it. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has brought in a raft of not just legislation but also schemes to deal with the housing issue. We need to build houses more rapidly to help younger generations get access to houses they can afford and that they can rent at affordable levels. That might be affordable housing, social housing, cost rental, the refurbishment of existing houses or any other initiatives we can take. The Supreme Court ruled in respect of CETA, and I welcome the clarification in its judgment. The court did not rule on the principle of free trade but rather on a point of law, which can be remedied. The decision of the court was six to one in favour of the view that an amendment to the Arbitration Act can deal with the issue and that, consequential on such an amendment, CETA can be ratified. What is this great danger the Deputy wants alarm bells to go off all over the place about? He never says it or references it. He talks about multinationals, developers and vulture funds. He does not talk about the 400 companies that employ many people in this country. These are Enterprise Ireland client companies, many of them startups and many of them small operations, that trade with Canada.This agreement is operational since 2017. The only real impact of this agreement is a 30% increase in trade between Ireland and Canada to the benefit of our companies and to protect jobs. What does Deputy Boyd Barrett want? Does he want every trade deal the European Commission does with a country like Singapore or Japan to go through a referendum?

Since the 1960s, we have fundamentally changed an insular approach to an external approach by joining the European Union and embracing the Single Market. Why? Because we sell 90% of everything we make in this country, be it services or merchandise. We sell and export to create wealth and jobs in this country. Deputy Boyd Barrett's diatribe and his reading of the riot act to me is anti-enterprises, anti-jobs and against the best interests of this country. Is the Deputy for free trade or not? Will he answer that question when he gives his supplementary response?

I will tell the Taoiseach what I do not want, and this is the connection between housing and CETA. I do not want what has happened to the United States, which is that the National Apartment Association, which represents big investors in apartments, has taken the US federal court to court through the investor court system and is claiming billions in losses because of the introduction of a moratorium on evictions. That has just happened in the United States. This is not a hypothetical danger. Who is the biggest apartment owner in this country? IRES REIT. Who is its parent company? A Canadian property company. Therefore, if the Government were to introduce regulations that controlled or reduced rents or regulated the behaviour of vulture funds and speculators that are benefiting from the housing crisis, we could be sued through the investor court system, as governments have been on a whole range of environmental issues. The French Government has been sued over trying to limit fossil fuel extraction, for example.

I call Deputy Cathal Berry.
#CathalBerry	unknown-#CathalBerry-party	unknown-#CathalBerry-dob	unknown-#CathalBerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-15 00:00:00	Death of Vicky Phelan: Expressions of Sympathy	66	I wish the Taoiseach a good afternoon.It is appropriate that we focus on healthcare reform for the day that is in it. There can be no better way of honouring the memory of Vicky Phelan than to focus on and accomplish what she was advocating for, namely, healthcare reform. We want to fix our broken health service to minimise errors and maximise excellence in all its forms. As the Taoiseach and colleagues are aware, I am not interested in HSE bashing in any shape or form. On the contrary, I recognise there are small pockets of excellence all over the health service in every hospital and primary care centre. Our job as legislators is to support these people so we can build on their success. The problems in the health service can be fixed by the good things in the health service, but only if we get our people right. I have three people-related questions for the Taoiseach. People are everything. They are the ultimate precondition to success. If we get our people right, problems melt away, and if we get them wrong, we are chasing our tail for the rest of our days. The position of chief executive of the HSE has been vacant for some time now since Paul Reid retired or resigned. Where are we with his replacement? Are we likely to get a replacement before Christmas? It is very important we have the corporate governance and accountability in place. We also have 900 consultant vacancies, almost a fifth of the consultant workforce throughout the country. Some positions are unfilled, partially filled or filled by locums. It is very disruptive to the health service. Negotiations on the consultants' contract are ongoing. Are we likely to get agreement on that by Christmas so that we can recruit and retain consultants and ensure appropriate clinical governance and accountability is in place? The new regional health areas, RHAs, are entities designed to streamline the hospital groups and community health organisations, CHOs. Where are we in establishing them? When does the Taoiseach envisage them to be established and made operational to ensure we have the appropriate structural governance and accountability in place? Those are the three questions: regarding the chief executive, the consultants and the RHAs.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-15 00:00:00	Death of Vicky Phelan: Expressions of Sympathy	67	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. It is important in terms of the improvement and enhancement of our health services. It is very much grounded in recruiting expertise and personnel. Since 2020, a net 15,000 personnel have been recruited to the health service, which is the highest ever number recruited in the HSE since its establishment or indeed in the health service. Huge numbers have come in. Obviously, the population is growing. Services are expanding and in many instances are getting better. I was at a stroke centre at the weekend in Cork University Hospital. There are 26 such stroke centres throughout the country. Wherever we get centralisation and a strategic view in terms of a particular disease, great benefits can accrue. Going back to the late 1990s and early 2000s, we had a cardiovascular strategy and the first national cancer strategies, all of which led to improved survival rates. Likewise improvements in stroke care have had a dramatic impact. I would say, in health services overall, having that strategic framework and focus is key, which has to be followed through by implementation. Personnel is key, of course. The consultants' contract negotiations are progressing in a constructive way between the Minister and team in the Department of Health and the representative bodies. We had a Cabinet subcommittee on health yesterday and we were updated on progress. I would hope that we can bring that to a conclusion as quickly as possible. It is very important we bring clarity to it in line with the expressed wish of most people in this House. That would yield better coverage overall in the health service and better outcomes and treatments for patients. Work is ongoing on implementation of the regional health areas as outlined in the programme for Government. The Minister brought a memo to Cabinet in April last. An implementation plan will be finalised by the end of the year. The RHAs will have population-based budget allocations and will be responsible for providing health and social care services.Integration between acute, community and primary care will be key. The recruitment will start early next year for the senior posts and the RHAs will be responsible for recruitment, financial management, service planning and delivery. Transition to RHAs will take place throughout 2023. Funding has been approved in the budget for the appointment of the RHA senior leadership teams and the aim is to have them operational before the end of 2023. If we can bring that forward we will do so but it is a significant structural change from what we have so it will take a bit of time.

It is very unusual to have six hospital groups and nine CHOs and for them not even geographically to align so I hope that will streamline the process. It is also reassuring to hear about the consultants' contract. If that can be done by Christmas it would make a massive improvement downstream because you are not just hiring managers or people with clinical governance; you are hiring expertise as well. The old medical adage that prevention is better than cure is an appropriate one. If you get the right people in the right place you can solve problems before they even start, stop mistakes and focus on excellence from there. Hopefully that issue will be solved by Christmas.

Following agreement we would intend bringing in a new contract hopefully to ramp up the recruitment of more consultants. On the RHAs, good consultations and engagement with health sector stakeholders have been held and more are scheduled. These include a workshop of the voluntary dialogue forum and six regional events were held for health service workers in Cork, Sligo, Kilkenny Tullamore, Dublin and Limerick in September and October. We are making progress on those fronts.

It is a huge issue. My colleague, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, and many others have called for an independent inquiry and survivors have also been looking for that. It would be useful for us to hear the Government’s response to these very serious allegations this week and to have the opportunity to debate this issue. I know we have a busy schedule generally but we have two-and-a-half hours of statements on Science Week this afternoon. We could schedule time this week or next week for a debate on these allegations.

The Minister for Justice gave us to believe that we would have the opportunity to put down amendments on Report Stage but we were debating Second Stage here last Thursday and the date for amendments had passed before we commenced Second Stage. This is shocking, it does not comply with Standing Orders and it is completely wrong. What is the Government's indecent haste in trying to rush this hate speech legislation through, breaching the procedures set down by this House, namely Standing Orders? Dáil procedure does not allow for that; there is a correct way of doing it. The Minister said she was not rushing it but she is rushing it in an inordinate hurry.

It is vital that we have such a debate. It is clear that the Taoiseach has not read the judgment on CETA but the whole House needs to familiarise itself with it because it is clear that the legislation is not sufficient. It states:...while such legislation is necessary, this in itself would not be sufficient. The Constitution does not permit the Government to ratify CETA nor the Oireachtas to enact the appropriate legislation giving effect to that decision for so long as the defences...to enforcement of a CETA Tribunal award under the ICSID and the New York Conventions respectively remain as circumscribed as they currently are. The gravamen of the constitutional objection which I have upheld is that, upon ratification of CETA as is currently proposed, the High Court would be virtually powerless to refuse the enforcement of a CETA Tribunal award.It is also incorrect to say the agreement is about the expansion of trade and so on; this is about an investor court system. It is also incorrect that being in the EU gives us protection. We should look at the Canadian mining company suing Romania and another Canadian company is suing Croatia so we need to debate it this week.

The revelations over the course of the past week have been absolutely horrifying. It is clear that there will need to be a response from the State that will need to be thoughtful, considered and in line with the needs and wishes of the survivors and those who have bravely come forward. That would benefit from being discussed on the floor of the Dáil and I support that request.

We have time and next week might be a better opportunity. We had some preliminary discussions at Government level on this and we have to take some advice as well in respect of any current cases that are ongoing. I know the Garda has issued contact numbers and so on for people to contact it. I have no issue with having discussions with Members of the House. It is one thing to call for an inquiry but it is completely different to try to develop one. It must be a bespoke model that meets the needs of victims and survivors and that gets resolution. We should learn from experience as best we can and I am open to engaging with Members on that. We are all in general for the Criminal Justice (Incitement to Violence or Hatred and Hate Offences) Bill 2022. We will vote on Second Stage tomorrow night so Committee Stage can start this week.

That is not feasible either so I suggest that we pencil a debate in at some stage. CETA has been provisionally in operation since 2017. We will not rush any response to this; we want to give due consideration to the judgment and the conclusion from the Supreme Court that amendment to the Arbitration Act 2010 would deal with the issue. It is not something that has to be rushed either this week or next week but I have no objection to a debate on CETA at some stage. We have already had debates on CETA in the House by the way.

Business and voluntary organisations have seen no reduction in their insurance premiums while a report published today shows that motor insurance has fallen by only 2% in the past year. The value of awards has reduced significantly but that is being pocketed by the insurance companies. All the while, as the Taoiseach knows, the industry has seen record bumper profits. We must ensure the insurance industry passes on the savings from reduced awards to customers. That is what Deputy Doherty's Bill, which is currently before the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, would achieve. Is it not now time for the Government to end its opposition to that necessary legislation?

I take the point that a significant range of reforms has now been enacted and while the cost of motor insurance has come down, other insurance premiums have not. The Government will be examining the issue to ensure we get premiums down.

I thank the Taoiseach for agreeing at my request to schedule a debate on these allegations and the horrific and widespread abuse that appears to have been perpetrated. In advance of that debate, we must acknowledge the need for a public inquiry arising out of the disclosures of abuse. We owe it to survivors, many of whom have contacted me and my colleague, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, in recent days. An inquiry is necessary not only to uncover the scale of the abuse but also to examine the cover-up. It must be a survivor-led inquiry and may have to extend beyond one order because it seems that organisations other than the Spiritans were also involved. We can, if necessary, approach the inquiry process in a modular fashion. I ask the Taoiseach to commit to meeting the survivors and hearing from them what is now needed.

I have said we are open to a debate next week. We need to discuss the matter but we do not in any way wish to impact any prosecutions that may take place. We also need to discuss the most effective way to inquire into the matter. It is shocking and sickening, especially when one considers the scale of it. As the Deputy said, there may have been a premeditated attempt to cover it up.

According to the latest survey conducted by BeLonG To, the LGBT youth organisation, which surveyed more than 1,200 LGBTQI+ students from across the country, 76% of students reported feeling unsafe at school. As one can imagine, feeling unsafe in a school environment is bound to have a detrimental effect on the quality of education a student receives. The survey also states that three in ten LGBTQI+ students missed at least one day of school in the past month because they felt unsafe or uncomfortable. Very worryingly, one in ten LGBTQI+ students are unsure whether they will complete the leaving certificate.That survey was released today. What can the Government do to enhance and protect those students, the LGBT community in schools, who are feeling unsafe?

There are issues. We also need to deal with the bullying issue, which is related. More broadly a whole-of-school approach is key to enabling people to feel safe in schools.

It has been nine months since the consultation process was started by the Tánaiste's office but not a single proposal has come from either the Minister of State, Deputy English, or the Tánaiste regarding the progress of this Bill. Can the Taoiseach get guarantees from that office that attempts will be made to move this Bill to Committee? Will he give the more than 500,000 retired workers some guarantee that the Bill will be aired and given a chance to pass through the Oireachtas? I know we are all getting older. They are getting older. They are retired workers and not retired voters and how they will respond to what the Taoiseach's office does or does not do matters.

Over the past two decades, while Governments have been committed to the introduction of such a scheme in the interests of both public health and the individuals concerned, we have always remained one report away from action. We now have claims related to adverse reactions from the Covid vaccination programme. When can we expect the commitment promised for so long to be implemented?

It has now transpired that many businesses in rural areas if they do not use gas - we do not have gas in many towns never mind in rural areas - and if they use oil for instance as their main way of creating industry, pressing the laundry industry and industries like that, will be denied access to this TBESS. That is totally discriminatory against rural Ireland again because such people do not have an opportunity to have piped gas in the towns. Many towns do not have it, never mind the countryside. Something needs to be done about this anomaly if it is a fact and I am told that it is. It is discriminatory against rural businesses and it must be changed.

Over the past two years, I have submitted a number of questions about this service and the most recent response stated that the HSE had received funding to establish the clinic on a permanent basis. Previously it was established on a pilot basis. However, 11 months after the pilot programme finished, patients tell me that the pain services are inadequate with waiting times of 12 months and in some cases up to 24 months, and inadequate facilities to carry out the procedures. It is called a pain clinic for a reason. For many people it is the final step in a long journey of chronic and unremitting pain. I have written to the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and I am asking the Taoiseach to raise this matter with him.

It is much appreciated. The budget provided for a once-off €500 payment for certain categories of social welfare recipients. All those social welfare recipients can do training courses, short courses lasting three or four months, under the aegis of SOLAS to enable their reintegration into the workforce while at the same time continuing to receive their social welfare. Based on a reply dated 25 October it has now transpired that if the €500 payment date occurs while they are on the course, they are not entitled to that €500. This is even though they are not materially better off than they were beforehand because all they are receiving is their basic social welfare payment. Would that Taoiseach agree with me that this is either an oversight or a glaring anomaly that needs to be rectified?

They contribute to alleviating the pressure they are feeling at the moment because of the extraordinary energy price increases. I will pursue it with the Minister. I think we can resolve this. I thank the Deputy for raising it.

He told the international community that we do not have a minute to lose in our efforts to combat climate change. There is a missing piece in this country in how we communicate the importance of climate change to our communities across the country. Climate action at ground level means bringing in different policies that affect people's lives. This may relate to land, transport, bus lanes and cycle lanes. These are very difficult and challenging problems at local level. There is a link between that action and addressing the worst impacts of climate change. We are missing a piece in how we communicate the importance of climate action at the local level.

One of the great takeaways from COP27 is the immediacy of climate change now. It is not something on the distant horizon and we have seen devastating weather events that can occur because of climate change. The presentations from Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Somalia and the small island states of the Pacific all reveal the immediate consequences of this. Personal behaviour change is key. Collectively we need to focus on offshore wind energy, for example, the national retrofitting programme and the electric vehicle, EV, programme. We can make great progress. I was reading a book last evening and we sometimes forget the progress we have made on renewable energy with increases in onshore wind energy. I think it was 1% of electricity generation at the beginning of this century and it is close to 43% now. It is the same with recycling of plastic, for example, with the plastic bag levy. It shows that we can do it.

The Taoiseach may be aware that in Connemara recently, 1,000 children lost their school meals because the provider ceased to provide them, citing financial pressures. This problem is spreading. It has become clear that there are problems with the school meal programme in the context of the cost-of-living crisis. The Taoiseach may have seen that we both received an e-mail from St. Maries of the Isle, a school with children attending from homeless shelters such as Edel House. Some of these children have now lost their school meal because the providers have pulled out. It is clear that financial pressures from the cost-of-living crisis are undermining the delivery of the school meals programme. Obviously, this is no one's intention but it is a very serious problem. We cannot allow meals to be swiped away from the neediest. I urge the Taoiseach to ensure this is reviewed at the earliest juncture.

This is of course mainly due to the lack of and loss of services in rural areas, which existed long before the war. I see it my own hometown of Ballaghaderreen, which welcomed Syrian refugees as far back as 2017. We were one of the first towns to welcome them here. Greater resources are needed in all our rural communities. Yesterday on the radio, the Taoiseach said there will be additional supports and that that would be important for communities. Can he tell us what those supports will look like? Will they include additional GPs and additional supports for local schools?

More generally, there are specific supports that we will implement through health and through education and more generally in terms of communities that have taken a higher number of Ukrainians. In particular, this happened early on where there was availability of accommodation in some locations, so there were relatively high numbers there when compared with other locations. We will see in terms of general community infrastructure how the Government can assist in providing additional resources there through funding.

That is the main road linking Portumna and Birr and it is at the very end of my constituency and my county. Because of its geographic location, the road does not get the resources that it deserves. For 1 km from the Ferry Inn in Portumna and Lorrha the road gets extremely narrow and trucks have to stop to pass. There is a blind bend there which is extremely dangerous. I would like for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and Tipperary County Council to work together to put the necessary resources in place to alleviate this serious safety concern. Residents in the area are willing to give their property to facilitate this progress.

The HSE South-South West submitted its plans in January. Robert Watt confirmed to the Joint Committee on Health on 28 September that we would have a decision by mid-October. I understand there was a meeting between the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform last Thursday. When will we get the decision on the new elective hospital for Cork? We have had a huge increase in population. It has increased over 170,000 in the last 20 years. We need new medical facilities. When are will we have that announcement about identifying the site, getting on with the design and with the building of that facility?

Recently, the Irish Examiner reported that over 27,000 people were in emergency departments and they left without being treated. That is extremely worrying and it is a terrible reflection on the Government’s health policy. Is this a reflection that the health policy of the Government has failed?

We need to create alternative centres for treatment. Particularly for me, the enhanced community care programme is a far more effective way to go. There has been huge progress on the enhanced community care programme in regions across the country whereby senior citizens and people in general can access a whole range of services, from respiratory centres, to cardiac care, diagnostics, rehabilitation for senior citizens and mental health programmes for young people all on the one campus with multidisciplinary teams in place. That is the future. Emergency departments in tertiary hospitals and major trauma hospitals are for people who are seriously ill or who have had serious accidents and require attendance at a tertiary hospital. We need to develop alternative centres, minor injury clinics, enhanced community care, prevention etc. to deal with many other issues.

It is ridiculous that some people have to be Garda vetted a number of times in any one year. There is so much time lost for someone who has secured and lined up a job and must then wait to be Garda vetted. It must be unduly cumbersome for the gardaí to operate this procedure repetitively. For example, take school bus drivers who when transferring from one operator to another have to be Garda vetted again. The same is the case for hospitals, health services and childcare services. There could be people involved with the GAA club, the youth club, the swimming club, the coffee morning etc. and they all have to be Garda vetted individually for these different clubs etc. The same person must be vetted a number of times in any single year and it does not make sense. Could the Government streamline this?

Homeless families are being sent further and further away to bed and breakfasts outside of their hometowns and catchment areas. A huge chunk of their already very low income is being swallowed up by expensive transport costs in order to make sure their children keep attending their local school with their local friends. What is the Government’s policy to provide financial assistance towards the cost of transport for the purpose of homeless children being able to attend their own schools from which they were dramatically shunted?

I met with representatives from Holy Angels in Carlow this week. As the Taoiseach knows, the funding is to support community-based voluntary organisations in the provision of disability, nursing home and hospital services across the country. I was told the funding would be there by the middle of the month. We are now in the middle the month but I spoke to the HSE last week. I rang them and they told me that they had received no funding and they were not aware of when it was coming. As the Taoiseach knows, section 39 organisations depend on this really good funding that was announced in the budget. I ask that it be given out as soon as possible.

The first meeting of the European Political Community on 6 October was a welcome development in wider European political engagement. It was hosted by the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, Mr. Petr Fiala, with the support of the President of the European Council, Mr. Charles Michel. Forty-four states were invited to participate, including all 27 EU member states, the European Free Trade Agreement, EFTA, partner countries - Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein - the United Kingdom, Türkiye, the six western Balkans countries - Serbia, Montenegro, Albania, North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo - and five of the six eastern partnership countries, namely, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova and Ukraine. No invitation was extended to Belarus in light of its ongoing facilitation of Russia's aggression. The meeting achieved its primary aim of bringing together leaders from across the Continent of Europe to recognise the considerable degree of common cause among us. The formal agenda included Ukraine, energy and the European economy. It was notable also for the agreement reached in the margins with Armenia and Azerbaijan to accept a civilian EU mission alongside their border. While at the European Political Community meeting, I participated in a round-table discussion on energy, climate and the economy. Other leaders participated in a round-table discussion on peace and security on the European Continent. I was very pleased also to have bilateral meetings with Ukraine, Albania and Bosnia while in Prague. The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Mr. Denys Shmyhal, expressed his appreciation that Ireland continued to be at the forefront of advocating for Ukraine's membership of the European Union, for the toughest possible sanctions against Russia and for holding Russia accountable, and that we were hosting over 50,000 Ukrainian people in need of protection. I assured him of our continued support at this time of terrible need in Ukraine. As I have said, I also met with two of our partners in the western Balkans - the Prime Minister of Albania, Mr. Edi Rama, and the chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr. Šefik Džaferovi. In both meetings, I expressed my support for them on their EU accession pathway. The members of the European Council held an informal meeting in Prague on 7 October. Our discussion was a strategic one covering the topics of Ukraine, energy and economic issues in order to inform and prepare for the regular meeting which subsequently took place on 20 and 21 October. We discussed Russia's war against Ukraine, including the impact it was having on energy prices in Europe. We were joined in this discussion by Ukraine's President, Mr. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, via video conference. We welcomed the eighth package of sanctions against Russia adopted on 6 October in response to Russia's illegitimate referenda and illegal annexations in Ukraine. We also discussed political, military and financial support for Ukraine as well as the importance of countering Russian narratives. We confirmed our resolve to work with and support partners across the world in tackling food security issues exacerbated by Russia's war.

He made this proposal at the Conference on the Future of Europe when it was concluding. Forty-four European countries, including Ireland, attended the first meeting in Prague. The UK also attended, which marked a change in attitudes by the British to European affairs generally. There is no doubt that the Russian invasion of Ukraine acted as a catalyst for the establishment of this new forum. At the meeting, extraordinary solidarity was expressed with Ukraine, and rightly so. The European Political Community also gives encouragement and support to applicant countries pending their full membership of the EU. Is there a future for the European Political Community? How would the Taoiseach like to see this forum develop? Should it be given a more formal structure and should it meet more frequently? I would welcome the Taoiseach's views on these matters.

The Taoiseach stated that energy and energy security were a significant focus of the Prague summit, and they continue to be for European political leaders. In that regard, I wish to raise our planning system, particularly An Bord Pleanála, which has been in crisis for some time. The difficulties run deeper than the behaviour of individual board members. There are issues around governance and organisational culture, but we are now at a critical point with just four board members in place. What is going to be done about this, even temporarily? I understand that the Government is looking for secondments from Departments. Substantial changes to the governance of, and appointments to, the board are contained within the development and foreshore (amendment) Bill. I do not want to prejudge the outcome of the committee's deliberations on the general scheme of the legislation, but it is important to note that the committee's members have raised concerns regarding some of the Bill's provisions. I urge the Government to work with the Opposition to ensure that we get the reform agenda around planning correct. The resourcing of our planning apparatus also needs to be beefed up significantly so that it is fit for purpose for delivering critical infrastructure, not least in terms of developing renewables, in particular offshore wind.

Many European Political Community countries will shortly be involved at an event that will be much discussed in the context of human rights. I am referring to the Qatar World Cup, which starts in five days' time. The Qatari regime will try to use this event to sportswash its shocking record on workers' rights, women's rights and rights for the LGBT community. Many European states benefited from the rotten decision to award the World Cup to Qatar, not least the French Government, which sold fighter jets worth $14.6 billion to Qatar after France threw its weight behind the Qatari bid. I wish to give our Government the opportunity to reflect the sentiments of the Irish people and speak out strongly this week against the human rights abuses of the Qatari regime. I would be interested to hear the Taoiseach's comments on this matter in his reply.

In respect of the Ukraine conflict, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, stated that we were not neutral. This begs the question of what neutrality means if we abandon it when there is a conflict. The Minister went on to say that people should talk to the Russians. We all condemn Putin's bloody invasion of Ukraine, but is it not precisely the role of a neutral country to be the voice on the international stage that argues for a peaceful resolution to conflict? I do not see how we can tally that with the repeated statements of various Ministers about rethinking neutrality and so on and the presence of representatives of the State at the Ukraine contact group, which is establishing military alliances to involve themselves in the Ukrainian conflict.

It puts Ireland at the centre of a debate that is taking place across Europe and in Canada, with many ordinary people mobilising against what is a charter for corporations.Earlier, the Taoiseach wanted to speak in generalities about free trade being a good thing. He did not address either the substance of the Supreme Court decision or what those of us objecting to CETA are objecting to, namely, the establishment of the investor court system, which would be a parallel system of justice that can only be accessed by corporations taking states to court for either direct or indirect expropriation, which can be - and regularly is - interpreted as anything that interferes with the right of corporations to maximise their profits. Is the Taoiseach aware that there are more than 1,000 cases right now involving Canadian companies suing different states? Does the Taoiseach know that these include European states, contrary to what the Taoiseach said earlier? A mining corporation based in Canada is currently suing Romania and another Canadian company is suing Croatia. Will the Taoiseach agree that CETA should be put to the people in a referendum to decide whether they want the State to sign it?

When the Taoiseach attended the European Political Community forum in Prague on 6 October, the protests in Iran were only a few weeks old. Tomorrow marks the two-month anniversary of the tragic death of Mahsa Amini in Iran. Since then, more than 300 people have died over two months of demonstrations, and as many as 14,000 may have been imprisoned. The impetus to act grows as more and more people are detained on bogus charges. I met last week with representatives of the Irish-Iranian campaign group Support Equality and Freedom for Iran. They said to me how best they feel Ireland can use its diplomatic power to effect change. I ask that at every opportunity when the Taoiseach engages with other EU leaders, if he might: reinforce calls for new sanctions on Iran; ensure that we also use our place on the Security Council to act on the Iranian issue; and that we take action here in Ireland. I have called on the Taoiseach previously to consider expelling the Iranian ambassador because of the absolutely egregious abuses of human rights being committed on a daily basis against protesters in Iran and because of the repression of women's rights in that country.

When he got off the plane, however, we discovered that the State had no intentions of doing anything like that. I would like the Taoiseach to address this matter because it may appear that a similar sleight of hand is on display after the lofty rhetoric in Sharm el-Sheikh. There are reports from the EU Council that Ireland has voted to exclude financial investments and funds from the EU corporate sustainability due diligence directive. This means, as an Oxfam report recently showed, that a huge proportion of the emissions causing climate warming on the planet are caused by the wealthiest people and that the fossil fuel industry will continue to be funded and will have no problem getting the funds it needs in order to have a boom in gas infrastructure globally. Ireland is leading the charge, along with Luxembourg, to exclude financial investors from this very important sustainability directive. Will the Taoiseach please address that?

Is that agreed?

It is a significant development when 44 countries come together in an overall forum. Earlier, there had been some concerns that this was a substitute for enlargement, for example, but it is not that. This was very clear from the deliberations at the forum. I attended one of the break-out meetings on energy. These meetings were very good and concrete engagements, in particular with the Prime Minister of Norway regarding renewables, and also looking forward to stabilising pricing with Norway, exports of oil and so on. It was very good and meaningful engagement between countries. There were Azerbaijan-Armenia discussions after dinner, mediated by France, which were about those two countries accepting an EU civilian group in respect of the borders there. One can see the potential for the European Political Community to be, at a minimum, a forum where issues can be resolved, the potential for conflict reduced and challenging issues dealt with. I am not clear yet that it is time for any structure because that could lead to people leaving. The forum is not the European Union, and it is not meant to be a replica of the European Union. The fact that the United Kingdom attended was good. This all means that it is a forum at which people who are not in the European Union can engage with members of the latter. Over time, the number of meetings may increase but the international calendar is very full. The next meeting is due to take place in early part of next year in Moldova. After that, there will be meetings in Spain and the UK. Those involved are looking at having meetings once every six months. I take the Deputy's point but, over time, that may grow. In between, there will be: the formal meetings of the European Union with the full councils; the Asia-Europe, meeting, ASEM; the EU-China summit; the China-Western Balkans meeting; the China-EU meeting; and the China-East Asia summit, ASEAN. Suddenly, one begins to see that the calendar fills up very quickly. To answer the Deputy's question, there is a future for the European Union within the European Political Community. I came away from the meeting thinking that the forum has real potential from the point of view the very basic premise of people meeting and engaging in breaking down barriers. Deputy McDonald raised the issue of the planning system insofar as it relates to energy security, but that probably belongs to a different question with regard to An Bord Pleanála or housing. The Government hopes to publish a review of the planning system shortly. That review has been under way for over 12 months, with a lot of expertise brought to bear in the context of streamlining our planning system. In the context of energy security, in particular renewables and offshore wind, we need to get offshore wind projects into operation much faster than is currently the case. The European Union carried out an analysis in this regard. It has indicated that it can take eight years from concept to realisation of an offshore wind farm coming into operation in Europe. I have a suspicion that it would take longer here. Therefore, we must do everything we possibly can to make sure we do that because offshore wind is the real alternative to fossil fuels for this country. It is the real answer to fossil fuels and to reducing our dependency on them. In addition, there does need to be reform of An Bord Pleanála. There needs to be change there and additional resources need to be provided. The Minister for Justice is looking at an environmental court as well to strengthen on the judicial side our overall response to environmental and climate change issues. On Deputy Barry's question, we do raise, on a constant basis, breaches of human rights, both through the European Union and bilaterally with countries such as Qatar. Again, with regard to the World Cup, I do not believe that Qatar would have been able to sportswash. It has had the opposite impact to date. Far more issues have resurfaced as a result of Qatar hosting the World Cup than might have been the case with international profiling of issues. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, and the Government have spoken out against breaches of human rights. Deputy Boyd Barrett raised the issue of neutrality. Neutrality in Ireland has meant that Ireland is not a member of a military alliance.

It has been the Government official position for a long time that Ireland is not a member of such an alliance, and this has been repeated consistently in legislation. Ireland's official policy is to be militarily non-aligned. We are, however not politically non-aligned. I was surprised when the Deputy, through the Chair, criticised the Minister for Foreign Affairs and stated that we are not neutral towards Ukraine. We are not. We are not politically neutral in respect of Ukraine. Russia has invaded Ukraine. How could we be neutral? Is the Deputy suggesting that we should be neutral on this? This is not a conflict between two countries. This was an invasion by one country with an imperialist 19th-century perspective that believes it has a right to say that its neighbour does not have a right to exist and stated, "We are taking over that neighbour. We are going to invade it and, with all of the military power that we have, we will bomb residential targets and infrastructure, and you have to come to heel". It also stated, "The rest of the world should stay neutral on this and let us get about our business because this is alongside where we live." We cannot accept that premise. As a result, we cannot be neutral on the matter. We just cannot be neutral on it.

The Cabinet committee on housing has met seven times to date in 2022. The most recent meeting took place on Monday, 24 October, and the next will take place on Monday next, 21 November. The committee works to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the implementation of Housing for All and the delivery of programme for Government commitments regarding housing and related matters. Housing for All is the most ambitious housing plan in the history of our State and contains actions to ensure over 300,000 new homes are built by 2030, along with delivering fundamental reform of our housing system. The target to 2030 includes 90,000 social, 36,000 affordable purchase and 18,000 cost-rental homes. The plan is backed by the highest ever State investment in housing and is having a very significant impact, despite a number of challenges which have emerged as a result of the war in Ukraine and other external factors. We are on track to meet the target for this year of 24,600 new build homes. A total of 20,807 new homes were completed in the first three quarters of 2022, more than the whole of 2021. Almost 28,000 new homes were completed in the 12 months to the end of September, the highest rolling 12-month total of any period since comparable data was first published in 2011. Planning permission was approved for 44,715 homes in the year to June of this year, representing an 11.4% increase on the same period in 2021. Since the middle of last year, over 68,500 new homes have been either built or commenced. Last year 9,183 social homes were delivered. These are clear indicators that the plan is starting to work. However, the results will take time given the scale of the challenge and the need to bring about fundamental reform. Along with increasing the supply of houses and reforming our system of home delivery, we have introduced measures to support renters. We are accelerating the delivery of cost-rental homes with State-backed rents at least 25% below what they would be on the private market. In 2023, a further 1,850 cost rental homes are to be delivered. We have introduced legislation to cap rent increases and enhanced security for tenants through the deferring of no-fault terminations for the winter emergency period. Other initiatives which have been introduced include the first home scheme, Project Tosaigh and a vacant homes tax. A number of fundamental reforms are in progress, including a major overhaul of the planning process and initiatives to promote innovation and productivity in housing construction. Looking ahead to 2023, we have committed a record €4.5 billion in public funding for the provision of more social, affordable and cost rental homes. On 2 November, Government published its first annual update of the plan's actions, setting out how it is responding to challenges in the external environment, notably inflationary pressures and interest rate rises, while ensuring focus remains on delivery. The stability provided by a clear and comprehensive plan is now more important than ever. The review was all about prioritising measures to activate and accelerate the delivery of housing supply while continuing to deliver on the fundamental reforms set out in the plan. The focus throughout 2023 will be on the following: meeting the challenges of viability, affordability and sustainability; reforming the planning system; delivering social and affordable homes; boosting productivity; increasing construction sector capacity; revitalising our towns and villages; improving the rental market; and planning for the future.

When the Government plan was published, the Labour Party made it clear that Ireland needed close to 50,000 homes per year, rather than the target of below 30,000 under Housing for All. The Department's records show 42,000 homes per year are needed, meaning there will be a shortfall, even according to the Department's records, of over 65,000 homes by 2030. This shortfall was already clear before the publication on the census showing ongoing population growth of 7.6% since 2016. Will the Taoiseach confirm that the Government will revise the targets for housing construction and put in place new measures to deliver more homes? We also expressed serious concern that there was no additional capital funding allocated in the Government's budget to account for construction inflation. The shortfall is even more acute because fewer homes can be built with the funding available from Government. It is clear the State needs to build substantially more housing - local authority homes on public land - if enough homes are to be provided.  I have suggested in recent weeks that the Government should invest more in the tenant in situ scheme, even in the short term, to ensure councils are empowered to buy back homes where tenants would otherwise be evicted. This would be a way of meeting housing need while ramping up the construction of affordable homes.

There are many individuals who have done nothing wrong whatever, some of whom are not covered by the Government's recently passed Bill to defer certain notices to quit, who face the imminent prospect of homelessness. Under pressure, the Government has somewhat conceded in theory that local authorities could intervene to stop people from being evicted and purchase these complexes or individual homes. In practice, all the excuses are coming out, in many cases from local authorities. One of the big excuses, enunciated by Owen Keegan, for example, is that not everyone in these places is on the social housing list, they are above the threshold and so the council cannot possibly intervene to buy the property. Many others are in that situation as well. Will the Government do something to prevent people being made homeless by ensuring properties are bought and that people being over the threshold is not an impediment to such purchases?

They will have discussions among themselves, they will hear from activists from the Mica Action Group about its campaign and experience, and they will hear from the different political parties, all of whom are invited to come and put their position. I understand they are still waiting for a response from Fianna Fáil, by the way, on whether it will have a spokesperson there. They are determined to fight for 100% redress and nothing less. They know that is the only just and only workable solution for the 100,000 families who are going to be affected by this, most of whom do not know about it yet but who will have a bill of €25,000-plus, in some cases €70,000, coming down the road. They also demand that the State pursues the builders responsible. They will also be on the streets on 26 November as part of the Raise the Roof protest because this is part of the housing crisis and the consequence of housing policy made in the interest of builders. Will the Taoiseach get a Fianna Fáil representative to attend? Will he commit that whatever scheme is introduced will be retrospective? Will he commit to 100% redress, which is the only workable and just solution?

I recently came across a case which shows why. It involves a woman who is in emergency accommodation in Cork city. She attempted to get a diagnosis of autism through the State. She is in that process, which is very slow, and she does not have the finance to go private. She clearly feels herself that she has autism but she has refused accommodation offers on the grounds that the are not suitable for her with her condition. However, the accommodation placement service does not accept what she says. It says she does not have an official diagnosis. She has received a notice to quit, having refused properties that would not be good for her health. This is in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis and a housing emergency and in the weeks running up to Christmas. I understand the Taoiseach spoke to her briefly at the weekend. I am asking him to accept there is a serious case here in both the particular and the general. Is he prepared to look into it in the particular and the general as a matter of some urgency?

I am told there is funding available to support action at local level at local level while we wait for a women's refuge in Carlow town. We are moving on it. It is a bit slow but we have the funding and we are getting there. However, we are struggling with the provision we have for emergency accommodation for those fleeing violence and experiencing homelessness. This is not just a women's issue. Men's Aid Ireland has reported a 37% increase in demand for its domestic support service for men. Those figures are also replicated in Carlow. It is worrying as we approach international men's day this week. We have some safe houses in the local authority buildings in Carlow, but when they are full, the local authority cannot put in regulation 49 in social housing. They need to have approved housing bodies, AHBs, managing them because there is no such thing as a temporary licence. The legislation must change to react quickly on this. Will the Taoiseach speak to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien, about this? I welcome the Taoiseach's commitment and that of the Government to building houses and affordable houses in particular.

I seek a progress report on this. Will the Taoiseach give us a timeline for when that legislation will be ready? There is a multitude of issues there that are very pertinent. The role of An Bord Pleanála needs to be examined thoroughly. The powers of the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, also need to be examined along with the streamlining of legislation, which the Taoiseach mentioned earlier, especially pertaining to renewable and green energy.

It gives an example of the depth and breadth of the Housing for All plan and how it touches on so many different areas of increasing supply, not least with the provision of public housing on public land. On the last count, there are more than 25 public sites delivering public housing in my constituency. That is very welcome. That most recent of those was announced today with the extension of grants for vacant homes, Croí Cónaithe, of €50,000 in cities, including Dublin, and many towns and villages. It will be particularly welcome in my constituency. I am concerned by the increasing interest rates and its impact on those developing housing. Will the Cabinet subcommittee step in to ensure the Land Development Agency, LDA, ensures those sites that having planning permission are developed for public housing, cost rental, social and affordable purchase and that the Croí Cónaithe cities is accelerated to ensure the viability of those sites, which may now be called into question in the context of increased borrowing costs, to ensure the delivery of new supply?

He talks about significant impact and indicators of success, yet all the evidence on the ground in the real world is of a social emergency. There is catastrophic failure in the housing market that has implications for people's quality of life, their life options and chances and their mental health. Younger people are actively making the choice to go because they cannot get a roof over their heads. The depth and breadth of the failure of the Government's approach cannot be overstated. I have a question about the third quarter progress report. The Government committed specifically to deliver 9,000 new build social homes and 4,100 affordable and cost rental homes this year. I do not want overall global figures, but on that commitment for 9,000 new build social homes, how many were built? On the commitment for 4,100 affordable and cost rental homes, how many have come on line?We can argue about the inadequacy of those targets, which, as Deputy Bacik has reflected, are too low, but they are the Taoiseach's targets nonetheless. Will he give me a specific answer to my specific question? If he does not have one, will he provide it to me at the earliest opportunity?

Is he aware that some of the information that he and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage provide on housing delivery is simply not correct? For example, the Taoiseach claimed in the Dáil last week that the number of housing commencements is up when in fact it is down by 14% over the last year. On the issue of social housing delivery, the Government claims 1,765 new-build social homes were delivered in the first half of this year. An analysis has been done of that figure by Laoise Neylon of the Dublin InQuirer. It shows a significant number of the homes claimed to have been completed in the first half of this year were not completed and were still being worked on several months later. Will the Taoiseach explain to me how homes that are still being worked on end up in the official figures for completed social homes?

To make a general point, there is no document of substance on the housing issue that is an alternative to Housing for All. There is nothing with its comprehensiveness, breadth and depth covering all aspects of housing. In it is an inbuilt review mechanism, which is important in any plan. Deputy Bacik raised the issue of a census. There is no limit to the number of houses we want to build. Funding is not an issue; the issue comprises delivery, the planning system and the question of whether we can get projects through quickly enough from concept to occupation by tenants or purchase. The modality concerning how we build houses is also an issue. We need to have much more discussion on advanced manufacturing technology off site for house construction, be it associated with steel frame housing or other types of housing that can be built faster, because the population is growing. There are many people coming into the country. Deputy McDonald says many are going but many are coming in. The net figure indicates people coming in, according to the Central Statistics Office. In any event, the housing situation in Ireland is similar to that right throughout the United Kingdom. Last Thursday and Friday, I met officials from England, the First Ministers of Scotland and Wales, and officials from the Isle of Man, Jersey and smaller areas, and I noted all have similar housing issues. There are not enough houses and people are asking whether they can be built fast enough. There is also a genuine issue in terms of prices. The same applies across Europe. Very few countries in the world, or certainly in the developed world, are not experiencing genuine housing pressures. That said, with regard to the issue of the target, there is within the plan a facility to review targets. This year we set a target of 24,500 completions. The likelihood is we will exceed that. There is no limit to the number. Obviously, some of the houses are private but many are social. With regard to the social fund we are looking at, the Minister seems to believe the number of social homes this year will be 8,000 plus, in addition to those for purchase, for lease and to address homelessness. We can get those figures and we will have them-----

I am saying where we are in respect of this. Obviously, we will have more definitive figures at the end of the year, when a lot of completions will come in.

It seems he is basically saying the local authorities should be automatons and do what they are told across housing. I am not sure that is the right policy and that councillors on the ground would appreciate that approach. There has to be some delegation of authority to local authorities. What we can do is resource them on the housing front, as the Minister has done, to increase their capacity to deliver housing projects in the first instance and to give them the necessary resources to intervene-----

On the question of income thresholds, of course there is an issue. There has to be, and some mechanism is needed to resolve it. There is no point in saying there is not an issue because there many people with lower incomes who cannot get housing. Therefore, there has to be a targeting of resources too. We cannot just go in one direction only. Every local authority has resources. Each has to allocate those resources for different schemes. Again, there should be ways of intervening to prevent what is going on in the case the Deputy has identified. I am aware the Minister has been in touch with the Deputy and has engaged with him on this. We banned evictions more generally across the system until the end of March. The relevant legislation has been introduced. On Deputy Murphy's question on apartment defects, I have said in the House that the Minister will come back to the House later in the year regarding a scheme and the associated report he published. He will come to the Government with it and then to the Oireachtas. On Deputy Barry's remarks, I have met the person concerned. I do not believe we should raise individual cases here. The organisation dealing with homelessness has been outstanding down through the years. There is a huge crowd of community supporters. I do not know the background to the case, which I will pursue further, but we need to be careful in the House that we do not interrogate the actions of organisations that have for a long time been working with homeless and emergency accommodation.

Deputy McDonald raised the issue of housing output this year. I will revert to her with the specifics. I do not accept there is a catastrophic failure. Housing for All is making a difference. It is catching up on a lot of the construction that did not take place in previous years. A huge effort is being made. I will come back to Deputy O'Callaghan on his remarks.

I thank the Business Committee for scheduling the debate. I acknowledge that Deputy Naughten specifically sought this debate, which he does on an annual basis. It is a very worthwhile exercise to have such a debate in our national Parliament during Science Week. As we continue to navigate our way through a global pandemic and climate emergency, it is essential that we continue to place science and research at the heart of our discussions here in the Oireachtas, and in the Government. We must ensure the investment in science makes the biggest possible difference and that it speaks to everyone's needs and hopes. We are actively asking our citizens, our young scientific talent, our educational and research institutions, enterprises and the wider community what science they need to meet their needs. There are many who seek to wish the problems of the future away and that can sometimes seem popular, but it will have long-lasting impacts on future generations if we do not embrace the challenges, acknowledge them and get on top of establishing solutions both nationally and globally. The role of us as legislators is to improve the lives of the people we are elected to represent, but also to prepare a better future for those who come after us, our children, our grandchildren and their children. In many ways, that is why this Department was established. My Department has perhaps a ridiculously long title, but the title does have a purpose. It is because we are trying to bring together our further and higher education sectors, with our research innovation and science sectors to provide a policy focus to this critical area and ecosystem. We want to begin a conversation with people across the country, with legislators and scientists, about the role science has in our lives. Science builds a foundation for understanding how global problems affect our daily lives. As a country, our collective ability to communicate and understand the complex science underpinning the Covid-19 virus built a collective trust in public health measures and vaccination. Science can generate solutions to everyday life, while also answering the great mysteries of the universe. Science challenges, questions and, crucially, answers the questions to which we often desperately need answers. Sometimes science can seem like something over there, as something elite, for somebody else, that is difficult to access. For decades, we have perhaps allowed the perception of science to fall out of the reach of many people in society and we must do better and bring science and technology into all communities and demographics in the country. That is why we decided to undergo a national campaign called, Creating our Future. We are one of the first countries ever to do this, actively to seek out the voice of our citizens. We want everyone to have an open discussion to discover what is important to people and what science and research means to them. We also want to find out what they would like to explore to create a better future for all. It far exceeded our expectations, with more than 18,000 citizens making submissions as part of that process, from fishermen in Killybegs, to children in a special needs class in Dublin; every part of the country and the population had an opportunity to participate. Through these submissions, the public's challenges, curiosities, concerns and creativity shone and in many ways this painted a picture of what is on the minds of the people. Citizen engagement is crucial in ensuring people understand science. I firmly believe Creating Our Future started us on the journey to better engagement with each other on science and its importance in everyday life. It is essential also that scientists understand the problems policymakers face, that it is a relationship of mutual respect and that they endeavour to make the results of their research relevant and comprehensible to society. As policymakers, we must be willing to follow the evidence and follow the science while developing policy. This is very much at the heart of our new national research and innovation strategy, which I launched in May 2022. We call it Impact 2030. The clue is in the title. It is a step change in our policy for research and innovation, emphasising not just the scale, level and process we go through with investment, but the impact of the investment in research and innovation on society and our economy. Ensuring that our science capacity is evenly distributed across our regions is a key objective also. The establishment of technological universities with distinctive missions and regional remits will help ensure all our regions have science capacity with smart specialisations. I am especially pleased that under the European Regional Development Fund approximately €80 million will specifically be available for research and the embedding of research in the technological universities. It is a very practical, tangible way of making sure we are investing in science in the regions, which underscores that science does not just belong in certain universities or parts of the country. Of course we cannot stop there. It is essential that we continue to diversify the profession and the teaching of science. You cannot be what you cannot see. Across the world, science is viewed as something confined to a laboratory, perhaps with a Bunsen burner and a test tube carried out by men in white coats. We must do much more to highlight female researchers and the amount of work being done by them. Dr.Dorothy Stopford Price was the first to introduce the BCG vaccination to Ireland in 1937, which led to the rapid roll-out of the vaccine against tuberculosis. Irish scientist, Professor Tess Lambe, with Professor Sarah Gilbert and a team at the University of Oxford, co-designed the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine against Covid-19. Botanist Phyllis Clinch was the first woman elected to membership of the Royal Irish Academy and the first woman in 1961 to receive the Boyle medal - I might add, the only one, until 2011. X-ray crystallographer and Professor, Dame Kathleen Lonsdale, achieved many firsts and in 1966 a rare form of hexagonal diamond was named in her honour. Many present will know the Kathleen Lonsdale Building in the University of Limerick, which is named after her. We must continue to champion female leaders, diversify science and bring gender equality when it comes to science. That is why Dr. Julie Byrne and Professor Linda Hogan led the Creating Our Future campaigns. We must continue to diversify the scientific talent pipeline and ensure that everyone who works in science in Ireland feels included and supported in the best environment for science. Talent is the bedrock of Impact 2030 and we are ensuring our work is internationally benchmarked through our work with the European Research Area. We continue to support the senior academic leadership initiative which will see 45 female professors appointed in our universities. I am very pleased to say that I recently announced a much-needed national review of PhD supports to address the experience of early-career researchers. I am delighted to announce in the House this evening that I have appointed Dr. Andrea Johnson, vice president of Workhuman and chair of Women in Technology in Science, and Dave Cagney, recently retired head of HR in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to lead this external review. It is essential that we examine how we teach our young people about science, maths and technology. It is vital for the well-being of our economy and our society, but also for the development of young people. These are the skills they require to compete in the new world of work. I wish to update the House on improvements made since this Department was established. Through our research and innovation strategy, Impact 2030, we have tried to position science at the heart of addressing Ireland's societal, economic and environmental challenges. This is a whole-of-government strategy, which is led by my Department. One of the recommendations of Impact 2030 is the creation of a new national research agency which combines the best of the Irish Research Council and Science Foundation Ireland. The new agency will not only support research across all disciplines, but it will enable greater interdisciplinary research activity in Ireland. This is important. We must break down barriers. Many of the challenges we face do not silo themselves in relation to one discipline of science. We must make it much easier for scientists to work with social scientists, with enterprise, community and policymakers, to respond creatively to the grand challenges we all face. My Department has established a research Bill work group to oversee the legislative process and operational and transitional arrangements. This work group held its first meeting in October and I will update the Government on this work shortly. In 2023, I will propose to the House that we will pass for the first time a single landmark piece of legislation on research, a stand-alone research Bill. I very much look forward to working with Members of the Dáil and Seanad to get legislation right. Our new research agency will be an important element in the delivery of the Impact 2030 vision of establishing Ireland as a research leader. We are a small country in a highly competitive global arena. We punch over our weight and we are ranked 12th in the global scientific ranking. Some of our researchers are world leaders in immunology, agricultural sciences, pharmacology and material sciences and we are continuing to build on these hard-won successes. I am also proud to say that as part of our emergency response to the war in Ukraine, Irish universities are now hosting more than 80 Ukrainian researchers. We very much welcome them and thank them for their ongoing work and contribution in the area of research and science. As a country, we continue to be active contributors and beneficiaries of our European engagement in Horizon Europe, Erasmus+, the European Regional Development Fund and other programmes. Closer to home, we are increasingly adopting a shared island approach to science and research. I thank the Taoiseach for his work in this area. The North-South research call, supported by the shared island fund in the Department of the Taoiseach, was a huge success and it brought together researchers from all disciplines across the island of Ireland. For example, it brought together our precision cancer researchers into a common network. As colleagues will be aware, along with my counterparts in the UK and Northern Ireland, we recently announced the new co-centres for research and innovation. This has been talked about for years and I am very excited that it is now happening. All-island research centres, North and South, and research centres east and west, are working together across the two islands in the interests of coming up with solutions to some of the biggest challenges our citizens face. This has been a great achievement and I thank all those who have worked so hard, including officials in my Department and in Science Foundation Ireland. There is now a co-funding model in place, which followed extensive engagement by my Department, Science Foundation Ireland and the shared island unit in the Department of the Taoiseach, along with the research funders in Northern Ireland and in the UK. These co-centres will bring greater cohesiveness to the research and innovation system on the island of Ireland. They will also enable more east-west collaboration, which is of the utmost importance in these times, post Brexit.I am very pleased to say the calls for the first two centres will commence this month. The first two centres will focus on the themes on sustainable and resilient food systems and on climate. These two themes are all the more imperative as they are the issues we are facing daily and which we can best solve on a shared island basis. These centres will work closely with the Departments that have remits which align with these themes and I can confirm this engagement has already begun. I am looking forward to the response from the research community to the call and the outcome of these calls in tackling major societal challenges, and I am looking forward to a further call on a third all-island research centre in the area of health during 2023. If we can get the best and brightest on the island of Ireland working on climate, sustainable food and health, it will have been a good day's work. I thank the people who have worked for many years on getting us to this point. The research in these centres will genuinely be of global importance and vital to the future of our communities. It is also a practical example of how working together on an all-island basis makes sense. My Department is also spearheading a whole-of-government initiative to connect policymakers with the best research and scientific advice available to inform our policies. When my Department was established, I set up an evidence-for-policy unit, which should not be a radical concept. We must ensure we embed evidence as we formulate policy. This means connecting our best scientists and researchers with public policymakers. We cannot have science and research over there and policymakers over here. We must embed that expert voice in policymaking, and this is the purpose of the new unit in my Department. It will improve the quality of both our policy and research. Recently, my Department received more than 40 submissions to the public consultation on science advice which closed at the end of September. Responses were received from stakeholders ranging from Departments and bodies to private individuals and representative bodies. The era of the chief scientific adviser also being the head of the funding agency is over. I do not want to prejudge the outcome of the consultation, but in 2023, we will put in place these new scientific advisory structures. I have been to the OECD and talked directly to officials there about models of best practice. It is fair to say there is no one model but many different ways of doing this and we must find a model that works for our country. It must be a model that recognises scientific advice is quite diverse. We need to map out the scientific advice already available to Government and come forward with proposals. The chief scientific adviser and the scientific advisory structures will be separate and distinct from the very good structures in place in Science Foundation Ireland, SFI. The level of submissions shows wide interest in the topic and I thank participants for the time they spent preparing their submissions. Without pre-empting the outcome of the consultation, some of the key high-level insights emerging include the need for independence, transparency and effective communication in any science advice structure; a strong desire for citizen engagement and involvement at all stages of the science advice process; and the highly complex nature of the area and the need to consider carefully how best to integrate science advice into a whole-of-government approach and wider strategic policy formation structures. It is clear also Ireland needs to engage proactively with international science advice networks. I have previously discussed in the House how that scientific advice can be available to the Oireachtas. That is very important. We cannot have pseudoscience in this place. I am not a scientist and not many of us are, though I think Deputy Naughten is. We all need to be able to have access to scientific advice, whether we are Members from the Government side, the Opposition or whatever role we play. Embedding scientific advice is quite important. I will be bringing proposals to Government on this shortly. They will build on the results of this consultation and only serve to strengthen evidence-based policy formation throughout Government. I also confirm to the House that I have asked my Department to prepare a submission for Government to consider Ireland joining CERN. CERN, as people will know, is one of the biggest and most significant scientific research centres in the world and we need to join it. I have asked my officials to prepare a submission on that basis. For more than two years I have been listening to researchers, industry and our citizens, and it is clear people want Ireland to be at the table when it comes to CERN. Having spoken to the Taoiseach, I know I have his full support. This is an important step for Ireland to take. I must be honest that the costs of joining CERN are significant but so too are the benefits. My Department is currently examining this and I look forward to being back here shortly to discuss it. I will finish where I started by thanking the Dáil for hosting this debate and setting aside time in the schedule for a debate on science, scientific advice, the role of science and research and evidence-based policy. As a field, science is one of the greatest collective endeavours of humanity. It significantly contributes to our understanding of the world and answers questions and provides solutions that benefit millions across the globe. I came across the following quote, "We live in a society exquisitely dependent on science and technology, in which hardly anyone knows anything about science and technology." Let us change that reality together. Let us make 2023 the year in which we pass a stand-alone research Bill, put in place new advisory structures, and the PhD review carried out externally comes back and we properly support the best and the brightest carrying out work here, especially early career researchers across our universities and beyond. Let it also be the year in which we take a strong step towards joining CERN and our all-island research centres begin their work on climate, sustainable and resilient food systems and health.

I thank everyone involved in and taking part in Science Week. It is an important initiative that gives us an opportunity to platform science and how it affects and shapes our everyday lives. The pandemic, perhaps more than other times, brought the role of science and scientists centre stage and into everyday conversation. Bhí eolaithe go rialta sna meáin. Bhí an pobal ag plé ábhair chasta eolaíochta. Bhí an vacsaín ar cheann de na samplaí is treise de luach staidéir eolaíochta and in lots of ways the high rates of vaccine takeup reflect a scientifically engaged public. Scientific analysis should not just shape the behaviour of individuals but should also guide governments and all policymakers. Scientists should have a clear and structured role in guiding government policy. The Government recently published a new research strategy entitled Impact 2030, which is the successor strategy to Innovation 2020. A part that stood out to me concerned a plan to improve the flow of scientific advice to Departments by establishing new scientific advice structures. My colleague Deputy Conway-Walsh, who sends her apologies, made the need for a structured link between research and policymaking a key component of her speech for Science Week last year. Accordingly, we welcome the inclusion of this in the strategy. It is essential we make progress in this area and we must ensure this moves from policy document into standard practice. At European level there are structures that facilitate engagement between researchers and policymakers, such as the European Commission's scientific advice mechanism, that should provide a useful model. Cuirimid fáilte freisin roimh an eagraíocht mhaoinithe náisiúnta a bhfuil caint fúithi laistigh de dhoiciméad Impact 2030. We also welcome the proposed new funding agency put forward in Impact 2030. We look forward to seeing the research Bill because we believe it is important there is a unified research system that places all research on an equal footing. People would be shocked to learn how little basic research is funded in this State. While applied research is important, our funding model is totally out of balance and the humanities and social sciences have also been undervalued and underfunded. A research funding agency is needed to roll out competitive funding and guide research priorities. That said, the role of higher and further education will continue to be crucial. Core funding for higher education makes up the basis of our research system and will continue to do so. The success of other research funding agencies such as SFI and the Irish Research Council will continue to depend on leveraging the higher education system to achieve specific objectives. This will also be the case for our new funding agency. Funding our higher education system is the foundation of all public research investment in this State. The best way to celebrate Science Week is to move higher education out of the austerity mode it has been locked in for some time now. We saw a modest increase in core funding this year but that needs to be built upon significantly. This summer, the Government published a policy document that recognised a €307 million funding gap in our higher education system, despite students and families paying some of the highest fees in the EU. That policy document and statement from the Minister that significant progress would finally be made but that did not fully materialise. Addressing the decade of underfunding is needed before we can really talk about addressing and valuing scientific research.That is essential if we want to ramp up and rebalance research and development. Caithfimid córas taighde uile-oileáin a bheith againn chun torthaí níos fearr a bhaint amach go heacnamúil. An increase in publicly-funded research is essential to tackle the social and economic challenges we face and to produce a sustainable economy. Of course, any person or organisation seeking to invest in Ireland is looking at what value we place on that area of research and investment. Public funding should be open access and available to all academics and to the wider public to ensure the greatest level of collaboration. Economic reports show that for every euro invested in research and development, more than €5 is returned to the economy. Public investment in research also leverages higher levels of industry investment and leads to accessing more competitive research supports through international funds like Horizon Europe. We need to value research and all researchers, including PhD researchers who have been surviving or subsisting, in some respects, on stipends that are very far from any kind of minimum standard of living, much less a living wage. That needs to be addressed. We need to increase investment in public research. We need to make sure this includes improvements to the working conditions of all researchers. Higher education research has consistently broken down between the university and technological higher education sectors at percentages of roughly 88% and 12%, respectively. Both that imbalance and the regional imbalance need to be addressed. I also make the point that cross-Border enrolment on this island has remained unacceptably low. This does not get the attention it deserves. Despite living on a small island, it is clear that partition has a bearing on where students choose to study. In the North, university enrolments by students from the South are relatively low. Between 2016 and 2019, it was approximately 4%. In this State, students from the North make up less than 1% of the student population. This is despite the lack of third-level capacity in the North. This should be much more normalised. It should be much easier to access. It is incumbent on us all to work together in this regard. I commend the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education, Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science in this regard. I will briefly make some final points. The sciences and occupations from right across the economy that have a scientific element to them have a crucial role to play. We should not just be talking about higher education; we should talk about further education and apprenticeships. The sciences have a role to play there. Science-based trades and apprenticeships will be crucial in terms of the green economy and a whole range of new enterprises and jobs that have hardly been conceived of yet. That should not just be accessed through third level, however. We need to create opportunities in science right across the board. I recently attended an event organised by the Institute of Physics. One of the points made was that it is a crucial discipline and subject at both university and post-primary level. There is a serious problem with the supply of physics teachers and physics graduates, however, which has serious implications for education and for industry that need to be addressed.

I welcome the fact we are having this debate and that we have Science Week. It is a good opportunity for the House to address these issues that do not always get the focus they deserve. Of course, they are hugely important to our country and its future. The theme this year was to explore the infinite possibilities of science to address social challenges and to help to understand our world. There are a couple of important points. This is about the idea of infinite possibilities and how you build a system that provides the necessary focus for the realisation of some of them. There are also issues around social challenges and understanding our world. I welcome that the Minister placed an emphasis on climate in his contribution, which is what I will do in mine. We must think about the climate challenge as one that requires a scientific and technical response. When we speak about the sector, we have got into that habit of talking about sectoral ceilings and dealing with this issue on a sectoral basis, However, if we look at energy, transport, retrofitting or agriculture, for example, huge scientific advances in recent years have provided us with opportunities. I firmly believe we need to position ourselves as a country to lead in this field, whether it be in terms of energy or elsewhere. Onshore wind technology has hugely advanced. Offshore technology is emerging but will advance in the time ahead. It is the same with solar energy. Our understanding has increased in the area of hydrogen in recent months and years. The opportunity there will depend on the efforts of the sector and the many scientists and technicians in the area, and likewise in the area of biofuels. In transport, new emerging battery technologies are increasing efficiency and effectiveness. We have sustainable aviation fuels. We are dealing with new building materials, progressing with retrofitting and installing new heating systems. In respect of agriculture, Teagasc appeared before the Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action this morning to look at the whole range of research it is conducting in the area of land use. There is, therefore, almost exponential potential for our country. Within that, we must prioritise and maintain focus. It is important that we put the requisite resources and supports in place to encourage this. In science, we must build the environment to encourage the endeavour of individual scientists and as a collective. There must be incentives. We await the hydrogen strategy, for example. I welcome the fact that that ball is now rolling more quickly than it was heretofore. Deputy Ó Laoghaire touched on the issue of basic versus applied science. As a country, we need to take risks in the area of scientific endeavour in terms of research and innovation. There is very often the constraint that the research that gets funded is that which will be commercial and deliver a return. As Deputy Ó Laoghaire said, we do not know what the technology is that will deliver for us and for climate; it may not exist yet. There is certainly an element within our response to climate change that is a moonshot. Our efforts are a statement of intent about doing the right things at this time to hopefully deliver the requisite responses in the years ahead. Some of that will be commercial; some of it will not. I will make the point that we must take those risks. Sometimes, in some of these spaces, I quite often get the sense at either an institutional, governmental or departmental level that we are waiting to see what is happening in other countries. We cannot lead on everything but we need to be strategic and look at our strengths as a country, whether that is in terms of offshore energy, hydrogen, renewable technologies or whatever it may be and we need to be brave. We must support those who are working in those areas. It is really important that our research is open access and available, and that we support our scientists. Deputy Ó Laoghaire mentioned supports for student scientists and PhD students. I made the case previously for working scientists in the medical sciences and elsewhere. We must provide them with a wage, stipend or support to be able to live in the communities in which they work and study.There is significant opportunity for the institutions and states that are brave and ambitious at this time. The Minister mentioned climate, food and health. We have made significant progress in technology and IT, health sciences and life sciences. The green economy holds great potential. Some of the endeavour will be Betamax, some of it will be VHS, some of it will be neither. It is important that we enter into all of this with a spirit of support for the scientific effort. We should respect and support basic and social sciences as much as applied sciences. We should respect and support those who are supported by major pharmaceutical companies as much as we do pioneering local research in individual hospitals or third-level institutions. It is important to get the balance right.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	18241	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-15 00:00:00	Death of Vicky Phelan: Expressions of Sympathy	236	I am delighted that Deputy Ó Ríordáin is sharing his time with me. I acknowledge the work of Mallow Development Partnership in the excellent Munster Maths and Science Fair that took place on 16 October this year. Up to 5,000 people attended and it was sponsored by the Irish American Partnership and Cork County Council, working through the Mallow Development Partnership to bring science to the people. I pay tribute to everybody who was involved. Although the event takes place every year on a Sunday, if the Minister is of a mind and is still in the Department this time next year we would be delighted to welcome him to Mallow. He could see for himself the interplay between students, members of the public and research entities like Teagasc and all the citizen science engagement that takes place. It was a perfect model and I acknowledge the successful role played by Mallow Development Partnership in bringing it about. It was bringing science to the people and an excellent example of science in action. An entity close to my own heart is the Irish Centre for Maternal and Child Health Research, INFANT, in Cork. It is such an important entity in terms of perinatal healthcare, making pregnancy safe for women, ensuring the health and future well-being of children and improving the survival and long-term health outcomes for newborn babies. The Minister must forgive me for being parochial again, but if he ever happens to find himself visiting University College Cork and if he visits INFANT, he will see for himself the excellent work that is carried. It is really impactful research meeting societal challenges, which is so important to all of us.  It is incongruous that at a time we are setting up the maritime area regulatory authority, MARA, to deal with consents and licences around offshore wind, we have a world-class entity called MaREI doing world-class research on offshore wind. The science has moved ahead of implementation on the ground, on the seabed or floating on the water. What I mean is that while we are doing excellent research here, we need MARA to issue those consents when it is created in order that the excellent research on wind turbines and offshore wind can lead to a throughput of projects to deal with our future energy needs. We can be concentrating on the excellence of science in Ireland but if it does not have the impact on the island of Ireland or off our shores and if there is not expeditious connectivity with industry, the gap will need to be plugged. If the Minister visits Cork, he should talk to the people in MaREI and he will see the potential.

We are facing a climate disaster and it will hopefully be science that helps us through that. We have to facilitate the scientists of the future through our education system. We need to empower the teachers in the teaching profession and the colleges of education to ensure they are equipped to bring the joy and love of science into the classroom. There is a gender element to this, as the Minister will appreciate. Because our education system is more gender-segregated than any other in Europe, traditionally all-girls' schools have struggled in this area. There are suggestions that girls have not been afforded the same opportunity to study science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, and science-based subjects as boys would have been. In the forthcoming citizens' assembly on education, there is an opportunity for us to flesh out what we are discussing here this afternoon. Certainly we have a disproportionately segregated education system, which I am constantly going on about. Some 17% of our primary school children attend gender-exclusive schooling and it is one third of our second-level schools. That leads to gender stereotypes and lends itself to restricted subject choice. Coming out of the time of Covid, we should have a much more expansive model of education. If a subject is not available because of limits in teaching staff or qualifications, there is no reason we cannot have remote learning from a centralised source so every student in every school in the country can study whatever subject he or she wishes. We have to be able to empower all students in all schools to study science. I am particularly conscious of that gendered element. It has been spoken of before. Unless we proactively deal with it, we are going to have these problems into the future. I suggest to the Minister that we can include this topic in the wider conversation of the citizens' assembly on education. It is important. I also echo the points my colleague, Deputy Sherlock has made about the Minister's trip to Cork in the coming weeks.

I am an engineer by training. Engineering is where science meets pragmatic application in many ways. We have a massive challenge in engineering to get balance; we are far from it. We do not have enough young women getting into the sector. If we did, I dare say that many of the challenges we have in our society would have been solved already. I know the Minister will agree. My colleague, Deputy Bruton, and I sat through a few hours of the climate action committee this morning. It was a really interesting session. Professor O'Mara and his colleagues from Teagasc were in, as was Mr. Niall Ó Brolcháin, late of these Houses. He was a Senator many years ago. He is an expert in what is known as land use, land use change and forestry, LULUCF, one of the great challenges this State has, which is also a challenge right across the world. As of now, our land is both a carbon emitter and a carbon sink but it is a net emitter. When we talk about climate action in this country we use the 2018 baseline because when we were negotiating the programme for Government it was the latest data we had. Now science has told us the numbers in the 2018 baseline were not accurate and our land is actually a bigger emitter than we thought heretofore. It was a fantastic discussion which brought home to me and my colleagues on the committee the importance of evidence-based policymaking, based on science and numbers.Many would say that politics and science do not or should not mix but I would argue they should. We do not have enough scientists involved in policymaking and if we can do anything to advance that we should do so. If we do so and if we try to bring about a culture of evidence-based policymaking on the back of scientific understanding, then it pulls the emphasis away from the norm of rhetoric and fear-driven legislation and policy that is often the case and has been the case in parliaments across the world I wish to pay tribute, as others have, to those who are in the field. I will be parochial and mention that Deputy Quinlivan and I attended a briefing yesterday by Professor Norelee Kennedy of the University of Limerick, UL, who the Minister will know. The briefing outlined UL's strategy for research and for turning UL into a powerhouse of innovation and research. I pay tribute to Professor Kennedy and her team and to those in the Bernal Institute. I also want to address the great efforts of their compatriots on the other side of the city in the Technological University of the Shannon, TUS, who are doing ground-breaking research. It is this kind of research that will underpin the decisions we make as a country going forward and in respect of that great existential challenge we face about which colleagues across the House have spoken. Last night I had the privilege of attending an event in Trinity College Dublin. Engineers Ireland hosted a lecture on a great Irishman named Charles Parsons from Birr, County Offaly. While the following accolade often goes to Nikola Tesla, one could say that Parsons invented the 20th century. The great innovations and genius of the man led to so many of the technological innovations that appeared in the late 19th century, particularly the steam turbine, which we still rely on to generate most of the electricity in our world today. The lecture was given by Mr. John Burgess and Dr. Bettie Higgs and I hope it appears online on the Engineers Ireland website. It was truly fascinating and it deserves to reach a wide audience. We have done pretty well in the scientific arena as a country. There are people in our history like Mr. Parsons, Robert Boyle and Tyndall. Many of the great scientific thinkers of the last 150 to 200 years came from this country. This country will produce the great scientific thinkers of the next 200 years as well, on the back of the efforts we make as legislators to put in place the educational frameworks to enable our young people to get into the scientific arena and make the great discoveries that we cannot even imagine now but that will have to be made to solve this existential crisis we face. Those young people should take inspiration from the great people who have gone before. If they look at their stories and see what they achieved in their lives a long time ago with limited resources, they can be inspired to learn, create and deliver critical solutions that we need to save our planet.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	25447	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-15 00:00:00	Death of Vicky Phelan: Expressions of Sympathy	240	I will limit myself to one ask which is that we expand Science Week to become Science and Design Week and that we take that approach in the future. I have always believed that design has been a driver of change that we have neglected in Ireland. When I was listening to the Minister in my office I noted he said that we must seek to ensure that science understands the problems of politics and I agree with him. I fear that in the debate about climate, a gulf has emerged between science and politics. It is correct and oft repeated that you cannot negotiate with the science. However, many climate scientists feel that it is enough to issue the dire warnings about the direction in which we are travelling and then to stand back and say that it is over to the politicians, who are in the arena trying to come up with policies that would change things. That is why I believe that faced with such a transformative challenge as we are, the role of design should be dramatically enhanced. I have done a lot of work on the issue of how we can remove the environmental damage from the supply chain of our lives and it is clear that design thinking is the core. I will give a few examples as follows. The business world says that 80% of environmental damage is baked in at design stage in the selection of materials, the processes that are used and the way in which the market is designed and conceived. That is where the problems start and if we do not have design thinking at the heart of our approach, we will fail. For example, construction, which uses half of the materials we absorb in this country, has the worst record on recovery and reuse but it also lacks design thinking. We do not incorporate timber into our construction methods; rather we use concrete. Timber is a way of sequestering carbon and preserving it, as opposed to concrete, which is a way of generating emissions. Poor urban design has been at the heart of the design in Ireland generally of an urban environment that has appalling carbon ratings and which has encouraged a lot of the commuting and dispersed and distraught lives many people have to live while trying to balance the needs in their communities. If you take fast fashion and textiles, which is the fourth-highest emissions generator and the worst of all in terms of water impact, it is dominated by perverse design that we have allowed to slip into the way we think about fashion in particular, and less so about textiles. We do not recover or reuse materials. The market is determined to see travel as a product to be sold and to sit idle in our driveways 95% of the time, used primarily for a single occupant. If we rethought travel as a service that we tried to deliver in as efficient a way as we could, then we would come up with completely different solutions and we would look at solving the problems of individual families in different ways. I ask for that to be considered; it would tap into a deep vein of fresh thinking and break out of a slightly depressed approach that a lot of people take to the challenge of climate. On seeing Deputy Naughten in the Chamber, I note that I brought down a magnum opus we did together in a report of the Joint Committee of Education and Science on science and technology in October 2000. It would be worth, 22 years on, redoing the tables and seeing how much progress we have made. We have made great progress in primary education and science has become embedded there. I would not be quite as sure that we have made the same level of progress in second level education. The reform of the examinations system is slow and areas such as professional development opportunities for science teachers, which we have pointed to, an audit of the science equipment in our labs and the take-up of science by women are not areas where we have made great progress. Schools should be forming clusters where they could develop the depth of the science offer being made, particularly to girls, who tend to have a poorer start in their schools. I am sure Deputy Naughten has done the work to redo all of these tables because he is much more diligent than I am but it would be worth revisiting how well we are equipping the schools to deliver the ambitions we all have for the coming generation.
#MauriceQuinlivan	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-party	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-dob	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-15 00:00:00	Death of Vicky Phelan: Expressions of Sympathy	241	I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on Science Week. It is a fantastic week that showcases the potential and capacity of our citizens and an event I wholeheartedly support. It has been running since 1995 and each year the event gets better. Hopefully, 2022 will be much better as well. Science Week showcases the talent in our third level facilities and among our school-going children. As the organisers say, it looks to showcase the "infinite possibilities" of science. I would add that it also showcases the infinite possibilities available to us when we have an active and educated population. Those who make scientific discoveries know that the knowledge is for the benefit of all society. In this country we are particularly blessed with a creative and hardworking scientific community. It does tremendous work, often without receiving headlines, and this work is mainly done for the improvement of our everyday lives. It is wonderful that we have this opportunity to salute our scientific community in this Chamber.In primary schools across the country, time will be spent by pupils exploring the world of science and, who knows, perhaps providing the spark of interest to the future Irish scientist who will make his or her mark on humanity with a positive discovery in the years to come. Over the past few years, we have battled against Covid-19. We all played our part by adhering to the advice offered to us by our scientists and other experts in the field of disease control. Without their knowledge and expertise, we would have been unable to tackle the pandemic as effectively as we did. We owe a debt of gratitude to these scientists. Indeed, the contribution to the national effort extends to work done by our third level institutions, the research they undertook, the availability of guidance and advice from those studying hard to come up with a Covid solution.  Overlapping with Science Week is the ongoing COP27 conference in Sharm el-Sheikh. We have heard from scientific experts on just how damaging human consumption has been and continues to be to our global environment. We have a real need to change our dependence on fossil fuels and it is heartening to hear from our experts that the potential exists on this island to change course and become the harnessers of alternative energy, from green hydrogen to harnessing wind energy. We have the natural resources, we have the experts and we need to invest in the future. We must all embrace this new direction that we, as an island, must and can take.  If we are to harness the talent of our potential scientists, we must ensure that more STEM places are made available at our third level institutions. To ensure we get candidates for these places who will be enthused and excited, we need to start at second level or earlier. Third level education remains underfunded in Ireland. We are providing third level 38% less funding now than we did in 2008. The Government has spent less on research and development as a percentage of modified GNI every year since Fine Gael came to power in 2011 and less as a share of public expenditure every year since 2012. This is even far below the EU average and the Government’s own target set as part of the strategy, Innovation 2020, and its successor, Impact 2030. We have fallen behind comparable countries in terms of research and innovation. While Impact 2030 outlines plans for a research fund, we must ensure that it supports all third level institutions in order that they may increase their research capacity. It is imperative that funding is provided to all third level institutions across the State to ensure balanced regional development. Investing in our public research system across all higher education institutes is the best way to achieve greater levels of quality research.  As a Deputy for Limerick, it would be remiss of me not to briefly mention the Limerick Festival of Science, which has been running since 11 November and remains open until this Friday. I encourage anybody who can to drop in and take a look. During the Limerick festival, there will be café science, quizzes and competitions. There is something to spark anybody’s and everybody’s curiosity. I commend the three Limerick third level institutions, the University of Limerick, Mary Immaculate College and my alma mater, renamed the Technological University of the Shannon, for combining and organising this fun educational festival. In conclusion, I mentioned the funding issues affecting our third level institutions but I would like to end on a note of hope. Science Week can spark the questions and desire for answers in our young people; the boys and girls of the next generation. It was heartening to see a recent iWish report that found that 93% of female transition year students reject the notion that boys are more suited to STEM careers. This is very positive and shows that the old perceptions are being broken down by the upcoming generations. The report also highlights that the perception remains that there is a lack of gender equality in STEM careers. This perception must be challenged and changed. If we do not, we risk wasting the opportunity to harness the immense talent of our young women; talent that could be used to advance this country as a leader in the area of STEM careers. I welcome the Minister’s comments on CERN. I would be interested to know whether it is associate or full membership that we will go for. Has he decided yet?
#GaryGannon	unknown-#GaryGannon-party	unknown-#GaryGannon-dob	unknown-#GaryGannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-15 00:00:00	Death of Vicky Phelan: Expressions of Sympathy	242	I am looking forward to and enjoying the contributions from everyone on this important topic. Science and research shape our modern world and its future more than any other profession or area of study. Scientific progress can be a matter of life and death for those suffering from disease, those living in poverty and those plagued by a lack of natural resources, just as it can open opportunities to improve quality of life for all. The kinds of scientific endeavour we commit to mirror who we are as a society. How we prioritise research echoes what we want our future to be like and what wrongs we wish to right. As a result, only those who have access to scientific education will be able to influence the very direction we take as a future-facing country, one which is quickly becoming – or I would argue has become - a global leader in innovation. Ireland's diversity is a point of national pride and we must ensure that diversity is reflected in how we work towards a better future, or risk leaving groups behind who do not traditionally have a seat at the table in relation to master’s degrees, PhDs or who gets to partake in the research that we rely on. For that reason, it is of paramount importance that our scientific research is conducted by a cohort that is representative of all groups and outlooks in the population. Though great strides have been made in recent years to reach out to groups who face greater challenges accessing a scientific education and turning it into a career, more work and greater nuance is required to ensure a balance is struck. Women in STEM programmes have been excellent and a necessary step in the right direction and have yielded results. However, without an intersectional approach, we will fail to elevate individuals who have been less represented in the past. Despite improvements, women face sustained challenges when considering their future in science and research and to heal these ails, we must consider the difficulties encountered by those who are working class or who live in poverty. Furthermore, these issues are exacerbate for women of colour and those from migrant families. Our educational institutions, community programmes and Government bodies are not doing enough at present to recognise that their struggle demands greater attention.  We should look and take inspiration from programmes such as Maynooth University’s STEM Passport for Inclusion as beacons of progress where young women from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds who may not have had traditionally accessed STEM careers are mentored in digital skills through activities such as computational thinking, artificial intelligence, computer science and the ethics behind it all. When students of the programme complete three lab days and independent learning activities, they receive an award that they can use on their CAO to access STEM courses in Maynooth University and Munster Technological University. The STEM Passport for Inclusion should act as a blueprint that can be replicated across the country. I wish to give credit to and mention my great friend, Dr. Katriona O’Sullivan, who has been a forerunner in enacting and driving this project. It is worthwhile and having tangible benefits for the young women involved, their families and the communities they come from. I will strongly argue for a scientific community too into the future. Working-class women are less likely to enter STEM careers, and without their contributions, future innovations will not reflect their wants and needs in a way that they should. Therefore, it is essential that we ramp up supports. If Ireland is to continue to grow as a hub for science and research, we will need contributions from every group and background to fulfil the opportunities and vacancies that are due to face us. Without them, our economy will shrink and we will become a less attractive location for future-facing initiatives. In the brief time that I have left, I also wish to express my solidarity with those who have been laid off in the past few weeks, those who find themselves sitting in precarious circumstances in tech companies and those who continue to fear for their jobs as a consequence of billionaires who behave in a manner that I think we would all agree is unethical. It is important to realise that technological progress cannot always benefit society if it is laid in the hands of individual oligarchs. We have recently seen how one billionaire can acquire a company and indiscriminately fire many of its core staff. Now the platform is at risk of violating regulatory orders and putting its users at risk. It is for this very reason that it is essential for inclusion of all group in STEM. We must democratise the tech industry to ensure that everyone’s voices are heard and avoid the tyranny of the reckless egos that we are seeing today.  We have seen automation and technology increase the possibility and precariousness of people in employment before. It is no coincidence and we probably can see parallels along the docklands today, where these same people who work in tech economies are fearing for their jobs, as 50 years ago, people along the docklands were losing their jobs to containerisation and a form of technological advancement that left communities behind. We must ensure that as we increase in technological capabilities and as the prospect of artificial intelligence becomes more real, we do not leave entire swathes of communities and people behind. We need to get clever in terms of how we invest more socially in society. As we move forward, we must always ask ourselves how this will affect workers’ rights, for example. How will this affect our neighbourhoods or towns and cities? Can we stop developing entire cities and towns for the technologies or bubbles of the day? I see that down in the docklands at the minute, where in the midst of a housing crisis we have single-room accommodations lying idle because they were built for a particular industry that is now at risk.  Science Week’s 2022 theme is infinite possibilities. It is essential that we ensure those possibilities will flow to all, not just a few.

As one of Ireland’s great scientists, he discovered, among many other things, the science of climate change and why the sky is blue, developed the sterilisation method called Tyndallisation and published what is considered the first book in English on mountaineering. Even a crater on the planet Mars is named in his honour. John was born in Leighlinbridge by the banks of the River Barrow and the legacy of his career is very much in evidence to this day. He shaped our understanding of climate change and outlined the effect gases could have on our atmosphere in the 19th century. At a recent conference organised by the European Commission Representation in Ireland, attendees were told that Ireland has the potential for 80 GW of offshore wind to be developed and the more wind that is generated, the greater the need for solutions such as electricity interconnectors to export it and storage solutions such as hydrogen. It is hoped that contracts will be signed this month to begin the manufacturing and construction of Ireland’s first European electricity interconnector, the Celtic interconnector, a 700 MW subsea cable or electricity highway which will allow electricity to be exported between Ireland and France. Research into this interconnector was carried out in Cork's academic research and innovation hub, the Tyndall Institute, named after the Carlow man. John Tyndall’s first job was with the ordnance survey office in Youghal and Ireland’s first electricity interconnector with mainland Europe will come ashore in Youghal. History has come full circle. This week is an important opportunity to ask how we as a forward-thinking country can support research to help meet the opportunities and challenges facing our society over the coming years. Because Science Week goes on for seven days and includes a wide variety of events involving industry, colleges, schools, libraries, teachers, researchers and students throughout Ireland, it is a fantastic opportunity for people all over Ireland to discover and engage with science. We can have that discussion because it is important. We are so lucky in my constituency. Teagasc is running its Festival of Farming and Food. Our university, the South East Technological University, is the first technological university in the south east of Ireland and it has an centre for innovation, opportunity and growth. Carlow College, St. Patrick's, is the second oldest third level institution in Ireland and is a leader in providing platforms for scientific thought through lectures and public engagement on subjects such as literacy around environmental issues. Of course, all the schools in Carlow, including Tyndall College, are exploring science this week and its place in our lives. I encourage all of us to engage this week with our sciences and learn more about ourselves and the world around us.

This year, it started on Sunday, 13 November, and will end next Sunday, 20 November. It is run by Science Foundation Ireland and has been running since 1995. Science Week includes a wide variety of events involving industry, colleges, schools, libraries, teachers, researchers and students throughout the State. I say a big "Well done" to St. Patrick's Boys National School in Portarlington which today held an event to explore the world of biomedical science, including hands-on experience with the assistance of Dr. Helena Bonner. A number of Science Week events are taking place in Kildare, mostly at Maynooth University. Tomorrow morning, the university will have an online event discussing black holes, what they are, how they formed, how our universe began and how it will end. Tomorrow evening, there will be a public conversation entitled Let's Talk About Obesity: Defeating Stigma with Science. It will discuss what science is telling us about obesity, consider whether obesity is a disease and explore how to address weight stigma in society and what treatment options are available for obesity. On the topic of obesity, many people with long-term conditions and chronic pain have difficulty losing weight. They are often trapped in a vicious circle of pain and obesity. The Government needs to go further and ensure that treatments such as liraglutide and Ozempic are more widely available on a medical card and under the drug payment scheme. Science Night at Maynooth University takes place this Friday from 6 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. There will be biology laboratories, chemistry talks and robots, along with computer science, physics, maths and psychology demonstrations. I commend the work of Science Foundation Ireland, a statutory body with responsibility for funding research in the areas of STEM. The foundation also promotes and supports the study of education in, and engagement with, STEM and promotes an awareness and understanding of the value of STEM to society. We in Kildare are especially proud of Kilcullen's own Professor Teresa Lambe who has been awarded a Presidential Distinguished Service Award for the Irish abroad. Professor Lambe and her colleagues played a major role in co-developing the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine. I welcome the establishment of the Tess Lambe bursary, which will benefit female students in Cross and Passion College who go on to study a science related course at third level after completing their leaving certificate. While bursaries are fantastic, we need to do more to encourage female participation in third level education and also participation from students from less well-off areas. Third level education remains underfunded in Ireland. While third level attendance has improved, this Government provides colleges with 38% less funding per student than was provided in 2008. That has negatively impacted the quality of third level education provision and the ability of higher education institutes to produce high-quality research. In Sinn Féin's alternative budget, we provided for an increase of €93 million in recurrent funding to deliver high-quality education and research. This Government and previous ones have allowed us to fall far behind similarly sized countries when it comes to investing in research and innovation. We need a better regional balance. The institutes of technology that make up the new Atlantic Technological University have won only €1.9 million since 2014. That is just under 0.2% of Ireland's total. As well as regional balance, we also need to provide greater funding to the public research system. Ten years of underfunding of higher education has had a severe knock-on impact on research and development. Investing in our public research system across all higher educational institutes is the best way to achieve greater levels of quality research. We in Sinn Féin believe that higher education needs a substantial increase in annual recurrent funding in order to deliver high-quality education and research. We will deliver that in government.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-15 00:00:00	Death of Vicky Phelan: Expressions of Sympathy	245	I have no doubt that Government representatives will continue to eulogise the great history of endeavours in the field of science. That is fair enough, but we must take it with a pinch of salt. We could take it seriously if we made a start by treating the teachers of science and other key subjects with the respect they deserve by paying them an income that will allow them to live and rent homes in the places where they work. The Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, recently polled almost 100 principals and deputy principals and found that 91% of them had experienced difficulty hiring qualified teachers of science, chemistry, maths and biology in the recent past. That is a fact which undermines all the Government's plans and promises to increase the uptake of STEM subjects in our universities. I also note that the State has agreed to carry out a review of its support for PhD researchers, which is good news. A recent report showed that Ireland's researchers are among the lowest paid in Europe, earning a salary of approximately €18,500 per year or lower, sometimes as low as €13,000. The highest paid are in Denmark where researchers are often paid up to €50,000 per year. A significant number in Ireland must engage in part-time work, which has a detrimental effect on their research. How do we expect researchers to survive on sums often as low as €13,000? We should have less back-slapping about what we are doing in this country until we ensure that the next generation of researchers and scientists have a decent income that will allow them to live with dignity. Similarly, the eulogising of how much we love science must stick in the gut of the medical science laboratory workers who had to strike in the recent past to achieve a decent pay rise after a decade of neglect and abuse by the State. The dispute was fuelled not just by gross pay inequality but also by the fact that 20% of medical scientist posts had been left vacant in our hospitals, leading to overwork, demoralisation and burn-out in this key group of workers.The entire dispute was an indication of how much respect the State has for front-line medical workers. The promise of science has been to improve our lives and to liberate humanity from the scarcity imposed by nature. Many of the great scientific leaps have done that. It is fitting, especially in the years of Covid, to think how vaccination programmes and immunisation save millions of lives each year. The World Health Organization estimates that between 3.5 million and 5 million deaths are prevented every year from diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus, influenza and measles. The issue we face when we look at scientific funding and projects is: what is the main driver for research and innovation? Is it always to improve the lives of people and humanity or is it to develop a product that can be commodified and sold for a profit? In the week that the tech workers have been thrown on to the scrap heap in their thousands, it is revealing that Facebook has spent $10 billion researching the development of essentially a virtual reality game, the metaverse. This is the vision of its founder Mark Zuckerberg in the belief at some stage that everybody will want to buy his version of virtual reality and make him richer. For this he borrowed $10 billion which is quite obscene. There is no doubt that many of the world's brightest and best young scientists in many fields have been seconded to help him achieve his vision. This is a waste of genuine human ingenuity. No doubt many of the world's leading universities and their graduates were invoked to send billionaires into space. My point is that the use of science is not politically neutral. It can be used and developed to save humanity in many fields or abused in others. It is telling today that the biggest issue with the Covid vaccine remains the inability of much of humanity to gain access to it. In some parts of the globe vaccination rates are lower than 20% and in the very poor nations it is low as 5%. Some 2.4 billion people are unvaccinated against Covid and a staggering 90% of them live in the developing world. In this week of COP, we can see that many of the targets and goals we have set on reducing emissions of greenhouse gases are dependent on science to deliver a magic bullet. The estimates for how much science will help reduce our emissions are often built into the models that predict warming and CO2 accumulation. We are literally gambling on the future prospect of someone somewhere inventing something to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, perhaps via carbon capture and storage, while at the same time continuing to encourage the production of oil and gas. It is largely a con but it serves its purpose in allowing the fossil fuel industry and its cheerleaders, such as some Ministers in the Government, to continue justifying extraction and development of fossil fuels on the basis that at some time in the future, science will help us remove it. Therefore, we keep drilling for gas and we may be able to find science that will capture it and store it. We keep developing the beef and dairy sector and we might be able to feed the cows seaweed. We fill our streets with perhaps 1 million private electric vehicles as a solution to having decent public transport. We build a vast array of anaerobic digesters with the by-products of an intensive and unsustainable big agriculture model. At every turn, science is used not to address the climate crisis but to find ways to continue with business as usual. Whether it is in climate or medical science, science is under attack by those on the right as never before. A major aspect of people's scepticism regarding science is motivated because of the contradiction between profit and the motivation for the good of humanity that we see across all fields of science. Science cannot liberate humanity until we liberate science from the imperatives of profit and capitalism.

Maybe it was his way of dealing with four inquisitive children when he was bringing us up, but I doubt it. I feel he probably came hard-wired that way. In any case, it was, and still is at times, like being stuck in a Socratic dialogue where we would ask, "Dad, why does that happen?" and get the response, "I don't know. Why do you think it happens?" There must have been something to it because my three siblings are all now scientists of different hues. They are people who actively seek what they do not know and question what they do know in an effort to try to understand the universe better. I am the black sheep, a politician, who does the opposite, pretending to know the answer to all things at all times, irrespective of whether I do. On clear winter nights, my father used to bring us outside with a telescope and point it skyward. Through it, usually after much foostering and cursing under the breath, we would eventually find Jupiter and see the same moons that Galileo glimpsed in around 1610, a view that challenged the orthodoxy of geocentrism. My father would wonder aloud how the father of astronomy would envy the view we had with all the benefit of what has been learned since. It is apt that we mark Science Week here. Before Deputy Denis Naughten leaves, I want to thank him for keeping it on the Oireachtas agenda each year. I congratulate him on his appointment as Chair of the Inter-Parliamentary Union Working Group on Science and Technology. It is always important for Ireland to be represented on these international bodies. We owe so much for the world we live in to the achievements of science and what it has unlocked in our lives, from the polyester in my tie to the broadcast equipment in front of me to the vaccine in my arm, from the inner workings of the atom to the Webb telescope which looks back to the dawn of our universe. For all we owe to our scientific community, I wonder if we celebrate scientists in the same way we celebrate our poets or writers. Hardly a week passes in here without a quote from an unsuspecting and blameless Irish poet being shoehorned into a speech on something or other. However, how often do we quote scientists of note? If I stopped a person in the street, they would surely be able to name three Irish writers, three Irish sportspeople or three Irish bands, but how many would be able to name three Irish scientists? We are lucky in Waterford to be able to lay claim to at least three scientists of note who have helped us to a better understanding of the world we live in. Robert Boyle is perhaps the best known. Boyle’s Law, as anyone who studied physics or chemistry in school will know, sets out the inverse relationship between volume and pressure in a gas at a constant temperature. It applies everywhere in the universe except perhaps in the Dáil Chamber, where regardless of the amount of gas expelled, both volume and temperature tend to increase with pressure. Our inverse relationship here tends to govern the relationship between pressure and the length of time before a decision is required. That is a very niche joke and I am very proud of it. Calmast, the STEM engagement centre of the South East Technological University, SETU, plays a central role in the celebration of Science Week. The centre commemorates Boyle each year in Lismore and Waterford city with the Robert Boyle Summer School which, if anyone needed any further excuse to visit Waterford, takes place next year from the 22 to 25 June. I am sure the Minister of State would be made welcome if he decided to travel. Boyle once remarked that "The book of nature is a fine and large piece of tapestry rolled up, which we are not able to see all at once, but must be content to wait for the discovery of its beauty, and symmetry, little by little, as it gradually comes to be more and more unfolded, or displayed." For all the more we have unrolled that tapestry since his time, the tapestry is no less beautiful, though I fear we may be unravelling some of that world at the same time. We in Waterford are also happy to lay claim to Earnest Walton, a physicist and a Nobel laureate, though in truth he lived in Waterford for a short time. As he was born in Abbeyside, just across from Dungarvan - a very important distinction in Waterford - we have as much a claim to him as any. We recently honoured him in renaming the Telecommunications Software & Systems Group research centre in Waterford the Walton Institute, which is fitting considering the quality and range of scientific research that happens at the Carriganore campus of SETU. Walton is best known for his work with John Cockcroft to construct one of the earliest types of participle accelerator. In experiments performed at Cambridge University in the early 1930s, Walton and Cockcroft became the first team to use a particle beam to transform one element to another. According to their Nobel Prize citation: "Thus, for the first time, a nuclear transmutation was produced by means entirely under human control." Particle accelerators are now central to the work of evolving our understanding of how our universe functions at a sub-atomic level. In that context I warmly welcome the Minister's announcement that the Government will this year consider applying to become members of CERN, where much of that groundbreaking research happens. Walton told us, "A refusal to use our intelligence honestly is an act of contempt for Him who gave us that intelligence."That is a timely exhortation to anyone attending COP27. By now, the science on the subject of climate change is unequivocal, and we must begin to bend the full weight of human intelligence and ingenuity to a challenge that is, in truth, the moonshot of this generation. The work of the third Waterford scientist of note who I want to mention gives some foreshadowing to the fragility of the natural systems that we take for granted and that have nurtured our civilisations and our scientific achievements. John Palliser was born in Dublin. He served in the Waterford militia from 1839 to 1863. He was a geographer and explorer. Following his service in the Waterford militia and hunting excursions to the North American prairies, he led the British North American Exploring Expedition, which investigated the geography, climate and ecology of what we know today as western Canada. His warnings about the unsuitability to agricultural development of the area now known as Palliser's Triangle were ignored and went unheeded. Palliser reported that the region, including what is now known as south-eastern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan, was too arid for farming. The area was nonetheless settled for farming and was subsequently devastated in the Dust Bowl drought, which wreaked such damage, both economic and ecological, in what is sometimes termed the dirty 30s in North America. It is impossible for me to read that without thinking of the pastoralists of East Africa at the moment, whose lives and livelihoods are being shattered by changing climatic conditions resulting from human-induced climate change. Scientists predicted that too. To return to that little boy in a backyard in Butlerstown looking down a telescope at the moons orbiting a distant planet, one is reminded of the words of another famous scientist, although, unfortunately, not an Irish one in this case. Sir Isaac Newton said in his letter to Robert Hooke: “If I have seen further than you, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” From where we are now standing, on the shoulders of the likes of Boyle, Walton and Palliser, we can see further and clearer than ever before, from the electron to the Big Bang. We are the only things, the only entities that we know of in this universe who ask that question that my father turned back on me and who can look at the universe and ask “Why?” In some sense, we are the universe trying to understand itself. We unroll more and more of life’s rich tapestry of which Boyle spoke and understand more and more about the forces and relationships that govern our existence with each passing year. We have a clearer understanding too of the challenges we face. I fervently hope that we can apply the intellectual honesty of which Walton spoke and apply the learnings of science to protect the fragile environment that allowed the homo sapien, the thinking primate, to make these advances in how we understand the world around us.

I will not talk about the result because I was robbed, but that is for somebody else to make a determination on. As I was leaving, a PhD student came up to Deputy Ó Ríordáin and I and spoke about the pressure they were under from a financial point of view. They said that the stipend they get does not cut the mustard and that they believe it is an issue that needs to be highlighted, so this is my attempt to do that. We all understand the necessity of putting the resources and funding into research. There has to be an element of us recognising that this might not necessarily be the research that will pay off. To a degree, people are speaking about moonshot science, but we never know what will actually pay off in research. We all know that if we do not put any resources in place and if we do not put any capacity in place within our universities for the people we want to do this research, then we will never deliver any bang for our buck in the long term. As a result, this is something we have to address. There is a wider issue in respect of third level funding in general. We all know the difficulties that students are facing, because they or their families have to pay astronomical costs to send the kids to college. We have to be able to remove fees at this point in time. Beyond that, there is a wider issue, because many people are well removed from third level education. We have not done adequate work at an early stage in communities and with families so that we can bridge that gap. Unfortunately, that is a gap that is created by poverty and it is therefore a necessity. We need to make sure that enough people coming through, whether that is in the area of teaching in the STEM subjects or in operating in the necessary industries. We need to make sure that workforce planning has been done in that regard. It would be remiss of me not to mention - and it would be the first time if I did not - the necessity of doing whatever can be done in the context of Dundalk Institute of Technology, DkIT eventually becoming part of the technological university group. That work needs to be done and we are now in a different set of circumstances as regards leadership in DkIT, which will probably be transitioning again to a new president. We will all have an opportunity, and we need to make sure that it happens, because we all understand that the technological university system is the only show in town. Science Week is a fabulous idea. It is worthwhile that we are speaking about it here, although we may be bluffing. However, me bluffing about science is nothing new. I have said before that I am probably the worst computer programmer in Leinster House. I could probably go wider than that and say throughout the State.

I would like to mention that transition year students in St. Louis Secondary School in Dundalk, alongside the transition year students in the Dominican College in Drumcondra, are involved in putting on “Science Week Live!”. It is on today, Monday, Wednesday and Friday and they are doing this alongside Dr. Niamh Shaw. Many people would know who Dr. Niamh Shaw is. She is a communicator, a scientist, an engineer, a writer and hopefully she will be Dundalk’s answer to Neil Armstrong. That is positive stuff. Beyond that, we know where we need to take real action, such as in the area of climate change. We know the issues we have had in the tech industry, but it is still a major industry for us. We have a significant amount of work to do. We are at a decent starting point and we need to make sure that we put the funding, frameworks and resources together to ensure we can do real business into the future.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-15 00:00:00	Death of Vicky Phelan: Expressions of Sympathy	250	Last month, I was honoured to be elected Chairperson of the Inter-Parliamentary Union working group on science and technology. That was thanks to the Ceann Comhairle’s original nomination of me to that body and I want to thank him for that. The goal of this working group is to build bridges between science and parliament at a global level and to serve as the parliamentary global focal point for issues related to science and technology. The working group is comprised of 21 members of parliament from across the five continents who have a specific relevant knowledge and expertise and who are determined to inspire global parliamentary action through legislative work in the fields of science, technology and innovation. I want to commend the Minister and the Department for the establishment of the evidence for policy unit and for the programme of consultation that is ongoing - or that has just closed - in relation to science for advice. One of the main aims of both these strands within the Department is to ensure that science is made more accessible and more useful for policymakers both in terms of Government and Parliament. There is a responsibility on the scientific community and scientists themselves to maximise the benefits of science for society as a whole. They must start to publish outside the scientific literature in the public interest by disseminating information by the findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable, FAIR, principle.Scientific research data, whether large or small and irrespective of discipline, should be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. It is imperative that we share the common knowledge, and not just because this is an important requirement in itself. Science is not science unless it is being communicated. In the recent past, we have seen growth in collaboration, particularly interdisciplinary collaboration, but potential collaborators are not going to pick up a specialised academic journal outside their own academic fields. It is only through communication with the media and the public that they are aware of what is happening in related and other fields. As such, it is imperative, not just in terms of scientific development, but also in terms of communicating with the public, that this engagement take place. The scientific community needs to realise that engaging with the public is a requirement as a result of securing the public funding in the first place and to ensure that they outline the potential benefits to society as a whole. This is an issue of equity on a global level. We need to enshrine the right to knowledge and fundamental science regardless of what part of the world someone lives in and regardless of his or her education or background. Information and access to that information need to be treated just like a human right. For example, we have to devise innovative and new climate solutions to deal with the challenges presented by the climate crisis. These need to be made available across the globe when they are devised. Turning to science and its relationship with policymakers, Parliament and Government, the reality is that science has historically been far too slow to provide answers and solutions. Tomorrow, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine will make a presentation to the Oireachtas. As Minister in 2017, I commissioned it to produce a report on air quality and the retrofitting of homes. Five years later, that evidence is only now being published. We made decisions on the retrofitting of homes and the new retrofitting scheme in advance of that because we could not wait five years to get the evidence back. We need to see evidence being turned around far more quickly. This will come with a caveat, of course. Science is always conditional and based on variables and, as politicians, we would love to have certainty, but certainty in today's world is not possible. We live in an uncertain world, and we need to acknowledge those uncertainties, weigh them up and make decisions based on that. With Covid-19, we have all seen at first hand how important it is for science to be able to communicate clearly with the Government and for the Government and Parliament to analyse the evidence critically and weigh it up against competing demands. This relationship needs to be strengthened by building relationships and trust so that we can ensure that the best strategic decisions are made now for our future development. We are facing unprecedented challenges in terms of climate change, biodiversity, food and energy security, inflation and economic growth. Bridging the evidence gap between science and politics is vital if we are to overcome these challenges comprehensively. We are living in a new, post-normal science world after Covid-19. Scientists compromised to provide evidence for decisions in a timely manner during the pandemic. It was a trade-off between certainty and the evidence that was urgently needed to make policy decisions. We are in the same situation in terms of climate change. We need answers now. The scientists have presented us with the evidence. The difficulty is that much of that evidence is far too fatalistic and futuristic. They need to engage in offering solutions. They need to engage with communities across this country and the planet if we are going to provide the solutions that we need to deal with the challenges we are facing. We have unique challenges and we urgently need unique solutions.

I thank the Minister, Deputy Harris - we are trying to get research funding for a new CT X-ray and I believe we are making good progress. When responding, will the Minister of State address a couple of points for me, please? Regarding the newest technological university in the State, we have been waiting a long time for a school of engineering. The original promise was made in 2004. It is to be built under a public private partnership. Has a contract been signed for the structure's development and, if so, what is its expected completion date? The Minister, Deputy Harris, advised in April that he was examining the technological university lecturing and academic career contracts and that the OECD was essentially part of the process of forming new ones. The Minister advised that he was due to go to the Cabinet and the unions to discuss the matter. I understand that this contract has now been completed by the OECD. Will the Minister update the House on where that process stands and when it is due to go to the Cabinet to be signed off?

We are all very glad to see him back and we wish him well in the weeks ahead as we approach the busy part of this term. Science Week is alive and well in County Cavan. It was launched in St. Mogue's College in Bawnboy, which hosted a family fun day last week with many attractions like a mad professor, a marine biologist, blood donors, the Cuilcagh Lakelands Geopark, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, Inland Fisheries Ireland and Cavan County Council, which led the way and had its own environment section in attendance along with the fire service and Civil Defence, to name but a few. Other events included climate action workshops, CSI Water presentations and events hosted by Teagasc at the agricultural college campus in Ballyhaise. I went through the programme for the day before coming to the Chamber. There was a terrific outreach programme where schools across Cavan and Monaghan were being worked with collaboratively, with the two counties coming together. I was delighted to see that the Cavan Institute and Monaghan Institute were involved. I could not let this debate go by without referring to my relentless campaign for Cavan Institute, which I have raised many times in the Chamber. Science Week highlights the need for a new campus for Cavan Institute. I am glad that the Minister has been there a number of times to see our institute, but it has outgrown the structures that were first built in 2006. At the time, it was meant to accommodate approximately 420 students. Today, well over 1,200 students attend Cavan Institute. I hope that the Minister of State will some day get to see with me the lovely greenfield site beside the existing campus. It is screaming out for new state-of-the-art facilities. The Minister has assured me that he will make an announcement on this matter in the new year, but I could not let this debate go by without reminding the Minister of State of the new campus's importance. The institute's principal, Ms Ann Marie Lacey, and her team of deputy principals and other staff have been relentless in their efforts to provide a large and broad range of science subjects, taking an holistic approach to providing courses for students. The institute provides 70 full-time courses. Currently, staff and students are in unsatisfactory conditions because the institute has to rent premises beyond the campus. These premises are not appropriate and are not fit for the jobs required of them, but the students and staff have to put up with them while we wait for the new building. The new building has been promised for ten years.For a decade the college has been crying out for these new facilities. I really hope that when the new year comes, the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, and the Minister, Deputy Harris, will be down to turn the sod on the greenfield site in Cavan Institute, which is waiting for it. As the Minister of State is aware, the college provides very diverse and imaginative courses across a wide range of programmes. It also provides outreach programmes for students in other higher education colleges, supplementing and developing its broad curriculum. Some students use it as a gap year experience and foundation builder before advancing and commencing into third level colleges. The institute's current building is inadequate for the innovative thinking and planning required for future education and training needs in Cavan Institute. Prospective employers, particularly in the trades, would really applaud and welcome an expansion of a further education and training hub at the campus. I really hope that my relentless calling for this new facility at Cavan Institute will not fall on deaf ears and that the Minister of State will over time ensure that we do get the facilities and investment that are required to deliver the new institute at Cavan.

I wish all of the daoine óga and daltaí go léir well in the colleges and schools on Science Week. My memories of science week were in St. Joseph's College in Cahir. The college was set up by two men, Mr. Tom McGrath and Mr. Vincent Russell, who cycled to Cahir, Cathair an Iascaigh, who bought a building and set up a school when there was no educational facility there. They recruited an excellent science teacher, who went to his eternal reward during the summer, Mr. Gerard Grufferty. He had a Bunsen burner and maybe a few bits and bobs in his pocket of the brown coat. I can still seem him in the brown coat. He did his best. He was an excellent science and maths teacher. He did so much to try to instil through us. They did not have the funding as they were not part of the VEC structures. He did Trojan work. Any science I learned was from the experiments with the late Gerard Grufferty. I pay tribute to him. He also ran that school when his two colleagues had retired. He was a fixer as well as everything else. He looked after the students' welfare, he looked after keeping the lights on, he looked after keeping the stairs standing and whatever else in an old decrepit building. Very many people came out of that educational institution. It was a pleasure. To his wife and family I want to say how sorry I am and I express my sympathies to them on his passing. He was an excellent man. More generally on science, we are bombarded with science and especially with Covid. We had Dr. Holohan who told me that they do not do the science, that they deal with the lockdowns and will do the science later. We now have climate change experts who are frightening everybody. Science is being manipulated somewhat. Anyone who questions it is seen as a Neanderthal or the kind of person who is a conspiracy theorist. That is not a good place for us to go as a country. The questions must be encouraged and questions must be asked. Our scientists must be asked those questions and explain. It is fine to have the knowledge and imparting it is very important, but we must never be afraid to ask the hard questions. I acknowledge the firefighters in the Public Gallery. I thank them for their help during Science Week and for their help in every aspect of life in our communities in the context of life saving and looking after us.

We will debate their issues and concerns later on. I want to acknowledge their presence. The year 2022 marks the seventh year of the Kerry Science Festival. This is a week-long festival that takes place across Kerry this November. Of course, we know that nationally it is Science Week, but I want to acknowledge what is happening in Kerry because what we do in Kerry we do better than any other place in the world, and that includes science, as the Ceann Comhairle is well aware. We are very modest about it too.

Of course there are challenges but there are also exciting times. If anybody has ever studied nanotechnology and what that means, they will see that it is about what is in the future, what we can actually do with regard to health and studying, and it is a completely different way of life. It is like people exploring the new world. There is a new world in this and there is so much talk that our minds could not even comprehend it. It is very interesting to study and to try even to start to understand it and the possibilities and capabilities it might hold in the future. Science Week is for everybody but it is particularly for young people. There is a great world out there for them, if only they use their time productively. One of the first things that young people should really do if they want to use their time productively is to throw away this goddamn mobile phone and start looking up other things, including the people that are alongside them.

They came up here today from all around the country. I met with some of the lads from Foynes and from Kilmallock who came up to represent Limerick. We are here to talk about Science Week and science. The only way we can move forward with climate change is to merge first-hand experience with academia. One learns from experience and the other learns from theory. Each has huge merits and I respect both. When it comes to climate change and science, however, what is the one thing that is standing in the way of future proofing Ireland in the likes of energy costs? It is not science. It is legislation. As much as our people are working within science, experience and theory in Ireland and around the world, the only thing stopping the people of Limerick and Ireland from having good and affordable energy is legislation; it is not science. The science is there but the legislation is outdated and flawed. This topic will be discussed under a Private Members' motion tomorrow. I hope there will be plenty of people here to debate this during Private Members' Business, which will bring in the science and the legislation that is stopping the science. Incidentally, the theme of this year's Science Week is "The Wonders of Science: Infinite Possibilities". We are looking for infinite possibilities from our students around the country who are going to second level and third level education. We are looking to them for answers into the future, but our Government needs to wake up and recognise that legislation is stopping our future.

I could hardly believe the crowds and the real interest that so many people had in all of the different events from the exploration dome to the Its Like Magic but Real event, from the Mad Professor to the kitchen chemistry event, from crime scene investigations to sustainable foods, and from the mermaid to the Eagle's Flying group. I spent a little while in one of the lecture theatres where there was a packed audience. I would say it had not been that full in years. It was an enraptured audience learning from the Mad Professor about different forces and their impact. The entertainment facilitated the learning. Nobody, including myself, left ATU Sligo last Sunday without realising that their entire lives are impacted and shaped by science. Far more importantly, we all left knowing that our actions can have a hugely significant impact on issues such as climate change, biodiversity protection, elimination of food waste, protection of our beaches and so on. Sometimes when we speak of innovation we think of women and men in white coats using test tubes with some sort of fizzy liquid coming out of it, or we think of computer whiz kids changing our digital world. Yet, every single one of us as citizen scientists can innovate and can contribute. One of the most interesting projects I saw last Sunday was the Coastal City Living Labs project.Sligo is one of ten cities taking part in this EU-funded project where citizen scientists, ordinary people who live near Enniscrone, Dunmoran or Streedagh beaches, are taking part in monitoring sensors that measure water quality and height and tide levels, while further information is gathered by researchers using satellite images. All of this information is put together using a sensor fusion technique, which simulates real-time environmental scenarios. Why are we doing this? Because those scenarios will help to measure the resilience of our coastlines and sand dunes and ultimately lead to measures to improve the resilience of our coastlines as they contend with higher sea levels, coastal erosion and extreme weather events. We have ordinary people playing a day-to-day role. Why not? It is their coastline and their town and they want to protect it. Last Sunday, what happened in Sligo was one of many events taking place around the country. I encourage people to go along, listen and learn like I did. Science does not just shape the world; it shapes all of our lives.
#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-15 00:00:00	Death of Vicky Phelan: Expressions of Sympathy	262	I join others in saying it is good to see the Ceann Comhairle back in the Chair. I listened with intent to the debate. Many spoke about famous scientists from their areas. We heard a lot about Robert Boyle. I was surprised not to hear about William Parsons. Maybe I did not listen closely enough. Something they have in common is Robert Boyle was the seventh son of the Earl of Cork and William Parsons, who developed the Birr leviathan, an interesting thing which I saw on a school tour, was the Earl of Rosse. For a long time, to be a scientist and advance science, you had to be independently wealthy. We would like to think that has changed, but has it really? This summer I got an email from a man in my hometown doing a PhD. We should be encouraging that because we talk of the importance of science and how it will save us all, yet he told me his stipend, and it is not unusual because it is the stipend generally for PhD students, was €18,500 per year. It is not taxed, but if it was it would be €19,614 per year, which is less than the national minimum wage. While there has been much rhetoric in the Chamber, I do not think it is matched by how we treat our students. I raised this matter in the Dáil and the Minister who took it told me the line Minister would write back and, in fairness to him, the Minister, Deputy Harris, did write back and told me they were looking at the matter and it was important to them. As the Minister of State will be aware, the stipend was raised by €500 to the huge sum of €19,000 per year. That makes it sound like an additional help but it is actually what they earn. To be a PhD student, particularly in the sciences, a person has to work essentially 40 hours per week. There might be room for a small part-time job but it is not like a person can do a PhD part time, get a stipend and nail down a full-time job. That is not possible. It is extremely difficult, especially for somebody from the country who has to pay for accommodation in Dublin, to live here, pay for accommodation and support him or herself on €19,000 per year. It is not reflective of the esteem we claim to hold science in. It needs to be addressed. It is easy to put aside a couple of hours in the Dáil to celebrate science. It is much harder to find the funding for it but, unless we do so, we will not advance and we will not advance the status of Irish universities and the study of science in them, which is very important. Regarding second level students, two teachers recently retired from Scariff Community College who year on year brought students up to the Young Scientist exhibition and opened up the world of science to them. I pay tribute to them: T.J. O'Halloran and Liam Coyle. A generation of students owes them a debt of gratitude.

I thank everybody in the House for this debate. In his opening statement, the Minister, Deputy Harris, mentioned that one of the areas in which real progress has been made is the sourcing of science advice. This is one of many areas where progress has been made in the research and innovation field. Deputy Naughten showed a particular interest in this topic at last year's debate and we are pleased to report the Department received more than 40 submissions to the recent public consultation on science advice from stakeholders ranging from Departments and bodies to private individuals and representative bodies. This shows the wide interest in this topic and we thank the participants for the time they spent preparing their submissions. Respondents were invited to say how they see science advice fitting into the overall policy process, including the broad reform agenda. This might be through the generation of evidence for policy and by strengthening policy development and foresight in the public service. We have asked people to share experiences where they feel advice has been effectively sourced and applied and experiences where it could have been better applied. Climate action and the response to the Covid-19 pandemic were cited multiple times as examples of advice effectively sourced and applied. People were also asked how existing sources of expertise could be mobilised. The consultation invited reflections on the individual skills and competencies of science advisers, scientists and government officials. It sought views on how to include citizen involvement in any science advisory structure. While we do not want to pre-empt the outcome of the consultation, the need for independence, transparency and effective communication in any science advice structure was highlighted by those who made submissions. There was a strong desire for citizen engagement and involvement at all stages of the science advice process. Our Department is studying the detailed submissions received and will draw out the themes expressed to inform our deliberations. This will be an important input into the proposal we will frame and bring to Government. On the PhD stipend review, we know many Deputies have had an interest in how we should support PhD students. To this end we recently announced a review of State supports for PhD students, met with various groups on the topic of such supports and listened to their concerns. We want to support these students and retain their talent within this country. This will help achieve our national ambition and grow our research and innovation ecosystem. That is why we announced the review, the purpose of which is to generate an evidence base and recommend key principles which will contribute to national guidelines for supports for PhD candidates. We will make sure the review includes engagement with PhD candidates, host institutions, research funders, employers and relevant Departments. We have much work to do together to ensure science is at the heart of Government decisions and that people understand the impact of science on their lives. That will require more conversations on the floor of this House, more teaching at our schools and more science becoming part of our communities. We encourage everyone to play their part in Science Week. There is loads happening around the country. Please get involved and get your children involved.

It is good to see the Ceann Comhairle back in the Chamber. It is my duty to bring forward a motion to initiate a process that will begin the work of resolving the very serious issues central to the crisis at the heart of the retained fire service. We need to be very clear: the retained fire service is in crisis and has been for a very long time. The recruitment and retention crisis is fast approaching a critical point from which it may be unable to recover. In 2005, subofficer Brian Murray led a walk out from Bray fire station out of concern over the condition of the retained fire service. He told me that someone would die unless the very serious issues in the service were addressed. Within two years, subofficer Murray and his colleague Mark O'Shaughnessy were killed while tackling a blaze. Some members of their families are here in the Public Gallery, as are many members of the retained service. I have no doubt that the Gallery would have been absolutely packed with retained firefighters were it not for the challenge of getting time off. The deaths of Mark and Brian were caused by the systematic failures in a service that simply is not fit for purpose. Firefighters say that, 15 years after Brian's and Mark's deaths, conditions are worse. While the Minister might point to investment in new fire stations and equipment, which is welcome, it is meaningless without the personnel to staff the fire stations and man the tenders. Situations continue to arise on the Minister's watch where fire services are simply unable to respond to emergencies due to a shortage of personnel. Many one-pump stations are supposed to have crews of nine. They are operating with 50% of the establishment figures with four or five personnel. This not only puts their safety at risk but also that of the public. In my hometown, Bray, for example, the fire station is supposed to be a two-pump station with 15 firefighters. It currently only has nine. It has not been able to operate as a two-pump station for at least the past five years. That is the case in many areas throughout the State. In other cases, fire stations have been forced off the run due to a shortage of personnel. The service was designed for the 1950s and is simply not fit for purpose in the 21st century. Throughout the State, retained firefighters are in the process of balloting for industrial or strike action. They feel forced into doing so as a result of the Government's failure to engage or make any meaningful attempt to deal with the recruitment and retention crisis. In many areas that have already balloted the results have been an overwhelming 97% in support of taking industrial or strike action. They are being forced to do that simply because of their concerns not only for their own safety but also for the safety of the public. I urge the Minister to take heed. This crisis will not go away. It is very real and dangerous and has the potential to impact on citizens throughout the State, if they ever find themselves unlucky enough to need the services of the retained fire service. The day has come where they are unable to answer the call because the Government has failed them. A recent survey of serving retained firefighters indicated that 60% intend to retire or resign in the next 18 months or two years. The retained fire service will not recover from such a loss of experienced personnel. No organisation could survive that, least of all one which battles life and death situations every day. I am asking Members, particularly those of the Government parties, to put aside party differences and support this motion. It will allow a cross-party committee to hear from key witnesses and stakeholders, to listen to the experts on the issues crippling the service, and to bring forward key recommendations for the Government to act on. It will complement any other measures being undertaken by the Government or other bodies. If we want a fit-for-purpose emergency retained fire service, things must change immediately. Let us listen to the firefighters and their motion. Let us pass their motion and work together to put in place a retained fire service that is fit for purpose and is fit for the 21st century.

Our fire services in Donegal were called to respond to that, as were fire service from across the Border. Over the years of road tragedies, and one example I am thinking of was in Inishowen, where eight people lost their lives in one incident, we called the fire service to respond. When there was a tragedy in my town of Buncrana where a family drowned on our pier, it was the fire services who were at the pier side. That is what we ask them to do. It is an incredibly demanding and traumatic job. I remember a member of the fire service in Donegal told me he attended a road traffic accident where there was loss of life. It came into his head that perhaps his son might be among them but he just got on with the job. He was one of the fortunate families who did not get bad news but that is what we ask them to do. That is what we ask of our fire service. The motion is about getting to the point as soon as we can where we have a fire service that is fit for purpose and where the issue of pay and conditions is addressed once and for all. It is about not putting impossible demands on them. As politicians in the Dáil and throughout the country, we thank them again and again. This is about substance. It is about making sure fire service personnel get what they deserve once and for all for representing us. That is what this is about. I commend the fire service personnel who are here today to protest. They are in the Public Gallery. I hope the Government does the right thing and that we will work together cross-party to solve this problem once and for all.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-15 00:00:00	Death of Vicky Phelan: Expressions of Sympathy	268	It is a daily occurrence where fire service vehicles are unavailable for deployment due to insufficient firefighters to crew them. Staff constantly battle exhaustion because of repeated requests to work overtime and cover staff shortages. That is what I am told by the firefighters. Simply put, we are putting our firefighters and the public in danger. We are gambling with people’s lives every day. This is not a new issue. I will focus on Dublin Fire Brigade. It has been highlighting severe understaffing and Government inaction for years. Staff shortages directly affect the emergency response services such as Dublin Fire Brigade. That must be prioritised. Understaffing or delayed response times put the public at serious risk. On-call vehicles leaving stations with less than a full complement of firefighters puts crews and the public at risk. Dublin is constantly growing. It is a city of well over 1 million inhabitants and buildings are getting higher. We need a fire service that has the equipment, the staff, the capacity and the capability to respond to fires and all potential incidents. There was a major apartment block fire in Tallaght last year which required the bulk of Dublin Fire Brigade's resources on site to deal with the fire and the evacuation of residents. Had there been another major incident such as bad crash on the M50 or a fire on the northside, the results would have been disastrous, with Dublin Fire Brigade forced to triage and divert resources in the face of a serious threat to life. We must establish this Oireachtas committee and conduct a full and independent review of how the national fire service is delivered across the State. It should be a short, sharp review of the situation which would interview key stakeholders.We must get to grips with this and put the solution in place before another year passes. The current situation is putting crews and the public at risk. It is putting the lives of everyone at risk.

The work its members undertake involves a significant sacrifice, yet their pay and working conditions do not match the significant time, effort and sacrifice involved. Therefore, it is little wonder that the service is haemorrhaging firefighters. The loss of such dedicated, highly trained and experienced personnel represents a huge loss to the service and has to be addressed. The result of the loss of personnel is that the remaining firefighters are put under extreme pressure. This is compounded by recruitment and retention problems. We are seeing this in every local authority right across the State. A recent study conducted by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage laid bare the difficulties facing the service. Almost 60% of its members said they intend to leave it in the near future. That represents a crisis. If this comes to pass, it will mean the collapse of the service within a few short years. In Drogheda, the largest town in Ireland, retained ranks have not been operating at their full complement since 2016. At present, only six out of ten retained firefighter positions are filled. This is a problem right across County Louth. When we look at the terms and conditions of the workers, it becomes clear to us why this has arisen. The firefighters work six 24-hour shifts in a row, with only two days off. That is 144 hours per week, during which they have to be able to respond to their station within five minutes. As Drogheda, which is but one example, grows in size and the housing crisis worsens, this will become increasingly untenable and totally unrealistic. Some firefighters are finding it impossible to adhere to the turnout time, which in turn affects their pay. I know a firefighter who sits in his car in a car park all day when he is on call to be able to respond on time. Other issues affecting retention include insufficient rest periods between shifts and pay that does not reflect the work carried out by the firefighters. The Government needs to meet representatives of the service. Enough is enough at this stage. We also need a thorough review of the entire service across the State to address the issues I have mentioned. If the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage were tasked with the review, we could have the report by early spring. This would allow for real reform sooner rather than later. The time for the Government to act is now.

The proposals being put forward by Sinn Féin are to address the retention crisis, particularly in the retained firefighter sector. This is a matter the Minister must address. We do not have time on our side. Correspondence from the National Retained Firefighters Association outlines that the current staffing level is now at crisis point. The service is no longer fit for purpose. Sixty percent of staff intend to retire or exit in the near future. We are at crisis point due to the failure of Governments to engage with the firefighters' representatives. There is a danger to the safety of both firefighters and the public. Pay and conditions have deteriorated to the point where crews now feel they have no option but to consider, reluctantly, industrial action. Ballot returns show that 97% in some areas favour industrial action. This is indicative of the crisis we face. Firefighters must work extra hours and forego family time, and the retainer pay they receive does not come close to compensating them for their sacrifices. Staff shortages are critical across the State, including Laois and Offaly. I have raised this with the Taoiseach on the floor of the Dáil. New recruits are not entering the service. We need a solution quickly. Crews are on call 24-7-12 in the various areas and are in understaffed stations. In Rathdowney, for example, the crew is down to five people, although there are supposed to be nine at a minimum. In Abbeyleix, it is down to six. That is the situation we are in. I want the Department to prioritise new fire stations for Rathdowney and Stradbally, both of which are in County Laois. However, unless we address the staffing issues, increased capital investment in new stations and modern equipment will be meaningless. Sinn Féin is calling for the establishment of an all-party joint committee. Let us work together on this to have an independent review of fire services. The reviewers will have to consult all stakeholders and examine pay and conditions, management and rosters. The review should be completed within four months. The reform of the service must not be delayed any longer. I welcome the retained firefighters who were present today to make their case. Theirs is a very positive move. We need to hear what they are saying loud and clear and act on it.

I welcome the men and women of the retained fire service. Everybody here today will commend their bravery. Every time they go out on a call, they put their lives or health at risk. They are not just involved in firefighting as they are also involved in dealing with cardiac arrests, vehicle crashes, river rescues, chemical spills and environmental protection issues. Earlier today, I took a few minutes to ask the firefighters what they want us to impress upon the Minister on the floor of the House today. They stated very clearly that the service is in crisis and that the 24-hour callout service for 365 days per year is simply broken and must be changed. They said that unless they are adequately paid and their rosters reflect the reality of their working times, they will not only be unable to retain staff but also will be unable to recruit. Therefore, there is urgency that I do not believe anybody could underestimate. The firefighters also made it very clear that it is becoming increasingly difficult to recruit young people because of the cost of childcare and the cost of living. They are keen to have additional training, particularly to ensure they will be able to do the very best job for their communities and themselves. I do not believe a single retained firefighter who voted for industrial action wants to take that action. They want the Minister to act and ensure they do not have to take the action they are balloting for. All I ask the Minister to do today is support this motion. He should support the very sensible propositions of Deputy Brady. He should also support the men and women in the Visitors Gallery and ensure they get the right pay and terms and conditions and communities get the service they rightly deserve.

Their dedication to their communities is second to none and their passion for their job is exemplary. They are often the first on the scene for emergencies such as car crashes, cardiac arrests and suicide attempts. They are often the first port of call in providing much-needed support for families in times of trouble. The current setup of the retained fire service is not workable. Recruitment has reached an all-time low because of the stark pay and conditions. The pressure on the firefighters' families is enormous. There are significant issues with work–life balance. As one firefighter put it, when you join the retained fire service, your family joins with you. There is a substantial question mark over EU law and whether standby hours count as working time under the working time directive, as was ruled in favour of a Belgian retained firefighter in 2018. These issues arise in the context of other crises. In County Wexford, you must live within 2.5 km of the station to be part of a retained crew. With the acute housing crisis, this is nearly impossible for people, and many cannot secure a mortgage. The cost-of-living crisis is putting additional pressure on crews, resulting in experienced and passionate firefighters having to leave the job because of financial pressure. This loss of expertise is detrimental to the service. Firefighters I have spoken to are adamant that within five years or less, if the current conditions are allowed to continue, there will be no one left in the service. We need an Oireachtas committee to conduct a full and independent review of how the national fire service is delivered. We need key recommendations on the issues outlined today, such as pay, conditions and management structures within the service. It is no use providing new fire stations if there is no one to man them. It is like buying a new car but discovering too late that there is no one to drive it. I ask all Deputies to support this motion.

I thank Deputy Brady and his colleagues for tabling this motion and providing time for this debate. I welcome the members of the retained service who are here this evening in the Gallery.It is an important debate. As many of those present know, I have had a real admiration for and interest in the work of our fire services for many years - long before I ever had ministerial responsibility for this aspect of my portfolio. It is an area of responsibility that I retain directly and one that I take very seriously. I visit fire stations on a regular basis. I meet firefighters, senior management and local authorities. I always take the time to talk and to listen. I will address many of the issues that have been raised here this evening. I want to see how things are working on the ground and ask what I as Minister and my Department can do to improve things. We have 2,065 retained firefighters in this country. We have just over 1,200 permanent firefighters, who deserve to be supported. As Minister with responsibility for the fire service, I am acutely aware that retained firefighters provide an invaluable service that is essential to their own communities and to the public. There is no doubt but that retained firefighters, first and foremost, save lives, prevent damage to residential and commercial property, protect critical infrastructure and safeguard our environment. The work of these brave men and women is dangerous, physically challenging and psychologically demanding. Our firefighters are an elite front-line service staffed by dedicated and selfless people serving their communities around the clock all year round. This was reinforced to me as I closely followed the response of the fire service in Donegal, which is a retained service, in the aftermath of the Creeslough tragedy. Like everyone here, I witnessed their dedication and courage and saw the training and professionalism in action, dealing with the devastating destruction that impacted the heart of that community in Creeslough. The response to this terrible tragedy involved a tremendous co-operative effort between fire services, An Garda Síochána, the National Ambulance Service, the Coast Guard, Donegal County Council staff, HSE staff and colleagues across the Border as well. It demonstrated to me that the systems we have in place in the form of the guidance document, A Framework for Major Emergency Management, work. Its principles guide those who manage the various intricate strands of co-ordination necessary to ensure an effective response to such incidents. I again take this opportunity to convey my deepest condolences to those who lost family and friends, and genuinely thank all of those who were involved in the rescue operations. I am acutely aware of the very significant challenges associated with both retention and recruitment of retained fire personnel being experienced in some areas around the country. As Minister with responsibility, I took note of comments that came out of the review that was undertaken of all fire services to identify lessons, review good practice and assess resilience measures during the response to the public health emergency. This report, Response, Recovery and Resilience, presented to the management board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management, NDFEM, highlighted the common challenges being shared by many fire services in recruitment and retention of retained firefighters and the urgent need to review the model of service delivery. As a result, I requested the management board of the national directorate to undertake such a review, the terms of which were agreed by the board. I am pleased to inform the House that a report detailing the findings of this review is in the final stages of preparation. That was based on meetings, collaborative discussions and engagement with key stakeholders, most importantly, the staff and management representatives in the retained fire services themselves. This process was underpinned by the pre-existing structures and relationships that we have between the local authorities and the NDFEM. It would concern me somewhat if there was any doubt about the consultation involved when this process was undertaken. We must now move towards implementation. At the outset, a quantitative survey was carried out of retained firefighters to evaluate their role and seek their opinions of the retained fire service. Of those surveyed, more than 900 retained personnel responded, including 869 current members and approximately 65 who had recently retired. My Department and I have always been conscious of the need to fully engage with retained firefighters and their representatives, together with the employer side. These matters have implications for both sides. The national directorate has worked closely with the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, and has engaged on numerous occasions with the fire services national oversight and implementation group, FSNOIG, which Members know is chaired by David Begg. For those who are not familiar with it, the formation of this oversight and implementation group was at the request of SIPTU, which is the union mandated to represent retained firefighters. I have met the group and SIPTU representatives as well. Its establishment was greeted by staff representatives as a "means by which our members in both the full-time and retained fire services will have full participation in the future development of a modern, effective and efficient fire and rescue service." An overview of the findings of this review have been shared with staff representatives through FSNOIG and with the NDFEM management board, and they have been broadly welcomed. Implementing the recommendations of the retained review is an absolute priority for me. This will require a sequence of steps that will include the development of a new model for service delivery with rostered time off for retained firefighters to improve their work-life balance. I believe this is the best course of action. The opportunity must now be given for engagement with all sides to ensure we have a fire service model that works for the public it serves and ensures that all retained firefighters have an appropriate work-life balance. That will allow us to attract new recruits into the service and retain the very valuable experience of staff within the retained fire services. While the recommendations of this review have yet to be approved, an overview of the findings have been shared with staff representatives and with the board. The findings point to some very challenging issues in terms of structure, culture and service delivery. It is clear that issues in relation to work-life balance, rostering models, area-risk categorisation and pay and conditions are all ones that now need to be addressed. The activity levels within the service are also challenging, with 76% of stations responding to fewer than three calls per week, and the trend of incident levels dropping over the longer term. This impacts on the salary that can be earned by retained firefighters. The most striking finding revealed by research on the profile of the workforce is the shockingly low level of participation by female firefighters, at less than 2%. I believe that a focus now needs to be placed on ensuring that the retained fire service is seen as an attractive option in which women can develop a career. My Department continues its support for all fire services in Ireland, with a new capital programme of €61 million over five years. This will continue to support the building of 12 new fire stations already under way, the provision of a further six new fire stations, as well as nine station refurbishments. In order to maintain a reliable fleet in optimal condition, a total of €27.7 million has been allocated for fire appliances, which will be delivered in two tranches. In the first tranche, 35 new appliances will be provided at an approximate cost of €16 million. The NDFEM is currently working with the Office of Government Procurement on a potential extension of the fire appliance scheme, to run from May 2023 to May 2025, with a further budget of €17 million. A further €5 million will support the procurement of other fire and rescue equipment and €2 million has been allocated to further progress the Ctrí programme, the new command and control system for 999 call answering. My Department also continuously works with local authorities on the training of all firefighters. While I fully respect the bona fides of the points put across, I reject one comment that has been made this evening. Plant and equipment are crucially important. We must make sure that stations are upgraded, new stations are built and that firefighters, both full-time and retained, have access to the best equipment possible and that we expand it. It is not the case that it is of no use. We accept the issues identified in the review. The recommendations following on from it will shortly be published.There are the issues with pay and conditions. There are issues with rostering to ensure a proper work-life balance and that we have a mechanism that means the service is seen as attractive to new entrants. That is what I want to happen and it is why we will proceed quickly with the full publication of those recommendations. We will work them through to implementation with management and most importantly with staff and staff representatives, who have engaged in this process heretofore. I am very serious about seeing this through towards implementation and I welcome support from Deputies across the House for the implementation of improved pay and conditions and rostering. The way to do that is not by kicking it off to the joint committee. Much of that work has been done already with regard to the review itself, the high-level recommendations of which have been given to staff representatives. It is now about getting that published and working through the recommendations there to see how quickly we can implement them. I hope my bona fides in this regard are there for people to see. We have ensured we have a capital plan. It is so important the equipment our firefighters use and the stations they work out of are of the standard required in modern-day Ireland. We now want to ensure staff themselves have the pay, rostering and work conditions they deserve and I am committed to doing that. I am happy to work with Members across the House and with firefighters across the country. I meet them regularly and met some as recently as yesterday during my visit to Kilkenny. I commend them on the work they do and want to see those recommendations through to implementation.

There was acceptance the model for retained firefighters is not working and that the issues with pay, conditions, rostering and the fact the job is not attractive must be dealt with. That is why the firefighters are watching proceedings from the Gallery at the moment. It is the reason a huge amount of them made the journey to Dublin. We all realise we are talking about local authorities across this State that are under severe pressure when it comes to being able to put a full quotient of firefighters into operation. In many cases local authorities cannot put forward a full complement. That means we are dealing with firefighters who are under severe pressure. The Minister spoke, as Deputy Mac Lochlainn did, about what firefighters did in Creeslough. I am aware of what they do. The last time I went to visit a scene was close to my house in Dundalk, where firefighters bravely fought the flames at a waste plant and brought the fire under control. Councillor Antóin Watters and I spent a considerable amount of time with firefighters fighting blazes on the Cooley Mountains. We all realise the absolutely necessary work that needs to be done. People have talked about six 24-hour shifts, 144 hours per week, split by two days and then another six days of the same. That is just not doable in any way, shape or form. Whether the Minister agrees with our motion and is going to follow through with the review process we are talking about or whether he is talking about an alternative, we know for certain we have a system that is ready to fail. In County Louth, Deputy Munster and Councillor Joanna Byrne have been to the forefront in talking about the huge difficulties in Drogheda. From speaking to retained firefighters from Carlingford to Drogheda, we know we do not have a system that is working and fit for purpose. We need action to happen as soon as possible. We do not particularly care how the Minister does it but he must make it happen as soon as possible.

He has a long history of advocacy on this issue. Credit must also go to the National Retained Firefighters Association of Ireland. We debate health and emergency measures in the House regularly and the issues that occur in other areas are unfortunately relevant here too. Fire services are understaffed to dangerous levels and experienced firefighters are leaving at a rapid rate. The sacrifices we ask these individuals to make on our behalf are extreme and many face the risk of death and injury weekly. A poor work-life balance, bad conditions, and paltry pay all play a role in many walking away. With a guaranteed income of only €8,500, many find obtaining a mortgage a struggle. This is in a job where people are on call 24-7 and have fewer days off per year than do those in similar roles. This puts a massive strain on people and their families. I spoke to a firefighter from Kerry today who said he could be out in the car with his children and get a call, meaning his partner has to come to the station as well, so families are on call too. Pensions are poor and as a result progression is difficult, with a top-heavy management structure. In Kerry there have been regular gorse, grass and bush fires. Radio Kerry reported that in one weekend last summer, nearly two thirds of calls were related to these types of fire. Firefighters must be supported when such events occur. There is a particular crisis with retention in Kerry. In larger towns like Tralee or Killarney there could be a number of calls but this decreases across the county. In addition, firefighters face difficulty when it comes to weather warnings as there are no nationally-agreed protocols on whether it is safe or not for them to work during such warnings. The national directorate has no representation of retained firefighters on it and there is a worrying element of confusion about the future of the service. This was added to by the Taoiseach who told my colleague, Deputy Stanley, the issues must be dealt with by the local authorities in the context of existing industrial relations mechanisms. However, more recently he changed his tune and questioned whether local authorities should have retained firefighters at all. That is not good enough for the public or for workers. We need an urgent review of pay and conditions on a cross-party basis and I call on all Kerry Deputies to support this motion.

Perhaps that could be rectified before the end of the debate. The cause and effect of why we are debating this matter are clear, namely, a lack of political leadership over many years, almost a disdain for retained fire services, a model of delivery that is broken and now the fact 60% of firefighters intend to leave with many of them planning to do so within the next year. I am somewhat perplexed by the Government amendment in which the Minister sees fit to compare firefighters to other staff in local authorities. With the greatest of respect to them, to say it is like apples and oranges comes nowhere near it. Increases in capital investment, refurbishment of stations and all the new equipment are all meaningless if there are not enough firefighters to use it. Any investment must be done on a fit-for-purpose model and with the appropriate oversight. The retained firefighters cannot retain experienced personnel, nor recruit significant amounts of new members, due to the pay and conditions of the job. That is what the focus of the Government should be. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the role of our retained fire services, especially the valued first responders from both Westmeath and Longford, who are in the Gallery this evening with their colleagues. I thank them for their tireless work and their commitment. I thank also their families and employers, without whose support they simply would not be able to do the valuable work we need and ask them to do. Despite all the problems, many of which the Minister listed, they show up, they do their job and they serve our communities to the best of their abilities. Despite this, contained in the Government amendment the Minister has the audacity to cite "4.3 deaths per million of population of fire fatalities" as if these firefighters' only role is to turn up to fires. That is what is insinuated in this. We are all in agreement this situation cannot be allowed to continue. I am going to ask, as my colleagues have done before, that the Minister support this motion. The review he mentioned apparently went to him as a draft in February and it is now November. The commitment by the firefighters is not being met by a similar level of commitment from the Government. That is a fundamental flaw in any solution that may be put forward. These are professional and dedicated people. They want to make the fire service better. They want to make it a safer place to work for all their members but that commitment needs to be matched by the Government.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-15 00:00:00	Death of Vicky Phelan: Expressions of Sympathy	277	I welcome the firefighters in the Gallery and thank them for bringing this to the Dáil. They are the courageous men and women who put their lives on the line for us daily and we owe them a debt of gratitude. Fire services face huge challenges when it comes to keeping their firefighters ready for the dangerous tasks they face each day, in their response times and in ensuring they can keep communities safe.It is clear there is a developing crisis in the fire service, however, particularly with regard to retention. In a report to be completed by the end of the year by a project team under the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage into recruitment and retention issues within the retained fire services, some of its conclusion showed that 74% of retained fire services have difficulty in recruiting firefighters while a further 45% have difficulty in retaining firefighters. Staff shortages meant that up to four trucks were not in service because the fire service did not have the staff to operate them. This is a very serious matter with huge implications not just for the safety of the firefighters, but also for their ability to carry out the tasks assigned to them in a safe and professional manner. If a fire station does not have a sufficient number of firefighters then it does not have the ability to carry out all its necessary functions such as being adequately able to put out a fire at a premises, carry out search and rescue, ensure proper ventilation and water supply and ensure rapid intervention, all of which require a big team. This should be a minimum standard, particularly in a constituency like Dublin North-West, which is populated with large housing estates, high-rise apartment blocks and big hotels. Retained firefighters face even bigger challenges and uncertainty on a daily basis. Retention and adequate budgets impact on the operation of the fire service including training, proper equipment and maintenance of the services. It also impacts on firefighter safety concerns. The safety of firefighters is a critical concern for all of us. They have a dangerous and stressful job. They risk long-term health issues by being exposed to smoke that may contain carcinogens. For our part, it is our responsibility as public representatives to keep our firefighters safe and free from all the problems they are facing. While the fire service is under-resourced and understaffed, all our lives and the lives of the members of the fire service are put at risk. Last Friday, I spent more than two hours at the scene of an accident. It took that long to get the fire ambulance and ambulance services to the scene. The problem was that ambulances and fire ambulances were parked outside the hospital acting like a ward because they could not get people inside. The hospital was overcrowded and they could not move people inside. That needs to be looked at very seriously.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	18241	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-15 00:00:00	Death of Vicky Phelan: Expressions of Sympathy	279	We in Labour support the call of retained firefighters for a more sustainable and improved working model including decent pay, fixed incomes and structured, limited working hours that are consistent with the European working time directive. The current recruitment and retention crisis is a result of poor terms and conditions of employment and the constant failure to resource and fund adequately the retained fire service. Retained firefighters are on call 24 hours per day, 340 days per year. Retainers are paid between €8,696 and €11,907 depending on experience. Salary and pay depends on the number of call-outs workers attend, however, meaning that many are forced to work second jobs or avail of social welfare payments to supplement their income. Furthermore, the lack of a fixed income makes it difficult for retained firefighters to get a mortgage. I have first-hand experience of that with constituents of mine. Retained firefighters are effectively locked out of social participation. When they are called to duty, they must be within five minutes of the fire station. This places severe restrictions on their ability to participate in everyday activities such as bringing their children to school, playing a football match, visiting relatives, attending social occasions or even going for a short walk. They are essentially under a form of house arrest while on call. It is unfathomable that we would expect these workers to put up with such conditions. Poor pay and conditions have resulted in this crisis of retention and recruitment. Some sources indicate that as many as 60% of workers, and we heard this already tonight, are considering leaving the service in the very near future. Staff shortages among the fire service pose a serious threat to delivery and consequently to everyone's safety. If a crew responding to an emergency does not have sufficient numbers to enter a fire, we could be talking about a potential loss of life. The last collective agreement made with retained firefighters was 23 years ago and the model has not kept pace with the changes to the socioeconomic and working landscape of the country. Retained firefighters are suffering economically, socially and mentally. It is time the Government introduced a more sustainable model that will address the recruitment and retention crisis and show these vital workers that it recognises their value and contribution to our safety as citizens by providing them with good pay and working conditions. They deserve nothing less. They are our friends, neighbours and family members. We know them; they live within our communities. They are always around and always on call. We must value them. I echo the points of previous Deputies in respect of the fact that we have not been issued with a copy of the Minister's speech. It is important in debates like this for us to have a copy in order that we can parse the words of the Minister as he is speaking so we can respond on the hoof, as it were. I note that he said the review will be published shortly. He talked about changes in structures, culture and the delivery model. He spoke about a sequence of steps for a new model of delivery. To be fair to him, I have no doubt about the Minister's bona fides in seeking to arrive at a solution whereby everybody can be dealt with to the satisfaction of all. I suggest to the Minister that this is not just about statistics regarding fires. We know it is important to have an assessment of the other services that are delivered by retained firefighters in terms of call-outs. There needs to be a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the types of call-outs that take place in communities such as those I serve in which firefighters are called out for any manner and number of reasons. That must also be factored in when the Minister talks about a new model of delivery. The bottom line for all of us is that in supporting the Sinn Féin motion, we acknowledge the role of firefighters within our communities. We have all done that collectively tonight but we must now move beyond the phase of empathy and sympathy for their position into a phase where we have some regard to concrete timelines for delivery. If I understand the Minister correctly, he is saying he is moving or seeks to move in that direction and that he will work with the interested parties to deliver a new model. Inherent within that, however, must be a recognition of the pay and conditions of workers. There needs to be a significant improvement on that. If I were to ask the Minister one thing tonight, it would be to give us some concrete timeline in respect of when he expects this process to be completed with a view to ensuring that everything he spoke about in his appreciation of the work retained firefighters do will be recognised and in that appreciation and recognition of their role, the fruits of their labour will be recognised and we will see real and concrete delivery of better pay and conditions as the primary aim of all of this. Will he please give us the timelines as to when that will be delivered? The Minister spoke of the implications for both sides. I am not quite sure exactly what he means when he says that. I suppose he is talking about the workers and the employer. There is always a way of finding solutions, however. Ultimately, we want to ensure that we have a cohort of professional people and that it is an attractive profession to enter. The Minister said that is what he wants to achieve. Let us take him at his word. He might give us timelines, however. I also note the Minister made reference to gender equality in respect of recruitment and retention. We absolutely support him in that regard. At the end of the day, I was hopeful that we would have a set of timelines.I would not accuse the Minister of this, to be fair, but very often we have aspirational and empathetic statements by Ministers coming before us. What the people in the Gallery and those watching outside really want is a clear indication of the timelines for delivery. That is the bottom line. When will this new model be rolled out? What is the timeline and the stage-gate process that has to be gone through to ensure we get over all the hurdles and challenges? We must ensure that in the communities that we all serve, there is a fit-for-purpose retained fire service in which morale is high and the staff are happy to do their jobs. We must continue to recognise the work they are doing and ensure the terms and conditions of employment are fit for purpose and are not anachronistic. We should not take them for granted. If I dare say it, I think they may be taken for granted within our communities. That is something that needs to be addressed seriously. The process the Minister talks about seems to be real, if it is chaired by Mr. Begg. However, we will have to see implementation of it.

I recognise his very long track record in this area, highlighting the issues that affect the fire services. On behalf of the Social Democrats, I strongly support the motion and support the retained firefighters who are campaigning for a basic level of decency in the way they are treated. It is a pity the Government has tabled an amendment to the motion. It would have been better for us to unite as a Dáil in support of it. I welcome the firefighters who are here in the Gallery. The best way for all of us to support the work done by firefighters and all front-line staff is not through praise and plaudits but by ensuring that enough staff are deployed, properly paid and treated well, to allow the work to be done safely. Another one of the best ways to support firefighters is to ensure buildings are built in compliance with fire safety standards and regulations so that firefighters' and residents' lives are not unnecessarily put at risk. We have heard from other Deputies about the very professional, dedicated service that is provided by firefighters and retained firefighters in communities across the country. It extends well beyond the traditional work of firefighters and involves matters such as cardiac arrest, dealing with environmental emergencies and dealing with suicides. Fire services and retained firefighters play a key role in our communities. The Minister rightly acknowledged all the key issues, including work-life balance, the need to attract younger people into roles, rostering, pay and conditions. However, I question the urgency of his response. He told us that these issues now need to be addressed. He has been in office two and a half years. These issues need to be addressed, but they should have been addressed before now. The Government should not have let it get to this crisis situation. The Minister said the review will be published shortly and that we must get it published. What is holding him up in publishing the review? Why has he not done it?  I want to address the issue of female participation which the Minister raised. He has a key responsibility in this. If he addressed the issues the firefighters are bringing to the fore around their work, conditions, pay and rostering, all that would help us get more female participation in the fire services. The Minister must address the issues that are being brought forward tonight and by the campaign run by the firefighters. The Minister mentioned the refurbishing and updating of fire stations throughout the country. As he knows, many of them were built 40 to 50 years ago. The facilities are completely inadequate in the context of the modern world. Many of the staff have no dignity or privacy in these stations. Some stations have communal showers. They also have locker areas in corridors where people have no privacy. It is not appropriate in any sense and certainly not appropriate in terms of trying to broaden diversity within the workforce. The Minister has responsibility for addressing this. The local authorities are left to modernise and refurbish the stations out of their own budgets, without sufficient support. This is an issue firefighters have raised with me. It is not tolerable that fire services nationally are understaffed and under-resourced. The Minister knows that this puts the lives of firefighters, residents and the general public at risk. There need to be standards set out as to what staffing levels are needed in the fire service. They need to be set out in legislation to ensure that local authorities comply. There are plenty of international examples where we do not compare well with other countries. The current system retained firefighters are operating under is archaic and not fit for purpose. It does not reflect the realities of modern-day life. It puts retained firefighters under significant pressure, for example, in having to pay higher rents to live in close proximity to fire stations, or not being able to secure mortgages. These are heightened pressures in the current housing disaster that we have. Not being able to travel outside a certain radius and being on call for such long periods, unable to visit or meet family, is particularly onerous. It does not compare internationally with other retained firefighters. It goes without saying that we need to keep and retain the skills and experience that we have in this very important line of work. We need an emergency response from the Government on this. Nationally and internationally, there is an issue whereby retained firefighters are not being replaced. In other jurisdictions, they have gone much further to address this than has been the case here. In the Shropshire, for example, retained fire service the maximum on-call time for members is about 48 hours per week less than is the case in Ireland. This gives people more flexibility. They also offer that people can be available for 75%, 50%, or 33% of the on-call time, which gives people different options. If we are looking to diversity in the workforce, that would help. On staffing levels, the authorities in Shropshire require 12 on-call firefighters in order to deliver a minimum of four firefighters. That is they way they operate. They have 18 to 24 retained firefighters to cover a single pump in a station. I touched on the issue of ensuring safety for our fire service workers and residents. That is tied in with our building standards and regulation of building compliance with fire safety standards. High-rise buildings have been mentioned by others. There is a certainly an issue. Firefighters in Dublin tell me that they do not have sufficient training and that there is not sufficient equipment either. There is limited equipment for any building over seven or eight storeys. I also want to refer to the ban on combustible facade materials.In Ireland, the ban only applies to buildings. It applies to institutional buildings and buildings over 80 m high. The situation here is that it is perfectly legal to put combustible material on the outside of apartment blocks of three, four and five storeys. That is in a country where we know there is somewhere in the region of 100,000 apartments with fire safety and other serious defects. It is completely irresponsible to continue to have a situation where combustible materials can be put on the facades of the buildings to which I refer. I would have thought after Grenfell, when more than 70 people lost their lives, that those lessons would be strongly learned here. If the Government was serious about fire safety, it would address these issues and ensure that all fire services are properly staffed and resourced and that they are not understaffed and under-resourced. It would treat retained firefighters with the respect they deserve in order they can bring their contracts and conditions into the 21st century and so that we can have the fire services everyone wants to see.

I attended a vigil for both of them at the time. Their lives were lost at a fire in the town. Our thoughts are with their families, friends and colleagues. Like others, I welcome all their colleagues to the Dáil. I went down and spent a few minutes with them earlier. I want to indicate to them that we fully support this motion from Sinn Féin and commend Deputy Brady on the work he has done in respect of it and for the work he has done over the years. It is striking that 15 years on from such a tragedy, a vital and lifesaving service such as the retained firefighter service in the State continues to be treated almost like a voluntary service. It is relegated in its importance and stature, almost to the point that it is seen as equal to the lifeboat service or the Coast Guard. All of them save lives, but a lot of our essential services are run on what is practically a voluntary basis. When I talked to the men and women involved about the current conditions, pay and life they have, they indicated that it is almost voluntary. It is disgraceful that this is still going on. We cannot, legally, morally or physically, run any aspect of society without a fire service. Why this has happened and been allowed to degenerate so far is beyond me. I cannot personalise it to the Minister; he has only been the Minister for two and a half years but he is of a party that has been in power for a long time and his colleagues in power, Fine Gael, were in power when he was not in power. The buck has to stop somewhere and perhaps it is the Department or it is the Minister and his predecessors. I accept the Minister's bona fides when he says that he is enthusiastic about the service, that he is committed to it and that he is waiting for this review to come out. Unfortunately, what the firefighters and I are hearing is that the review is done, that there has been engagement with the representatives - although that is not clear from the motion - and that we are waiting for the publication of the review. It is a bit like what I hear in respect of many issues in this House. I heard the same thing from the Taoiseach this afternoon about the retired workers Bill, which has been sitting for 17 months with no movement whatsoever, while people who are retired get older and older and more and more frustrated. Interestingly, today's march was dubbed the march of frustration and that is understandable from the point of view of the workers who are in the Gallery. I did a Google search of the term "retained firefighters" today in order to find out what has been happening in the field recently. What comes up is that almost every county in the State is desperately trying to recruit members because there is a chronic shortfall in staffing, whether it is in Wexford, Kerry, Waterford, Sligo, Mayo or Donegal. All of the counties are all chronically short-staffed. This is not anything new; two years before they died, Mark O'Shaughnessy and Brian Murray took part in a local protest in Bray to highlight safety concerns around the issue of the understaffing at the station. Instead of having 15 firefighters at the time, Bray had ten. Whenever we ask questions in this House about what is happening with this service we are told it is an issue for the relevant local authority. I was a councillor for seven years and I know there are issues with local authorities and the fire service but technically the buck stops here, particularly because we cannot run a society, legally, safely or any other way, without a fire service. It is a two-way street but the State does not value some of its most important front-line workers. Passing the buck to local authorities is not good enough. It has to stop. The question was asked as to timelines for the review and implementation. The Minister will come back on that but my overall point on the motion is that these people did not travel here today and take it this seriously because the Minister was sitting on a review. It is because of the systemic neglect of these people and the service over many decades, and somebody has be accountable for it. I want to focus on the question of being available within 5 km of your station and the knock-on effect that has. One of the key things that came up today in my discussion with firefighters was the question of housing, namely, the affordability of housing and the lack of availability of mortgages because of the pay they are on. No matter what town or city you are living in these days, rents are too high. If you can get a place to rent, it is too expensive. All of these problems stem from the Minister's role and job. In his Department, we also have a housing crisis that has a knock-on effect on the real lives of ordinary workers. The same could be said of nurses, teachers and so many people who leave this country or our cities because the cost of accommodation forces them to do so. An astonishing 97% of these workers voted in favour of strike action. That has to be taken into account when the Minister is looking at how seriously they take what has happened to them and the frustration they feel in the context of trying to move things forward, all the while meeting nothing but obstacles and delay after delay. That is why they had to form the National Retained Firefighters Association. The Minister has the capacity to solve this problem. The Government has done the wrong thing by proposing an alternative to the motion. That is the wrong thing to do because it divides the House on and us-versus-them basis. The evidence is there that those on the other side of the House, those who rule, have let down the men and women of the retained firefighter service over the years. If they end up on the picket lines we will be with them 1,000%. Most people do not want to ever have to go on strike but if they do so that puts the Minister and the local authorities of breaking the law because they will not have provided fire protection and a service for their citizens. We will be with them but we need to stop passing the buck and to take responsibility. We need answers from the Minister.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-15 00:00:00	Death of Vicky Phelan: Expressions of Sympathy	282	Cork City Fire Brigade has been operating at 75% strength for the past year. When the city boundary was extended in 2019, the civic fire service took on the station at Ballincollig, the retained staff there and an extra truck. Since then, the retained firefighters have been promoted to full-time positions and are based at the fire station headquarters on Anglesea Street in the city centre. In taking those positions they replaced other firefighters who retired. There are now no retained officers at Ballincollig and the city is left with four pumps, with only enough staff to man three of them. The number of full-time firefighters covering a population of 240,000 in the extended city boundary, is the same as the number that previously covered 126,000 people. Full-time staffing in the Cork city area is the same today as it was in 1975. This is dangerous for the population and the firefighters. Late last week, the fire at R&H Hall should have been attended by four trucks.It was instead attended by just two because a truck should always be kept in reserve. This summer, a woman jumped into the River Lee at Morrison’s Island. The person who went in to rescue her also got into trouble. A rescue unit crewed by two firefighters arrived on the scene, but no fire pumps were available - the nearest was in Carrigaline. The officer was faced with a choice of jumping in without sufficient back-up or watching the woman drown. He decided to jump in. That kind of stuff looks good on television. Luckily, he succeeded in rescuing the woman and the second person made it to the ladder on the quay wall. In reality, that officer risked his life by taking a chance he should never have been forced to even consider. I call on the Minister to instruct Cork City Council to crew the Ballincollig fire station with sufficient full-time staff to crew the fourth pump. This is a vital and crucial issue. I call on the Minister to move on that. If Cork City Council does not take action, he needs to instruct it to do so.
#MattShanahan	unknown-#MattShanahan-party	unknown-#MattShanahan-dob	unknown-#MattShanahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-15 00:00:00	Death of Vicky Phelan: Expressions of Sympathy	283	As the Minister outlined and heard from other speakers, we have significant problems within the retained fire service nationally. I will give some statistics for the Waterford fire stations. We have 32 full-time and 16 retained firefighters in the fire service in Waterford city. This crew of 48 handles approximately 450 calls per year. Outside the city, Kilmacthomas has six retained firefighters who handle between 120 and 150 calls per year. In Dunmore East, four retained firefighters deal with 80 calls each year and in Portlaw, six firefighters handle between 120 and 150 calls. What is most interesting about this is that the retained fire service often deals with traffic accidents. The N25, which services Waterford and the Kilmacthomas area up to Dungarvan, is now the worst road in the country for accidents and we are asking a depleted fire service to attend those accidents. I will read a couple of notes from someone in the fire service in County Waterford who pointed out the major problems the service faces. Most stations are only crewed to 50% manning levels. The person highlights that no negotiated agreement has been in place since 1999 for a composite pay agreement. The average pay for a retained firefighter is €9,000 per annum, plus payments for call-outs. As the Minister knows, the number of call-outs has declined from some stations as the permanent fire service rather than the retained service is being called out. Firefighters cannot get loans for cars or mortgages because these are guided by the retained amounts of pay they receive. The average pension for a firefighter with 30 years' service attending 50 calls per annum will be €28.67 per week. One would wonder why people would do it at all - I certainly do. Retention is a big problem, as the Minister highlighted, as is the lack of work-life balance. Firefighters are being asked not to take time off because the service is so depleted. To maintain the service they cannot go outside a five-mile radius of their station when they are on call and they cannot take annual leave. Those are significant problems. I can well understand the frustration of firefighters nationally coming to Dáil Éireann today to try to present their case and see whether Government is listening to their problems. I listened to the Minister’s opening statement with a great deal of attention. He highlighted the 2,065 retained firefighters in the country and the 1,200 who he said do an invaluable service and are essential to communities and the public. There is no doubt that the retained firefighters, first and foremost, save lives, prevent damage and assist in safeguarding residential and commercial property. We know exactly what firefighters do and the invaluable service they give. However, we also know we are not paying them properly. We know that because we cannot retain people in the service or attract people to the service. Some 50% of those who are in the fire service have indicated they wish to get out of it as soon as possible. The Minister highlighted that a review is taking place and I understand it was established recently. He also said it will examine significant matters, including roster times for retained firefighters, improvements in their work-life balance, attracting new recruits into the service, particularly young females, and retaining the very valuable experience in the retained fire service. These are all very laudable tasks and nobody could argue with them but the question is how to achieve that. The problem is that firefighters, like many others in the emergency services, have been hearing that help is on the way and the cavalry is just over the hill so they should hang in there because we are listening and working. The Minister, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, has left the Chamber. This review cannot come quickly or hard enough. We saw in the incident in Creeslough recently just how important the fire service is. What would we have done up there after that explosion if there had not been a manned fire service available to present with the ambulance people? How would that have looked? I ask the Minister to expedite this review and pay firefighters properly. They must be given proper terms and conditions for the critical work they do in supporting and helping our communities.

I thank Sinn Féin for tabling the motion. Last week, during questions on policy and promised legislation, I raised this issue with the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, responded. I acknowledge that significant investment is being made in the fire service in terms of infrastructure, new fire stations, fire tenders and all goes with that. In my constituency, a new fire station has opened in Tuam and it is a state-of-the-art facility. A contract for the construction of a new fire station in Athenry will be signed shortly and we are about to go through a Part 8 process for a new fire station in Loughrea. These are three centres in the Galway East constituency, which badly needs these fire stations in order that we have proper facilities in which firefighters can serve the people in they way they should. It is a credit that investment is being made because we know how important the service is. All three stations have retained firefighters. Despite this infrastructural investment, we have a concern. Speaking to the retained firemen who were outside the gates today, the biggest issue is the need to bring their infrastructure into the 21st century. They need now to viewed as people who are delivering a vital service in our society. They have expressed a view that they are being frustrated in attempts to talk about the core issue, namely, remuneration and recognition for the work they perform on a daily basis. A young person will not be attracted into fire service because the remuneration is not good enough. Retained firefighters receive a baseline retainment fee and a fixed amount per call-out. That type of payment does not augur well when they go to a mortgage broker to try to get a mortgage.  I know many people who go into the fire service. They have part-time or full-time jobs. Traditionally, local shopkeepers and publicans joined the service but that is no longer the case in the modern world. We have to make the service fit for purpose for those who deliver it, use a bit of common sense and show respect to these people. We could get much more from the fire service if we put in the effort. Firefighters do a lot a hell of a lot more than fight fires. They could get train in other aspects of healthcare for when they are needed in an emergency. The retained fire service proved its worth beyond a shadow of a doubt in what it did in Creeslough and throughout the Covid pandemic.Very quietly, they were there to provide back-up. They were a source of inspiration to many of us when we did not know what to do. There is a countermotion from the Government, which I think is wrong. We should all be as one on this matter. This is not something out of which we should be making a political point. The people who were outside the gates today did not want to be here. They were not sure what to do or say but when one got talking to them as individuals, one realised they were there because they believe they are being ignored. The only way we can disprove that is for a proper and fast engagement to talk about the issues that are affecting them. The number of people entering the service has been low. Some 60% of the existing retained firefighters have said they are going to leave the service. Are we going to wait until they are gone before we put our hands into the air and ask why we did not do something about it? We have an opportunity to do a lot. Rather than just sitting down and talking to those firefighters, we must deal with the nub of the problem. We must invest in the people themselves to ensure that at the end of the day, the retained firefighting service in this country is fit for purpose and fit to serve us all.

We talk about it in this House. Everywhere we go, we need to respect our colleagues and other people. Will we show respect to the firemen and firewomen in the Gallery and in every town and village in Tipperary and the rest of the country? They wait for a call to go out and put themselves in the line of danger to look after us. We are operating on a model that has been in place since the 1950s. Imagine that. The Government and successive Governments have let down these firefighters. A recent survey of retained firefighters indicated that 60% of the members of the service are intending to retire or leave in the next five years. That is an appalling vista. Gardaí are scarce on the ground now. On Sunday night, there was a fatality in Carrick-on-Suir and a fireman had to block the roads. That happens on a regular basis. On many occasions, the ambulance service is so depleted that firemen and firewomen have to sit with patients who, in many cases, are seriously injured. They must stay with such patients for hours while waiting for an ambulance because of the folly of having ambulances crisscrossing the country. The Government has damaged the ambulance service. It all falls back on volunteers and voluntary retained servicemen whom I salute from the bottom of my heart for the work they do and how they put themselves in danger. In Tipperary town, we have been short of firefighters for the past three or four years. The mandarins know about that. When there is a call in Tipperary town, a unit must be mobilised from Cashel or Cahir. That is a scandalous situation. Where is the back-up for those brave men and women if they need rescuing? We saw what happened in Creeslough in County Donegal. It can happen anywhere at the flick of a match. I spoke to a man named Mark this evening. He had to leave the service. He loved his job in the retained fire service but he was unable to get accommodation. These firefighters must reside within five minutes of their stations and they cannot get accommodation. That excludes a cohort of volunteers from rural Ireland who cannot join the service because it requires them to be on call and they do not live close enough to get there on time. It is time for us to cop on. I have seen the Government accepting motions willy-nilly in the past 12 or 15 months. It now has the audacity to oppose this motion. Shame on the Government and on the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke. The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, would not even wait for us to have our say. I salute the brave men and women of the retained fire service. We must look after and have respect for them.

Many of them had to go home because they are on call tonight in their respective counties. I welcome the people who came from County Kerry and the rest of the country. They are here not because they want to be here but because they have to be here. They must make the Minister of State and the Government listen. When Government leaders and Ministers go on the television after tragedies, the first thing they do is to thank the emergency services. It is the same situation as applied in respect of the nurses when the Government told people around the country to stand up and start clapping for them. That was among the most insulting, degrading things ever done to any sector of society. The same thing has happened to the people who are here tonight. They did not come here to hear us praising them. They did no such thing. They came to seek a thing called fair play and fair pay. It is the same situation as applied in respect of the nurses. Never mind clapping for them; pay them instead. It is the same for the firemen and the retained fire service. Give them proper money to allow them to live the same as everybody else and to have a mortgage the same as everybody else. They should be allowed the same opportunity to send their children to school as everybody else in every other walk of life. Why should they be treated as second-class citizens? In rural areas, it is a fact that when an ambulance is called out, the local fire service should also be called out. In many instances, the fire service could arrive to a scene quicker than an ambulance because the Government has made a right dog's dinner out of the ambulance service by centralising it to a disused fire station here in Dublin instead of keeping it in the local areas as was the case and where people had knowledge of the local area and its geography. The Government made a mess of that and it will do the same with the fire service if it is allowed to get away with it. We will not allow the Government to get away with it. I omitted at the start of my contribution to acknowledge the good work done by Sinn Féin. I thank its members for bringing forward this motion. I pay tribute to the fire service in Kerry, in particular to people such as Mr. Teddy McCarthy, the late Teddy "Chub" O'Connor, who walked the highways with us and who served his time as a chief in the Killorglin fire station. I pay tribute to all the other fire people in County Kerry.

I thank Sinn Féin for affording us the opportunity. I also thank all the firemen in the Gallery. I thank those who spoke to me outside the gates, some of whom were from Kerry. They had to go back because they are on duty tonight and have no way out of it. Another Kerry Deputy suggested that all the Kerry Deputies should support the firefighters. I can say to that Deputy that I have always supported the firefighters. I do not have to be told by him or anyone else to support the firefighters. I recognise the great work they do on the ground when they are called out. Teddy McCarthy, who was already mentioned, is from Sneem and his name comes to mind in this discussion. He acts as an ambulance in many instances because he arrives on the scene hours before an ambulance comes to that rural place. It must be recognised that these men have oxygen and all the things they need to help, including defibrillators and whatever else, and to ensure a person is kept alive. They can reduce a person's pain. They do so much more.  It has been pointed out to me that a firemen cannot be depended on to mind the children while his wife goes shopping because he could be gone when she comes back from the shop. Perhaps such a man would have to take the children with him to the fire station and ring someone to have the children collected. What kind of a life is that? Some of them are only being paid €175 to be retained 24-7. Imagine that. They are only paid €175 to be on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They cannot go or live more than five minutes away from the fire station. It is the same as being tied to the leg of the bed. They cannot go anywhere or do anything. It is a job that ties people down. I say to the Minister of State that the Government will have to recognise the calls and claims of these people for proper pay.

What is a retained fireman or firewoman? A retained firefighter is somebody who lives in the county and does not have set hours. Someone who rings those firefighters at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. looking for help is not only ringing the firefighter, but is also ringing their wife or husband and their children because they take their caller home with them. They put it on the locker beside the bed. At 3 a.m., 4 a.m. or 5 a.m. when that alarm goes off, children are woken and their wife or husband is woken. That is who people call because they are retained firefighters. They do not have set hours and do not have a set roster. We are coming up to Christmas. Because the fire service is under-resourced and does not have enough staff, come Christmas Day those firefighters could be sitting down to Christmas dinner or watching their children opening their presents and they need to jump up, change their clothes, run out, get to the fire station, change their clothes again and within ten minutes go out to protect us or save us from harm. The Government has tabled a countermotion when it should accept the motion. If it wants to put in amendments, it can do so, but it should have left the motion that is there and stop delaying it. Let us look after our fire service and the people in the county. I did a job in 2018 in Kilmallock and had a firefighter working with me. On many Fridays we used to go for breakfast as a treat. Many a time that firefighter had to jump up from the breakfast table and leave his breakfast behind him. In the Gallery this evening we have not only current firefighters but also retired firefighters who are still fighting for the rights of the firefighting personnel here. The Minister should look after our retained fire service. They are from the county. They do not have set hours. They want our help because we look for their help when we are in trouble. It is time for us to help them.

Retained firefighters need a fixed adequate income. The current retainer varies from about €9,000 per annum going up to a maximum of about €11,000. While there are opportunities to earn more on foot of callouts and training, the total salary is completely inadequate. Nobody could live on it and crucially nobody could get a mortgage on it. The other major issue is that they need structured time off. They cannot have a 168-hour contract every week which is the situation for many firefighters week in and week out. These kinds of working conditions are unsafe and completely contrary to any kind of balance between life and work. The Government countermotion states that "Retained Firefighters are highly committed front-line responders providing an exceptional service within their communities". I could not have put that better myself, but where is the financial recognition for these highly committed front-line responders? Where is the work-life balance for those who provide exceptional service within their community? I accept that the Government has commissioned a review and the Minister has said implementing the recommendations of the review should commence as soon as possible at national and local level. However, I want to hear that implementing these recommendations will commence and I want to hear a timeline. Retaining firefighters is becoming increasingly difficult. Over the last two to three years, County Leitrim has lost ten out of 48 firefighters and there has been enormous difficulty in replacing them. It took three rounds of recruitment to find just three replacements. It is the same story in Sligo and until a significantly improved basic wage and structured time off is put in place it will be increasingly difficult to keep experienced firefighters and attract new ones. There is a real need to provide a community-first responder service where ambulances cannot respond within the required time. Sligo is the only fire service outside Dublin that is training firefighters to PHECC standards but the HSE must engage with and help to resource the fire service to provide this invaluable safety net.

Firefighters are heroes and national treasures. That is especially apparent in rural communities such as in my constituency of Clare. They are often the first responders and play a vital role in keeping our people safe. In recent years the job has not been attractive enough. We know that 60% are planning to leave and I would say that most are staying due to the loyalty they have to the service and to each other. They have been waiting for recommendations from the national review to be published for progress and for meaningful engagement. It is shocking that this has not been done. They have so much uncertainty with their pay that they cannot get a mortgage. That is mind blowing. The Minister should recognise and hear their difficulties and, more importantly, react and respond appropriately. I ask him to give definitive timelines on the national review recommendations. I ask him to commit that there will be no more waiting.
#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-15 00:00:00	Death of Vicky Phelan: Expressions of Sympathy	297	To add to what my constituency colleague has said, in addition to their loyalty to their group, there is a tremendous sense of loyalty to their local community and the community has a sense of loyalty to the fire service. Not many people in Clare even realise that there is only one full-time fire officer in County Clare and everybody else is part time, with the vast majority of them retained firefighters. There is an increasing professionalisation and it is increasingly difficult to get a mortgage. What worked very well up to recently is no longer working. I could express my disappointment at the Government's countermotion but more importantly I ask the Minister of State and his ministerial colleague to engage with the issue. Regardless of what the motion and the countermotion are, they should engage with this issue. Could the State afford to provide the level of fire cover that we have now if everybody was to be paid on a full-time basis? I think the answer is clearly "No". The nearest full-time fire service to County Clare is in Limerick city. I do not think the State could shoulder the enormous cost of the expansion in the service that would be required to cover all of County Clare. However, the status quo is equally unaffordable because people are not joining the fire service to the extent that this is becoming dangerous. Either way, the status quo it is not sustainable nor is a full-time fire service. I ask the Minister of State to engage with the management of fire services, rural fire services, retained fire services across the country and also their representatives in the trade union movement. The matter needs to be resolved. There was previously an issue. The former Minister, Joan Burton, was regularly criticised by Sinn Féin and perhaps by the Minister of State, but she did engage with the issue and she found a solution to the issue when there was a problem with retained firefighters and whether they qualified for social welfare benefit or assistance. That was ironed out and I believe the problems that exist now can be ironed out with the political will. The Government has the numbers to win the vote regardless. I ask the Government to engage with firefighters to bring about a solution.

I am surprised that the Government has tabled a countermotion. The Minister of State must acknowledge that when people are in trouble with a house going on fire, a car crash, a fire on a ship, in a bog, in a forest or whatever, the first thing we do is dial 999 and we expect these people at the drop of a hat within two minutes to get the text and they have to be gone. They might have to leave jobs they are working on. I was talking to guys from Nenagh and I was talking to Padraig Quinn from Tuam. They say that they basically always need to be on standby. The day has come and I see it in my own side of it. In agriculture a long time ago someone who had a new tractor or a fancy looking yoke would have a queue down the road trying to jump up on it.Today, you nearly have to put your arms around some of those youngsters. It is a different Ireland. People want time off and they want to go places without having to be on call all the time. They want to know when they are off and when they are on. The problem is with the numbers. This is in rural Ireland. We must remember that in the bigger cities, they are full time, so they are okay, but this is in rural Ireland. It is another issue that is hitting us in rural Ireland. I refer the likes of Mountbellew, Roscommon, Elphin, Strokestown, Ballaghaderreen and Ballyhaunis. They could have to get two fire brigades because one may not be big enough to handle something. There is another problem as well. Many people in the fire service should have an option. They could be fit and healthy but they have to retire at a certain age. Even though they have a full MOT done and they could be perfect, they are not allowed to stay on. That is one issue that should be looked at. This is reasonable. I was speaking with the firefighters today and they are reasonable about it. They want an all-party working group to be put together to resolve these issues. Some night we or somebody in our constituencies will need them. We will dial that number and we will expect them to come straight away. Do we want to leave ourselves open? It is being flagged at the moment that there is a problem, and we know that what is coming up is serious. Do we, as politicians, want to leave ourselves exposed to a situation where they will not be able to fill the vacancies and there will not be enough cover on some night, in some place or for some person? I am thinking especially of our elderly people in the case of a house going on fire. God forbid that they would be exposed and there would be a loss of a life, because we did not put the group together, did not work with it and did not resolve the issues to make it safer to live in rural Ireland. This is what it is about. I also ask the Minister of State that over the coming months, when there is a new county manager in Roscommon, that we look at Castlerea fire station, which has been closed. It is a fair-sized town and we have even seen problems there since the fire service went. I hope that can be addressed.
#PeterBurke	unknown-#PeterBurke-party	unknown-#PeterBurke-dob	unknown-#PeterBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-15 00:00:00	Death of Vicky Phelan: Expressions of Sympathy	299	I would like to welcome all the men and women from our retained firefighters who are here this evening. I thank them for taking time to attend. I also acknowledge those who cannot be here as it is important that we do that. I want to acknowledge and be clear that this is a genuine case that has been put before this House this evening, as indeed is what has been articulated over the past a number of years. I appreciate the work that is going into it. I would also like to sympathise with and give my condolences to the families in, and to the community of, Creeslough, which has experienced so much loss. I want to put on the record of the House my thanks to all those who were involved in the rescue efforts. A number of Deputies referenced why the Government is not agreeing to the motion before the House tonight. The text of the motion and the way it was drafted contains three paragraphs condemning the leadership of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O’Brien. Deputies will appreciate that there is no way that the Government could vote for a motion that condemns its own Minister, who is clearly passionate about our firefighters and has set in train process to try to resolve the issues. Sometimes motions are tabled in this House and Deputies stand up and ask why the Government will not accept them, but all reasonable people would know that one will not vote for a motion that condemns one’s own leadership, when we have put forward a substantive countermotion on how we are responding. I say genuinely that is not against the firefighters but the text of the motion. As I said, no one disagrees with the retained firefighters, or with the invaluable service and essential work they do in our communities. I meet with them on a weekly basis and I have met many from my own constituency in relation to this issue. There is no doubt that they save so many lives, prevent damage to property, protect critical infrastructure and safeguard the environment. We are indebted to them for their work and their sacrifice, because they often face so much danger and significant risk. I would like to clarify the role of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. Its role is supporting fire authorities by setting general policy and national standards, providing central training programmes, issuing guidance on operational and other related matters and providing capital funding support for equipment and priority infrastructure projects. While the Minister, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, has responsibility for fire services, he has no operational role in respect of our fire services. On the other hand, the local authority fire service in Ireland is staffed by more than 3,000 professional, competent and highly committed personnel, full-time and retained fire services. Local authorities, as the funders and employers of the fire service personnel, have demonstrated their commitment to this service. It is important to note that the number of front-line fire service staff have been maintained at a high level even at a time when staffing numbers were out of necessity reduced in other areas of the local authorities. The fire service is operated at a local authority level by 27 individual fire authorities. There are 218 fire stations throughout the country with 3,245 serving fire service personnel, of whom 2,065 are retained on a 24-hour basis. The work of our fire services has changed considerably over the past two decades and this is reflected in the changes in incident types that have been attended by fire services. In the period, the proportion of fires attended has decreased from a level of 62% of incidents in 2000 to 45% in 2021. By the same token, special service incidents attended has increased rapidly from 19% in 2000 to 35% in 2021. The changing profile has resulted in ongoing reviews and fire service risk assessments, response capability, equipment and training requirements. Retained fire stations were mobilised on an average of 24,750 times annually over the period from 2016 to 2020 to incidents including fires, road traffic collisions, special rescue and general services. The range of incident activity varies considerably across the services from stations with low numbers of callouts to busy retained stations.  A tangible and welcome result of the efforts of fire services is a downward trend in incidents of fire in Ireland with the fire fatality rate per million of population, using a three-year average, currently at 4.3 deaths per million of population. While as we all very well and acutely know, each death is one too many, this figure is a third of what it was 20 years ago when it stood at 12.9 deaths per million of population. The level of fatalities from fires in Ireland is a low rate compared with other countries. I want to again acknowledge the great work that our fire services have in making that a reality. As my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, has already stated, he has listened to concerns being raised in relation to our retained fire service in Ireland. He is acting on this and a review in collaboration with the retained firefighter, the fire services national oversight and implementation group, FSNOIG, the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA and the Department is soon to be completed and presented to the management board of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management. It is a priority for both the Minister and Department to begin this implementation process in order to respond to the genuine issues which have been raised here tonight. This will require a sequence of steps and developments to improve firefighter work-life balance and to ensure that the retained service is seen as a place of opportunity for a career for both male and female firefighters. There is a significant urgency in moving forward with the implementation of the review’s recommendations, however, it should be noted that the capacity of resilience of fire service has been shown to be robust through the external validation process in 2016 and the capacity review in 2020.  In December 2021, the Omicron variant of Covid-19 caused a steep increase in infection rates right across the country. In anticipation of the impact on the delivery of fire services, the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management issued a circular advising immediate protective actions to be taken by all fire services to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in the fire service. Simultaneously, the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management worked with local authorities to underpin resilient measures recommended in the capacity review report. Fire services demonstrated strong business continuity measures during the peak of the Omicron wave of infection with no loss of service. The recruitment and retention issues are serious and are now being taken very seriously by the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and his officials. The Minister also mentioned that while the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is not the employer, it supports all fire services in Ireland through its fire services capital programme. The latest programme has an allocation of €61 million to support the building of 12 fire stations already under way, six new stations and refurbishment works planned for another nine stations. The invaluable financial support is continuing with the fleet programme. An allocation of €27.7 million has been made with the first tranche providing 35 appliances at an approximate cost of €16 million.  The Department continues to work with the Office of Government Procurement and will shortly have secured extension of a fire appliance scheme with a further budget of €17 million indicated. A further €5 million has been allocated to support the procurement of other fire and emergency rescue equipment and €2 million allocated to further progress the mobilisation and communications project. There is also a focus on training for all fire personnel, with the NDFEM providing the annual training programme, which offers courses for local authority fire service officers and supports the ability of fire authorities to deliver efficient and effective fire and rescue services. The quality of training delivered by the NDFEM has been beneficial to fire authorities in assisting their fire officers to develop and maintain consistency in standards, but also to pass through the instruction to firefighters at an official level. The national-level training is complementary to ongoing county station training and drill nights, which provide ongoing continuous training to fire crews in all areas of their work. The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, remain committed to investing in all of our fire services, including retained ones, and we will work with all parties to achieve this. The Minister is confident that the report will be completed and published in December. He will commence work promptly on responding to all of the issues. I acknowledge the genuine case that has been presented by the firefighters tonight. The Government appreciates their work and we will respond in a timely manner once this report is published. I thank the firefighters for their attendance.

I welcome the men and women of the retained fire service who are here with us and the many more who are watching. Every Deputy who has spoken has recognised the same point, that is, that there are many people who cannot be here by virtue of the fact that they are on call. They have to be close to their home places so that they can protect their communities. The Minister of State sought to give us a little lecture on what he did and did not think was reasonable, but a reasonable Government would wake up to the statistic that 60% of retained firefighters were considering resigning or retiring in the next two years. They are not unreasonable people. In fact, they are some of the most flexible and reasonable people providing services in the State. A reasonable Government would take on board that statistic. A reasonable Government would be concerned. A reasonable Government would listen. A reasonable Government would be alert to the terms and conditions and the fact that these men and women were, in many instances, providing services on a shoestring. It is no wonder that we struggle to get people into the fire service and to retain them there, given that they are struggling to get simple things like a mortgage because of the way their wages are structured. When the Minister was present, he told us that the firefighters kept their own communities safe. Last night, the fire services from my town of Skerries were in Donabate fighting a fire alongside crews from Kilbarrack and elsewhere in Dublin. Fire services come together. A fire service is not just a small service for a small community. The communities have expanded. Firefighters do a professional job. They provide a first class service, yet all they are seeking is respect and decent terms and conditions. They cannot take applause or a pat on the back down to the supermarket and try to use it to pay for their groceries. They are looking for respect, decency and decent wages.
#PaulineTully	unknown-#PaulineTully-party	unknown-#PaulineTully-dob	unknown-#PaulineTully-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-15 00:00:00	Death of Vicky Phelan: Expressions of Sympathy	302	I welcome the motion and commend my colleague, Deputy Brady, on the work he has undertaken in tabling it. Retained firefighters are first responders and are often first on the scene of awful tragedies that we can only imagine. It is a dangerous job with enormous pressure, and firefighters face real risks to their personal safety. Firefighters go into burning buildings to make sure that the rest of us are out of them. They go to cars and cut people out of them even though the cars might explode or burst into flames at any moment. All of this takes an emotional toll on the firefighters and their families. Conditions within the job have led to a recruitment and retention crisis. Firefighters are on call 24-7 and must be in the vicinity of the fire station at all times, yet the money they receive is not reflective of that commitment. The retained fire services cannot recruit sufficient new members nor retain experienced personnel. This has made an already dangerous and pressurised job even more so, as fire stations are being forced to operate with low crew numbers. In some cases, this has resulted in fire authorities deciding to close stations temporarily. There are issues with the failure of management to take seriously firefighters' concerns about the provision of proper training, consultation and the supervision of the use of new technologies. That is in breach of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005. The retained fire service "is not fit for purpose." These are not my words, but the words of Mr. Dave Carroll, the former head of the Chief Fire Officers Association. He made these remarks in 2018, and matters have grown even worse since then. The cost-of-living crisis has exacerbated the issue and many retained firefighters have been forced to take up full-time employment. The job is not sufficiently paid to consider it full-time employment, so most have to take up other work. However, if they do so they are taxed to the hilt. One firefighter told me that he had received €5,000 for a six-month period of his retainer and call-outs. That was €5,000 in theory. What he actually got into his hand after tax was €1,700. That would not encourage anyone to join and risk his or her life. I urge Deputies to back this motion, which calls for the establishment of a cross-party Oireachtas joint committee. This issue must be resolved urgently for the safety of the crews and members of the public.
#JohnBrady	unknown-#JohnBrady-party	unknown-#JohnBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-15 00:00:00	Death of Vicky Phelan: Expressions of Sympathy	303	Members of the retained service and their family members came to Dublin today and marched on the Dáil. Some have sat outside for the duration of this debate. They came here out of frustration looking for hope and respect, but all they got from the Government benches were words. They received no hope from the Government benches and little respect. Instead, they got a classic case of kicking the can down the road. That is what has been done with the Government's amendment. This motion was penned by the members of the retained service themselves because they feel their voices have not been listened to by anyone in government. The Government's amendment nullifies and totally dismisses everything they have said. It essentially says that the Government is great and that everything will be done to resolve the issue, but it contains no definitive timelines. I have heard it said repeatedly that the Minister will bring forward the review and the recommendations in December, but no date whatsoever has been given. Bear in mind that the Minister has been sitting on the review and recommendations since February or March. That in itself gives a clear indication of how seriously the Government is dealing with the crisis in the retained service. There was not one mention by the Minister of State or his colleague of the balloting for industrial action. Members of the retained fire service felt that they had no other option, given that the processes they had engaged in up to that point had not produced meaningful solutions to the crisis. They served notice on the chief executives of all the local authorities a number of weeks ago. The balloting is taking place as we speak. In some areas, 97% of retained firefighters are saying that they have no other option and that, although they do not want to go down this route, they have to because their voices are not being heard. As a last resort, they are prepared to take industrial or full strike action. They have no faith in the Government to follow through and implement the report. The motion could complement the process, which was not initiated recently. Firefighters were asked for their input into the review last year. Nine hundred of them took part. However, all it was was words. No action has come from it. What the firefighters are asking for is the creation of a cross-party Oireachtas committee to get under the bonnet of the retained service, examine all of the issues over a four-month period and make recommendations.That could and should complement whatever review is being undertaken. More importantly, it will give a level of accountability and responsibility to the Government to implement and follow through on whatever comes out of that. I have my own views, and the firefighters have their own views, around the working time directive, which needs to be fully implemented. That would go a long way to addressing all of the concerns we have heard from right across the Chamber here this evening. Unfortunately, all we have got from the Government is words. I will refer to one line in the countermotion. Members of the service were sitting up in the Gallery and I do not know if the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, noticed, but the vast majority of them actually got up and walked out after the Minister of State spoke. Their morale was on the ground as they came in here, and that just sunk it even further. The countermotion states:... while the recruitment and retention issues are serious, it is important nevertheless to place these issues in the context of a service that has repeatedly been shown to be operationally ready and resilient ...It then goes on to refer to Covid. To my mind, the Minister is conscious of the serious challenges but is happy because he knows the guys are going to get up, get out and respond as they always do despite the major challenges and despite the shortage of personnel on the ground. I again appeal to the Minister of State to pull the amendment, to support the motion, and to show full support for the retained firefighters and the communities in which they serve. I ask the Minister of State to pull the amendment and support the motion. Let us get this committee going and start putting in place a service that is fit for purpose.

#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-15 00:00:00	Death of Vicky Phelan: Expressions of Sympathy	308	I thank Deputy O'Donoghue for his question. He may be interested to know that the salary scale of Secretaries General and equivalent grades is a matter of public record and is disclosed in replies to parliamentary questions. Also, circulars detailing the salaries applicable to each civil servant grade, including the Secretary General grade, are published and are publicly available on the circulars page of the Gov.ie website. The most recent circular listing out the salary scales of civil servants, Circular 19/2022, was published on 12 October and includes Secretary General salary scales and notes the amount of the highest rate paid to a Secretary General. There have been no changes to these disclosure arrangements that would have had the effect of restricting transparency in relation to Secretary General salaries. In fact, the appropriation accounts for 2021 included new additional disclosure requirements in relation to salaries of Accounting Officers. As the Deputy is aware, the legislative basis for the annual appropriation accounts is the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866. In the interests of transparency and accountability, each year my Department considers requirements for more enhanced reporting while also considering any legal constraints on disclosing information. Any extra information disclosed in the accounts is in the form of notes to the accounts. These notes to the accounts aid the reader to better understand the expenditure and receipts for each Government Department and office of Government. In that regard, in March of this year my Department issued an instruction to all Accounting Officers requesting additional reporting requirements, including the disclosure of the Accounting Officer's gross salary in the appropriation accounts for each of the 45 Vote-holding Departments, offices of Government and other entities. This additional reporting requirement commenced with the 2021 appropriation account. These audited appropriation accounts were published by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General on 30 September 2022. My Department is considering further enhancing the information in the salary note for this year's appropriation accounts. The enhancements being considered include provision of salary band data as well as further information on the gross remuneration of Accounting Officers. The provision of information in relation to gross remuneration reflects the fact that decisions regarding voluntary deductions from salaries are a personal matter. I will come back to this in my next response.

Given that the taxpayer foots the bill, GDPR legislation was never intended to be interpreted to ensure that non-payment to any individual could never be published again. Using GDPR legislation in this manner is very dangerous. Today it could be used to block transparency around payments to former taoisigh and barristers; and tomorrow, if it goes unchallenged, all payments by the State could be beyond the reach of the public. Does this sound like transparency to the Minister?

In my initial reply, I outlined that the salary scales and grades of every Secretary General are a matter of public record and are published in a whole range of ways, including through parliamentary questions that are answered here on the record. Information is also provided by way of the appropriation accounts. The specific issue that has been raised by some of the Deputy's colleagues relates to waivers or the gifting of a portion of salary by individuals. That is a personal matter. In respect of what we can publish, we are governed by the rulings of the Ombudsman and Information Commissioner. Following the bringing of a case to the commissioner in respect of the Freedom of Information Acts, the Ombudsman and Information Commissioner has deemed that to be personal information. This governs what we can and cannot publish with regard to net salaries and what somebody may decide, for whatever reason, to give as a portion of their salary. The salary set by State is a matter of public record, which is officially published.

Why would the senior civil servants do this and why is the Government allowing it to happen? If everything is above board, why is there a need to hide the information? As the journalist Daniel McConnell recently wrote, "Experience has taught us time and time again, where there are shadows, dodgy things tend to go on." Again, I ask Minister why there is a need to hide this information when the taxpayer pays the salaries of these officials. In his answer the Minister seems to be dodging the bullet. If nothing is being done wrong there should be no need to hide this information, regardless of where they are actually giving the moneys to. It should be a matter of public record.

Information is published in the relevant appropriation accounts. As the Deputy is aware, those accounts are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and come before the Committee of Public Accounts for further scrutiny when the reports become available. The specific issue, which I am aware has been raised by members of the Committee of Public Accounts, and which the Deputy is touching on this evening, relates to net salary. They want to tease out whether somebody is gifting a proportion of the salary, when they started gifting, when they finished gifting, and so on. We are governed by rulings made by the Information Commissioner. The Information Commissioner has deemed the issue of the gifting of salary to be personal information and, therefore, not subject to disclosure. The salary the State is liable to pay every Secretary General across government is published and is a matter of public record.

Discussions, consultations and appraisals have been ongoing for years and we have been going around in circles with no conclusions. We have too many agencies around the table. We need someone to get a hold of this, give direction and make it happen.

In tandem with this statutory role, the OPW has a mandate to engage in the presentation to the public of heritage sites entrusted to its care. The increasing popularity of heritage sites with visitors, to a point where it is estimated that visits to Irish heritage sites number in excess of 20 million annually, is highly encouraging and represents a strong endorsement of the success of this approach. The OPW has a strategic partnership with Fáilte Ireland and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to spur investment in the heritage estate to increase standards of interpretation and visitor experience and support local tourism economies. Cashel has featured as a site of focus since the earliest days of this partnership. The Rock of Cashel is one of six sites making up the Royal Sites of Ireland, which were placed on the UNESCO tentative list for world heritage in July 2022. The OPW is entrusted with the care of the complex of five national monuments situated on the Rock of Cashel. In 1975, the hall of the vicar's choral was re-roofed and restored, part financed by the European Regional Development Fund. In the early 2000s, a major conservation project started on Cormac’s Chapel, which is not only one of the most significant early Romanesque buildings in the country but also contains fragments of an immensely important scheme of wall paintings. There is a continuous conservational ethos with all the buildings on-site. I am encouraged to note there has been a strong recovery in visitor numbers to the Rock of Cashel post pandemic. In 2019, there were 272,498 visitors. Between January and August 2022, there were 210,154 visitors to the site, which places it in a strong position to equal if not surpass pre-pandemic visitor numbers. As the Deputy is aware, the OPW is one entity working as part of a collaborative effort in place since mid-2019, together with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Fáilte Ireland and Tipperary County Council, to assess options for the development of a new all-purpose visitor facility in the town which would serve the needs of the Rock of Cashel visitor site and the town of Cashel, acting as an engine for economic, tourism and cultural sector growth. The remit of the OPW in this wider collaborative effort relates primarily to our dual mandate to conserve and present for visitors the complex of national monuments that make up the Rock of Cashel site and have been entrusted to the care of the OPW.

It is the number one attraction in the south east. It is known worldwide and a destination of choice for a huge number of national and international tourists. Cashel has rebounded from Covid. Recent statistics reveal that, as of August this year, up to 170,000 visitors had enjoyed the majestic Rock of Cashel, representing a 69% increase in numbers on the previous year. Prior to Covid, an average of 370,000 visitors stopped in Cashel and the site has an average of 1,000 visitors per day. The Magnier family recently invested heavily to restore Cashel Palace to its former splendour. The town of Cashel has been greatly enhanced by its reopening. It has revitalised the local economy. The Rock of Cashel is one of our prime national attractions. Despite years of planning, it remains without an identified location for a visitor and interpretive centre. This is a glaring omission which must be urgently addressed. How advanced are those discussions?

It has been working with the local community and tourism representatives to determine where a site should be placed. Along with its partners, it has engaged international expertise and carried out a scoping report which has been presented to my Department for consideration. A number of sites have been visited and identified. Consideration is being given to existing arrangements for public parking, toilets, reception, café, retail and exhibition. There will be an assessment of the report and a decision will be made in the coming weeks.

The continuing delays in providing a visitor centre in Cashel are depriving the town of much-needed revenue. The business centre of the town has never been able to take full economic advantage of the numbers visiting the town. Typically, when tour buses stop at a popular destination, people on the bus are given a certain amount of time to spend at the relevant attraction. This time usually allows for a visit to an interpretive centre and can be extended to explore the town. If no such centre is available, the tour guides often choose to leave the area, and that is happening in Cashel. The town has an average of 1,000 visitors per day. It is of fundamental importance that it have the services and attractions to allow it to capitalise on this footfall. Local businesses benefit when tourists have the opportunity to linger and discover an area, rather than be whisked away again on buses. A national tourist attraction of this magnitude requires that all the relevant agencies the Minister of State referred to co-operate with a sense of purpose and urgency to deliver an interpretive centre without further delay. Where exactly are we with that? When does the Minister of State anticipate the steering group will make a recommendation and when will we have a decision?

Cashel is one of the most important sites in the country and was visited by Queen Elizabeth II and others. The next step is to assess the identified site locations. They will be matched against defined criteria to be agreed by the project steering group. The group will have regard to the conceptual spatial model, which will encompass requirements for the proposed new facility. If the outcomes of this study are favourable, this will lead to further studies that will review sources of funding, possible management and operational options and other requirements laid out in the public spending code. The steering group for the project continues to meet on a regular basis. I do not have dates or costs. I will take the Deputy's concerns to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, and ask him to speak to the Deputy directly.

I welcome the fact that the Government has made a large amount of money available for such schemes in recent times. How much has been made available in recent years? What is the current situation? Are their plans to increase funding?
#OssianSmyth	unknown-#OssianSmyth-party	unknown-#OssianSmyth-dob	unknown-#OssianSmyth-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-15 00:00:00	Death of Vicky Phelan: Expressions of Sympathy	321	I thank the Deputy. I have set out in tabular form in the following link the detail on the amount of funding approved for each local authority under the OPW minor flood mitigation works and coastal protection scheme in each of the years 2018 to 2021 and to date in 2022. As the Deputy will be aware, the purpose of the scheme is to provide funding to local authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works or studies to address localised fluvial flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas. The scheme generally applies where a solution can be readily identified and achieved in a short timeframe. The works to be funded are carried out under local authority powers and ongoing maintenance of the completed works is the responsibility of the local authority. Under the scheme, the OPW reviews all applications to ensure the proposed works are technically, environmentally and economically feasible. The scheme applies to all eligible projects with an estimated cost of up to €750,000 and 90% of the overall costs for approved projects are paid by my office. Since the scheme was established in 2009, 7,600 properties have been protected through 643 minor works projects at a cost to the end of 2021 of €43.4 million. Approved works typically include the provision of flood barriers, remedial works to embankments, installation of trash screens, works to culverts, drainage and channel widening. Since 2018, funding of €19.4 million was approved by the OPW for 212 individual projects across 27 local authorities. Of these, the highest funding approval, €2.2 million, was granted to Galway County Council. Cork County Council was allocated €2 million, Kerry County Council, €2 million, and Fingal County Council, €1.4 million.  Over this time, five of the 212 applications from local authorities were for projects of over €500,000 each, with 86% of all applications estimated to cost less than €150,000.During that same period the amount of funding drawdown by local authorities for approved flood projects was €9.6 million. The commencement and progression of any works for which funding is approved is a matter for each local authority concerned. Often drawdown will take up to five years after approval.https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/debates/questions/supportingDocumentation/2022-11-15_pq84-15-11-22_en.xlsx

The Minister of State might tell me what the situation is with that. Does the OPW keep tabs on the local authorities to put pressure on them to do the work in a timely fashion? Obviously, these works would not be approved unless they were needed. If they are not done in a timely fashion then people are going to suffer. I am sure the Minister of State will be interested in my next question about sea-level rise himself. We know from the recent conference in Egypt that sea levels are rising at an alarming rate. I have raised this before. In my own area in Pilmore near Youghal we see the impact of that. Do these schemes encompass the rate of sea level rise and the damage that it can do to property, livelihoods, to roads and houses and so on? Are there any plans to expand the scheme to take that into account?

Much of the funds are not drawn down. Roughly half the funds approved have actually been drawn down during the five-year period we were looking at. The budget itself is not entirely applied for. There is always much more money in the budget than is applied for by the local authorities. I would encourage the Deputy to ask his local authority to apply for the funding for minor works schemes and then to make sure that it does draw it down. There must be a role for county councillors in local authorities to pursue their council executive over these matters to, first, request that they ask for money and then to make sure that they draw it down and make sure that they spend it. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, asked me to convey to the Deputy that he is planning to visit Midleton in coming weeks.  Of course, sea level rises are something that affect not only the Deputy's constituency but also my own. In Dún Laoghaire the railway line runs along the seafront and this is becoming a cost for Irish Rail as well as for the country as a whole and everyone who happens to live near the coast, which is an increasing number.

If reports are true, we face a very serious impact on property and housing, farmland, railway lines and so on across the country. I get the feeling we are not treating this with the urgency that we should as a Government, as a State or as a nation but it is coming if all the scientists are correct. Would the Minister of State agree that perhaps the local authorities do not have the capacity to draw down the funding he is talking about? It is very serious if they are not drawing down the amounts which he mentioned because these schemes are needed. If money is being handed back because local authorities do not have the capacity, is it time for the Government to have a conversation with local authorities to see if they need more help, such as more personnel to get this work done in time?

There will be specific actions relating to flooding. People will pay particular attention to that in the current environment. On whether the local authorities need extra capacity, I know the OPW will act in an advisory capacity to anybody who has been allocated money. If local authorities feel they do not have the capacity to draw it down they should write to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan and let him know, if that is what the problem is. Really, many of these are small projects of under €0.5 million. They are the kinds of projects that local authorities are well capable of delivering if they put their minds to it. There is a role for county councillors to put pressure on their own local authorities to actually carry out the work.

These enabled local authorities to carry out flood mitigation works to address localised flooding. As has been said, these schemes have been extremely beneficial. There is good return on public investment. They are turned around in a short time. It is a scheme that merits increased funding on the basis that it addresses local issues and also ensures a good return on public investment.

The works to be funded are carried out under local authority powers and ongoing maintenance of the completed works is the responsibility of the council. Under the scheme, applications are considered for projects that are estimated to cost not more than €750,000 in each instance. Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for approved projects. Applications are assessed by the OPW having regard to the specific economic, social and environmental criteria of the scheme, including a cost-benefit ratio and having regard to the availability of funding for flood risk management. The original maximum amount was €500,000 and was increased to €750,000 following a review of the scheme in June 2017.The scheme is demand led and the funding has always been available to cover eligible applications submitted by the local authorities. Funding will continue to be available in 2023 on this basis. To date, nationally and since 2009, my office has approved 873 projects under this scheme and funding of €57.7 million. This is a very significant and important scheme for managing localised flooding problems and both I and my office promote and encourage local authorities to avail of the funding under the scheme to address such localised flooding issues.

The Minister of State is encouraging local authorities to submit proposals to the OPW. My local authority in Cavan has a number of proposals with the OPW that I would like to see advanced as quickly as possible. Two are The Maples estate in Cavan town and The Meadows estate in Shercock. Unfortunately, over the past few weeks both those estates endured heavy flooding which caused flooding in some homes and limited pedestrian access into The Meadows estate. There are very reasonable proposals with the OPW on these two estates. I would be very glad if the Minister of State would speak to the officials and ensure that the funding is provided to Cavan County Council to ensure that they can carry out the necessary remedial works in early 2023.

Any local authority should apply for funding where needed. There is a very low refusal rate. I think only about 10% of schemes are refused. Also, as we discussed, there is a low rate of drawdown on the projects. Sometimes projects are approved but the funding is not drawn down. The question was phrased in such a way as to ask if there will be sufficient money next for year. There is always sufficient money in the budget. The problem has always been spending the money that is in the budget. It is available for anyone who needs it. The budget is set at such a level that if there is a very bad year, where there were bad storms for instance, there is enough money to cover those flood-relief works. I think the emphasis has to be not on increasing the funding but on making sure that the Deputy's local authority does apply for the funding and has capacity to do it. If they need advice or help to apply for the funding, we can help with that. I will take the two schemes in Cavan to the Minister of State.

I would state very clearly here that Cavan local authority has put forward very realistic proposals on those two particular estates and other projects too. I hope that it would be possible to get clearance from the Department early in 2023 so that the council can set about drawing down that funding and bringing those necessary improvement works to those two particular estates. Other projects have also been submitted by the council which it is confident it could easily carry out should the funding become available.

Budget 2023 contained significant responsive measures to support households, public and community services and businesses, with spending measures of €4.5 billion. As part of this budget, a winter cost-of-living package for households, costing €2.2 billion, was announced by the Government. It included the following: a double payment of weekly social welfare scheme payments in October; a fuel allowance lump sum of €400; a once-off payment of €500 to those in receipt of the carer's support grant and people on the disability allowance, blind pension and invalidity pension; a €200 living-alone allowance lump sum; a €500 working family payment lump sum; a double child benefit payment; a once-off reduction in the student contribution fee of €1,000 for undergraduates and one third for apprentices; a €1,000 increase to the postgraduate tuition fee contribution grant; a double payment to those eligible for Student Universal Support Ireland maintenance grants and a once-off payment of €500 for Science Foundation Ireland and Irish Research Council PhD researchers; €8 million for the student assistance fund; and three €200 electricity credits, with two instalments due in the new year. In addition, a Christmas bonus will be paid to eligible social protection recipients in December. In recognition of the unprecedented rise in energy bills for businesses and public services, the Government introduced several further support measures. It provided €340 million this year in support for public and community services. It will introduce a €200 million Ukraine emergency response scheme, helping firms facing liquidity issues as a result of increased energy costs. It is to be administered by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. We are introducing a temporary business energy support scheme, providing up to €1.2 billion to support businesses encountering increased energy costs. The focus of the Government is now on implementing all these measures, plus a range of others announced in the budget less than two months ago.

In fairness, there has been an incredible intervention. We have never seen anything like it in the State's history in terms of how we have tried to cushion the blow from the increase in the cost of living. The Minister mentioned the cost-of-living payment, the disability support grant, the doubling of the social welfare payments, the reduction of the student contribution and the doubling of the student grant for December. These are all extraordinary measures that will make a difference and help. However, as we get into the middle of winter, time goes by and inflation continues to increase, at what point will we review the existing measures and consider increases where needed? A key element in reducing energy costs is the roll-out of solar. Can we expect a rapid roll-out of solar, particularly domestic solar?

Just today, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Heather Humphreys, and I announced the details of the four lump-sum payments to be made this week, on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. These payments are: the fuel allowance lump sum; the disability grant lump sum; the living-alone allowance lump sum; and the payment to low-income working families in the form of the working-family payment. Throughout next year, starting on 1 January, we will see the implementation of a range of other budgetary measures designed to ease the cost-of-living pressures we know many households are facing, including the changes to core weekly social welfare rates, the easing of the eligibility threshold and qualifying criteria for the fuel allowance, to give just a few examples in the area of social welfare, and also income tax changes. We will consider the point the Deputy has made on solar energy and what more we can do as a Government to incentivise investment in that source of renewable energy.

This tax will be levied on energy companies that provide low-carbon and low-emissions energy. I have heard figures of between €2 billion and €3 billion for Ireland alone out of the entire pot. That is a significant pot to use to cushion the blow for businesses and households, but the latter especially. When can we expect to see the benefits of the windfall tax? When can we expect to see the revenue distributed to the households that will badly need it in January and February, when it will still be cold, and to businesses? Some businesses are very appreciative of the temporary business energy support scheme but feel more may need to be done in future months. Can we see the windfall tax revenue distributed?

In this regard, I would like to bring up an issue. Would it be possible to consider a bespoke solution for communal heating systems? Constituents of mine in Carlinn Hall have a gas-fed communal heating system that presents a particular anomaly. In the long term, the only solution is to change the source, but in the short term we need to mitigate the pressure people are under. If possible, could the temporary business energy support scheme payment be made to the companies that run such schemes, once it is ensured that the residents get the break? I also wish to raise a related issue. Have we dealt with anomalies such as shared meters at caravan parks, etc.?

In Carlow, we now have the South East Technological University and Carlow College. However, while students in the university can access Government supports to combat the cost-of-living crisis, those in the college cannot. Some third level students can receive funding for laptops under the assistance scheme but Carlow College students cannot access that scheme. The college loses out on mental health funding and other supports simply because it is not under the Higher Education Authority, HEA. Can the Minister tell me what engagement the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, has had with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the progress on including Carlow College under the HEA?
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-15 00:00:00	Death of Vicky Phelan: Expressions of Sympathy	339	In response to Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan, we have committed that any additional revenues we raise, whether from a windfall tax, a solidarity contribution from companies in the renewables sector, which companies have done very well owing to how energy is priced, and also from fossil fuel companies, will be provided by way of additional supports to communities, households and businesses. Several Departments are currently working to scope out the impact of the measures that have been agreed at EU level. That work is continuing. I expect that, throughout next year, we will have further clarity on what that means. The commitment to giving revenue back to people by way of additional supports, reduced network tariffs and so on will apply. On Deputy Ó Murchú's question, I assume he was referring to district heating systems. This issue has been raised with me also at constituency level. I have engaged with the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on it because I am aware it has presented particular problems for residents with group heating. A district-heating group has been set up across government to work on that and determine what possible solutions may exist. I will ask the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, to revert to Deputy Murnane O'Connor on Carlow College and the non-availability of some of the supports to some of its students.

#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-15 00:00:00	Death of Vicky Phelan: Expressions of Sympathy	341	At the outset, it should be noted that my Department, in carrying out its role in co-ordinating the national development plan, NDP, review, does not consider the merit of individual projects or sectoral policy strategies, as this is primarily a matter for individual Departments and agencies. National strategic objective, NSO, 8 seeks the transition to a climate-neutral and climate-resilient society. The next ten years are critical in order to address the climate crisis, and we have significantly stepped up our climate ambition by committing to reduce our overall greenhouse gas emissions by 51% by the end of the decade, and to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. This is set out in the new Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021. The Act established a new legally binding framework for climate change, including the adoption of a series of three economy-wide, five-year carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings, which set the maximum limit on greenhouse gas emissions for each sector of our economy. In addition, the Act provides for the climate action plan to be updated every year. The latest version of the plan for 2023 is expected to be brought to the Government in the coming weeks and it will be aligned with our carbon budgets and sectoral emissions ceilings. The sectoral strategies for flood risk management are outlined in the Government's climate change sectoral adaptation plan for flood risk management. These strategies play a critical role in identifying the goals and priorities for the sector and are therefore critical in informing the investment priorities set out in the NDP. Over the period to 2030, an additional €5 billion of the expected €9.5 billion in additional carbon tax receipts will be invested in energy efficiency. In terms of strategic investment priorities for the energy sector, this includes supporting the delivery of offshore renewable energy, retrofitting up to 500,000 homes and the installation of 600,000 heat pumps. Specific projects include the Celtic interconnector, which when completed in 2026, will be Ireland's largest electricity interconnector. I will add further details in a moment.

He alluded to many of the measures that will be used to reduce emissions and achieve climate neutrality. One of the key ways that we can transition to a climate-neutral society is through active travel and the provision of walkways and cycleways in particular. Unfortunately, we saw an alarming statistic in 2021, which was that 56% of funding for active travel in rural areas remained unspent. Is the Department monitoring the expenditure of the various local authorities on active travel? Are local authorities being proactive in spending this funding? Could the Minister refer in his response to Cork County Council and whether it is reaching its targets on active travel expenditure? I would appreciate if he could go further and tell me if whether west Cork is meeting its targets as well.

The Deputy is correct in saying that there have been underspends across some local authority areas. To be fair, it can take time to build up the capacity to deliver certain projects and to get them through the various planning approval processes. The allocation of €360 million every year will support 1,000 km of new and improved walking and cycling infrastructure by 2025, as well as additional investment in greenways. My Department is working closely with the Department of Transport in particular on the roll-out of the funding. As the Deputy can imagine, it is in touch on a regular basis with all of the individual local authorities around the country. I do not have a breakdown of the performance by local authority versus budget, but as the Deputy is aware, there is within the overall management of capital expenditure an opportunity to carry forward certain unspent funds. It is about having a pipeline of projects that can be delivered over several years. This is a fantastic opportunity to improve our walking and cycling infrastructure.

It has achieved great things especially in building social houses. I am interested to see what its delivery on active travel is like, especially in the western division. I know the Minister cannot comment on individual projects, but the NDP does refer to a project to deliver a safe walking and cycling access between Clonakilty, my home town, and Inchydoney, probably our most famous tourism destination. Currently, there is no safe pedestrian or cycling access. A dedicated group has been formed which has put its weight behind this project. It has approached landowners, 99% of whom are fully behind this project. The entire public are behind the project, but we are finding it difficult to get the local authority to buy into it, and apply for funding for it. Could the Minister's Department do anything to give a nudge to local authorities to get behind projects like this one that will deliver safe cycling access to a wonderful beach like Inchydoney?

It is a real gem in west Cork. I am happy to work with Deputy O'Sullivan and the elected members of Cork County Council to advance the project because it would be hugely exciting if we were in a position to develop a safe pedestrian and cycling access between Clonakilty and Inchydoney. The returns that are made by local authorities are available, so we will get access to the records. It is important that everyone is held accountable for their use or non-use of public money, as the case may be. As I said at the outset, this is a tremendous opportunity provided through the funding available under the NDP and it is important that local authorities all over Ireland make maximum use of it.

The R587, which is the key artery from mid-Cork into west Cork, is blocked when the river floods. There has been a great deal of talk for many years about advancing flood defences and improvement works in the area and much investigation has been done.

Where necessary, local authorities may put forward proposals to relevant central government Departments, including the Office of Public Works, for funding of appropriate measures depending on the infrastructure or assets under threat. As there is no application on hand in the OPW for the location mentioned in the Deputy's question, my office contacted Cork County Council and it has advised that the area around Ardcahan Bridge has a history of flooding, whereby the R587 frequently becomes impassable to road traffic. To alleviate flooding at the bridge, the council's Dunmanway area office approached the regional and local road design office to examine the possibility of removing silt around Ardcahan Bridge as part of bridge works. Consulting engineers were appointed to progress the project in 2019. To date, the detailed design of the repair works to the bridge are substantially complete and include: structural bridge investigations; the production of a preliminary design report; extensive 2D hydrological modelling has been carried out; and environmental surveys have been completed, which have fed into the draft Natura impact statement. The consultants are aiming to have the Natura impact statement completed by the first quarter of 2023. Works will follow once statutory approvals are in place. Cork County Council will liaise with the Department of Transport under its annual bridge rehabilitation programme, in the first instance to fund these works. I will bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Transport.

It is essential that headway is made on commencing the work. The Natura impact study was expected earlier this year, and it is frustrating and of concern for locals to hear that it will not be available until next year. I understand that Cork County Council is taking the lead role in the project. Once the various plans are ready, is there a possibility that the project could be fast-tracked through the planning services to ensure that work can advance as quickly as possible? We must also ensure that funding is in place to carry out the essential works. Has there been engagement on the matter?

The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, has committed to speak to the Minister for Transport about the issue.The area is located in a special area of conservation, SAC, and that makes it harder to get the consents. As to the question of whether it would be possible to have a fast track for planning, the only fast track that exists is emergency planning in case of bridge collapse or something like that. That is unlikely. I do not want to give the Deputy false hope there. As soon as the Natura impact statement is in, the council will be in a position to draw up its plans. There is no reason the council cannot progress matters. I think the design work is in place so there is no reason the council cannot pre-prepare its planning application and have a degree of parallelism such that it is ready to go when it gets its consent.

This objective, as the Deputy knows, seeks to strengthen rural economies and communities. It applies to the traditional pillars of the rural economy as well as those emerging from such developments as improved transport connectivity, national broadband delivery, climate action and rural economic development. The sectoral strategies here include some important policy objectives and projects, such as Our Rural Future, the Town Centre First policy, Food Vision 2030, the Investing in our Culture, Language and Heritage strategy, the Linking People and Places tourism strategy, and the national sports policy. An extensive number of projects are already being rolled out through the €1 billion rural regeneration and development fund, RRDF. As of the end of October the RRDF has allocated funding of €280 million for 191 projects across the country worth a total of €380 million. Examples.of this include the Cahersiveen town centre regeneration project in County Kerry and the Cahir town centre regeneration project in County Tipperary. I congratulate the Deputy on the role he played in lobbying and securing funding for the project in Charleville town centre in the recent allocation. Under the national broadband plan that commenced roll-out in 2020, some 1.1 million people living and working in over 544,000 premises, including almost 100,000 businesses and farms, along with almost 700 schools, will receive access to high-speed broadband. As of the end of October, over 97,000 premises can order or preorder high-speed broadband connections. More than 87,700 premises have been passed and are ready for immediate connection.

It is a fantastic project worth €5.2 million and we hope it will be rolled out. There are a couple of issues. All these schemes are hugely beneficial to rural communities across the spectrum. Some rural communities got funding under the town and village renewal scheme and other schemes. Some of them started off two years ago at cost and now they have an allocation but that funding does not meet the cost of what they are trying to do. Is there a possibility of using unspent funding for 2022 to bolster the funding these communities got to give them an extra envelope of funding? It is important, especially for projects we could term shovel-ready that have planning and everything else but which need extra money because of the escalating cost of building.

I understand it will see the renovation of a number of vacant and derelict buildings in the heart of the town. Charleville courthouse will be renovated into a remote working hub and a currently vacant heritage building on Chapel Street will be converted into a new arts and community centre. In addition, an old HSE building in the town will be converted into the new home of the men's shed and the local snooker club. I again commend the Deputy, Councillor Doyle and others who made a contribution to securing that funding. I understand the Deputy's point about older allocations under schemes such as the town and village renewal scheme and the difficulties presented by the escalation of costs due to inflation. When it comes to individual projects, I ask that there be engagement with the relevant line Minister or that they be brought to my attention. If the projects are shovel-ready, we will certainly examine them and see what we can do.

He mentioned broadband. Some of the dates given are in 2024 or 2025 and the roll-out in particular areas has been brought back to 2023. Is there engagement with National Broadband Ireland, NBI, to see whether it can be further speeded up to ensure broadband for rural Ireland? It is the great enabler. There are great prospects for remote working and for companies to set up in rural Ireland, especially when so many people have decided to return to live there because of Covid. We have seen an expansion in our population and it is greatly welcomed. I ask the Minister to use his good offices to try to get us the broadband even faster, especially for areas where the date went back to mid-2023 when there had been talk about them being reached in early 2023. I would appreciate it if he could look at that.

It is the great enabler in so many respects. In a post-Covid - if I can use that phrase - environment of remote and hybrid working, there are huge opportunities for towns and villages all over Ireland. The Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, as the line Minister with responsibility for the national broadband plan, has very regular engagement with all of the key stakeholders, including NBI and also Eir, which is a supplier to NBI. The Deputy may be assured that where an opportunity exists to accelerate the roll-out of this programme, it will be seized upon. There were naturally delays during the period of Covid-19 but every effort is being made by the Department, the Minister of State, NBI and those who work with it to fast-track the roll-out of the plan insofar as is possible.

The Office of Public Works, in partnership with Cork City Council, is engaging proactively to progress the flood relief scheme for Glanmire. The Glashaboy flood relief scheme was confirmed in January 2021 by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 to 1995. The scheme is being funded from the €1.3 billion in flood relief measures under the national development plan to 2030 and as part of Project Ireland 2040. The Glashaboy River flood relief scheme will protect 103 properties from a significant risk of flooding. The tender documentation for the procurement and appointment of a contractor was issued in September 2021 with a return date of 24 January 2022. Unfortunately, Cork City Council was not in a position to appoint a contractor for the works on foot of this procurement process. Cork City Council is proceeding towards issuing updated tender documents in the coming weeks, however, with works scheduled to commence in quarter 2 of 2023. The key project partners are working to minimise the overall delay in the completion of these works.

Houses had more than 6 ft. of water in them. We now have properties, businesses and private dwellings for which people cannot get insurance. The relief scheme was signed off back in January 2021. The whole process that occurred thereafter was too slow, however. When contractors were invited to send in tenders, the cost of doing this work went way up. The Minister of State said it would be a few weeks. I always get concerned about the use of that term because by the time the few weeks are over, costs will have gone up again. Is there any chance we can tie down specific dates for when invitations will be issued for tenders to be submitted, and a specific timeline for when tenders are submitted and agreement is reached on who is awarded the contract? I raised the issue of the time delay with the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts recently. It is a problem we are now running into.

That is definitive. Second, I understand that these 103 families are now facing the risk of flooding but also the fear that they cannot ensure their properties. I understand this is a matter of urgency. The first tender process collapsed due to inflation problems, which I spoke to the Deputy about at the time. The whole framework for procurement has been changed to take into account and remove the inflation risk as far as possible. Cork City Council is now proceeding towards issuing updated tender documents in the coming weeks. The aim is that the works will commence by quarter 2 of 2023. That is the clear timeline for that.

The reason I stand here this evening is that there is much misinformation in the public domain regarding this project. It is important, particularly for the residents and businesses in Glanmire, that the Minister of State gives clarity and certainty. He half gave that already with regard to Deputy Colm Burke's question. Could he clarify for the audience at home specifically what the red tape hold-ups are, however? Can he clarify what processes specifically need to be adhered to in terms of the tendering process as we go forward? Obviously, there are legal conditions that need to be fulfilled. I would appreciate if he could give clarity on what they are specifically. The Minister of State confirmed this to Deputy Colm Burke, and the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath met with residents.

I was there on the night and saw the frustration and anger. The people and businesses in the community of Glanmire have been putting up with ten years of broken promises. They are sick of delays. This is like the Cork event centre. Every year, there is an announcement on flood protection for Glanmire but it is not delivered. They need flood protection now. They are facing into winter and every time there is a high tide or high rainfall is forecast, people in Glanmire cannot go to sleep at night. They are afraid to go to sleep because they could lose everything. The people affected have no flood insurance. Nothing has been done to protect them. I spoke to a lovely retired couple who have lived in Glanmire for decades. They raised their family there. They are great neighbours. They are selling their home because they can no longer put up with the broken promises. The people of Glanmire need flood protection now.

Behind every one of these flood relief schemes are tales of people who are of going through the anxiety, financial damage and mental trauma of having to deal with risk to their family home and their finances. I can confirm that the money has been secured. I stand beside the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform to say that very clearly. Unfortunately, the tender for the project went ahead during perhaps the worst period for a public procurement tender to happen during a period of rampant inflation. By the time the bids came in, none of the people who bid wanted to stand over their bids because the price of material had gone up so dramatically. Therefore, a new anti-inflationary framework has been put in place to deal with that in order that our public tenders can go ahead. It legally had to be put out to re-tender. It is a legal requirement that all public works contracts over a certain amount of money go out for tender. That is now being assessed by Cork City Council. The information I have is that it is scheduled to commence construction during quarter 2 of 2023. I cannot give a clearer or more definitive indication. The information I have is that the project will commence in quarter 2 of 2023.

#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-15 00:00:00	Death of Vicky Phelan: Expressions of Sympathy	368	As the Deputy is aware, my Department is responsible for allocating public funds across each area of Government spending and ensuring that expenditure is managed in line with these allocations by Departments. The National Development Plan 2021-2030, published last year, demonstrates the Government’s commitment to meeting Ireland’s infrastructure and investment needs over the medium-term horizon. The NDP provides €165 billion in public capital funding alongside a detailed and positive vision for Ireland up to 2030 as part of Project Ireland 2040. In budget 2023, I announced an additional €800 million for capital infrastructure projects and programmes next year, which will be made available under the NDP for core capital spending to help in delivering the largest, greenest and most ambitious infrastructure plan in the history of the State. This represents a very substantial commitment of resources. The Fiscal Monitor for October this year, published on 2 November, recorded gross capital expenditure of almost €5.5 billion to the end of October. The expenditure figure of €5.5 billion does not include capital carryover from 2021 spent in 2022. The amount of capital carryover spent to the end of October amounted to almost €750 million, giving an overall capital spend of just over €6.2 billion for this period. In year-on-year terms, gross capital expenditure is over €400 million higher, excluding capital carryover. Capital expenditure by its nature tends to be lumpy, with a particularly high drawdown at year-end. It is, therefore, not unusual for Departments to record an underspend or overspend against profile throughout the year. There can be any number of reasons for projects to diverge from the profiles submitted at the beginning of the year, such as delays in planning, delays caused by the rising level of costs, supply chain disruptions, fuel costs and skilled labour shortages.

Will he continue to encourage his colleagues in various Departments to progress this as fast as possible? We always hear complaints about an inability to start a project because t's have not been crossed or i's dotted and some hold-up creates a problem.These things are not always possible to resolve. Will the Minister keep a close watch on what is happening in the various areas that are most affected and can most benefit from the allocation he has made?

I certainly will. It is an important part of our ongoing work. It is true to say that so far this year we have a significant underspend in capital. I think that will continue to year-end although it is difficult to predict what the precise amount will be. We will certainly have a substantial carry-forward of unspent capital this year into 2023. I am working very closely with colleagues to make sure that we streamline the process as best we can. There is a balance to be struck between having an assurance process and absolute compliance with public spending code rules, which we must do, and ensuring that projects continue to move forward and actually get done. The whole purpose of providing €12 billion next year is to get a lot of work done in our country that must be done in terms of building more homes, building schools, improving our healthcare infrastructure, and improving our public transport and road infrastructure to name a few. It is a great opportunity to get projects completed given the scale of funding that is now available under the national development plan.

It is about delivery. The budget is in place. We are at almost a unique point in our history where when it comes to capital expenditure, funding is not the greatest constraint. The greatest constraint is the capacity to deliver. That can manifest itself in a number of ways. We have to strike the right balance, ensuring that we have due process, proper project appraisal in advance and value for money at all times, and ensuring above all else that we get the projects done and secure completion of vital projects to improve the quality of life of our people, fundamentally to provide homes for our people and also, from an economic point of view, to make sure we are competitive by continuing to invest in and improve our infrastructure. I thank the Deputy for a really pertinent question. It is an ongoing part of our work.

This assessment study built on previous reports of 2011 and 2015 commissioned by Iarnród Éireann. Having considered all various options, the assessment study recommends a new preferred option of a technically viable drainage scheme that would prevent flooding of the railway occurring while also including any flood mitigation measures downstream that would be necessary either directly or indirectly with this option. The Office of Public Works, OPW, has engaged constructively with both Clare County Council and Iarnród Éireann over recent years in relation to the flooding problem at Ballycar and has participated in a meeting on the matter convened by the council in 2014 and participated on a steering group from 2018 to 2020 comprised of Clare County Council, Geological Survey Ireland, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and Iarnród Éireann, in relation to the new preferred option. The selection of the new preferred option was based on the hydrological, hydraulic environmental impact assessments, mainly ecology, geology and hydrogeology, and costs of each option. The primary benefits of the measures identified in the assessment are derived from the protection of Iarnród Éireann infrastructure and accordingly it is with Iarnród Éireann, as the key stakeholder, to lead and pursue the resolution of the railway line flooding problem and to secure funding for the proposed project. The OPW will continue to work with Iarnród Éireann and the other steering group stakeholders in addressing the problems on the rail line at Ballycar. In response to a recent contact from the Department of Transport, my office has indicated that it is available to meet on the matter.

I take issue with the answer. He has said Irish Rail is to lead on this project. The solution to this serious issue is a couple of kilometres away from the rail track and really it should be with the OPW and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. Confidence will be lost in the service between Limerick and Galway if this floods. We had 2.5 times the normal rainfall just in October and it is not unlikely that we will see flooding on this line like we saw back in 2014 and 2015. If that happens, the service will be knocked out for anything between seven and 15 weeks, perhaps even longer. I am afraid to say that this has been passed from Department to Department and back again. The report is there now over two years and it seems that nobody wants to take ownership of this issue. It will be very detrimental to our ambitions to enhance public transport between cities and across the country if we allow this to happen and do not act now to prevent the flooding of the line.

The first was removing underground restriction between the swallow hole and spring and ancillary works. The second was attenuation of some flows at Rossroe and Fin loughs. The third was diverting the Rossroe Lough sub-catchment flow towards the Ratty river catchment along with removing the underground restriction between the swallow hole and the spring. The fourth was raising the existing railway embankment in the vicinity of Ballycar Lough. The fifth was pumping of flood flows from the swallow hole to the spring. Option 2, attenuation of some flows at Rossroe and Fin loughs, along with removal of restriction between the swallow hole and spring and ancillary works, was the one that was identified in the report and is the preferred option. The next stage is for funding to be obtained. The indicative duration of the project would be between seven and ten years. It is not a straightforward project. The primary purpose of the project is to protect the railway line between two cities, as the Deputy says, Limerick and Galway. It is recognised that this connection has been interrupted on a large number of occasions over the last decade.

The situation at the moment is that responsibility for the project is being passed between different Departments. That is a problem. We are two years in now and nothing has been done. A recent parliamentary question I submitted to the Department of Transport passed the buck again over to the OPW. Now we are hearing the buck being passed back again. It is not acceptable because if it keeps going on we are going to get flooding on the line. Everybody will accept a solution that takes seven to ten years to finish out but they will not accept it if nothing is being done when it can be done. We are losing years and have lost two already. A solution has been identified. It is a critical piece of infrastructure. We cannot afford to lose confidence in the service between Limerick, Ennis and Galway. That is what will happen if we do not act on this as soon as possible.

It is an issue we have both worked on. We have had meetings with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, and the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan. There really needs to be a coming together. Why not have a joint venture between both Departments? There is an identified solution there. It was originally costing €20 million. Both the Minister and the Minister of State will be aware of the fact that all these prices are escalating. The quicker we do it the better value for money we will get. We are ignoring the problem. I put in a parliamentary question last week to the Department of Transport. It is pointing at the OPW. It is literally pass the parcel. We need a solution to this. One has been identified. Both Departments need to get behind it and fund the option. The Limerick-Shannon metropolitan area transport strategy has been published.It hangs on the need to invest in rail. A rail spur to Shannon Airport is identified in that and various rail stations have been identified. This is a key link between Ennis, Limerick and Galway so the matter needs to be rectified. There is a solution and we need both Departments to fix it.

It is a key role of all politicians to broker agreement between different parties. The view of the OPW is that it is acting in an advisory role. Deputy Leddin is telling me the Department of Transport is saying it is an OPW job. We have all been in this situation before. I will bring the Deputies' comments back to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan. It is a multimillion euro project of between seven and ten years so it is cannot happen quickly.

I am pleased that this new cross-Border programme is at its final stage of development as a successor to the EU's INTERREG and peace programmes. With an unprecedented funding allocation of some €1.1 billion, PEACE PLUS will support shared peace and prosperity across Northern Ireland and the Border counties over the remainder of this decade. The draft PEACE PLUS programme has been developed by the Special EU Programmes Body, SEUPB, working closely with my Department and the Department of Finance in Northern Ireland, and has been approved by the Government, the Northern Ireland Executive and the North-South Ministerial Council. The draft programme was formally approved and adopted by the European Commission in July 2022. The final required element of programme development is the completion of a financing agreement between the EU, the UK and Ireland in order to formalise respective financial contributions to the new programme. By way of context, this had not been a requirement for previous iterations of the INTERREG and PEACE programmes, as the UK was then an EU member state. Work on this draft agreement is now well advanced. Engagement is ongoing between the three parties in order to finalise the text of the draft agreement over the coming weeks. The agreement will then have to be ratified by the three parties. It is anticipated that this process will be completed in time for the first calls for funding applications under PEACE PLUS to issue during quarter 1 of next year. I must also commend the programme of pre-development support for PEACE PLUS which is being delivered by the SEUPB. This is ensuring that potential applicants can deliver high-quality applications once funding calls open.

I mention some of the suggestions I brought to the Minister on working with the SEUPB, statutory agencies and community groups in my constituency and the Minister has provided for the type of issues we were hoping would be addressed. I welcome the Minister's statement that the EU has approved the draft programme. Hopefully within a number of weeks it will be possible to put the final stamp of approval on it. I ask the Minister to give us an assurance that the preparatory work that statutory agencies and community groups have been engaged in will be allowed to continue so that no time is lost while we await a final approval in a few weeks' time.

I had an opportunity on two occasions earlier this year to visit Northern Ireland and different projects that received funding under INTERREG 5A and PEACE IV. I visited Belfast in March and Derry in June, where I saw up close the transport hub and the Waterside shared village project. There are so many exciting projects in the Border counties, including in Cavan-Monaghan, the constituency the Deputy represents, that will benefit from the programme which has been agreed. The final piece of the jigsaw is the financing agreement and I assure the Deputy that the pre-application support work is continuing. I look forward to final approval of the financing agreement and then a formal launch of this programme whereby it can open up for applications.

Total gross voted expenditure to the end of October amounted to €66.531 billion, which is €80 million, or 0.1%, below profile overall. Gross voted current expenditure of €61.055 billion is €1.262 billion, or 2.1%, ahead of profile. Gross voted capital expenditure of €5.476 billion is €1.342 billion, or almost 20%, below profile. There have been a number of developments this year which have an impact on the level of current expenditure. These include the extension of the Building Momentum pay agreement, the response to the cost-of-living crisis, the humanitarian response to the war in Ukraine and the ongoing recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. The position of the gross voted current expenditure in some of the major spending Departments is as follows. The Department of Social Protection is ahead of profile by €517 million. The position is mostly reflective of the payment of some of the cost-of-living measures in October, which were announced as part of the budget in late September but not included in the 2022 profile. Gross current expenditure in the Department of Health is €581 million ahead of profile. This is largely due to higher Covid-19 related expenditure than anticipated, due to the Omicron wave and the pandemic recognition payment. Gross current expenditure in the Department of Education is €168 million ahead of profile, mostly due to increased costs associated with the substitutions and payments of Covid-19 supports to schools for term three, as well as increased escort payments for school transport. I can go through all the different Departments. We already had a discussion on capital expenditure but if the Deputy has a particular question, I will do my best to answer it.

Be it a flooding event or any other major humanitarian issue that arises, we will always step in and provide the necessary support. In adopting budget 2023 we have a strong fiscal framework and we are projecting a significant surplus next year. As the Deputy knows, we are in a position to put €6 billion into a national reserve between now and the end of next year. While there are undoubtedly global economic headwinds that will have an impact on Ireland, we are coming into this period in a position of strength.We have the public finances in a healthy state, which gives us the capacity to respond across next year to the type of scenarios that the Deputy outlined and indeed others that may arise in an unforeseen way.

#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-15 00:00:00	Death of Vicky Phelan: Expressions of Sympathy	389	I thank the Minister for taking this Topical Issue matter. We know - and are due to vote on it shortly in this Dáil - that every year, the State gives about €90 million in public funds to the horse and greyhound racing industry. We know that about €70 million of that goes to Horse Racing Ireland, HRI. What is new are the figures. Thanks to an answer to a parliamentary question I tabled, we know how much of that goes to prize money. Some 70% of that €70 million goes to prize money – approximately between €40 million and €45 million. In answers that I have just gotten back from HRI, that to compares with about 7% that goes to animal welfare. In reality, there is a massive transfer of public money to a small number of multimillionaires who get it tax-free and win it in the form of prize money. That is what is happening in black and white. One can look at the most recent HRI factbook for 2021. The top four winners were J.P. McManus, Michael O’Leary, John Magnier and Michael Tabor. They are all multimillionaires and none of them paid tax on that money. If one goes broader than that, the top ten owners won €11.8 million in one year. This money is not going to the poorly paid people within horse racing. It is going to already super wealthy individuals. One can look at the various races and who is winning. The prize money is concentrated among small number of people who are already very wealthy. Compare this amount of money with what is spent on other things. Compare it in terms of sports. I know those people who are winning it and the Minister do not like this comparison. However, the total core funding that Sport Ireland gives out on a yearly basis is €15 million, which is for the GAA, the FAI, the IRFU, Swim Ireland, the Special Olympics, Athletics Ireland, HRI, which even gets a bit of that money, and a range of other organisations. That is €15 million altogether compared with €70 million in public money that goes to the horse racing industry, the vast majority of which is used for prize money that ends up in the hands of already extremely rich people. Compare the €70 million to the half of that that is spent on domestic violence refuge shelters and a similar amount of money that is spent in terms of the National Park and Wildlife Service. At any time of year and in any given context, it would be unconscionable to have such a giveaway of public money to already extremely rich individuals tax-free. However, to have this continuing at a time of a deep cost-of-living crisis when one in three families is suffering from energy poverty and then, in reality, some of their taxes ending up in the hands of multimillionaires who face no cost-of-living crisis whatsoever, is absolutely scandalous. It is ironic we are having this discussion on the day that the Government launched gambling regulation. Why is the betting duty going to the horse and greyhound racing industry as opposed to tackling problem gambling?

I did not hear him mention that once and I do not think that is something he is too concerned about either. It is one of the sectors and industries in which Ireland is a true global leader. The broad geographic distribution of this industry contributes to the achievement of more balanced regional economic growth and rural economic activity, providing a wide range of employment and income opportunities from stable staff to trainers to jockeys to breeders and farmers. The support provided by public funds through investment in the industry has enabled Ireland to develop a world-class reputation for excellence in horse racing and breeding. The Irish thoroughbred breeding industry is extremely competitive at a global level. We are the second largest producer of bloodstock in world by value sold after the USA. Ireland has the world’s third highest number of thoroughbreds foaled each year after the USA and Australia.  Successive Governments have acknowledged the importance of this industry and supported it. Horse Racing Ireland, established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001, a commercial State body, is responsible for overall administration, promotion and development of the industry. The horse and greyhound racing industries receive financial support through the Horse and Greyhound Fund. My Department makes payments through HRI and Rásaíocht Con Éireann. On the current expenditure allocation, no more than 80% is to be applied to prize money. In 2020, €67 million was allocated to HRI from the fund and €76 million last year. In 2020, €54 million of the HRI allocation was assigned for current expenditure. The total prize money paid out in horse racing for 2020 was some €51.5 million, of which HRI contributed €35 million, or 68%. Private sponsorship of prize money was some €16.3 million, of which race horse owners themselves contributed some €11.7 million with the balance of private sponsorship contributed by corporate bodies.  The HRI factbook for 2021 shows that there were 394 fixtures, with 8,700 individual runners and 25% of these horses winning at least one race. More than 6,000 of the individual runners won prize money at some stage, which equates to around 69% of individual runners.  We are not outliers in this space. The support provided by public funds through investment in this industry has enabled us to develop a world-class reputation for excellence in horse racing and breeding. Horse racing in other major jurisdictions is also funded by government, either directly or indirectly. Ireland’s racing industry obviously is in direct competition with Britain, France, Australia, America and Hong Kong, for example. The global nature of the racing and breeding industry means that these countries compete for the same pool of foreign direct investment, which ultimately fuels horses and training and therefore employment. In France, there is approximately €400 million in government support per annum. In Hong Kong, the state supports are approximately €800 million per annum. In Australia, returns to racing differ from state to state, however, in the state of Victoria, for example, this amounted to the equivalent of €251 million in revenue in the years 2020 and 2021.  The owners of race horses who earn prize money are not subject to taxation in respect of this income. Race horse trainers and jockeys, however, are subject to taxation. There is no revelation in that our horse racing and thoroughbred sectors are truly world class. To conclude, we perform way beyond our size and scale. This is a sector that supports thousands of jobs in rural parishes across the country and is one that we should definitely support.

McManus, Michael O’Leary or John Magnier, not to mention the various people who are not living in this country who are in receipt of this public money.If one cuts out all the propaganda, the Government is choosing to give more than €40 million of public money every year to people who are already multimillionaires. That is what is happening. The Minister can talk about the industry, how successful it is and so on, and that is fine; I agree. However, that is not an argument to use the industry to give tens of millions of euro to people who are already very rich. That is an argument to say the industry can fund itself, as is the case in many other countries. There is an idea that Ireland is not an outlier and there is a reason why Irish prize money is so high. It is so high because of the extra public money that is provided. The industry would be capable of paying for its prize money, rather than having the majority of it paid by the public, through broadcasting rights, entry fees, sponsorship, breeding and bloodstock sales to name but a few potential areas of income. The bottom line here is that it is a political choice to hand over this money. I do not think that is justified on its own terms. Horse racing is not the poor relation of all the other sports in the country that have more people participating in them. That does not justify the choice. At least the Minister did not make the argument that Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, has made. It has stated it is not in receipt of any taxpayers' money because all its money is raised from the betting tax. That tax is paid by ordinary people. That brings me to the following point. Does the Minister not accept that this money that is raised from taxes on gambling should be spent on tackling the problem of gambling addiction and problem gambling, which the Government has spoken at length about today?

Dental services for medical cardholders are already under significant pressure in all areas. I am now seeing a worrying development that causes me to question the model of contract used. I am acutely aware of the pressure on dental services for medical cardholders in Carlow because I have been on the phone to dentists in my area asking for help with emergencies and severe cases. Subsidised dental services are currently available to medical cardholders and to qualifying workers who pay PRSI contributions but these services and general medical card and dental services are under significant threat from a recent audit decision by Revenue. The traditional dental model operating in Ireland, the UK and Europe is that self-employed dentists, known as dental associates, who practise as a joint venture within a group, hold individual contracts with the Department of Health and the Department of Social Protection to provide a range of dental services to the general public on a fee-per-item basis. The contracts are specifically stated contracts for service and are exclusively stated for self-employed contracts. I am assisting a group operating in Carlow which is concerned about these contracts. The contracts have been in operation and unchanged since 1993, which is almost 30 years ago. They cannot be subcontracted. Dentists who are employees cannot hold or operate these contracts legally in this manner. A recent Revenue decision to categorise these dental associates as employees in a practice in Carlow means the contract with the Department will be illegal. These dentists have paid their own taxes in order to continually hold the dental contracts. Each contract holder must produce an annual tax clearance certificate to the Department that offers the contracts to the dentist. However, Revenue has decided some self-employed dental associates are actually employees and this impacts the group operator, which has now been told these dentists are employees and not self-employed. Revenue recently decided to recognise the traditional dental model of dental associates, which is dental principal, to be a joint venture with no VAT liability, yet Revenue is now raising assessments against group operators for PAYE and PRSI obligations that should not be there. If Revenue presses the status of dental associates as that of an employee, some dental associates in Ireland will have to resign their current contracts for service with the HSE and the Department of Social Protection, and will not be able to see patients under these schemes. This will lead to an increased crisis of access in the provision of dental services for medical cardholders and also access for PRSI contributors. Will the Department for Social Protection revisit the current model or impress upon the Department of Finance the need to standardise the approach to the self-employed status of dental associates? As it currently stands, Revenue has opposing views on the matter in two Departments. Audit is one and VAT is the other. If dental associates are pressed to drop services for the PRSI medical cardholders, the loss to the community will be enormous. The Minister of State knows how important these services are. I urge her to speak to officials in the Department of Health and the Department of Finance to regularise the situation to prevent the loss of service to the public. This matter was brought to my attention by some dentists in Carlow. I want clarification. The biggest issue is that this has not been reviewed in nearly 30 years. We must ensure that medical card patients get to go to the dentist. That is what the system is there for.
#AnneRabbitte	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-party	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-dob	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-15 00:00:00	Death of Vicky Phelan: Expressions of Sympathy	407	I thank the Deputy. I am answering this matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly. The objective for all of us, as public representatives, is at all times to ensure that a person who holds a medical card gets seen to. The treatment benefit scheme provides dental, optical and medical appliances, comprising hearing aids and specialised contract lenses, to insured workers, self-employed and retired people who satisfy certain PRSI conditions. A person must have paid a specific number of PRSI contributions in the relevant tax year to qualify for treatment benefit. It is also available to the dependent spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of those who qualify. People can avail of a range of treatment either free or part-funded. Two significant changes to the scheme were introduced by the Government this year. A new grant of €500 towards the cost of wigs and other non-surgical hairpieces was introduced for those who have suffered hair loss due to a cancer or certain types of alopecia, with nearly 900 claims paid since the scheme was introduced in May. The eligibility criteria have changed to reduce the PRSI contributions to people aged 25 to 28, which will benefit almost 80,000 young people.The treatment benefit dental scheme provides for a free annual dental examination and an annual scale and polish treatment subject to a maximum co-payment by the customer of €15. The scheme is very popular, with 893,000 claims in 2021 at a cost of €53 million. Figures up to the end of September of this year show that 843,000 treatments were claimed which is a 10% increase on claims so far in 2022. Dentists can check a customer's eligibility online and make a claim for payment through the Department's welfare partners interface. Each month dentists are paid for treatments claimed in the previous month. Currently the Department pays the dentist a fee of €33 for an examination and €42 towards the cost of cleaning and other treatments. Departmental officials have commenced a review of the fees and part of the process involves examining the current contract to ensure it is fit for purpose and that any changes necessary are put in place. A consultation with the relevant bodies, including the Irish Dental Association, will be undertaken as soon as practicable following consideration of the complexities involved in developing a new contract. Officials hope to be in a position to commence this engagement in the near future. The Department is aware of the HSE contract with the dentists and will ensure that any new contracts will be mindful of the objective of the national oral health policy. A review of fees in the dental benefit scheme is a priority for the Department and the Department wants to resolve it positively and in a timely manner.

I welcome that consultation with relevant bodies, including the Irish Dental Association, will be undertaken as soon as possible. During the Covid pandemic, older people and those with medical cards found it hard to get access to their dentist. In fairness to the dentists, they worked extremely hard. Following this consultation, we need to ensure that the most vulnerable people in our communities are looked after. They need to be able to get the full benefit with their medical card and need to be able to access the dentist. The contract that is being changed needs to include all people who are deserving of it. The consultation on the contract with the dentists needs to happen as soon as possible. I and other people want clarification on this as do people with medical cards and those who pay their PRSI contributions. I again thank the Minister of State for her answer.

It is the Department's biggest scheme in terms of claims, with more than 1.4 million claims received in 2021 and a total expenditure of €109 million. So far in 2022 some 1,342,000 claims have been received with a total expenditure of €102 million. The dental benefit scheme is the most popular component of the treatment benefit suite of schemes and, as I said earlier, 843,000 claims were paid this year, an increase of 10% on the previous year, with payments to date this year coming in at €48 million. The treatment benefit complements the HSE system of dental care by providing dental check-ups and a contribution towards scale and polish for eligible customers. Any additional oral healthcare can be co-paid. I cannot understand how in recent months people with medical cards, particularly in my county of Galway, cannot access a dentist. Last Monday, I was with the Brothers of Charity at an award ceremony and it was the main item on the agenda. It is not the people with medical cards that is the issue here; it is the fact that they cannot get a dentist. Earlier this year, the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, made an additional €10 million available and it did not address the issue. Given that €60 million was underspent last year in dental services, one must question the obligation of the dentists within this and their willingness to come to the table to assist in finding a solution when the most vulnerable who are in pain cannot get assistance. It is beyond comprehension.
#NealeRichmond	unknown-#NealeRichmond-party	unknown-#NealeRichmond-dob	unknown-#NealeRichmond-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-15 00:00:00	Death of Vicky Phelan: Expressions of Sympathy	410	I appreciate the opportunity to raise this issue this evening. I raise it not just in the context of being a Deputy whose constituency contains the Belfield campus but also because it is of national structural and infrastructural importance. Of course, University College Dublin, UCD, is the largest third level institution in the State with a student population of over 25,000. While the news that came out earlier in the week that the college authorities have decided they are no longer able to push ahead with 1,200 additional on-campus accommodation spots is extremely disappointing, sadly it is not greatly surprising given that the reason cited for the cancellation or postponement of the project is rising material and labour costs and the difficulty in accessing both those things. While this is a disappointment and a challenge, I feel there is an opportunity here because the president of the university has indicated it is seeking Government support to get this project back up and running. In other fields where major national infrastructure projects are threatened due to rising costs or lack of labour, the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform has said the State will intervene and will work with developers and contractors to address those needs. That is a fair assessment and this case comes under that situation. It is regrettable that the university has stated it needs to ensure that the rents to be charged on campus will cover the costs. We want rents on campus to be charged in a fair and equitable manner, reflecting that the people living in this accommodation are full-time students. These are younger people who may have a part-time job but do not have the means to pay excessive market-based rates. I know those are not necessarily words people are used to hearing coming from my mouth but we are talking about third level education, involving the training and education of the future engineers and architects who will build the next phase of housing, the doctors and nurses who will staff our health service and even possibly the next generation of Deputies. Who knows what will come out of UCD in the coming years? They need to be able to be educated in a manner where their accommodation needs are not distracting excessively from their studies, which is something that is happening throughout the country at the moment. It has given rise to protests by student unions up and down the country within institutions and on a national level. We have another exciting opportunity that needs to be taken forward. This was a plan for just 1,200 accommodation units. Given the footprint of the UCD Belfield campus, we all know it has the opportunity to construct large levels of student accommodation. The space is there, the services are there and the transport infrastructure surrounding it is there. There is absolutely no reason we cannot inform UCD that the assistance will be provided on two conditions: that the Government can have a direct say on the rents being charged to students; and that UCD ups its level of ambition to a realistic level that will service not just the needs of UCD but also the needs of the entire State. It can alleviate a great deal of the pressure on the general rental market in Dublin, particularly in the south Dublin area that surrounds the campus.

We are very aware of the difficulties faced by students trying to secure accommodation. It is an issue that we are actively pursuing and resolution is a high priority for the Department as a whole. In September 2021, the Government launched Housing for All, led by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. It set out a series of over 200 actions which will be delivered to address the housing crisis, backed by a transformative budget of €20 billion. Actions 11.5 and 11.6 activate existing planning permissions and set out my Department's responsibilities. These are to bring forward a range of potential options for State support to assist activation of new, additional, purpose-built student accommodation units and to develop policy and methodology for potential short-term State supports for proposals for the construction of purpose-built student accommodation by higher education institutions to provide additionality for targeted cohorts where planning permission has already been secured. This includes the examination of relevant EU rules together with a borrowing framework and financing options for technological universities. The cost of construction and the cost of finance are obstacles hindering the HEIs from delivering on-campus accommodation at affordable rents for students. These have also influenced the decision by UCD to postpone the progression of the project at present without significant funding support intervention. My Department is working closely with the HEIs to examine the design specifications and financial modelling for each individual project on a case-by-case basis. Department officials have met with UCD and the Irish Universities Association, IUA, to discuss the projects for UCD's student accommodation. This engagement is ongoing and options are being considered to activate this project. In October, we updated the Cabinet committee on housing and received support on initial plans for policy development for the provision of student accommodation. We are actively progressing a new policy that bridges the challenges gap between the viability of delivering purpose-built student accommodation and subsequent rental affordability for students. This will include for the first time the State assisting with the cost of building student accommodation beds and unlocking projects which have been postponed in return for the affordable rents for targeted students. Detailed work is currently being advanced with a section dedicated to student accommodation having been established within the Department. We will also be bringing a memo to Government in late November setting out the short-term activation proposals and the long-term strategic response of the State to the provision of additional affordable student accommodation. In conclusion, we are finalising a memo to Government at the end of the month for approval on the assessed proposals to facilitate a number of short-term activation options set out earlier. UCD is obviously part of that conversation, as are the University of Limerick, UL, Dublin City University, DCU, NUI Maynooth and others. We also have to be honest that building will take time and we have to examine different options too. We are examining how we can come up with quicker solutions to address the immediate need. We are open to discussion with UCD and any other college that wants to build accommodation. This will be essential if we are to relieve the pressure on the overall housing market and to assist students with the help they need. I would like to thank the Deputy again for raising this matter. 
#NealeRichmond	unknown-#NealeRichmond-party	unknown-#NealeRichmond-dob	unknown-#NealeRichmond-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-15 00:00:00	Death of Vicky Phelan: Expressions of Sympathy	412	I appreciate the full reply that was given. I would also appreciate the opportunity to speak with the Minister, Deputy Harris, about this. I strongly welcome the consultation that is ongoing between the Department and the various third level institutions. It is important to recognise the national efforts to address this issue in terms of short-term activation measures. I see UCD being prominent this. There is also the ability to increase the number of people renting rooms. We also see other third level institutions pushing ahead with the construction of additional beds. There are 250 in Trinity College Dublin, 255 in University College Cork and 670 in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle’s own constituency in University College Galway. I mentioned the two opportunities, but I am seeking to conclude my contribution tonight with two asks. I seek urgency from the Department in dealing with this issue overall and in dealing with this issue as it directly affects the State's largest third level institution. That is important to every factor of our social and economic development. We need to move beyond conversations with the third level institutions to practical, immediate actions that will see large-scale investment in on-campus accommodation that will match the level of investment and development of so many other on-campus sporting and educational facilities that have been extremely welcome over the last decade. The other ask is straight to UCD. UCD needs to have the level of ambition that beholds the largest university in the State. I say that not just as a local Deputy for the area but as a proud graduate of UCD who thinks that the university should be leading by example, should not be letting other third level institutions lead and, most importantly, should do its duty to its students, staff and the people who live in the surrounding areas.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-15 00:00:00	Death of Vicky Phelan: Expressions of Sympathy	413	I thank the Deputy for his remarks and reassure him that this is a high priority issue for the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, so much so, as I alluded to in my opening remarks, that we now have a section within the Department that is dedicated to working with our HEIs to advance the provision of the much-needed student accommodation. That will be backed up by money. As I said previously, a number of initial projects are being discussed with a range of higher education institutions, including UCD. They all have to be looked at differently because they are not all the same. Different institutions are bringing forward different proposals, some of which are on-campus and some of which are off-campus. Commercial considerations and decisions have to be taken around that. In relation to our technological universities, it is important to say that we are significantly advancing the commitment to follow through on the decision taken by Government to allow our technological universities to borrow in order to build on-campus, purpose-built student accommodation. As the Deputy knows, the likes of UCD and the other universities can borrow, and that does not go onto the State’s balance sheet. Yet, for the former institutes of technology, which have now transitioned into the technological universities, that is an issue which has to be changed. In other words, any debt they accrue by providing purpose-built student accommodation will not go onto the State’s balance sheet in terms of the general State debt. To reassure the Deputy, it is a high priority for our Department, for UCD, as the Deputy articulated, as well as for every higher and third level education institution. We made significant changes to the rent a room scheme in terms of the people who can avail of it. They will not, for example, lose some social welfare or other entitlements if they enter the rent a room scheme. They can earn up to €14,000 per annum tax free. It is a huge assistance and benefit to people who are seeking accommodation but also to the incomes of the people who are providing the accommodation. I would encourage more people to engage in it.
#ThomasGould	unknown-#ThomasGould-party	unknown-#ThomasGould-dob	unknown-#ThomasGould-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-15 00:00:00	Death of Vicky Phelan: Expressions of Sympathy	414	I raise with the Minister of State the issue of the housekeeping attendance in Cork University Hospital. The pay scale of a number of positions in the hospital have been reviewed. They will see increases in the new year and I welcome that. However, housekeepers are to be excluded from this increase. This is despite Cork University Hospital’s providing housekeeping services 24-7. They are long, hard shifts, often in overcrowded wards where they are surrounded by infectious diseases. Throughout the Covid-19 crisis, hospitals like Cork University Hospital were kept safe and open thanks to the Trojan work done by these housekeepers and many others. They rose to the challenge during the pandemic when the State and the people needed them most. Even the Minister for Health at the time, Deputy Harris, highlighted the important work of hospital housekeepers when he tweeted, “You are on the frontline and your work is crucial in our national effort against the #coronavirus”. Covid-19 gave us a valuable insight into the role of those working in hospitals, from porters to kitchen staff to housekeepers, all of whom are essential workers. We value these people and I have no doubt that the Minister of State clapped for them. Yet, rounds of applause do not pay bills. They do not pay people’s rent, mortgage, put fuel in their cars or put food on their tables.  In an article in the Irish Examiner at the height of the pandemic, a housekeeper in Cork University Hospital detailed the work being done within the hospital. Many of these tasks are still being done today post-pandemic. Many of these tasks still need to be done. The levels of cleaning and infection control remain higher than they had been before. We have learned a lot from Covid-19 and many of the lessons are here to stay because they are dealing with Covid-19, MRSA and other infectious diseases. This extra work being done places a heavier burden on the housekeepers who are expected to follow new protocols and to work to a new standard. That should be reflected in their pay. Unfortunately, the process has concluded, but I ask the Minister of State to include a new pay scale for housekeepers. Let the Trojan essential work that they are doing in hospitals be reflected in their pay. The problem is that these housekeepers feel undervalued, underpaid and let down. I have spoken to the workers. They are devastated by this decision and are looking for help and support. When the State needed help and support, they were there. Today, a lady told me that, during our darkest hour at the height of the pandemic, housekeepers brought trolleys around to every room to feed patients because hospitals were trying to isolate people and reduce the risk of transmission. Housekeepers have also told me of how they had to go into rooms during the height of the pandemic and try to sterilise them so that more patients could be brought in. These are decent people. We are talking about 200 workers, who have asked me to bring their case to the Minister of State. I hope she will look on it positively.
#AnneRabbitte	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-party	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-dob	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-15 00:00:00	Death of Vicky Phelan: Expressions of Sympathy	415	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly. I am keen to respond as accurately as I can with the knowledge available to me at this time. It is important to note that any adjustment to pay scales for any public service staff, including housekeeping staff in Cork University Hospital, CUH, can only be done in accordance with public service pay policy. While the need for a review of pay scales is being raised by the Deputy, Department officials are not aware of any outstanding claim in respect of the pay of housekeeping staff in CUH or a corresponding collective claim relating to their pay scales. Under the dispute resolution procedure set out in the current public service agreement, Building Momentum, a minimum six-week period of initial bilateral engagement between the parties to a dispute must take place at a local level. If this is unsuccessful, the issue can be considered by the relevant sectoral oversight body or equivalent forum before processing through the various industrial relations machinery of the State. Departmental officials have confirmed that this matter has not been raised at the health sector oversight body or any other national industrial relations forum to date. Therefore, I cannot comment on this matter in terms of it being an outstanding claim. I can only engage on the matter from a general pay policy perspective. Building Momentum was originally to run from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2022. In acknowledgment of the changes to the underlying assumptions of the agreement in respect of inflation, however, a review of Building Momentum was conducted this summer in accordance with section 5.7 of the agreement. This led to the parties agreeing to an extension of the terms of Building Momentum by 12 months to 31 December 2023. The original agreement involved two general round pay increases of 1%, which were due on 1 October 2021 and 1 October 2022, along with an additional sectoral bargaining fund to deal with outstanding claims. The extension of Building Momentum has allowed for a further increase in basic salaries of 3%, backdated to 2 February 2022, an increase of 2% from 1 March 2023, and an increase of 1.5% or €750, whichever is the higher, on 1 October 2023. All public servants are entitled to all general round increases, and housekeeping staff will receive them alongside their other public service colleagues. Regarding addressing any claim relating to pay scales, sectoral bargaining was the only mechanism through which any claim could be progressed within the lifetime of Building Momentum. I am aware that the matter the Deputy has raised may relate to the current job evaluation scheme for support staff, which has been completed by the HSE. This scheme is in its fourth phase and the outcome of the evaluation may impact housekeeping staff, including staff at CUH. The report on the scheme has been shared with the Departments of Health and Public Expenditure and Reform for consideration. Once the HSE receives sanction, it will issue a circular for implementation.

I recognise her point about the general round of pay increases. She touched on the main issue, that of the job evaluation scheme, which is the least fair aspect. These workers feel that the evaluation has not been fair on them and their work. We all accept that they are front-line workers. They are continuing to do the work they did during the pandemic. For many people, we are in a different place where Covid-19 is concerned, but people working in a hospital, especially in housekeeping, and disinfecting and cleaning rooms, are still doing the same job they did during the height of the pandemic. Another concern occurred to me when I looked into this matter. Housekeeping staff are being told that, if they move to a different position, they will qualify for the pay increase under the new evaluation scheme. Will this lead to a privatisation or contracting out of housekeeping work once the staff have moved to new roles? I am seeking an assurance from the Minister of State. Staff should not have to move to new roles - that is unfair - but if grocery inflation is, according to RTÉ tonight, running at 13.4% and general inflation is running at 9%, a worker who sees a pay increase elsewhere will feel pressurised into moving roles. That is not right. These workers need and deserve a pay increase. If possible, will the Minister of State look into this matter under the evaluation scheme and will she guarantee that these jobs will not be privatised in the long run?

According to the concluding statement that the Minister has provided, grades that fall into the HSE's support staff category, such as housekeeping staff, have seen an overall increase of between 10.25% and 11.5% in the past four years alone, depending on their point on the scale. These increases have been as a result of the adjustments agreed via public service agreements, including the current public service agreement, Building Momentum. Further increases for these grades have been agreed as part of the extension to the public service agreement, as previously advised. The Department of Health and the HSE are bound by the existing pay agreement, which clearly states that sectoral bargaining is the only mechanism for addressing outstanding claims within the lifetime of the agreement. If a claim relating to this pay scale exists, I advise the relevant representative bodies to raise it at the appropriate national industrial relations forums and through the necessary local engagement, if that has not already occurred. The matter can progress through the relevant conflict resolution processes. I will bring both of the Deputy's suggestions to the Minister.
