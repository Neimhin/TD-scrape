        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_1">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_35">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 34, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">On the European Council meeting in Thessaloniki on 19 and 20 June, the House will recall that on Wednesday, 25 June, the earliest opportunity following the Council, one hour and 20 minutes of Government time was allocated to statements on the Council, including a question  and answer session. I refer Deputies to my comprehensive statement on that occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">As I indicated in my statement, I made clear that the Council was a major success for the European Union. It marked a further milestone in the enlargement of the European Union with the Heads of State or Government of the ten accession states attending a full European Council as observers for the first time; it warmly welcomed the outcome of the European Convention and it accepted the work of the convention as a good basis for the start of the Intergovernmental Conference; it set out a detailed work programme in the area of justice and home affairs; and, it approved the appointment of a new governor of the European Central Bank. I also reported in my statement to the House on my meetings with President Papadopoulos of Cyprus and with Prime Minister Blair <i>en marge</i> of the Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">Over the summer months I continued my structured series of engagements with my European counterparts in the context of the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the Union and the ongoing business of the Union with visits to Turkey, Spain, Austria, Slovenia and France.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">On 16 and 17 July, I visited Turkey where I met with Prime Minister Erdogan. The issues discussed included Turkey's application to joint the European Union and the possibility that the European Council, in December 2004, will set a date to open accession negotiations with Turkey. I encouraged the Prime Minister to continue with his extensive reform programme and I indicated a willingness, in particular during the Irish Presidency, to do everything possible to help. I also referred to the EU ambition for a united Cyprus to join the Union on 1 May next. I pointed out that this issue could influence perceptions in the lead up to the Council decision in December 2004. During the course of my visit, I attended a lunch hosted in my honour by Prime Minister Erdogan. I also laid a wreath at the tomb of Kemal Ataturk and paid a courtesy call on President Sezer.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">On 22 July, I visited Spain where I held talks with Prime Minister Aznar. On 24 July, I visited Austria where I met with Chancellor Schussel. Later that day, I travelled to Slovenia for a meeting with Prime Minister Rop. I also paid a courtesy call on President Drnovsek while there. On 12 September, I had a meeting and working lunch with President Chirac in Paris. While in Paris, I also fulfilled a long standing commitment to visit the newly renovated Irish College there.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">In each of these meetings, discussions focused on matters of mutual concern in the European context, including the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and Ireland's Presidency of the Union in 2004. A range of international issues was also discussed.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">I stressed at each meeting that the effective and efficient conduct of the Union's business is central to Ireland's Presidency preparations. I said that we are currently developing our Presidency programme and that I was eager to hear the views  of member and accession states and factor these into our planning. There were exchanges of views on how best to advance the Lisbon Agenda despite the challenges of economic slowdown and global uncertainty and in the context of the enlarged Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_43">The European Convention draft constitutional treaty was also discussed and while all agreed that it is a good basis for the Intergovernmental Conference due to start on 4 October, each country has issues of concern which it will wish to see addressed in the Intergovernmental Conference. I set out our concerns in this area. In addition, our discussions touched on international issues including the need to strengthen EU-US relations.</p>
          <p eId="para_44">I will be continuing this series of engagements with my counterparts in the coming months. Meetings are scheduled in October with Prime Minister Balkenende of the Netherlands, to take place in Rome, Prime Minister Van Hanen of Finland, to take place in Dublin, and Prime Minister Juncker of Luxembourg, in Luxembourg. In November, visits are scheduled to Slovakia, Cyprus, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Denmark and Latvia. The Prime Minister of Lithuania will also visit Dublin in November.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">I will, of course, attend the meetings of Heads of State or Government in Rome on 4 October to formally launch the Intergovernmental Conference. At that meeting, I will be making it clear to my colleagues that the draft treaty prepared by the convention offers a good basis for discussion at the Intergovernmental Conference. While there are, of course, a number of key issues of concern to Ireland, particularly the issue of taxation and some justice and home affairs issues, Ireland will fully support the Italian Presidency in seeking to conclude the Intergovernmental Conference by the end of this year. I am confident that a constructive approach on all sides will ensure a successful conclusion to the Intergovernmental Conference in December.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">I will also attend the European Council meetings in Brussels on 16 and 17 October and on 12 and 13 December. While the agenda for the Councils have not yet been finalised, I understand that the October Council will focus on a limited number of issues which is likely to include the re-launching of the European economy; strengthening the area of freedom, security and justice; and, external relations matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">Preparations are continuing satisfactorily in my Department for its role in the Irish Presidency of the Union. As I mentioned earlier, the effective and efficient conduct of the business of the Union is a key priority for our Presidency. We will seek to move the agenda of the EU forward during our term. There is ongoing contact between officials involved in the preparation for our Presidency with their Italian colleagues and there is also ongoing contact with the Netherlands, which will succeed our Presidency in July 2004, and with the European Commission and the secretariat of the European Council. The President of the Euro pean Commission, Romano Prodi, will visit Dublin on 22 October to discuss the Irish Presidency and, in particular, the spring economic Council. I will also discuss the Presidency with Pat Cox, President of the European Parliament, at a meeting in November.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">On 7 July, I signed an agreement along with the former US President Bill Clinton providing for co-operation between the Government's aid programme, Development Co-operation Ireland, and the Clinton Foundation on fighting HIV/AIDS in developing countries. The co-operation will focus initially on the provision of HIV/AIDS treatment, namely, access to life-saving drugs for poor people in Mozambique in co-operation with its Government. This will be a pioneering programme, developed by the HIV/AIDS experts recruited by the foundation and provided for in Ireland's bilateral programme in Mozambique. Ireland will commit $50 million to this programme over the next five years. The funding will come from the HIV/AIDS budget within Development Co-operation Ireland, which I initiated at the UN HIV/AIDS summit in June 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">Every year since 1990, the United Nations development programme has commissioned a report from an independent team of experts to explore major issues of global concern. The 2003 report focuses on progress by poor countries towards the achievement, by 2015, of development goals on poverty, hunger, education, child mortality and HIV/AIDS, agreed by all of the world's leaders at a UN millennium summit in September 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">Ireland is committed to reaching the UN target of 0.7% of GNP to overseas development aid by 2007. The level of funding required to reach this target will depend on patterns of economic growth and levels of GNP. In 2003, Ireland's overseas development aid will reach €450 million, or 0.41% of GNP, placing Ireland seventh in percentage terms among global donors. The report indicates that Ireland has advanced by six places up the human development index to twelfth in the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">I addressed the UN General Assembly on Friday of last week. I availed of the opportunity to pay tribute to the dedicated and experienced staff of the UN, led by Sergio Vieira de Mello, who were killed by an act of terrorism in Baghdad on 19 August 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">My statement to the General Assembly addressed a number of issues, including the need to reform the workings of the UN. I believe it is incumbent on all its members to renew our approach to the UN so that a viable system of global governance is created that can ensure international peace and security. My remarks also addressed several of the other issues of concern to the international community, where collective action is required to achieve progress. A copy of my statement to the United Nations General Assembly has been laid before both Houses. One  will note that it is my intention to seek Dáil approval for the deployment of a sizeable contingent of Irish Permanent Defence Force personnel to the UN peacekeeping mission in Liberia. The proposed deployment of some 430 will be the largest since UNIFIL in Lebanon.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">When in the United States, I met President Vicente Fox of Mexico. The primary purpose of this meeting was to discuss the arrangements for the EU-Latin American-Caribbean Summit which the President and I will co-chair in Mexico on 28 and 29 May 2004. I also had bilateral meetings with the President of Serbia and Montenegro and with the President of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p>

I would like to deal with one element of the replies given by the Taoiseach in respect of the Iraqi situation. It now appears as if it is going horribly wrong and that there are daily instances of further aggression against American troops and weekly deaths.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">Given the Taoiseach's contribution to the United Nations General Assembly last week, will he explain why he has belatedly criticised a policy of pre-emptive strike action by the American Government in the case of Iraq, given that Ireland supported it fully by offering the use of Shannon Airport as a transit point for military aircraft and personnel? Can he state whether he has had any discussions with either UN or American personnel on the supply of troops from Ireland to Iraq in respect of the conditions and criteria associated with reconstruction, peacekeeping and peace enforcement? Could he state if he is uneasy about American foreign policy in that other countries allegedly harbouring either weapons of mass destruction or intending to develop them might be on a pre-emptive hit list of the current American Administration?</p>

          <p eId="para_56">I thank the Deputy for welcoming me back to the House. He has raised three questions. The question of whether there will be discussions on a United Nations mandate with the Americans or anybody else does not arise and has not arisen because there is no UN resolution in this area. It has been made clear outside of the House that we would not be in a position to discuss it until that was the case. If it is the case that the UN agrees a mandate for Iraq it would be a matter for the Government to consider. As I have stated in my reply to other questions, we have made a large commitment of troops to the UN mission in Liberia, so regardless of what requests may arise, it is unlikely that we would be able to provide any additional troops.</p>
          <p eId="para_57">My statement last week to the United Nations is consistent with what we have said throughout, which is that we should adhere to the policy of the UN. We have adhered faithfully to the UN position throughout the campaign and debate on  this issue in the past year and we have outlined that position from start to finish in this debate. When Ireland was a member of the Security Council we worked at ministerial level and with Ambassador Ryan and did much to achieve an agreed UN position, but unfortunately that did not maintain into the early part of last year.</p>

          <p eId="para_63">Is it not the case that the Taoiseach has now, belatedly, criticised the policy of pre-emptive strike, as followed by the current American Administration? He did not criticise that policy last February when the United Nations position was effectively abandoned and when, more formally in the Dáil, full consent was given to the American position when America and Britain decided to invade Iraq on a pre-emptive basis. In view of his speech to the United Nations last week and given that he is the incoming President of the EU Council of Ministers, does the Taoiseach intend to make an issue of the fracture that now exists in European foreign relations between Britain and France, Germany and Russia? Does he intend to use his Presidency to focus on that aspect of foreign policy? Does he also intend to make proposals to change the structure of the UN Security Council, given that the current structure was designed on the basis of a world order created after the Second World War but that no longer exists?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_9">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_64">The Deputy raises two separate issues. With regard to the first, in view of our historic position one of our priorities will be to endeavour to improve a fractured relationship between the European Union and the United States. We will use our good contacts in Europe and the United States to improve what is a difficult position. In this respect, some months ago the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, presented a paper on this issue to the General Affairs Council which I believe, on the basis of what has been said by Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers, was well received. It set out why action should be taken in this area and how he  believed we could work to achieve it. It is an important development and we will continue our efforts in this area. Much depends on whether the parties concerned seek improved relations. I get the impression they do so but we will have to wait and see. A number of recent meetings involving the French President, the German Chancellor and President Bush have indicated that efforts are being made to mend some of the fences that were broken over the past 12 months or so and to make progress in this area. However, there continue to be grave differences of opinion.</p>
          <p eId="para_65">On the second issue concerning the UN, we will not use our Presidency of the European Union to follow that up, but we will play our part. Last week, the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, indicated his intention to immediately establish a small group of prominent experts who will seek to progress over the next 12 months the agenda of reform of the United Nations. Mr. Annan has endeavoured since he became Secretary General to reform and make changes to the UN. The structure is outdated and is insufficiently flexible to deal with the types of issues that arise these days. There is an argument about membership and about there being too many European seats, arguments that have continued for a long period.</p>
          <p eId="para_66">In September 2000, Kofi Annan set out his reforms and what he required based on the Brahimi report. They have not yet been implemented and, unless members, especially the permanent members, change their attitude, it is unlikely that they will be implemented. That is what Kofi Annan said last week. He will now use his position to bring forward a more focused report to highlight the areas in the Brahimi report and the longer document of September 2000 that he believes should be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_67">We will make our submission to that group, although it is unlikely we will be a member. It will comprise a small number of prominent people. We will make a submission to the group and I have discussed this with our ambassador, Mr. Ryan. Given the experience of our membership of the Security Council and because many of our diplomats have been involved with that council over the years, they feel well placed to make a submission with the Government, and that should help. Anything we do in this regard would be intended to assist Kofi Annan.</p>

          <p eId="para_70">The proposed constitution for the European Union will obviously be central to the Irish Presidency which commences  on 1 January next. What is the Taoiseach's view of the recent statement by the European Commission President, Romano Prodi, that under the proposed new EU constitution, each state should retain the right to have a Commissioner with full voting powers? As the Taoiseach will recall, the Government defended the loss of this right during the Nice treaty debate and people voted on that basis. Does the Taoiseach recognise that this U-turn on the part of the Commission is a vindication of the arguments presented by those of us who opposed the adoption of the Nice treaty? Will the Government maintain its opposition to the abolition of the requirement for unanimity on taxation matters?</p>
          <p eId="para_71">My party requested before the end of the previous session that a special debate opportunity be afforded in the House to address the draft constitutional treaty. We had hoped that would have been dealt with before the commencement of the Intergovernmental Conference which is due, as the Taoiseach indicated in his response to our questions, at the end of the week on October 4. We have had no debate and have no indication yet of the Government's position on the draft constitutional treaty. When will we, as elected representatives in this House, have access to the Government's position in advance of the commencement of the Intergovernmental Conference, given the extreme importance of this proposition both in terms of Irish sovereignty and neutrality or whatever is left of it, a subject which the Taoiseach has skirted around for the past few minutes?</p>

          <p eId="para_74">It is only the commencement of the Intergovernmental Conference. As regards the position of the Government, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and I have made numerous speeches setting out our position in various areas. I could ask for the documents in question to be given to Deputy Ó Caoláin if he so wishes. They are extensive documents which were put out over the summer and prior to that and a document issued when the Convention concluded in May.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">On the two questions the Deputy asked regarding President Prodi's recent speech, the position agreed in Nice was that when the Community reached 18 countries there would be no further increase in the number of Commissioners, a smaller number of them would be full members of the Commission and there would be strict rotation – sometimes one would be in and other times one would be out. We supported the system agreed in Nice.</p>
          <p eId="para_76">Since then, there have been two further proposals. The proposal in the Convention is that each country would have a Commissioner but there would be voting and non-voting members. This proposal is in the current Convention document. The third proposal, on which President Prodi outlined his views, will, I understand, be put forward by the Commission in a formal document.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_78">We will wait until Mr. Prodi publishes the document before responding to it. I understand from his speech and from the Commission's statement earlier in the Convention that the Commission would rather see a position where every country would have a post of Commissioner and a vote. This was strongly resisted by the larger countries earlier in the Convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">The larger countries gave up their right to a second Commissioner which was a major concession at the time. I do not agree that the Nice position was a victory for those who opposed the treaty because the larger countries made major concessions in giving up their second Commissioner and agreeing to the strict rotation method. If the matter of each country having a full Commissioner comes up for discussion again, I will look favourably on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">As I have said previously in statements outside and inside the House, I envisage a lot of difficulties if people do not have a vote or clear jobs. This is the difficulty with the draft in the Convention. It was stated at the time that this would be fleshed out in detailed discussions. We have to await that position. In communications with the Presidency during the summer we made the point that it would be far more transparent for Commissioners to have posts and votes and a that this position would be far easier for the public to understand.</p>

          <p eId="para_83">I ask the Taoiseach to be clear. Does he accept that it would be entirely inappropriate to commit troops to Iraq in current circumstances unless there is a clear, prior, specified lead role for the United Nations? Does he agree that to do otherwise would be to legitimise the doctrine of pre-emption? Did the Taoiseach read newspapers at the weekend which suggested that he confused the United Nations, which could not make head nor tail of the Irish position? While he refused to condemn the doctrine of pre-emption in this House, he apparently condemned it in New York. Does he condemn the doctrine and accept that it is a breach of the UN Charter and,  if so, why did he not state this to be the case at the time it mattered?</p>
          <p eId="para_84">On European matters, I note the Taoiseach stated the efficient management of the Union's business is central to Ireland's Presidency. In the interests of the Union, let us hope management of the Union's business is more efficient than management of our domestic business.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">What arrangements is the Taoiseach putting in place to provide a critique of the outcome of the Convention? Is he making any arrangements to report back to the House on the Intergovernmental Conference? Did the Taoiseach say that he expected the Intergovernmental Conference to conclude its work during the Italian Presidency? Is there any basis for that view? Does the Taoiseach accept that one of the lessons of Nice is that there ought to be regular reports to this House from the Intergovernmental Conference?</p>

        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_21">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_86">I have already answered the first question asked by Deputy Rabbitte. There is no question of putting troops into Iraq without a clear resolution from the UN. Even if there were such a resolution, it is unlikely we would be able to contribute because of manpower arrangements. However, there are no negotiations on this issue and there are unlikely to be any until all matters are concluded at the United Nations and that might or might not happen in the next few weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">I do not believe Ireland created any confusion last week. There was no basis for any of those comments. We set out our unchanged position to the UN, where we are held in high regard. Ireland is seen as a country that has done an excellent job over the years, particularly during its recent term on the Security Council, and it did much to try to help relationships during a difficult period. That is appreciated by Kofi Annan and the staff of the UN. There is no question about that. I was warmly received by the United Nations last week.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">With regard to European issues, it is the stated position of the Italian Presidency, a position that is supported by the vast majority of countries, that the Intergovernmental Conference complete its work by December. The Presidency set out a timetable with a demanding workload, particularly for the General Affairs Council and the European Council. The Italians are using various methods, including weekly and fortnightly questionnaires, to try to short circuit some of the work. When countries send in their detailed views they try to synopsize them in an effort to do the job quicker. It is the intention of the Italians, the Commission and the vast majority of countries to complete it before the end of the year. We will have to wait and see whether that will be achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_89">There will be a debate in the House in which we will set out our position going into the Intergovernmental Conference. It has already been put in the public domain but we will do so again on the basis of discussions that took place  in the General Affairs Council during September and the replies we sent to some of the questionnaires. I intend to go to the European forum shortly to set out where things are. I will do that in a detailed paper.</p>

          <p eId="para_108">Since discussion on the final constitution being ironed out by EU Governments at the intergovernmental conference is behind closed doors, in the interests of transparency, does the Taoiseach recall that, on 25 June 2003, before the summer recess, he told the Dáil that the Government would be pursuing specific concerns, including unanimity on taxation, certain issues in criminal law, and some issues relating to security and defence?</p>
          <p eId="para_109">Regarding pre-emptive strikes, on that basis, will the Taoiseach accept or reject on behalf of the Government a number of inclusions such as Title V, Article 40.3 of the draft constitution, involving Ireland in increased arms spending? Will he accept the solidarity clause, which countenances pre-emptive strikes in a blank cheque for military co-operation, including for the purpose of countering the threat of terrorism, which was the United States' argument for attacking Iraq? Does he accept that, if the Government's neutrality is to be taken seriously, it must assert that such military inclusions in the constitution are unacceptable? The European Armaments, Research and Military Capabilities Agency, for example, is to be established with a strong mandate to boost "the industrial and technological base of the defence sector".</p>
          <p eId="para_110">Is the Government prepared to accept such inclusions in the constitution? As it is aware, the Green Party was fighting alongside the Government to ensure that the constitution was in accordance with what we believe to be Ireland's wishes.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_111">I reaffirm my statement that there will be a debate, and we should try to have it at an early date to plot where we stood at the end of the convention and where we stand now at the commencement of the Intergovernmental Conference. Some matters have moved on a little, though there has not been any great change. Our position still holds. It mentions common law, where we have a similar position to that of Malta and Cyprus, which is different from most of the other countries on justice and home affairs issues. We still want to follow what we said in the convention on those issues. Those views are shared by one or two other countries. The issues will have to be thrashed out in discussions, but not much has changed in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">On the issue of taxation and qualified majority voting, I have already explained the position to Deputy Ó Caoláin. Some of the institutional issues are still being debated but there has been no change from the position we held earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">I repeat we can accept the idea of a solidarity clause that would assist the EU's response to emergency situations and threats arising from terrorists and non-state entities directed against civilian populations and democratic institutions situated within European Union territory. We do not consider that this would extend to pre-emptive military action. That has been the position we have stated in the convention. I understood that the Green Party also agreed to that position. As has been underlined previously, the idea that in the event of an emergency the Union would be in a position to mobilise all its assets and call on its member states, both civilian and military, is very much in keeping with our traditions. A number of partners, including Austria, Finland and Sweden, which have always been considered neutral, also support a solidarity clause along these lines. We have kept close to that position. Nobody has an alternative view and all the strongly neutral countries hold that view.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">The position on the agency is that the Thessaloniki Council gave the appropriate bodies of the European Union the task of undertaking the necessary actions towards creating, in the course of next year, an intergovernmental agency in the field of defence capabilities, development and research and the acquisition of armaments. The modalities for the establishment of this agency are under consideration by the European Union and will be advanced between now and the end of the Netherlands Presidency at Christmas 2004. We will meet our responsibilities which will fall on us during our Presidency in progressing the work in this area. We are satisfied that participation in the agency is voluntary in nature so it does not create a difficulty for us. It is anticipated that the agency will contribute to eliminating the wastefulness which characterises spending on defence in the European context. This would be welcome. Many of the issues arising are ones which the European Union was not in a position to deal with successfully when there was trouble in south-eastern Europe and the western Balkans,  when Europe was strongly criticised that it did not have its act together, did not have an armaments agency and was not capable of dealing with these issues. Those are the issues being brought forward for which there is general support.</p>

There were elements of a common defence policy but a common defence is a different matter. Will he agree also that on this occasion, common defence is on the agenda and if we are to carry the people with us in a referendum it is time to be up front, honest and open? Will he agree that if Ireland does not participate in the making of rules on common defence the rules will be made by those who join from the beginning, rather like the EMU, and those who join later will do so based on the rules made by others? Therefore, will he agree it is time to negotiate those rules and for Ireland to join on its own terms from the beginning?</p>

That is why we endeavoured to get the UN to an agreed position. We will continue to try to get it to a fixed position. The legal arguments will go on forever and, as happened last year, one will never satisfy the legal arguments. The argument is being fought all over. We stand for the UN position that there should be a multilateral system where the world and the 191 members of the United Nations should agree within its membership and the Security Council to achieve this position. That is what we fought for and we are held in high regard for holding that position. We are highly thought of for taking that position and making that contribution.</p>

Time and again people want to complicate those arguments. We have continued, since Maastricht ten years ago, to play our role in these areas. However, the issue of mutual defence, of which we are not and will not be part, continues to create a difficulty. This time I think the debate for all of us will involve keeping a clear position between what is common foreign security policy and the European security defence policy, and to try to make those issues as simple as we can. We have spent quite a lot of time in our papers on this treaty – we are not the only party to do so as members of the Convention from other parties have done so also – in trying to state the different arguments in the case. I will do so again when I address the meeting in Dublin Castle shortly.</p>

        <speech by="#CharlieMcCreevy" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_55">
          <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</from>
          <p eId="para_130">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the matter to which the Deputy is referring is known as VAT carousel fraud. This involves the consignment of high value, low volume goods, typically computer processing units or mobile phones, through a chain of companies in two or more member states of the EU for the sole purpose of defrauding the Revenue authorities of the VAT payable on the goods in the country of eventual destination. The Revenue Commissioners are well aware of this type of fraudulent activity and have been actively tackling it in collaboration with the revenue authorities of the other member states concerned. A dedicated VAT carousel fraud unit in Revenue has the specific remit of addressing the issues and assisting other revenue authorities under the mutual assistance directives and regulations. Since 2000, over 35 investigations have been carried out. The Criminal Assets Bureau has also been actively involved in some of these investigations.</p>
          <p eId="para_131">As a result of effective information exchange and concerted enforcement activity by the various revenue authorities in the EU, it is believed that the bulk of this type of trade in CPUs between this country and the United Kingdom has all but ceased. Inquiries to date indicate there has been no significant loss of VAT to the Irish Exchequer as the fraudulent activity has been targeted at other jurisdictions. However, because some of the trade has passed through Ireland, Revenue has adopted a very proactive approach to combating the frauds elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">The Revenue Commissioners have assured me their VAT carousel unit will keep the situation under constant review.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_56">
          <from>Mr. R. Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_133">I thank the Minister for his reply. Can he explain how it took so long to detect this type of fraud when there was an active unit in place? Having read the CSO report on the export figures, am I correct that with €8,000 million passing through the Irish economy in any one year, the potential VAT loss is nearly €2 billion? Can the Minister assure us that, apart from the CPUs which he described, there are no other sectors where a similar opportunity exists for VAT fraud? Was the fraud carried out on the Irish or British taxpayers?</p>

        <speech by="#CharlieMcCreevy" eId="spk_57" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_134">The fraud indicated by the figures to which the Deputy refers has been committed against the United Kingdom taxation authorities. However, that is not to say that we have not suffered some VAT carousel fraud. VAT carousel fraud is a feature in the member states  of the EU. When goods are exported from one EU member state to another, a zero VAT rate applies. The fraud occurs when goods are exported at a zero VAT rate and are re-imported almost immediately, all of which may be done several times and involve a number of companies. The goods are eventually exported to the second country where finally a company goes missing with the VAT and there is a fraud on the exchequer of the relevant country. This has a negative effect on CSO statistics in regard to GNP and GDP because goods are being exported and re-imported which distorts export figures.</p>

        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_58">
          <from>Mr. R. Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_135">The CSO has indicated that our imports and exports were down by €8,000 million as a result of this fraud. In other words, the undetected activity going through Ireland was in the order of €8 billion. If that is the case, how can the Minister give us assurances that this practice has all but ceased if such similar carousel fraud could be committed in so many areas?</p>
          <p eId="para_136">Has the Minister carried out an audit of the systems in the Revenue Commissioners' office which failed up to 12 months ago, but which he now assures us are absolutely foolproof? Have independent people examined the way in which this issue has been handled in order to give us assurances that this cannot occur in other areas?</p>

        <speech by="#CharlieMcCreevy" eId="spk_59" as="#Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_137">This is not just a problem for the Irish authorities. The chief sufferer in this case was the UK revenue authority. There is nothing to prevent the export of goods from one EU country to another and under the present EU law, this involves a zero VAT rate. There has been no loss to the Irish Exchequer from VAT carousel fraud. However, the opportunity exists for people to do this. It applies as much between Ireland and the UK as between the UK and France or France and Germany and the revenue authorities in all the member states actively pursue prevention of this activity. However, it is impossible to eliminate this activity completely because it is legitimate to export goods from one country to another.</p>

However, one cannot eliminate the sale of goods from one country to another.</p>

      asked the

      his views on the Exchequer figures for the first nine months of 2003; his estimate of the likely budget surplus or deficit for the end of 2003 and the expected tax take by the end of 2003; the way in which these figures compare with the estimates he gave in the last budget; the expected outturn of capital spending at the end of 2003; the way in which this compares with the estimates in the budget; the capital spending projects that will be completed and those that will not; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_145">The Exchequer returns for the first nine months of the year will be available on Thursday, 2 October 2003. In the meantime, Exchequer figures are available up to and including 31 August 2003. An Exchequer deficit of €892 million was recorded for the first eight months of the year. This compares with a budgeted deficit of €1,869 million for the year as a whole. Based on the available figures, it is estimated that the Exchequer borrowing requirement for 2003 could be up to €500 million higher than forecast at budget time.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">The higher forecast deficit is due to the possibility that tax receipts could be up to €500 million lower than the budget day forecast. Total Exchequer tax receipts to the end of August 2003 were €19,093 million compared to €18,523 million for the same period in 2002 equivalent to an increase of 3.1% year on year. This compares with a budget day target of 8% for the year as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">Overall, total Exchequer expenditure is expected to come in broadly on target. The provision for capital spending in 2003 is €5.5 billion. While current indications are that there may be some small underspends in a limited number of Departments, it is too early at this stage to be definitive. Capital expenditure is especially susceptible to timing factors and it normally accelerates in the final quarter of the year. The position regarding capital projects is a matter in the first instance for the Ministers concerned.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</from>
          <p eId="para_163">As the Deputy will be aware, the full report on the River Tolka flooding study, which is being funded by the Office of Public Works at a cost of €870,000, is being carried out by consultants employed by Dublin City Council as part of the greater Dublin strategic drainage study. The final report was initially expected to be completed in May. However, as the consultants were heavily involved in producing interim reports for the three local authorities concerned, Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council and Meath County Council, and also preparing the design of the interim measures being undertaken, it was not possible to meet the deadline. A draft final report was completed and received by the Office of Public Works and the local authorities in counties Meath and Fingal and Dublin city last month. The report, as it considers the River Tolka catchment from Dunboyne in County Meath, through the Fingal area and all the way through the Dublin city area, is being given careful and detailed examination by Office of Public Works. This examination is now almost complete and Office of Public Works will be submitting its observations to Dublin City Council very shortly. Completion of the final report by the consultants will follow on as quickly as possible but it will be dependent on how significant any proposed changes are. All parties are aware that the report should be completed speedily so that decisions can be made on the whole Tolka catchment.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">Following the completion of the interim report from the consultants in November 2002, discussions took place between Dublin City Council and the Office of Public Works on a package of works which could be undertaken and funded by the Office of Public Works on behalf of the coun cil. The works were undertaken under the Local Authorities (Works) Act 1949, and the council publicly exhibited the package of works in January to February of this year, in accordance with the requirements of Part 8 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001. Not all of the recommendations contained in the interim report were included by Dublin City Council in the proposed package of works and no works downstream of the Tolka Park area, apart from general maintenance, were included in the schedule of works provided to the Office of Public Works.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">Almost all the works contained in the Part 8 process exhibited by Dublin City Council have now been completed and the cost of these works to the Office of Public Works this year will be in the region of €1 million. When the final report is ready the Office of Public Works will enter into discussions with the local authorities as to how its recommendations can be implemented.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gregory</from>
          <p eId="para_166">Will the Minister of State not agree that the delay in the publication of the final report has more to do with a failure to provide adequate funding for the works required than with anything else? What funding has been set aside for the works that remain? I am referring specifically to the area downstream of Griffith Park and Drumcondra Road. Thousands of homes are at risk in the Clonliffe-Ballybough-Richmond Road area. They have been flooded twice in the past three years and virtually nothing has been done regarding that stretch of the Tolka. Will the Minister of State not agree that he is negligent? He gave a commitment in the Dáil on a number of occasions to me and other representatives of the area that the works would be carried out, yet the city manager has told members of the city council that funding has been sought for the removal of the Distillery Weir, which is a major undertaking, to free the whole Clonliffe area from the threat of flooding. There appears to be no answer from the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">Will the Minister of State indicate what funding has been allocated and for what works downstream of Drumcondra Road? I welcome the work which has been carried out opposite the Taoiseach's office in Drumcondra around Griffith Park. The problem is that virtually nothing has been done anywhere else. As we are now heading into the winter, people are very concerned that their homes will be destroyed yet again unless these works are carried out. That whole stretch of the Tolka has not been properly dredged. The weir has not been removed. A bridge at Distillery Road which is an obstacle and flood threat has not been raised or removed. The river walls along this stretch have not been reinforced. Nothing has been done. What is the Minister of State's response to these issues? Is he waiting for another flood to devastate the area on the north side of Dublin?</p>

        <speech by="#TomParlonPD" eId="spk_79" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance">
          <from>Mr. Parlon</from>
          <p eId="para_168">I appreciate that most of the work has taken place upstream of Tolka Bridge. When  the Office of Public Works was faced with the task of responding immediately – people wanted an immediate response – the first report had not been drawn up. In terms of planning permission, the public exhibition and environmental impact study takes substantial time. Given the money which has been spent and the work carried out, one must concede that the work carried out has been very practical. The work downstream involves a more technical input, including a major environmental impact study, detailed engineering design and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">It was not a simple operation to carry out the work downstream. The draft report suggests an overall cost in excess of €30 million, which includes an area from County Meath to the sea. As regards the works carried out upstream, in four of the major exits water came overboard. Much of the flooding downstream of Tolka Bridge was caused by water that flowed out upstream, went overground through the streets and did a lot of damage. The works which have been carried out will limit substantial flooding in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">Work will have to be carried out which will cost a substantial figure. The current Office of Public Works budget is just €19.9 million annually for the total flood relief scheme. As I said earlier, matters will be decided shortly in the context of the final report. When major works are being carried out, such as the work on the weir, the extra costs involved in dealing with objections and public consultations can be very substantial. The flood review group has been sitting for the past six months and is about to report shortly. It is becoming almost impossible to carry out a major scheme both from practical and expense points of view. Other alternatives will be considered following the publication of the final report.</p>

      <b>Mr. P. McGrath</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Finance</b>
      the action he plans to take as part of the Government's anti-inflation initiative.
      [21054/03]

        <speech by="#CharlieMcCreevy" eId="spk_89">
          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_181">The rate of inflation in Ireland has eased significantly over the past few months, falling from 5.1% in February to just over 3% in July and August. However, we cannot afford to be complacent. Bringing the rate of inflation down further towards that of our EU partners remains a priority for the Government. This is essential in order to safeguard our competitiveness and prevent job losses. The anti-inflation initiative, which brings together key participants in the partnership process to tackle the issue of domestic inflationary pressures, has an important role to play in this regard. The anti-inflation initiative group is expected to submit its first formal report to the Government shortly and I look forward to seeing its conclusions.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">Strict adherence to the pay arrangements in Sustaining Progress is also vital to the continued easing of inflation as so much of our inflation rate is affected by wage developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">Another important factor, if our inflation rate is to moderate further, is the control of public expenditure. My Department will continue to utilise the management and control mechanisms that are in place to ensure that this is achieved. The Government is determined that public expenditure will come in on target this year.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_90">
          <from>Mr. R. Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_184">I still fail to see what the Government's anti-inflation initiative consists of. Is it correct that the CSO has confirmed that 85% of the inflation published in August for the previous 12 months comes directly or indirectly from the Minister and his Ministers, either through indirect taxes of 1.4% of the portion, with the various charges on services and stealth tax making up the balance? As stated in Sustaining Progress, is the Minister's budgetary and public policy over the lifetime of the agreement having regard to the inflation target or is it correct to say that he has abandoned the inflation target when setting charges and stealth taxes? Will he accept that many householders and businesses are finding it extremely difficult to cope with the charges being imposed? Is the Minister aware, for example, that Irish businesses have witnessed a 10% cut in their prices over the past 12 months while the services under his remit are seeking 15%, 18% and 25% increases in their charges? Is it not the case the inflation problem is being generated by his ministerial colleagues and administration?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CharlieMcCreevy" eId="spk_91">
          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_185">The anti-inflationary initiative group comprises representatives of the Departments of the Taoiseach, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Finance together with representatives of ICTU and IBEC. The forecast rate of inflation has dropped from my budget day figure of 4.8% and this year's average is expected to be approximately 3.6%. The moderation in inflation since the beginning of the year is the result of a number of factors. There has been a considerable moderation in service sector inflation, which has reduced from 6.1% in January to 4.5% in August. I am not aware of the CSO figure referred to by the Deputy but he may be confusing it with a figure in a survey conducted by Forfás in this regard.</p>

          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_187">Either way, the Deputy is making the same point that the bulk of inflation is caused by Government action rather than anything else. That is not correct. The budget day measures I introduced last December contributed 0.9% to the 2003 inflation figure. I estimated on budget day the figure would be 0.85% and it currently stands at 0.9%. It is correct that changes in services supplied by public bodies have also contributed to the inflation figure but as far as the budget day exercise is concerned, it has contributed 0.9% to the overall inflation figure.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">The Deputy referred to a number of matters relating to the increase in inflation, on which he produced a number of documents. However, for example, the increase in the price of electricity is not directly controlled by the relevant Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">The thrust of Government policy is to get our inflation rate down to the European average. The EU inflation rate, to which the ECB works, is approximately 2%. We were considerably behind the rest of Europe in terms of the general harmonised inflation rate used throughout Europe but that gap has narrowed. The HICP figure for Europe to the end of August was 2.1% while Ireland's HICP rate was 3.9%. The gap was considerably wider earlier in the year.</p>

          <from>Mr. R. Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_190">Does the Minister agree many of the figures he is quoting bear little relationship to the reality facing people? For example, his figures claim the cost of housing has fallen by 14% in the past 12 months. House prices are soaring and people trying to buy houses are having a difficult time. Does he accept he undertook to introduce anti-inflationary initiatives? One thing all Ministers have in common is they are always one more report away from doing anything about these problems. The Minister promised the report would be published earlier in the summer, yet now, towards the end of autumn, he still has not produced it. No action has been taken by the Government and the Minister has not given a commitment to avoid service charges, stealth taxes or indirect taxes as a way of resolving the funding problems he has created for himself.</p>

          <p eId="para_205">The Sustaining Progress commitments on taxation indicate that the need to pursue responsible fiscal policies and to maintain the public finances in a healthy condition will  guide all taxation decisions as will a range of other points. These are issues I will bear in mind in annual budgets over the period of the agreement. The Deputy may be referring to the personal taxation objectives in the agreement which state that to the extent that there is any scope for personal tax reductions, progress will continue to be made over the three budgets contained within the lifetime of the agreement towards exempting the minimum wage from taxation and moving towards a target where 80% of all earners pay tax at not more than the standard rate. The cost implications of making further progress in either commitment depends on the degree of progress possible in the annual budgetary context. The primary functional responsibility for the social insurance system, including the revenue aspect of the system, rests with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.</p>

The Minister will be aware the Sustaining Progress agreement has an objective that the tax system should be "fair and able to adapt to changing circumstances". Does the Minister agree there is broad agreement that the taxation policies of the past six years have benefited far and away the better off in society and have disproportionately addressed the needs of the less well off? Does he accept many of the lowest paid workers are still in the tax net, despite years of promises to take them out? Sustaining Progress acknowledged that almost one in three of all PAYE workers pay tax at the highest rate of income tax, even though the Minister's target was one in five. Does he also acknowledge a considerable swathe of workers who are on the minimum wage or below are also in the tax net? How will changes envisaged in Sustaining Progress affect this? Does the Minister accept real inequality was uncovered in the Revenue Commissioners' survey of the highest earners in society conducted last December? It found that one quarter of the highest earners pay no tax at all. How is that fair? What does the Minister propose to do about that?</p>

According to the bodies to which I referred, Ireland has the lowest tax wedge of all countries in the EU and the OECD and it has a lesser take from lower wage earners than any other country by a considerable margin. That has been achieved through the budgets I have introduced since 1997. We have the best tax system for the low paid in the EU and the OECD and it has received favourable comment. The implementation of the last budget meant that 90% of minimum wage earners were taken out of the tax net. The Deputy's assertions were true prior to 1997. However, they are no longer correct and the facts, internationally commented upon, bear that out. The commitments in Sustaining Progress, like all other commitments, are conditional on the budgetary position. As I have said in Sustaining Progress, and previously in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto, any improvements in taxation over the coming years will be concentrated on those at the lower end of the scale. That is where our commitment lies.</p>

          <p eId="para_214">I welcome the Minister's response. He acknowledges that the total receipts from tax and social insurance contributions are the lowest in the EU when measured in terms of either GDP or GNP. While that seems to satisfy the Minister greatly, how does he balance that with the reality that we have the lowest social provision and much lower infrastructural quality in terms of ordinary people's daily lives? What is the price of the Minister's boast? That price affects the daily life conditions of families which are struggling. I will not recite the whole litany of neglect by the Minister and his colleagues in Government over this past 12 months or over the previous five years. The price exacted is an unacceptable quality of life for ordinary people in this jurisdiction, and the Minister's boast is not one he should proudly proclaim in this House.</p>

      the cost of capital he would regard as acceptable in a private funding package for a public project.

          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_222">Overall value for money in privately financed projects is assessed by comparing Exchequer cash flows under a more traditional procurement with the cash flows arising in the privately financed PPP tender. The private financing is an integral part of this assessment but one which is so significant, it merits separate consideration. I established the National Development Finance Agency for this purpose. One of its functions is to advise on the optimal means of financing public investment projects. The NDFA brings financial expertise to this role and I have provided it with the necessary flexibility to carry out its functions and apply its own professional judgment.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">On the one hand, a State authority can contract with the private sector to build a facility while financing this itself at the cost of Government funds, which would currently be about 4.3% for long-term money and that, in general, is the test applied to the financing element of any alternative package. On the other hand, a State authority can seek an all-in package from the private sector that would include the design, construction and maintenance package but also a financing mechanism. In assessing whether such a package is good value for money, many issues arise including the comparative cost of funds, the degree of risk transfer, quality of product, maintenance quality and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">I intend that any additional cost associated with private finance will be incurred only where the overall value for money assessment warrants it. The NDFA will assess all proposed private financing packages on a case by case basis. Where non-Exchequer funding is to be utilised and where in the NDFA's opinion the overall cost of the private financing package is excessive, taking into account risk transfer factors, the agency may  offer NDFA financing in its place. It will be a matter for the relevant State authority directly concerned with a project to decide which package to accept having reflected on NDFA advice.</p>

          <p eId="para_228">A very prominent colleague of the Minister has suggested that a metro could be funded with a PPP package at a cost of just €350 million a year for 30 years. I am not an accountant, but I can still calculate the internal rates of interest implied by that, and I calculate it at 14.5% on the cost of that system of funding. How can the Minister say that is a good approach to funding a public project that tallies with the figure of 4.3% he quoted today as the cost of money to the Government? Is there not something radically wrong when Ministers come forward with what seem to be hare-brained public finance projects that do not in any way come close to meeting the criteria the Minister has outlined to us? Is the Minister further aware that bodies like the National Roads Authority are refusing to release to Deputies the comparisons he says are being done? If Ministers and agencies are so confident that they will stand up to scrutiny, why are they not open to scrutiny by Deputies who seek that information?</p>

          <p eId="para_233">All these matters must be assessed by the Government. No decisions have been made by the Government in that regard. I am sure the Deputy can do the sums as well as anybody else. Matters such as the cost of overall finance will definitely be a consideration in any propositions put forward for consideration by the Government. I emphasise that no decision has been made on the project referred to.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">As the Deputy is aware, the development of PPP in Ireland has been patchy, to say the least. It has been my goal to have more PPP projects, and a number have come to fruition. We apply fairly strict criteria to those. One of the reasons for setting up the NDFA was to get the expertise  of all bodies regarding financing in one quarter. That has been done now under the NDFA and all State authority projects costing more than €20 million must be assessed. It will then be up to the relevant State authority to make its own decision on whether to go ahead. To give an example, in the recent past the Kilcock-Kinnegad by-pass project was announced, but the financial terms were so onerous that a number of financial institutions in the State and in the European Union turned it down. Consequently, the overall winners will have to go further afield to finance that project. In all of these matters, it is a question of striking a balance. If a PPP project is too unattractive, it will not be taken up. If it is made too generous, the State loses. It is a question of achieving a balance, and we have detailed procedures in place.</p>

          <p eId="para_235">Would the Minister not agree that the critical issue is that this should be transparent, that value for money should be clearly established and that everyone can see it is a good choice? Why are agencies which are involved in this refusing to reveal any information regarding comparisons they and the Minister claim they are making? Surely the tax-paying public deserves to see these comparisons and satisfy itself that cheap public funding is not being replaced with very expensive private funding. There is a danger that that will happen, and it has happened in other jurisdictions.</p>

          <p eId="para_254">Many European countries, led by Governments of different political persuasions, have pursued the PPP idea, although they may have given it different names. PPP projects are valuable for management, financial and other reasons. I accept Deputy Burton's point that no organisation can borrow as cheaply as the State. No bank in Ireland and no bank that may come here can borrow as cheaply as the State and that will always remain the position. Other matters have to be considered when one is pursuing certain projects. Deputy Burton will note that a reply to a later question states that the national pensions reserve fund is in credit as we speak.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">Deputy Boyle asked about EUROSTAT,  which makes decisions about what counts as general government borrowing. It does not generally give advance warnings of what will or will not be included. I have cited the example of what happened in Portugal in the recent past. Many projects were pursued by the Portuguese Government in the belief that they would not be included under the general government accounting mechanism, but EUROSTAT ruled some years later that they should be included. That continues to be the position in respect of individual projects. If the risk is to be entirely transferred as far as possible from the State – if a project is to be totally financed by charges, for example, and there is no recourse to the State – one can take it that it will remain outside the Government deficit. If the State is giving a guarantee, however, one can take it that it will be counted against the general government balance. There is something of a grey area between the two extremes.</p>

          <p eId="para_259">As I have said previously, the Government remains committed to moving forward the progressive decentralisation of Government offices and agencies. The process of reaching a decision on a major initiative such as a new programme of decentralisation involves careful consideration of a wide range of important issues. Among the considerations are the many submissions received by my Department on behalf of towns around the country, the concerns of departmental management, which wishes to maintain effective and efficient delivery of services, and staff concerns about their futures. The Government must also take account of the national spatial strategy. The deliberative process is ongoing. Given the wide range of considerations and the complexity of such a major initiative, I consider it appropriate for the Government to take its time over its deliberations before reaching a final decision on the matter. The Deputies will appreciate that until that final decision is reached, I am not in a position to say when the programme of decentralisation will commence or how long it will take to implement.</p>

Is it not true that he indicated that he would have a radical decentralisation programme in place by the end of 2000? The Minister is now saying, three years later, that he needs to consult more people before he takes a decision. When does he believe that a decision will be taken? When will enough consultation and consideration have been completed to allow us to see exactly what the Minister proposes? He seemed quite happy to make decisions in the absence of a spatial strategy for a long time. People are becoming exhausted as a result of the Minister's dithering on this issue.

It is not in my nature to delay things for too long, but a wide variety of considerations must be taken into account. Those involved in this process include every politician in this House and many people outside it. We have received over 120 applications from various towns and centres of population throughout the country. A day does not go by during which we do not receive further representations. I am reminded of decentralisation in every part of the country that I visit. It is a matter of considerable interest to Deputies on all sides of the House, including my colleagues in Government.

We have heard the answer the Minister gave today in this Chamber on four or five occasions and we know it off by heart. The Minister is probably aware that many industrial jobs have been lost so far this year in towns such as Kells. The requests for the benefits of the proposed decentralisation programme, being made on behalf of many towns, have an added poignancy in the cases of towns that have suffered many job losses. Is the Government saving the announcement as a sweetener to be used in advance of the European and local elections, or will the announcement be made after the elections?</p>

        </question>
        <speech by="#CharlieMcCreevy" eId="spk_169">
          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_279">I propose to take Questions Nos. 145 and 214 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">In the Sustaining Progress agreement the phasing of the benchmarking increases is set out as follows: 25% with effect from 1 December, 2001; 50% of the increases from 1 January 2004; and 25% of the increases from 1 June 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">However, payment of these increases, with the exception of the 25% from 1 December 2001 and the general round increases, is dependent on meeting the conditions set out in the agreement. These are the absence of industrial action and the achievement of the objectives of the modernisation agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">The commitments to co-operation with change and modernisation in Sustaining Progress are more extensive and more specific than in the past. Strong verification arrangements have been put in place, in particular with a greater independent representation. Emphasis is placed on industrial peace in the public service. This is because industrial action harms delivery of public services and affects taxpayers. We have seen in the past how industrial action in the health and education sectors resulted in the disruption of public services in hospitals and schools. Maintaining industrial peace is also a very tangible and transparent target.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">The modernisation agenda for the public service is set out in the agreement. There are some specific targets for the main sectors – health, Civil Service, education and local authorities. These include changes in the education sector to standardise the school year, parent-teacher meetings taking place outside school hours, initially on a half-in half-out basis, and other changes relating to examinations. In the Civil Service there will be a widening of the access to jobs at all levels and a new Civil Service Regulation Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">These are just some of the changes. However, in addition to these specific targets there is a gen eral commitment by the unions to co-operation with ongoing change. This should allow for continued developments either through technology or otherwise to improve services.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">I have said that the Government will pay the increases on the basis of the conditions set down in the agreement. We are determined that all of the public service commitments agreed in Sustaining Progress must be delivered by those to whom they apply. There can be no rolling back on any of these commitments and there will be no renegotiation of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">The agreement sets out the process to be followed for verification of achievement of the conditions necessary for payments to be made under the agreement. If any grades, sectors or organisations fail to agree on specific actions to achieve the commitments or, having so agreed, fail to deliver on them, they should not expect the verification process to decide that pay increases are warranted.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">I am confident that over the period of Sustaining Progress the quality of public services will improve and there will be a period of stable industrial relations with no disruptions to the public service such as we have had in, for example, the health and education sectors in the recent past. If this happens then the public will get good value for money from the public service pay increases, not just in the short term but also continuing into the future. However, if the agreement is not adhered to then, quite simply, the money will not be paid.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_170">
          <from>Mr. R. Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_288">Is the Minister aware that the original benchmarking agreement was based on the fundamental principle that co-operation with change and modernisation would not be the basis for an increase in pay under benchmarking? Rather, the 75% of benchmarking was to be based on proof that there were real outputs being delivered in value for money to people receiving services.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">Am I not right in saying that all the things the Minister has listed are no more than co-operation with change, for which no pay should be given? Is it not the case that every general pay round had an industrial peace clause and we do not have to pay for them twice? Is it not the case that the arrangement for parent-teacher meetings, to which the Minister referred, was a commitment made in the PCW, not one but two pay agreements ago? Surely the Minister cannot ask the taxpayer to pay a second time for these increases. Is it not the case that if we are to secure benchmarking we must have a reform package that delivers value? What monetary value does the Minister see coming from the changes he says will occur? How will they improve services?</p>

          <p eId="para_290">The Deputy is correct. In previous agreements there were references to industrial peace. Never in any agreement in which I have been involved has change and modernis ation been so specifically laid down as in this agreement. Performance verification groups have been set up, the Secretaries General of the relevant Departments must sign off before the payments can be made and if the changes are not forthcoming the money will not be paid.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_299">I remind the House of the words of the Taoiseach on 28 May 1998, when he said, "What matters most is how a political party reacts to knowledge when it becomes available." These are the words of the Taoiseach in a debate on matters relevant to the former Minister, Mr. Raphael Burke. These are the standards set down by the Taoiseach as head of his party and as Head of Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">The Taoiseach has openly admitted that, several months ago, he had information to the effect that Deputy Michael Collins, a member of his party, had serious difficulties with the Revenue Commissioners regarding compliance with tax regulations. What did the Taoiseach do? Did he report this to the public watchdog, the Ethics in Public Office Commission? No. Did he call in Deputy Collins and ask him about the extent of his liabilities or otherwise? No. Did he ask his party to investigate the difficulties Deputy Collins was having? No. He did nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">The Taoiseach has fallen below the standards he set himself. He pronounced in this House that what is most important is the way a political party reacts when information is brought to its attention. Why did he do nothing in respect of Deputy Collins and his problems? Why did he not call him in and ask him about the extent of his liabilities? Why did he not ask his party to investigate the Deputy several months ago and why did he not report this information to the public watchdog, the Standards in Public Office Commission? Will he explain that to the House and to the thousands of compliant taxpayers who are absolutely appalled by this continuing litany of abuse of privilege and by the activities, in some cases, of Members of this House?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_179">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_302">I reiterate what I have said many times across the floor of the House, to be absolutely clear, that the Government and the parties in Government do not and will not tolerate tax evasion in any form. That is why the Government, particularly the Minister for Finance, has given powers to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to investigate and catch tax cheats. We have done more in this area than any other Government in the history of the State and we will continue to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">I believe that those who seek election and those who want to be legislators in this House have a particular responsibility to ensure that their tax affairs are in order. This is why the Government introduced a specific requirement under the standards in public office legislation for elected representatives to make a statutory declaration within one month of their election confirming that they are tax-compliant and to obtain, within nine months of their election, a tax clearance certificate from the Collector General stating they are in compliance with their tax obligations. These are the orders of the legislation and everybody in the House is duly bound to live by them. It is clearly inherent in the legislation that its effective implementation requires individual Members of the House to take personal responsibility to ensure that they fulfil their obligations. However, we also gave the Standards in Public Office Commission power to investigate any potential breach of the legislation. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in Government have introduced more stringent regulations pertaining to standards in public life than any other Administration.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_305">Deputy Collins approached me in the second half of June. He informed me that he had personally sorted out a tax issue with the Revenue Commissioners, that his name would be published shortly in its report and that when this was published he would make a public statement and make himself available to the authorities dealing with the matter. He understood that because the Fianna Fáil Party had a ruling on tax  certificates, it could create problems and that he would have to make his position clear. He also knew the Fianna Fáil ruling, Article A4 of the mandatory code for public officeholders and candidates, which stipulates that where any investigation, inquiry or trial is being undertaken by any court, tribunal or statutory body which concerns the issue or the officeholder who is the subject matter of an investigation by the Standards in Public Life Committee in the interests of natural justice it may postpone, suspend or adjourn its own investigation pending the outcome of that other inquiry. Deputy Collins knew quite clearly that when the Office of the Revenue Commissioners published his name – he had be been informed of this matter either by his accountants or solicitors – he would have to deal with the Fianna Fáil position. To the best of my knowledge – maybe he told me or I told him – it emerged in our conversation that he was aware that he was also in breach of the guidelines of the Standards in Public Office Commission and would also have to deal with that body.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">By way of due process I set up the commission and we passed the Bill. I worked hard to set up the commission and to give powers to the Revenue Commissioners on the basis of natural justice and due process. When a Member tells me in confidence that his name is in the Revenue domain, it is not for me to ring Revenue, which would not give me the details, nor is it for me to circulate this information in the public domain. In this case, Deputy Collins was absolutely clear his name would enter the public domain and that he would have to deal with the issues both in the party context and with the Standards in Public Office Commission. I hope and know from his public statement that he will do so.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_307">The Taoiseach's reply amounts to cowardice dressed up as ethics. What is involved is not Deputy Collins but the Taoiseach's leadership. I refer him again to his own standard and his statement that what matters most is how a political party reacts to knowledge when it becomes available. The Taoiseach was given such knowledge by Deputy Collins and he failed to act. In the same debate, he said:</p>
          <p eId="para_308">Where controversy or legitimate public concern arises or facts that have not hitherto been known come to light, they must be fully disclosed to the appropriate authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">What did the Taoiseach do about that? Nothing. Did he ask Deputy Collins to go to the proper authorities? No. Did he ask the Fianna Fáil Party to investigate this? No. Did he ask Deputy Collins what his problems were? No. The issue is not about Deputy Collins but about the Taoiseach and his leadership. It highlights the cynicism that exists among thousands of compliant taxpayers who see this as part of a continuous litany of such issues that have been evident for the past ten years. The country is mired in tri bunal after tribunal and inquiry after inquiry, thanks mainly but not exclusively to members of the Fianna Fáil Party. Will the Taoiseach explain to those compliant taxpayers what he, as Taoiseach, did when this knowledge became available to him last June and what he is doing now. This is appalling leadership and disgusting government and it does the Taoiseach, as leader of his party, no justice to have to admit in the House that he did nothing in respect of the standards he set down in the House in 1998. He has fallen short of his own standard and let down hundreds of thousands of people who pay their way day in and day out and have to put up with another failure of the Government to manage the affairs of the nation properly.</p>

          <p eId="para_314">The fact is that Deputy Collins informed me he had been informed, either by his accountants or solicitors, that he was to be named in a Revenue report which created a problem for him in respect of a matter which he said had been resolved. He was quite aware, as was I, that this created a difficulty for him. It may or may not be a very serious one. It was not for me to investigate the facts. I am not in, nor will I get into, the business of breaching due process and natural justice. Thankfully the Office of the Revenue Commissioners is the statutory agency to make reports on people who have either offshore accounts, bogus accounts or whatever else a Deputy may be guilty of.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">When this matter was coming into the public domain, there was no secrecy and for Deputy Kenny to infer otherwise is incorrect. It was quite clear that the matter would be investigated, on the publication of the report, by Deputy Collins's party – he was well aware of this – and, more importantly, by the Standards in Public Office Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">We set up the commission statutorily to deal with these issues and therefore it is not my job to do so. When a Member tells me he has a difficulty, my job, as far as I am and will be concerned, is to highlight to him that he must deal with this through the commission. I will not check the Isle of Man or wherever else people have offshore accounts. I informed the Deputy that he should comply with the law of the land and in this case he agreed to do so. Deputy Collins believed the Revenue report, about which he was told,  would be published in a matter of days. It was not; it took a matter of weeks. I look forward to his coming before the Standards in Public Office Commission or dealing with the matter in whatever way it indicates, in accordance with the legislation, and to his explaining the matter to my political party.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_317">I have raised with the Taoiseach many times in the House, including on four consecutive days last February, the question of the deal entered into with religious congregations. I made a number of points about the deficiency in the deal, but I made two points in particular. I said the Government grossly underestimated the liability and exposure of the taxpayer, which could amount to a total of €1 billion, and I pointed out that the Attorney General was not involved in the deed of indemnity</p>
          <p eId="para_318">After the Taoiseach denied my charges, defended the deal and misled the House as to the number of complainants, the Comptroller and Auditor General decided to undertake his own assessment, published today. In it he concludes that the total exposure of the State will be between €869 million and €1.04 billion and points out that, at the time, the Attorney General was excluded from involvement in the critical negotiations. Initially, the then Minister, Deputy Woods, had him excluded and refused even to reply to his letters. Later, at the critical time, he was campaigning in the general election, ironically seeking to prevent the Taoiseach from spending €1,000 million building on a football stadium at a time when a deal for €1,000 million was being concluded in his office when he was not present.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">The report published today by a constitutional officer, the Comptroller and Auditor General, is the most serious indictment ever to come before the House of a scandalously reckless, negligent and profligate deal entered into in the name of Irish taxpayers by a Government, the facts surrounding which the Taoiseach attempted to cover up, deny, refute and then defend in this House. The findings of this report are far more serious than anything ever concluded on behalf of the State by the Taoiseach's mentor, the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, who has been the subject of much odium in the House. Any Government that concluded a deal like this does not deserve to be in the charge of the affairs of the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_320">I have previously said many things about this agreement. I disagree with Deputy Rabbitte that I misled the House. It will take at least two years before an assessment of how many people will be included under the terms of the agreement can be known and the figures I have previously indicated continue to be the figures indicated by the various Departments and the Attorney General.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">Deputy Rabbitte and I will never agree on the indemnity agreement but we can at least listen to  each other's points of view. I will at all times listen to his. The Government was committed to giving redress by way of compensation to victims of abuse and we intend to do so. The redress board was established for this purpose. If we had not agreed to compensate victims of abuse through this mechanism, then each and every court case brought to the High Court – at that stage there were approximately 2,000 cases – would have had to be fought in the court. It would have been necessary to bring a claim for financial contribution in respect of each case against the religious orders, which would have taken years. The compensation payments would have been delayed in thousands of court sittings. There would also have been debates about limitation periods and the responsibility of religious orders for abusers, which would have been a nightmare scenario for the victims. Given that she could not get the legal people involved, Ms Justice Laffoy was seeking to introduce a redress system and there was pressure on the Government to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">There is a commonly held belief, fostered by those who wish to confuse, that somehow the State was unwise to enter an indemnity agreement. I accept that Deputy Rabbitte continues to make that point.</p>

          <p eId="para_324">A number of facts demonstrate that this argument is without foundation. Indeed, in the view of this and the previous Government, concluding an agreement with the religious orders was in the best interest of the State. I remind the House that when the issue of responsibility between the state and the institutions was raised in the Canadian courts, according to a court decision the allocation of blame was 70% to the state and 30% to the religious orders. It is important in showing that the State had a major responsibility for what went on in these institutions. As I have said continually, and it is why I apologised, we abandoned the children of another generation in these institutions and failed miserably to ensure their interests were protected.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_326">It seems that everyone agrees with that proposition, as Deputy Rabbitte has said. However, the logical conclusion that arises from this is that the State has to bear a significant proportion of the responsibility towards victims, and that is our view. In entering into the indemnity agreement, the State was conscious of the fact that victims could lose cases brought against religious orders, which would have been an appalling scenario. To arrange for the religious orders to make payments to the State, totalling €127 million, was in our view a sensible way to proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">As I have done so before, I can set out the reasons we believe many of these people would lose their cases. There are several problems in this area, one of which I wish to highlight. Under our law, where a victim obtains a judgment under civil liability legislation for a monetary sum, the total amount of the judgment would have to be paid by the State. It is a fundamental principle of our code that those who committed wrongs are liable for all of the injury or loss, even though they bear different degrees of responsibility. This means that even if one is only 1% responsible in law – the State's responsibility was certainly far higher than that – all of the damages must be paid, with recovery to be sought from other wrongdoers. The State would have ended up paying the money in any event.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">I do not know what will be the final figure. Our view continues to be that it will not be anything like what the eminent Comptroller and Auditor General has said. We still believe it will be far smaller. However, we continue to faithfully hold the view that we would not have been able to deal with this issue if we did not establish a redress board and if we did not properly agree a compensation indemnity claim. We could have ended up with the worst of all scenarios, where the individuals would have received no money. That was our legal opinion then and now, and it remains the Government's view.</p>

          <p eId="para_329">It is disgraceful for the Taoiseach and his office to dismiss in this House the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General as if it were an unfounded charge. Why did the Department of Finance recommend a 50-50 arrangement and why did the Government initially pursue that strategy if the Taoiseach considers it to be an unfair apportionment? Any Taoiseach who would say that a contribution of €127 million by the religious orders is a sensible way forward in a deal that the Comptroller and Auditor General estimates could cost of the order of €1 billion does not deserve to be in the Taoiseach's position. How could he have entered into such a deal in circumstances where, according I understand to page 85 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, the Department of Education and Science said it was not legally competent to permit its Minister to sign the indemnity without the involvement of the Attorney General, while yet proceeding to sign off on it? When the deal went to the Cabinet on the last day of the previous Government's term of office, the Department knew it was inadequate. On 29 June 2001, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, had written to say he was disappointed with the contribution from the religious congregations based on the then assessment of €200 million to €400 million. If it was disappointing in that context, it is certainly disappointing in the context of €800 million to €1,000 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">There is no explanation for this. The Attorney General was not at his desk. When he was, he was excluded by a decision by the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, who attended the two critical meetings at which the deal was entered into. The then Minister has never told us why that happened. All the Taoiseach's Cabinet colleagues were involved, including the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Who would have thought we have come to the stage where the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will not even come into the House? He was up lamp posts when this major deal was being concluded and was nowhere in sight. On the last day he said it was a deficient deal and that it contained no mechanism to deal with the rising number of complainants, yet the Taoiseach signed off on it anyway. The Taoiseach sent out "Woodsie" to agree a secret indemnity that was never debated in this House, he signed off on it and hoped it would never come back to haunt him, but it has done so.</p>

This is being increasingly revealed in the disagreements between high level members of Fianna Fáil, the most recent example being the Leader of the Seanad disagreeing with the Minister for Transport. The Minister informed us of the length of time it takes to bring a public transport project to fruition while the Leader of the Seanad informed us that it is the Minister's fault that we do not have a resolution to the problem.</p>

He will be aware that the Government decided to proceed with a metro system for Dublin 20 months ago. He will also be aware that, a year ago, the Rail Procurement Agency presented a business case proposal for the metro to the Minister for Transport for a final Government decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">We have seen repeated changes to the story in the newspapers. The <i>Sunday Tribune </i>of 5 January last stated that the Minister was planning to present to Cabinet within weeks a proposal for a €2 billion metro line which would be in place before he left office. The <i>Irish Independent</i> of 13 February last informed us that the price had increased to €3 billion but that the proposal would still come before the Cabinet before the end of the month. By the end of the month, <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> stated it had been reliably informed that the Minister now had a price tag of €4 billion and that the proposal would come before the Cabinet within five weeks with construction to commence in late 2004. In March, the price had increased to €4.8 billion, at which point the Minister for Finance said the proposal was unrealistic.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">Will the Taoiseach inform the House whether, following the Minister's escapade in Madrid and a revision of the price to €3.4 billion, this issue will finally be decided on by the Government at tomorrow's Cabinet meeting or whether we must wait another ten months and endure more dithering?</p>

          <p eId="para_358">The RPA has advised that construction of the Luas system, while encountering difficulties over the summer, is progressing and it is hoped that all phases will be completed next  year. The reason there is a difference in costs and cost analysis for the metro is because they relate to different proposals and projects. It is natural that there would be different cost structures in such an event.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">The experience of planning and delivering major infrastructural projects, of which there have been many, has shown that there is scope for improved efficiencies. The Minister and his officials visited Madrid to examine what is recognised in Europe as the most efficient and cost-effective model that exists. This was examined by the Cabinet sub-committee to see if we could learn from the experience in Spain. Measures under construction include shortening and streamlining statutory powers in respect of applications for orders to construct the metro infrastructure and many other issues relating to compensation. The experience is that the rules and regulations that apply in other countries are not the same as those which apply here. That accounts for most of the price differential.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">The RPA has responsibility for the Dublin metro project. It is finalising its report based on the experience of Madrid and elsewhere and it will bring that to the Minister during October when the Government will examine the proposal. The Minister for Finance made it clear that the original cost was outside what we could afford in the capital programme, given all the other projects contained therein. It is his obligation to do that. The costs were enormous for one project, which meant we had to examine alternatives, which is what the Government is doing.</p>

          <p eId="para_446">This is the first sitting of this session and politics can be a rough business. I pay tribute to the fortitude of the Minister of State,  Deputy Hanafin, on the tragic death of her husband during the summer. This is an unbearable burden for her and I express the sympathy of the Fine Gael Party on her great loss. I also hope the Clerk of the Dáil, who was in hospital recently, will make a full recovery to good health.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">The Taoiseach made an announcement during the summer which amounted to tidings of great joy. That is how it appeared to many thousands of young couples who assumed it would be possible to have the opportunity to build their houses in rural areas. There is no legislative basis for declaring that there should be more houses in rural areas. Why is there no reference to publication of a Bill to give effect to the Taoiseach's aspiration that more houses should be provided in rural areas for the many young couples who seek them?</p>

That was the limited area I mentioned. If the guidelines are set down – local authorities are co-operating with the Minister's Department in this regard – that should be possible in this limited area.</p>

I am open to debating the taking forward of those or any other proposals. I have always held the view that we could do many things to improve the House. I agree with the Deputy on the last point he made. The work of parties is disrupted. We could do many things if there was agreement among the Whips. The basis of the document produced by Deputy Brennan, which was not only his thinking but was also based on proposals put forward by a number of the Whips, including Deputy Stagg, was that we would take these matters forward. The Government is always ready to examine them.</p>

It was proceeding, although the date for publication was changing as we went along, from early to late 2003 and then to early 2004. Now it seems to have been dropped altogether. Is it coming back, or has heritage been relegated further down the Government's agenda? Is the subtle yet perceptible change in promising that the Government expects to publish on the pink pages of the A list legislation up to the beginning of the next session – not during this session – an indication that the Dáil term really is too short and that the publication of legislation is now to take place as much during the holidays as during the Dáil session?

          <p eId="para_567">I have the distinction of being the first speaker on the resumption of legislative business in this House following the three month recess of this Dáil or the three month interruption in the legislative work of the House. Incidentally, the Opposition, including the Labour Party, the press and the public did not want those three months recess. They were wanted only by the  Taoiseach and the Government. The rationale given to us for such a long recess is that it enables the Government, Ministers and Ministers of State, to get behind their desks to deal with the issues in their portfolios without the interruption or the inconvenience, as they see it, of having to come before the House on a regular weekly basis to account for themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">With three months free from having to attend the Dáil, one would have expected that the issue of housing, which is so big a concern for many people in this country, would have been high on the order of priorities of the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, who is present, and his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Looking back over the three months I wonder if the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, and the Minister fell asleep at their desks. Certainly, they have done nothing to address the housing problems of this country over those three months. Not a single new initiative has been taken by the Government to deal with any aspect of the housing problems in that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">I looked over the website of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and saw that 78 statements were issued by the Minister's office during the Dáil recess. Only eight of those related in any way to housing matters and these were only routine announcements of funding for individual housing projects or provided information as to where the Minister might be photographed when he went to view the demolition of Fatima Mansions. There was not a single word in any of those statements regarding any aspect of the real housing problems that exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">It is not that the Government was not reminded that there is a housing problem because during the recess there were a number of reports highlighting the continuance of house price inflation. House prices last year rose at a rate of between 15% and 16%, about four times the rate of inflation. There was a good documentary film on homelessness, prepared and presented by the Simon community. Despite those reminders we still have no action from the Government on any aspect of housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">It is time to remind the Government that in the six years it has been in office house prices in Dublin have risen by 206%, nine times the rate of inflation, five times the rate of increase in average earnings and four times the rate of increase in the cost of building, but still there has been no action from Government. There are twice the number of families on local authority waiting lists, some of them now waiting for over ten years for housing, and still there is little or no action. This year we saw a cut in the budget. The Government's lack of urgency and concern about the housing problems faced by the people is the reason the Bill is three years late. This Bill, which is to implement the recommendations contained in the report of the Commission on the Private Rented  Sector, was recommended in July 2000. The Bill was not published until May of this year and we are only now resuming Second Stage as we come into October. It will be well into 2004 by the time the Bill progresses through committee, goes through the Seanad and is passed.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">It is difficult to imagine any other sector of Irish society whose needs would be treated in a less urgent manner by the Government. Threshold estimates that there are 150,000 tenancies in the country. At the time of the report of the commission it was 135,000. I think the Threshold estimate may be conservative. Threshold estimates that these 150,000 tenancies make up about 12% of all the housing tenure in the country. If the distribution of the population among those who are renting privately is the same as among the rest of the population, between 400,000 and 500,000 people in the country live in private rented accommodation. These people enjoy little or no legal protection. The one item of legislation which was to provide protection has been three years coming and the Government is dealing with it with a marked lack of urgency. If, for example, workers did not have basic legal protection, I could not see the Government treating the equivalent of the entire membership of SIPTU in this way. I could not see it treating the equivalent of twice the population of Cork city in this lethargic way.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">Unfortunately this Bill has come too late for many tenants who over recent years have been evicted from their accommodation or who have seen their rent increase dramatically. At a Labour Party conference about 18 months ago I made the rhetorical charge that in the six year lifetime of the present Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government more Irish families lost their homes through eviction than in any equivalent period under the British in the 19th century. I was surprised, particularly when I repeated the charge on a number of occasions since, that it was never refuted by any member of Government. Neither was it ever contradicted by a historian. The more I repeat it and the more often it is not refuted, the more convinced I am that it cannot be refuted. I do not have empirical evidence for the charge but I am aware of many cases, as I am sure many Members are, of people who lost their homes through eviction over the past four or five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">One example I can think of is the case of an elderly former employee of <i>The Irish Press</i> who was evicted after 19 years and 11 months. Presumably, this was so that he could not accumulate tenancy rights. Another case was the dressmaker in her 50s who was 13 years in the same accommodation and who had built up a dressmaking business in the locality. She never believed that she would have to face the indignity not only of losing her home but of becoming a homeless person living in temporary accommodation until eventually allocated a home by a local authority. I met a woman this week who has lived in private rented accommodation for all her adult life and  is being evicted for the second time in three years. A working couple with two children in my constituency were recently featured in a “Prime Time” programme on housing and are now facing eviction. The reality is that many people have lost and continue to lose their homes through eviction. If this Bill or some variation of it had it been in place when it should have, it would have provided these people with some protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">Not only is the Bill late, but it has a huge gaping loophole. When the Bill was published, I was astonished to read that the commencement date for its provisions are to be decided at some stage after it is enacted when the Minister gets around to writing a regulation to commence them. I would have though that, at a minimum, the Bill would have stipulated that the basic rights which are provided would take effect from its date of publication.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">Since the publication of the Bill on 28 May, any unscrupulous landlord who wants to literally get his or her house in order has almost a year to do so between the publication of the Bill and its enactment. Anecdotal evidence is coming through to the Labour Party of unscrupulous landlords de-tenanting in order to avoid the provisions of the Bill. They are increasing rents because they know when the Bill becomes operative, rent increases will only be on an annualised basis and that, until then, the tenant has no recourse to the private rented tenancies board in order to have his or her case examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">At a minimum, an operative date for the provisions of this Bill must be set and I urge the Minister of State to use the opportunity at the conclusion of Second Stage to introduce an appropriate amendment to that effect. Such a provision would have the support of the Labour Party.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">As I said earlier, this Bill is to give effect to the recommendations which were contained in the report of the commission on the private rented sector. The Labour Party will support the Bill and welcomes that it will provide a minimal level of protection to tenants. However, it must be acknowledged that the conclusions of the commission on the private rented sector were themselves a compromise between the various interests which were represented. I wish to pay tribute to the excellent work of the chairman and members of that commission because they put together the framework upon which this legislation is based.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">There are a number of aspects of the Bill which require attention and the Labour Party will table a number of amendments on Committee Stage to deal with its weaknesses. There are a number of types of tenancies which are exempted from the provisions of the Bill. For example, a building which is partly used for business purposes is exempted. That seems to exempt a considerable number of tenants who occupy buildings, part of which are used for a business purpose. Dwellings let by public authorities are also exempt. I can understand why dwellings let by local authorities,  and which come under the Housing Act in the normal way, are exempt. However, dwellings which are let by other public authorities, of which there are many examples such as State companies and agencies, are essentially let as if they were private tenancies and they need to be brought within the scope of the Bill since they are not part of the Housing Act as I understand it.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">We also need to examine the exemption for tenancies which are employment related and which are, in many cases, provided on a long-term basis by public authorities. The Bill also exempts dwellings in which the landlord also resides, of which there are many cases. It is unreasonable to deprive tenants of rights purely on the basis that the landlord lives on the property.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">We need to look at the exemptions in regard to the grounds for termination of tenancy. One provision allows for a termination on the grounds that the number of bed spaces is too few for the number of people requiring them. This will affect families with new born babies, given that the number of bed spaces becomes fewer than required by the family and they could be exposed to termination of tenancy. There are areas of exemption which need to be looked at on Committee Stage and I will table appropriate amendments to that effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">One of the main provisions of the Bill relates to security of tenure. The formula used is a six month probationary period of tenancy, following which a tenant may become eligible for a four year tenancy. There are problems with this, particularly with any succeeding four year tenancies. For example, when a tenant comes to the end of the four year tenancy and becomes eligible for a second four year tenancy, he or she is effectively required to revert to a probationary period. That is unfair and a way can and should be found in order that when a tenant reaches the end of the four year period, he or she does not effectively lose all of his or her entitlements and revert to the status of a probationary tenant.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">The length of the probationary period is also a problem. I do not see the necessity for a six month probationary period. Threshold has recommended a period of three months and this issue should be looked at on Committee Stage. Within the probationary period, there is a danger that tenants would be exposed to having no rights at all and that a landlord could, for reasons other than the good management of the property, decide to act unfairly against that tenant if, for instance, he or she raised questions about his or her rights or entitlements. We need to insert some minimal rights into the probationary period in order that tenants may be protected against being treated unfairly by a landlord.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">I am not a great fan of the idea of fixed term tenancies and I can see difficulties arising with them and the formula by which they are dealt with in the Bill. There is, for example, a possibility of tenancies of five weeks or three months duration so that tenants do not acquire the right to a four year tenancy. As a tenancy comes to  the end of the four year period, there is a danger that it will be terminated after four years rather than allow succeeding rights to build up. Therefore, it would have been preferable if the model used here was analogous to the type of arrangements that exist, for example, in employment law whereby once the probationary period has expired it is assumed that if employment is available the employee has the first call on it. Similarly, there should be a formula whereby once the probationary tenancy has expired, and as long as the property is available for letting, the tenant should have the right to continuing tenancy.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">Issues relating to termination of tenancy are provided for in the Bill which, by and large, are reasonable. Given that the circumstances whereby a landlord would be entitled to seek recovery of the property and issues relating to, for example, the setting and adjustment of rent are provided for in the Bill, I do not understand why the idea of a continuing tenancy could not have been addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">The second major issue relates to rents. The Bill provides essentially for a formula whereby the initial rent will be set by reference to the market and thereafter rent increases will be limited to annual increases and the Private Residential Tenancies Board will be able to adjudicate on the level of rent increase. By and large, this is a reasonable formula for dealing with rent. However, it is inconsistent with the current regulations in relation to rent allowances operated by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and administered through the health boards. Under the legislation the rent for a property will be set by the market but the regulations introduced by the Minister's colleague puts a cap on the amount of the allowance that may be paid. The Government cannot have it both ways. It cannot, on the one hand, have a legal framework for the determination of rents which is market based and, on the other, have an arrangement for the setting of rent allowances which is determined by ministerial diktat.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">There is an absurd situation currently in relation to rent allowances. A tenant does not qualify for a rent allowance if the rent exceeds the maximum set through the health boards. There are anecdotal stories, at least, that arrangements are being made whereby one rent is declared to the health board for the purpose of the rent allowance but private arrangements are being entered into between tenants and landlords which are in excess of that. This issue can be approached in either of two ways. Either there is an arrangement whereby the rent, as well as the rent allowance, is determined by the Minister – I am not sure that is the best way to go – or, alternatively, there is an arrangement whereby the rent allowances are related to the market rent, which is provided for in the legislation. If tenants are required to have their rents set by the market then the rent allowance regime should conform to this.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">While on the subject of rent allowances, I might as well make the case for reforming the whole rent allowance regime. It is absolutely absurd that if one goes into full-time employment, very often a low paid job, one loses one's rent allowances. It is time the Government considered introducing a housing benefit which would be neutral on the question of whether one was in employment and related to the income of the tenant and their housing need. This is a matter to which we might usefully return.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">The Private Residential Tenancies Board has been given considerable responsibilities and powers under the legislation, which I welcome. It is long overdue that we had a housing court or private rented tenancies board which is able to determine disputes between landlords and tenants. I agree, by and large, with the approach being taken for the setting up of a mediation service, the appointment of adjudicators and the provisions for appeal to a tribunal. My worry, however, is that given the remit the board has been given, including the remit for the new arrangements for the registration of tenancies, it will be able to carry out its duties given the resources being provided for it. The explanatory memorandum states that staffing for the board is likely to be in the order of 20 people and the annual budget €2.5 million. Given that there are 150,000 tenancies in the State, with the number increasing, the obligations being placed on the board to register these tenancies and the issues which may now be referred to the board for mediation or adjudication, ranging from the standard of accommodation, rent, disputes about tenure and so on, I cannot see a staff complement of 20 being capable of dealing with this.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">I am concerned that we would put in place a legislative framework governing the relationship between landlords and tenants, and the Private Residential Tenancies Board which exists to deal with it, and that we would reach a point where people are referring their cases to the board and they are not being dealt with expeditiously. There are a number of examples of where this has happened in the past. It happened, for example, in the industrial relations area when the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court at different times were under-resourced and disputes which should have been dealt with quickly ended up taking months to go through the system. It has happened in the Garda complaints area whereby a complaint may be submitted but God knows when it will be dealt with. It has happened, for example, in the planning area where appeals to An Bord Pleanála have taken a considerable length of time because of a lack of resources and insufficient staff to deal with them. If this legislation is to work it must be resourced.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">The board has been given responsibility for the registration of tenancies. We come to the issue of registration with some experience because, unfortunately, the 1996 regulations which required tenancies to be registered with local authorities have  not been enforced. There is evidence that approximately 20% of private tenancies were registered with local authorities. Local authorities, particularly those showing great enthusiasm of late for the collection of outstanding charges of another kind, owe the public an explanation as to why they failed to pursue the registration and collection of registration fees due to them for the registration of tenancies.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">I refer to an example of the "Nanny State", about which we have heard a great deal in recent times, finding its way into this legislation. Section 16 places obligations on tenants, a number of which are reasonable. However, under section 16(<i>m</i>) the tenant is required to notify the landlord of the identity of each person, other than a multiple tenant with whom the individual is sharing the flat or house, “residing for the time being in the dwelling.”  I can see where this will lead. I have heard of people putting notches on their bed posts but, if they are required to write down the names of everybody who has been invited in for coffee and supply it to the landlord with the rent, it will be “Nanny State-ism” that puts smoking bans and no children in pubs after 8 p.m. in the ha'penny place. I do not know how that provision was inserted in the legislation or what is its purpose. I will be interested to hear on Committee Stage what was on the Minister of State's mind when he inserted this provision. The Bill is intended to provide for the legal protection of tenants but it will have a devastating effect on the social life of the country if the provision remains in that form. The Labour Party will support the Bill on Second Stage but will seek a number of amendments on Committee Stage.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DennisODonovan" eId="spk_411">
          <from>Mr. O'Donovan</from>
          <p eId="para_593">Today is similar to the first day back at school and, like Deputy Gilmore, it is nice to speak on the first day. He mentioned the long summer recess but both Deputy McCormack, who is present, and I worked long and tedious hours during July on the Joint Committee on the Constitution dealing with the property rights issue. The summer was extremely swift, but that comes with the terrain. The public is at times under the impression that once the Dáil goes into recess in early July, we all put our feet up or go fishing, hill walking and golfing. Unfortunately, that was not the case for me. I enjoyed August because the weather was excellent. However, a great deal of committee work was done in July and September.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">I welcome this important legislation, which could and should have been introduced 20 years ago, as Deputy Gilmore said. One could slate the current Government parties for being inactive over the past six years but the protection of tenants' rights has been on the agenda for more than 20 years and various Administrations comprising different parties have been in power in the meantime.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">Deputy Gilmore mentioned the exemption for employment-related lettings, which is important. My father-in-law was a maintenance foreman at  Bantry hospital and lived for 23 years in a house adjacent to the hospital. When he died suddenly, his wife and children were given six months to leave the house. That was a harsh measure as they were expected to walk away from their home of 23 years, a hospital lodge, in difficult circumstances. Perhaps the Minister of State will re-examine this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">The thrust of the legislation is to protect tenants' rights and it is not before time. The general trend of legislation introduced since the foundation of the State, particularly Bills enacted in 1931 and 1967, was to protect the landlord rather than the tenant. That continued until the 1970s when a new school of thought emerged. Tenants realised they did not have security of tenure, particularly in the private rented sector, and set up various organisations such as Threshold. The Bill addresses problems that have pertained for many years in a fair way.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">Part 3 covers rent reviews. Rents have increased annually for the past ten years. In what circumstances would tenancies be renewed with lower rents? Would that happen because of the poor state of the accommodation or lack of repairs by the landlord or market trends? Housing demand has exceeded supply in recent years. Deputy Gilmore pointed out the housing shortage is a major problem. The committee I chair is examining this issue in depth and we conducted extensive hearings and consultations. It is expected that approximately 60,000 houses will be built this year, a phenomenal number. Construction industry representatives who appeared before the committee stated the industry was at breaking point and could not deliver more houses than that annually. Great Britain has a population of 60 million and almost one million housing units would have to be built to compare with the construction rate in Ireland. However, only 200,000 units are built there annually. The US would have to build two million units per annum to meet Ireland's rate of construction on a <i>per capita </i>basis. Despite record construction of houses, problems persist but Ireland is doing remarkably well in comparison to the US and Great Britain.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">The Bill provides that rent reviews should be conducted on an annual basis. Given my experience as a solicitor, frequent reviews are difficult to manage. Reviews should take place not less than every two years and not more than every four years unless the date of the review is set in stone and the rent is index linked. Most tenancies do not involve a written agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">Part 4 deals with security of tenure. I am intrigued by the four year cycle, which is an interesting and novel concept. What we had in the past was totally inadequate as far as tenants were concerned. To give credit to the Minister, this is the first time in the past 20 years that a Government has grasped the nettle by introducing the Residential Tenancies Bill 2003, which will give security of tenure and protect tenants rather than landlords.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">A number of questions occurred to me when studying the Bill. Why should a landlord be unilaterally entitled to terminate a tenancy within the first six months of a four-year cycle? This seems very harsh. Further study of the Bill reveals that the notice of termination must in all instances be served, but it is not necessary to give a reason during the first six months. That seems to favour the landlord. Perhaps there is another explanation that has not occurred to me. Otherwise, if a termination notice is served a reason must be given. The landlord must prove that renovations of some magnitude are to be carried out to the house or that he or she needs the house for a relative or friend.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">Would the fact that a house is structurally unsound be sufficient cause for a landlord to ask a tenant to leave? I came across an interesting case in the commercial sector which ended up in court regarding a building that was falling down around the tenant and, having been reported to the Health and Safety Authority, was found to be unsafe. The tenant was asked to leave despite the fact that he was claiming a business equity tenancy. Would the private sector be subject to similar regulation and would the fact that a building was structurally unsound or unsafe be sufficient reason for the landlord to terminate a tenancy?</p>
          <p eId="para_602">The previous speaker, Deputy Gilmore, mentioned long tenancies. I appreciate that this legislation cannot operate retrospectively. However, I am concerned about the situation where a tenant who has had a continuous tenancy in the same property for ten, 15 or 20 years must start afresh after four years. That militates against the tenant. Deputy Gilmore mentioned cases where people had been in occupation for 19 years. He mentioned a dressmaker who had been in occupation of a premises for more than 19 years, and a former <i>Irish Press</i> worker. It is very harsh that a family or a couple who have occupied a house for ten, 15 or 20 years – and I come across them frequently enough – can find themselves with no rights whatsoever. I am not sure whether this Bill can redress that. The Minister may say the legislation cannot operate retrospectively, but the operation of a four-year cycle is of concern to me and it should be examined for the future. I understand that even at the end of the third cycle the landlord and tenant must start afresh. Tenants may have to pay the market rent, but if they have been in occupation for 12 years they should be entitled to longer notice than 16 weeks. I suggest at least six months' notice should be given.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">I have already touched briefly on the procedure of termination and how the termination notice is to be served. This Bill provides for the setting up of the Private Residential Tenancies Board, which is a very salient feature of the Bill. I presume the serving of a termination notice will be simplistic, served not by registered post but handed by the landlord to the tenant, and that there will be no problems regarding proof of service and declarations of service. I understand this Bill is intended to be user friendly for both tenant  and landlord to avoid difficulties in landlord and tenant actions in court involving the service of notices and so on. I would like clarification that what is intended is a very simplistic form of notice served in a particular way that does not require consultation with a solicitor.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">In the second three and a half years of the tenancy the notice required is graduated from four weeks up to a maximum of 16 weeks. This applies to both landlords and tenants. Should a lesser period of notice apply to tenants if they want to leave for any reason? The requirement to give 16 weeks' notice where a tenant has a genuine reason for leaving seems to favour the landlord, given that the purpose of this Bill is to protect the tenant. Perhaps there is a good reason for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">Part 5 of the Bill refers to the termination of a tenancy where a sub-tenancy has been created. My understanding is that landlord and tenant law frowns on sub-letting and that the standard letting agreement which is endorsed by the Law Society of Ireland contains an explicit agreement not to sublet. I would like clarification that sub-tenancies will be a new phenomenon and that they will be covered if a person rents a premises and after nine months, without contacting the landlord, sub-lets to a brother or sister or relative and the rent is the same and has been paid. Is that acceptable? It may well be.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">Part 6 of the Bill deals with dispute resolution. I compliment the Minister on this. This is probably the cornerstone of the Bill, for many reasons. I will touch on a few of them within the time allowed. It is a very welcome approach. Up to now all disputes concerning landlords and tenants inevitably ended up in court. If they did not end up in court the tenants, usually the least well-off in society because they cannot afford to buy housing, often had to walk away from a situation and did not get a fair deal because they had not the money to pay a solicitor or the wherewithal to go to court. More often than not, this whole area was weighted heavily against tenants. Great credit is due to the Minister for advocating the notion of the Private Residential Tenancies Board. I am sure it is not a novel approach, but it is an excellent one. It should be welcomed by every Member of the House. I am delighted that the Labour Party spokesman, Deputy Gilmore, has expressed his full support for this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">The courts were obliged for too long to deal with these matters under old legislation. I am aware, from personal experience, that District Court and Circuit Court judges were not keen to get involved as arbiters in many instances of disputes between landlords and tenants. The new board will have a number of other roles. The new dispute resolution committee represents an excellent way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">I would like to conclude by speaking about the registration of tenancies. I concur with Deputy Gilmore's views in this regard, on the basis of my experience of the system that was to be operated by the local authorities. The registration figure of  20% cited by the Deputy is absolute proof that the system did not work. I think the figure should be closer to 80% or 90% in future. A person who contacts a landlord, after seeing accommodation advertised, often encounters difficulties when he or she asks the landlord to sign a health board form. I have seen this happen in rural areas – perhaps it does not happen in Dublin. The landlord often says that he or she does not want the person as a tenant if he or she has to sign a form that may lead to his or her being brought into the tax net. Such landlords want to deal with cash customers only. This practice should be brought to an end.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">I wanted to make a few more points, but I will respect the fact that my time has almost elapsed. I welcome this important Bill. The Minister deserves great credit for its introduction. I do not doubt that it will have a major impact on the lives of thousands of tenants who are renting property. I wish the Bill a safe passage through the Houses.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PadraicMcCormack" eId="spk_412">
          <from>Mr. McCormack</from>
          <p eId="para_610">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the Residential Tenancies Bill 2003 so early in the new term. The Bill was published at the end of May following the recommendations of the Commission on the Private Rented Sector. It was right that it was published at that time, because more and more people are entering the rented sector every day. We have to lay down proper regulations to deal with this fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">The fact that 50,000 families are on the national housing waiting list is an indictment of Government policy. Sufficient funds have not been provided to local authorities to enable them to provide the necessary housing numbers in local authority areas. Many people have to avail of the private rented sector as a result. A record number of people – some 1,600 in total – are on Galway City Council's housing waiting list. These people are either homeless or are involved in the private rented sector as they wait. Those who are qualified to do so can avail of rent supplement payments to stay in the private rented sector. Clearly laid-down legislation that deals with the rights of tenants and landlords is timely at this point.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">This Bill is being introduced against a background of poor quality rented accommodation, generally speaking, in all cities and towns. A survey conducted by a Sunday newspaper in advance of the new third level college year indicates that a large percentage of student accommodation in our cities is below an acceptable standard. In some cases, student accommodation does not comply with building and other regulations, but nobody seems to care. The fact that rents are high, standards are low and enforcement by the authorities is minimal is a serious one. I do not lay the blame entirely at the feet of local authorities, as this is a matter of resources. If local authorities are not resourced to do their job, they are unable to do so. Many local authorities do not have the resources to ensure enforcement with the regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">The Minister of State is responsible for ensuring that those being exploited, many of whom are students, are not priced out of the market. They should be able to get accommodation that is in line with their needs. Academic life is stressful enough without having to tolerate substandard and inadequate accommodation. I can speak from personal knowledge in this regard, as members of my family attended third level colleges in cities other than Galway. The accommodation they availed of in such cities certainly left a lot to be desired – that is all I will say about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">The Irish Property Owners Association, which has made a submission on this matter, feels that the Government has failed to understand the needs and the operation of the private rented sector. The association believes that this lack of understanding has led to a succession of failed and harmful measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">Deputy O'Donovan and others have referred to the 1996 registration regulations, which did not work properly because they were not enforced. While conducting some research recently, I encountered some figures in the housing statistics bulletin for the March quarter of 2003. The numbers of houses registered in each of the five major cities are as follows: Cork, 1,724; Dublin, 6,609; Galway, 3,468; Limerick, 541; and Waterford, 393. Such figures represent a ridiculous return for the amount of rented accommodation that exists. It is believed that there are 150,000 tenancies, or people in rented accommodation, in the State. I would like to compare some of the figures. The figure of 3,468 for Galway is not too bad, especially when compared to the figure of 1,724 for Cork, which is ten times the size of Galway. More than twice as much property is registered in Galway as in Cork. Galway is comparable in population to Limerick and Waterford, but there are just 541 and 393 registered properties, respectively, in these cities. It is clear that somebody is not doing his or her work.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">When the registration regulations were introduced in 1996, the penalty for non-registration was a fine of £1,000. No landlord has been fined for non-registration in my local authority area and I am fairly sure that is also the case in other local authority areas. Local authorities do not have the resources to follow up the work that is involved in this area. It is clear that landlords are known to the city councils, as they can be traced for refuse charges in Galway and other cities where people pay their refuse charges. I do not know if that is the case in Dublin, as I do not know what is going on there. Given that local authorities are able to trace landlords in many cases, I cannot understand what is happening in places other than Galway, where the figures are very good. It seems that less than one tenth of rented properties are registered in accordance with the regulations which have been in place since 1996, but which have not been implemented. This matter should be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">Existing legislation, combined with measures taken as a result of the first of the three Bacon  reports, led to clearly increased rents. Mortgage interest relief was scrapped when demand for rented accommodation was at its greatest. It is regrettable that the net impact of these measures, combined with the notion that rental income is unearned income, was to drive investment out of the sector at a time of maximum need. This Bill should be viewed in light of the need for proper recognition of rights and responsibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">I reject the arguments of those who seek to downgrade or belittle landlords. Landlords have a vital part to play in the provision of rented accommodation. Without the provision of private rented accommodation we would have a housing crisis. It is easy to categorise all landlords as bad but it is wrong to do so. There are bad apples in every barrel but the majority of landlords provide a good service and get a fair return for their investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">I reject the belief that the market is the king. The right to hold and let property is accompanied by a responsibility to treat tenants with the respect they deserve and to grant them the rights to which they are entitled and which are provided for in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">A vibrant rental sector, which is attractive as a medium-term and not just as a short-term option as it is at present, is vital for the future of our economy. This legislation gives tenants the security of a four-year lease at the market rate. It obliges landlords to maintain property while tenants must repair any damage caused and refrain from anti-social behaviour. It obliges landlords to register properties legally and threatens penalties if they fail to comply. I ask the Minister to spell out how this will be done, given that the 1996 regulations are not complied with. How is it proposed to ensure the requirements of this Bill are complied with?</p>
          <p eId="para_621">The Bill gives assurances to landlords that their names will not appear on the public record. It provides for the setting up of an official private residential tenancies board to resolve disputes. With just one in five landlords currently registered, the Government must provide a significant carrot to entice them in. How does the Minister propose to do this? Section 147 provides:</p>
          <p eId="para_622">(1) The members of the Board shall be such number, not less than nine and not more than 15, as the Minister considers appropriate from time to time.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">(2) The members of the Board shall be appointed by the Minister as soon as may be after the establishment day and shall be persons who, in the Minister's opinion, have experience in a field of expertise relevant to the Board's functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">(3) Except as provided for by <i>subsection (2),</i> the members of the Board shall be appointed from time to time as occasion requires by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">(4) The Minister shall, in so far as is practicable, ensure an equitable balance between the  numbers of members of the Board who are women and the number of them who are men.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">(5) The Minister, when appointing a member shall fix such member's period of membership which shall not exceed 5 years and, subject to this section, membership shall be on such terms as the Minster may determine.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">(6) The members of the Board (including the chairperson) may be paid such remuneration as the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may determine.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">These are standard provisions regarding the appointment of boards. I hope the Minister will not fall into the trap of appointing only members and supporters of the Government parties to the board, as is the norm in appointing boards. The latest trend appears to be the appointment of defeated and former Deputies to State boards. I hope this will not be the case in the appointment of the private residential tenancies board but that its members will be appointed on the basis of their ability to serve and their knowledge of the private rented sector and the rights of tenants. My party will table amendments to the effect that a 15 member board should consist of five representing tenants' interests, five representing landlords' interests and, perhaps, five people who do not represent an interest but who have expertise in the area. If we repeat the common practice in the appointment of boards the private residential tenancies board will be a complete failure.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">The need to reform the private rented sector has long been recognised. The Bill is published against a background where the percentage of housing stock available for rent has risen from 8% to 14%. This is a 50% increase in the number of rental properties. The percentage increase is all the more notable because the total number of units has increased substantially.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">The housing situation is very different from that which existed when my party left office in 1997. Back then students could find accommodation relatively easily. They could pay for the places they found and hope, some day, to own a property of their own. Things have changed utterly because of the ever increasing cost of housing. Home ownership is an option that is being postponed. While it is still the ultimate goal of many it is often put off until later in life.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">It is only right that we frame appropriate legislation to respond to these changing times in the rented sector. In the first three months of 2003, Galway City Council paid out over €1,342,000 to hostel owners and landlords for the provision of accommodation for asylum seekers. I do not know if such tenants will be catered for in this Bill. Perhaps the Minister will comment on this matter in his reply to the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">We must not underestimate the serious situation facing those in the rented sector and those wishing to enter the housing market. It is important that we are in no doubt about the facts. This is where Government policy has failed. The  first-time buyer's grant of €3,000, which was a great help to people buying their first home, was abolished at last year's budget. A day or two later VAT on housing materials was increased from 12.5% to 13.5%, increasing the price of a typical €200,000 home by €2,000. These two measures left young people trying to buy their first home with €5,000 less in their pockets. Some of my own family were in that position. The cost of an average home is approximately 25% higher in this country than in the United States and has increased 180% since 1996. This is the reality facing young people trying to acquire their own houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">In the 12 months during which the Commission on the Private Rented Sector held its meetings 12,000 people contacted Threshold, mostly on the issue of frequent and substantial rent increases. Health boards are paying rent subsidies to 100,000 people. Tenants have poor security of tenure while landlords have felt that Government decisions and policies were brought forward on the basis of out of date and inaccurate information. No one is satisfied with the current position. I hope this Bill will improve it.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">The Bill addresses the major areas of importance in this sector. I believe it will stand the test of time when it has been fine tuned. The inconsistencies in the Bill must be ironed out on Committee Stage before it passes through the House. The make-up of the proposed board needs to be spelt out more clearly. It is dealt with in section 147 of the Bill but it is not spelt out clearly. Section 147 deals with board membership, which is to consist of no fewer than nine and not more than 15, inclusive of the member appointed as chairperson. The members, as appointed by the Minister, shall be persons who have experience in a field of expertise relevant to the board's functions and will be appointed for a term of up to five years. Board members are to be paid such remuneration as the Minister may determine, with the consent of the Minister for Finance. That spells out nothing about how the Minister intends to recruit the members of the board. Given the amount of work it will have to do, the board will require full-time staff. Board members would almost need to be full time to cater for all the difficulties that will arise between tenants and landlords when the Bill becomes operable.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">Will the Minister elaborate on the appointment of the board in his reply? It appears that he is free to choose whoever he wants as long as he deems them to have adequate experience, provided there is a balance between men and women on the board – this latter point is acceptable. However, he does not have to ensure that there is a balance between landlord and tenant interests on the board. It is important to have such a balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">Section 148(2) allows the Minister to make a subjective decision to remove a member of the board at any time. This gives him great power over the functioning of what needs to be an independent group. This provision seems to be at vari ance with what people expect from the legislation when taken in conjunction with section 129, which provides that the Minister has the power, in effect, to rewrite the day-to-day workings of the Bill, subject to his own interpretations. This is unacceptable and contrary to the principle of independent board hearings and proper lawmaking.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">Section 125 refers to the publication of the registry details. I have dealt with how this will be implemented, although it is acceptable that no information on the specific identity of landlord or tenant or the rent amount is to be included in published accounts.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">There is a concern that taxes are not paid by all property owners – this was alluded to by Deputies Gilmore and O'Donovan. Will the Minister state why the Bill does not ensure that this is not the case? The omission of such a provision by the Minister is strange, to say the least.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">The proposed compulsory registration and deregistration of each tenancy will be a bureaucratic nightmare. We fail to see what it will achieve or what purpose it serves. We fully appreciate why local authorities should know where rented property is. One must refer to the 1996 regulations in this respect. Giving responsibility to the board to take on the function of registration centrally is excessive and will lead to much red tape. In no other European country, where there are far higher levels of rented accommodation, has such a system been implemented. It does not exist in Germany, for example, where 70% of property is rented, and I do not see why it is needed here. I ask the Minister to re-examine the matter because the bureaucracy that will obtain in respect of single and multiple tenancies will be excessive. I do not see how the system can be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">I do not know how certain sections of the Bill can be implemented given that most rented property is rented to working people, who often do not stay in the same accommodation for long. One tenant may reside in a property today only to be replaced by another in three months, thus implying that there is no overall continuity over four years in a given house. I wonder how this matter will be worked out.</p>

        <speech by="#CharlieOConnorFF" eId="spk_413">
          <from>Mr. O'Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_641">I propose to conclude my contribution at 7 p.m. so a new speaker may begin when the debate resumes. Like other colleagues, I am very happy to be back. It is important that we take this opportunity to talk of business which is very important. While coming in the gate today, I made a point to a journalist that I am particularly pleased that the Dáil is sitting again because colleagues opposite – I notice that they have gone to have their little rest – often promulgate the view that one is not working if one is not sitting in the Chamber. It is important that we try to correct this perception. As has been said many times from the Chair, much work is being done in the constituencies and in Leinster House generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">I am pleased to note the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon. I welcome him back. He will know that I would be just as happy to ignore my script and talk about the need for a new Garda station in Tallaght, but I will resist the temptation. It is unfair to be suggesting that the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, and the Minister, Deputy Cullen, have not been working away on our behalf in recent months. There is no question that challenges exist and it is important that we continue to highlight them in the House. As a Fianna Fáil backbencher I will continue to honour my responsibilities, as will my more eminent colleague, Deputy Haughey.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">As I go about my business in Dublin South-West, on the streets of Tallaght, Firhouse, Templeogue and Greenhills, I always take the opportunity to listen to what people are saying to me. An issue exists regarding people's ability to own their own homes. This is true of young people in particular, and there is no point in any of us standing up and saying it is any different. It has to be said that the impact of the economic boom of the past six years affects us all. One area that will never be the same as a result pertains to our expectation to own our own homes. This is a challenge for many in all our constituencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">I believe the European model of lifelong tenancy is becoming a reality in our cities and towns. Such accommodation is being provided by large commercial interests and financial institutions, as is the case in Germany, Scandinavia and many other European countries, as was said by my colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">In Ireland, which suffered a long history of absentee landlordism and where the rental culture was one of poor standards, the need for the Residential Tenancies Bill 2003 is very evident. I have read with interest the contributions of Members of the House when it was introduced and noted the responses from organisations such as Threshold. On balance, I agree with my colleague, Deputy Noel Ahern, who stated that the Bill is one of the most important housing Bills to have been brought before the House and the most comprehensive reform of the residential private rented sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">The Bill is a step in the right direction. It offers hope to younger people that renting their own homes need not necessarily be fraught with worry, given the level of house prices. It can only be a good thing if renting a home is seen as a viable short-term or long-term alternative to home ownership. Bad landlords and bad tenants will suffer as a result of this Bill. Property owners who offer a good standard of accommodation will benefit from tenants who will realise that they have responsibilities as well as rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">All of us, from both urban and rural constituencies, can talk about our experiences on this subject. Many residents' associations and individual residents throughout my constituency, particularly in Tallaght, often talk to me about problems associated with tenancy. I often make the fair point that where people have a rented house  in estates, there is no reason they should act differently or why the standard of upkeep of that house should be any different from that of another. In many parts, certainly in Tallaght – I live in Springfield – there are fewer problems when landlords and tenants take their responsibilities seriously. Problems exist where they do not do so and where there are irresponsible landlords who will not give neighbours their telephone numbers and who just want to ignore difficulties. In recent years, this phenomenon has led to problems in my constituency and I suspect in many others, certainly across the city and county of Dublin, resulting in a decline in the image of rented accommodation. In South Dublin County Council many initiatives have been taken in respect of what could easily be determined as anti-social behaviour. There is a need to deal with such issues and the Bill affords us an opportunity to reflect on them. We should be positive about the merits of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">This is my first occasion to speak as a Member of the Dáil while no longer a member of a local authority. I do not feel any different and I am trying to use the time I used to spend in the council chamber in Tallaght in a worthwhile way. I am now finding lots of other things to do. I hope those colleagues that understand the challenges we face will help those of us who are wrestling with them for the first time.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DavidStanton" eId="spk_414">
          <from>Mr. Stanton</from>
          <p eId="para_649">I thank the Deputy for telling us that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CharlieOConnorFF" eId="spk_415">
          <from>Mr. O'Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_650">I am happy to do that and I will listen very carefully to what Deputy Stanton has to tell us.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">The Bill updates the legislation applying to the private rented sector. It brings overdue protection for tenants in terms of rent reviews and much-needed security of tenure. It also gives landlords and tenants an effective means of resolving disputes that arise between them. It addresses some long-standing deterrents to investing and residing in private rented accommodation and will lead to greater professionalism within the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">The Government – I am happy to be a Fianna Fáil backbencher – is acutely aware of the importance of the private rented sector in the overall housing market. This is reflected in the priority accorded in the current programme for Government and in the recently concluded partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, to reform and develop the sector, which is increasingly becoming the sector of choice in which to reside for a growing number of people. Rental accommodation can facilitate mobility in the ever-changing jobs market and can also help to address social housing needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">The Bill implements the recommendations made by the Commission on the Private Rented Sector, established by the previous Government to examine the workings of the landlord and ten ant relationship and to make recommendations regarding the sector. While the commission's recommendations did not fully meet all of the demands of the competing interests in this sector and the Bill does not contain everything that accommodation providers and renters might wish, it strikes a reasonable balance between these competing demands while providing a structure for a stable, effective and efficient private rented sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">The Minister of State shares my hope that the Bill will encourage further development and growth in the sector. In a speech last June he stated that he would explore other possible means of promoting the development of the sector, including increased investment and greater professionalism. Like the Minister of State, I am keen to encourage the potential of public private partnerships in the rental accommodation area, specifically in the context of social and affordable housing and especially if the commercial model used in countries like Germany is applied or where there is a greater encouragement of housing associations.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">We are informed that pension funds are being reduced by the volatile nature of international stock markets and in view of this, perhaps insurance companies should seek to invest in our housing needs and generate the secure income to meet the demands of their customers. This would be preferable to expecting us to work until the age of 75 years of age, although I have no difficulty with colleagues who wish to work until then. As society changes it is vital that as public representatives we seek the best solutions from countries that have already embarked on this area of social development and not waste time trying to reinvent the wheel.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">Many prospective first-time buyers living in rented accommodation are pushed to buy earlier than they need because of the high cost of rent and the ever increasing cost of their goal, a new house. For some, the increasing drain of rental costs has moved the home ownership goal further away. In view of this I welcome the surveys that indicate that over the past 12 months, the supply of rental accommodation has increased substantially with rents moderating and even falling in certain segments of the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">It is clear that with 50,000 families on housing lists throughout the country and against a background of some poor quality rented accommodation in most cities and towns, there is a poor, if any, enforcement of standards. Rents are high, standards are low and there is no enforcement by the local authorities. Always the shout will be "no resources". However, I am pleased the Minister of State outlined that funding from fee income will be distributed to local authorities to support their enforcement activity, especially with regard to standards for private rented accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">Tallaght is no different from anywhere else, although it is the third largest population centre in the country and it contains several thousand  local authority houses. Anti-social behaviour is now becoming a challenge that must be addressed, as it is in other urban and rural areas. I hope the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister of State with responsibility for housing understand the message from our communities that protection must be afforded to those tenants who wish to live normal lives while not being bothered by bad neighbours. Some local authorities in Dublin, including my south county area, and elsewhere have made progress in dealing with anti-social behaviour. However, many of those in private estates point out that if powers have been given to local authorities to deal with anti-social problems in housing estates and to move families who create such difficulties, why is the same protection not afforded in private housing estates? Indeed, it often happens that families who are moved from local authority estates for serious reasons find accommodation in private housing estates through the rent subsidy system where they cause the same problems. There is a call for this aspect to be addressed. The Minister and his Department must consider this issue and understand the need to afford the necessary protection. Ultimately, we are all entitled to believe we are safe in our houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">The increase in the supply of new housing in recent years, particularly apartments with tax relief for refurbishment, of which there are a huge number in Tallaght, is improving standards within the overall sector. However, the remainder of the sector needs to be inspected to maintain the correct level of supply standard. I agree with the Minister of State when he stated it is unacceptable in the 21st century that any accommodation provider should offer a product that does not meet minimum basic standards, especially when the product is to serve as a person's home.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">It is right that the Bill has generated debate and a little controversy, although I do not agree with the criticisms of Members on the other side of the House. It is good legislation that will be welcomed by communities. We need to examine all the issues involved. Like many colleagues, I have received numerous submissions. Our role is to articulate in the Dáil the views and concerns expressed by families, organisations and associations. The legislation will ultimately be welcomed and built on. It is important that the Bill be subject to scrutiny and I look forward to supporting its passage through the Dáil. I know that people in my constituency will be happy that it will be well debated and dealt with. While I commend the Bill, a number of outstanding issues need to be addressed and other issues will arise from its passage which I hope will also be addressed in due course.</p>

          <from>Mr. Allen</from>
          <p eId="para_665">The basic principle of benchmarking awards is the same as the principle under which Dunnes Stores operates – value for money. When the concept of benchmarking was proposed, Fine Gael supported the process as a way of bringing about major change in the provision of public services, and we confidently expected that the expenditure on benchmarking would reap rich benefits. How wrong we were. The Government did not involve benchmarking in an agenda for reform to deliver the necessary service improvements that are constantly demanded by those working in the public services. Fine Gael believes that the agreement reached by the Government is seriously flawed and it should re-negotiate the deal in the same manner as deals were re-negotiated previously and for which there is a precedent.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">The implications of the benchmarking agreement for local authorities are horrendous because they will face a frightening funding shortfall of approximately €161 million arising from the benchmarking pay award. The full cost of the award will run to €1.2 billion when fully implemented. As of now, the Government has failed to indicate to local authorities how to fund this award.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">The simple arithmetic is that, with local authorities employing almost 32,000 people or 13% of the 235,000 covered by the benchmarking process, the full year cost to them will run to approximately €161 million per year. This cost can only be made up by one or a combination of four options. One would be an increase in local charges for services. These would involve new development charges. I have heard that local authorities are considering new development charges for new house construction, with some floating the idea of €10,000 per unit. At a time when house prices are spiralling out of control, this would be the death knell of the hopes of many young people trying to buy their first homes. Increased local charges would also involve an increase in refuse collection charges, and I am sure councils would eventually  be forced into considering charging for water supply.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">Another option would be to increase rates for businesses, which would affect our competitiveness as a nation. Chambers of commerce have warned recently that businesses are being forced to close because of double digit increases in commercial rates at a time when inflation was running at 4% to 5%. The other options would be a reduction in services offered or job losses.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">If local charges were increased to meet the cost of the benchmarking award, it would have the effect of imposing a charge of €125 per year on each of the 1.288 million private residences in the State. This fact puts the recent bin protests, where waste charges of €130 per annum were the norm, in stark focus. The benchmarking, in its current shape, will be the silent secondary charge on all services at local authority level.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">The debate on value for money in benchmarking has at least thrown some light on what the Government deal is doing for the taxpayer. What has had little discussion is the manner in which benchmarking will quietly introduce another stealth charge on every household of €125 as local authorities desperately try to balance their books.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">Since Fine Gael made its stance known on benchmarking, some of the largest councils, including Cork County Council, have stated that no funds are available to meet their benchmarking bill, which for Cork County Council will run to about €10 million per year. Meanwhile the taxpaying public continues to wait in vain to see what it will get for its money.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">Local government has been damaged grievously in recent years by tribunals and allegations of corruption. Added to these problems has been the undermining of the fabric of local government by this Administration, the most recent example being the benchmarking award, a deal struck by the Government which is now dictating to local authorities that they must fund it despite having no hand, act or part in agreeing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, through the Protection of the Environment Act passed last July, removed from councillors the powers to set charges and gave them to city and county managers. Imagine the uproar if the Minister for Finance were to wash his hands of taxation policy, transfer it to the Civil Service and say he was no longer responsible for setting taxes. This is happening locally.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">The Government has set a scenario in which it will continue to reduce its funding for local government and has ensured in recent legislative changes that its local agents, the city and county managers, will make up for this financial shortfall by raising charges locally. In other words, rates are being re-introduced. It is ironic that the Fianna Fáil Party, which abolished domestic rates  in 1977, is re-introducing them through a wide range of new local charges.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_675">What we are debating is the result of short-term political thinking for even shorter-term political gain and the type of self-serving political thinking for which Ireland is paying too high a price and which it finds it can no longer afford. Benchmarking, as constituted by the Government, is an example of strategic thinking coalition-style. It is strategic thinking that extends only to the next general election. That alone made it a bad deal when it was struck. That the benchmarking award is now to be paid in radically changed economic circumstances makes it all the worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">Ireland has a €1 billion deficit. Growth in Irish business is almost nil. Inflation remains double the European average, the highest in the euro zone. One in four overseas managers has lost confidence in Ireland as a place to do business. By the end of the year, it is expected that there will be 45,000 job losses. The Taoiseach has warned of more on the way. Surely in the national interest it is time to shout stop and to suspend payment of the benchmarking awards pending a serious reform package being implemented that would yield real improvements in the quality of services delivered to the public to reflect the extra cost involved. That is what our motion proposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">My colleagues will examine the details of the benchmarking agreement and its impact on key areas of the public service. I want to focus on the broader political issues this raises – the Government's refusal to govern, its abdication of responsibility and its abysmal failure to lead. Benchmarking, as constituted, is a brilliant insight into how the Government is running and ruining this country. As coined by the coalition, it reveals a political vision more in keeping with the government of a rogue state than of one soon to assume a defining role in modern international politics, namely, the Presidency of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">Through all the confusion on benchmarking one fact is clear. As constituted, it is a raw deal for everyone. It screws the taxpayer and, because it refuses to tackle real reform, it hamstrings the public service. Therefore, we all lose. As with many bad deals, the details of the award were devised in secret and kept secret. Bizarrely, the Government agreed to pay out money under Sustaining Progress for performance improvements already committed to, and possibly still outstanding, under an earlier agreement, the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. Overall, benchmarking promised a great deal, but it demanded and, as far as the public can see, delivered nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">Ask anyone to name three specific improvements, in either the quantum or the quality of the public services for which they are paying under benchmarking, and they will be hard-pressed to name even one. That is not the fault of public servants, who are also taxpayers. The problem  with benchmarking is not public servants but the Government. It promised a reward without a proper reform package that could be publicly scrutinised and quantified in return.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">Benchmarking gave the coalition Government a brilliant opportunity to get our public services right and offered the perfect opportunity to reform bureaucratic systems which were strangling public servants, robbing the taxpayer and failing society. In these appalling systems doctors are being paid €8.5 million a year for ghost patients and 50% of cases before the District Courts are being struck out without a hearing. Through benchmarking, the Government could have tackled definitively these and other problems at the heart of our public service. Instead of tackling them, however, it chose to tolerate them and left the taxpayer and future Governments to pick up the tab for its "easy ride" mentality.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">Every area of public life will suffer significantly through the payment of these awards of €1.2 billion. Just last week, as Deputy Allen pointed out, the Cork county manager warned that benchmarking would cost his council €10 million over the next year. Nationally, the deal will cost local authorities more than €160 million, forcing job losses, increases in service charges and cuts in services. We will all lose but it will be the general operatives and outdoor workers on whom the axe first falls.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">County managers, the people at the public service coalface, are not even pretending that benchmarking will produce the improvements in public services the Government tells us are in the bag. Despite this, the benchmarking crisis – it is a crisis for the Irish economy – has done the State some service in that it shines a spectacular light on the politics of appeasement practised by the Government. The Government's politics seek to please all the people all the time. They are politics based on the maxim that one should never confront when one can dodge and never commit when one can fudge or, better still, when one can commission a report knowing one will sit on the results for months or years. Above all, they are the kinds of politics which state one should never be responsible or take blame. Whatever the crisis, it is never the fault of the Government. As the Taoiseach put it, if it is blame one is after, blame the state of the international markets or the Japanese yen.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">Ireland is realising to its cost that it can no longer afford this kind of politics or Government. The price of both has become exorbitant, financially and morally, because, come January, it is not the Government that will pay the awards but the individual taxpayer. It will be the couples mortgaged to the hilt for the pleasure of living miles from their people and their jobs, the small business people letting staff go because of soaring insurance and the sick, hardworking, compliant taxpayer who is shipped from Beaumont Hospital to St Vincent's Hospital because a public health system screaming for reform has left the northside accident and emergency services unable to  cope. Let there be no mistake, it is not the Government that will pay but ordinary people will pay dearly.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">Election fever made the Government forget that, in this country at any rate, the primary reason for the existence of the public service is not to give employment, even though an additional 21,000 people were recruited to the public service ranks in the year before the general election. It exists to give the public the services they pay for in health, education, transport, security and so forth. In any properly functioning democracy, if the public is to pay more, they are entitled to know what they are getting in return.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">By reducing benchmarking to a strategy of appeasement the Government has maligned our public servants. This is damaging to the public service, an already fragile public trust, public office and society. Thankfully for Ireland, however, many thousands of public servants want to work to the highest standards. In keeping with their sense of public duty they would welcome the chance to show how well they can do their jobs. They want the kind of reform which would recognise and reward their valuable contribution, make their jobs more satisfying, the services they deliver more effective and Ireland a better country in which to be born and learn and a better and happier place in which to work and live. They must, therefore, have found the Minister for Finance more intriguing than usual recently when he wrote in newspapers that under benchmarking in future greater emphasis would be placed on merit in Civil Service promotion. Surely promotion is based on merit or not at all. If this is not the case, it is no wonder that a 1999 study on the retention of staff in the Civil Service cited the absence of personal recognition as one of the key drivers in staff resignation. Lack of reform may well be driving our best and brightest out of our public service and still the Government stonewalls.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">Our public servants are the people who make our world work. They deliver our babies, inspire our children, care for us when we are sick or old and keep us safe in our homes and on our streets. They have every right to be paid well but if they are to be paid more for, as we are told, doing more, the paying public has an equal right to see precisely what this entails. This is entirely reasonable and responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">There is, however, nothing of the kind in the Government action plans. However unpalatable this may be, one thing is sure, namely, incompetence or poor performance cannot and should not be paid for out of the public purse. To do so would be an abuse of our good public servants and the taxpayer. It would be corrosive to our public services, efficiency, quality of life, competitiveness and international credentials as a place to do business and an affront to our national dignity and integrity.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">Based on the overall needs of the economy, particularly the competing demands for resources evident in areas such as crime, transport, health and education, the Fine Gael Party believes that  the country cannot afford the annual cost of the €1.2 billion benchmarking process nor the €500 million benchmarking award due to be paid on new year's day. It is time to blow the whistle on the benchmarking framework devised by the Government which is not delivering to the taxpayer. Despite our best hopes, nothing has presented itself to show that these awards are justified. With just over 100 days to go until this massive payment is due, the Fine Gael Party is saying "Stop". The Government must go back to the drawing board, renegotiate a deal for the times and deliver a real reform agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">As far as the public is concerned, there is now no one in charge of the country. Time and again, the Taoiseach has refused to do what he was elected to do, that is, to lead. On benchmarking, in the name of the quiet people of this country I suggest he rouse himself at last and do so.</p>

          <from>Ms O. Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_692">I support my colleagues and the Fine Gael Party motion which has been tabled not to accuse public servants, make political gain or embarrass the Government, or because we do not support benchmarking. We support a real benchmarking process, one which would reward those who improve their performance and deliver better services. The primary reason for tabling this motion is that we believe the issue is too important to ignore.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">We are not discussing a normal negotiated pay round but a unique payment on top of the normal pay round to every one of the 300,000 public service workers in the State. While the first 25% of the award was paid unconditionally, the deal was that the next tranche, announced by the Minister tonight, would be delivered only in tandem with demonstrable improvements in the public services. It now transpires that this deal for the consumer was never negotiated or hammered down.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">Rather than pursue a detailed and challenging reform agenda, the Government was content instead with a one-sided deal. The price paid was too large and has too many ramifications for everybody else to allow a responsible Opposition to stay silent and fail to bring the matter before the House and the public. It is our responsibility to raise the issue and ask where is the beef. The truth is there is no beef. The whole exercise of benchmarking has been nothing but flimflam, a shadowy illusion designed solely to get the Government over an immediate problem and a way of buying industrial peace in a summer which was already shaping up to be very difficult for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">A one-sided deal would probably not have mattered so much if the Celtic tiger had continued to roar. The Government had already frittered a surplus of €5 billion and probably decided that another €1.2 billion would be hardly noticed.  Suddenly, in the aftermath of the election, it was noticed and the figure became a significant amount of money. To put in context the sum involved, for ten years we discussed <i>ad nauseam</i> the Luas project, the cost of which is now put at about €800 million. The issue is raised in the newspapers every time there is a slow news day and is correctly discussed in the Houses, on the airwaves and in the streets, because €800 million is a significant sum of money. Benchmarking could pay the cost of 1.5 Luas projects in a single year.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">There are two differences between Luas and benchmarking. The first is that with Luas we will have a physical, productive asset but after paying out €1,200 million under benchmarking we will have nothing to show for it. The other difference is that we will pay for Luas once, whereas we will pay benchmarking every year in perpetuity. We could have had an underground metro and paid for it in three years, even without the Spanish cavalry being brought in by Señor Brennan to show us how to do it. There are endless examples of what we could do with that type of money.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">The Government would have people believe that this is an attack on public servants. It is anything but that. They are as much victims of benchmarking as the rest of us. What they are getting with one hand they are giving back with another through a range of stealth taxes introduced to pay for benchmarking. They are probably less well equipped to pay those stealth taxes than others, certainly than the self-employed who have the ability to vary their income by working harder or for longer. Public servants generally do not have that flexibility so they will bear the costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">In the health area alone they have borne increased charges for beds, increased drugs charges and increased VHI premia. There are increased charges throughout every sector. Even then, however, the cost of benchmarking is so enormous that it is also being paid for by cutting many services. Stealth taxes alone will not even come close to balancing the books. Cuts in services impact on public servants and their families as much as on everybody else.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">Health care workers want reform. Every health care worker I know or have ever spoken to knows there is a finite envelope of money to be spent on health. The Minister has said as much many times. To the extent that it goes to enhance the pay of existing workers, there is less money for everything else. That is the reason contract workers are being let go, that there are fewer nurses and wards are being closed. It is the reason there is no money for critical ICT investment and that we are dangerously uninformed about anything going on in the health sector. It is the reason no maintenance or refurbishment is being carried out, services are either closed or curtailed, there is no disabled person's grant and there are no care assistants for disabled children.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">One of my constituents is required to pay €150 per week for a care assistant for her Down's syndrome son so he can have the privilege of  attending a State primary school. That is an outrage. Only last year the State promised that every child would be entitled to a care assistant. That promise means nothing this year. No wonder the disabled want rights-based legislation. The bottom line is that benchmarking has a price and it is being paid daily by all of us but primarily by the most vulnerable – children, the old and the sick.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">The Government has a responsibility to establish priorities and decide where money is spent. When it decided to spend the money as it did, that had ramifications for all other expenditure. It has the potential to wipe out virtually all non-pay expenditure and all new recruitment. The only possible justification for making the choice it did was if the Government could prove to the taxpayer that it was getting the best possible value for money and better service. The irony is that the Minister for Finance knew this and said it publicly. However, neither he nor any member of the Government followed through to ensure that the taxpayer, who would pay this enormous bill, would get anything in return.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">This is not the fault of public servants; it is the fault of the Government. Nurses cannot be expected to give a better service if their wards have been closed. Doctors cannot perform more operations if they are denied theatre time. I can offer other examples throughout the health service and other services. The Minister is aware of the point we are making. This Government must go back to the drawing board and pursue a genuine reform agenda which will equip public servants to give the type of service they want to and are capable of giving under good Government and good management.</p>

        <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_423">
          <from>Mr. O'Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_703">Ba mhaith liom cuidiú leis an rún an-thábhachtach agus bunúsach seo. Táimid ag caint anocht faoin tír, faoi chúrsaí airgid agus, go mórmhór, faoin chúis nach bhfuil an t-airgead againn chun ardú ioncaim a thabhairt dos na daoine atá ag obair ar son an Stáit. Is ceist phráinneach í seo a bhfuil gach duine sa tír ag caint fúithi. Is minic a cuirtear ceist orm, cén fáth go bhfuil Fine Gael ag déanamh díospóireachta ar cheist an bhinse mharcála.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">Many people ask me why Fine Gael is talking about benchmarking when the party is not in Government. It is a sincere and straightforward question asked by people who work in the public service. We have a sincere and simple answer, that the money is not available right now. The last figures published by the Minister for Finance show a serious deficit in current funding of more than €800 million. That means that at the end of the year the Government will either have to cut public services or increase taxation to bring the figures back to where they were expected to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">The economy has changed. While everybody is hopeful that the world economy will recover, our economy is stagnating in terms of the amount of income available to meet public spending demands. Other people, for example, teachers,  tend to say to me: "I think Enda Kenny is right but he should not have said it."  Nurses say the same thing. They are making two judgment calls. The first is that Deputy Kenny is right. It is a fact that we cannot afford to proceed with benchmarking in the way the Government and the unions propose. The money is not there. The services are not available and we cannot provide them as matters stand.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">Deputy Allen spoke earlier about the problems in local government and the extra charges that will be imposed. We must face reality. People will listen to the truth. In this instance they are getting the truth from Fine Gael speaking from the Opposition benches. The Minister must also listen to the facts, which speak for themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">I was called to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda at 9.15 p.m. last Thursday by a family whose mother, aged over 70 years, had a suspected blood clot in her leg. They rang me because they were told there was no bed for their mother and that there was a possibility but no definite hope of a trolley. I called down and spoke to the family. Thankfully, the lady was given a trolley at about 11.30 p.m. and at 5.30 the following morning she was admitted to a ward for treatment of this serious condition.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">During the previous week I got another call from the same hospital. The lady concerned was admitted through casualty with a suspected stomach ulcer problem. She was kept for over 24 hours on a trolley. The family was happy that she was getting good care and attention on the trolley. However, after 24 hours the lady was taken off the trolley and put on a chair. The reason was that the hospital had no more trolleys and the one she had occupied had to be given to a patient who came in with a suspected heart attack.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">The same is occurring in the accident and emergency departments of all hospitals. The money is not available so services are not being provided. The services are not available to look after the sick and the elderly because we have squandered the money. If the Government proceeds with benchmarking as it proposes, it will have to find the extra money. It will have to cut services further. There will be a progressive deterioration in the quality of service in accident and emergency departments and in hospital services.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">Deputy Olivia Mitchell is absolutely correct about disabled persons' grants. We are all aware of the position in our constituencies. I am sure the Minister has also met such people. I met one man in his late 70s whose wife had a stroke. They lived in a local authority house with an upstairs bathroom and bedroom and he had to carry his wife upstairs to bed every night. Being an independent person, he would not accept a home help who might have done it in that instance. He is waiting, just as people in Louth are waiting. The Government has made no effort to provide funding for disabled persons' grants. In Louth there is no such funding. They are now dealing with the 52 applications which they agreed last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">If benchmarking goes ahead as proposed, the services that are poor will get much worse. The money to pay for it can only come from increased taxation or a reduction in services. Fine Gael is saying that the Minister should stop and look again at what is in the benchmarking report. It states that, for the 75% that is to come, we should examine the required efficiencies. Everyone, including public servants, knows that there is no such thing as a free lunch. I believe that they are prepared to respond to the crisis in the national economy and to the fact that we do not have the money that we expected to have to run our services. There are also significant problems in other parts of the public services. It is not that long ago that a situation arose between the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who sits with the Minister at the Cabinet table, and the Prison Officers' Association. He pointed out that overtime payments could not continue to rise as they had. There was uproar, rí-rá and ruaille buaille. The Minister was right, we cannot afford to run public services that depend far too much on jobs which literally consist of overtime or where two or three times the basic income comes from it. That is not good enough either.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">If one looks up the websites on benchmarking, as I am sure we all did tonight, one will see that the issue that comes up very clearly is that of teachers' benchmarking, an absolutely fundamental question throughout the past few years. As I understand it, the teachers have reached consensus with their employers and are concluding productivity deals on the hours that the schools will be open to meet parents and so on. Fine Gael is saying that it is good, constructive common sense and makes good financial sense, because we cannot afford to go on as we are. It is simply not possible, and it is the Minister's job to ensure that the economy is in the healthiest possible state given the situation that has arisen from benchmarking.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">The other issue that arises is that of community and voluntary bodies, which is part of my job. Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív is the Minister responsible and no one doubts his sincerity or commitment to it. We all know what is going on with community employment schemes in our constituencies. We all know communities that have operated effectively and efficiently, holding their own against the tide of urban Ireland. They have stood out nobly, providing their own services in their own communities. They have cut the grass, built up community services and implemented small schemes to take people, particularly people in their 40s and 50s who are not generally in full-time employment, and give them a place and a role. They are real communities which are alive and well. What will the reality be for those? What will the reality be, given the way the economy is currently running? Without reform and improvements in service delivery, the cost of benchmarking will take its toll, particularly on the sector least well  equipped to deal with it, the community and voluntary sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">The Government has taken a hatchet to the community employment scheme, which will see its numbers fall from a high of 40,000 to 20,000 by the end of the year. The Government Estimates for 2003 provide for only 20,000 places on community employment schemes, a reduction of 50%. The number of people involved in CE schemes has fallen by one third since last year. Disadvantaged communities are reeling as the effect of the cutbacks hits them. Many community group projects are already being closed or are seriously affected by the cuts. I believe there was a report in the papers the day before yesterday about protesters being dragged out of the way of a Minister – I believe it was the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney. They were protesting about their community scheme being disbanded in an urban area. That is not good enough and is not acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">Vital and valuable services are provided for people with disabilities, the elderly and children by community employment schemes. In Drogheda there was a community employment scheme whereby people got meals on wheels ready for elderly people in their homes. The health board was obviously not in a position, or did not want – no one did – to take them from their homes and put them into long-term or medium-term care. What happened to that community employment scheme? It is gone because there is no money for it. Now those people must be dealt with and helped in a different manner. These cutbacks in public and community services will make matters more expensive for the State in the longer term. I put it to the Minister that the Minister for Health, Deputy Martin, overruled the decision of the North Eastern Health Board not to proceed with its budget for this year. The reason was that there was over €1 million of cuts in home helps amounting to over 8,000 hours. That means that people with a disability will be at home on their own. I knew a gentleman who was blind but left on his own practically all day because there was no one to look after him. There was no home help available. The writ of the Minister, Deputy Martin, applied in his Department, and he cut back the budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">We are bringing to the Minister the real issues, which I am sure he must know from reports on his desk – they are also on those of other Ministers. We are describing just how bad the situation is on the ground at present. If we go ahead and pay more money to more and more public servants, increasing the money without a better deal for all those people, it makes no sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">What will the effect be when a €500 million reduction in services starts to have an effect as a result of the benchmarking Bill? The Government promised to mainstream health and child care positions in the community and voluntary sector currently filled by CE scheme participants. That promise has thus far gone unfulfilled. There are two chances that the Government will deliver,  a dog's chance and no chance. What will happen when benchmarking is implemented? The Government will remain content to see vital services provided to the old, the sick and people with disabilities by part-time, vulnerable and temporary workers. When the CE schemes disappear, as they undoubtedly will, and the Government reneges altogether on its promises to give those jobs the primacy and value they deserve, services will be lost to those most in need. Without a <i>quid pro quo</i> in more efficient delivery of service, increased availability of trained staff and cost effectiveness, the price of benchmarking will be far too high for vulnerable sectors to bear.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">Recently I attended a meeting in Gardiner Street of all the community groups in the city of Dublin who are concerned about the delivery of services to that part of our community most at risk, drug users. There are more than 13,000 heroin addicts. Those groups work in the most deprived areas of our cities to give a better service to their communities. They said that community schemes were cut. The jobs of people working directly with those with a drugs problem were ring-fenced. They were cut back in the health boards. The absence of health board workers in the community has a very significant and adverse impact on the effectiveness of the Government and community in fighting the drugs problem in Dublin city.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">It is time to think again. It is time to do another deal on benchmarking. We ask the Minister to think before he acts and ensure the community is better off and particularly that the poor and the vulnerable do not suffer.</p>

          <p title="amendmentProposal" eId="para_720">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p eId="para_721">To delete all words after "Dail Éireann" and to substitute the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_722">"notes that:</p>
          <p eId="para_723">– the benchmarking exercise under the PPF was an important initiative in developing a better system of pay determination in the public service;</p>
          <p eId="para_724">– payment of the second and third phases of the increases recommended by the Public Service Benchmarking Body and of the general round increases under Sustaining Progress is conditional on the maintenance of industrial relations peace and on progress on modernisation in the public service; and</p>
          <p eId="para_725">– effective verification processes have been put in place to ensure that these conditions are met."</p>
          <p eId="para_726">I wish to share time with the Minister for Education and Science.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">The Fine Gael motion is quite remarkable in what it proposes. It asks the Government to break an agreement reached only last January  with the social partners. This would inevitably mean the collapse of Sustaining Progress and probably the end of the social partnership process that has served this country well since the late 1980s. The motion also seeks to deny to public servants pay increases which have been recommended by an independent and distinguished body chaired by a High Court judge. It ignores the fact that strict conditions have been attached to payment with an effective verification process having been put in place to ensure that those conditions are met. In effect, the motion seeks to prejudge the outcome of that verification process.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">The motion is surprising in that Fine Gael seems to have reversed its position on the payment of the benchmarking increases. In July 2002, shortly after the publication of the report of the benchmarking body, Deputy Enright issued a statement calling for the immediate negotiation of the benchmarking report between the Minister for Education and Science and teacher unions, saying "The timetable for the delivery of the proposed increases will be crucial."</p>
          <p eId="para_729">Much of the comment about the benchmarking process from Deputies opposite and others shows little real understanding of what benchmarking is about or recognition of developments that have taken place in recent years. I would like to make some facts clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">Why benchmarking? Prior to 2000 when the body was established the public service pay scene was very unsettled. In the 1990s there had been a whole series of disputes, particularly notable examples being the nurses' strike and the famous, or infamous, "blue flu". There was a general recognition that we could not go on like this.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">Deciding pay levels in the public service has always been difficult and contentious. How does one decide the level of pay for a garda or a nurse when the private sector comparators are not obvious? Over many years a system of relativities had grown up. Basically, groups were linked to other public service groups so that a pay rise for one knocked-on to the related group. Sometimes these groups bore no relationship to each other in terms of work and were linked solely for pay purposes. This led to leapfrogging, with each group trying to pull ahead of other groups with consequent claims in turn for catch up increases. Pay increases could end up being determined on the basis of irrational pay linkages, selective analogues or simply horse-trading with no real objective basis. To many, the system was illogical, inconsistent and incoherent. Right across the spectrum of political parties, interest groups and commentators the view was expressed that there had to be a better way to determine public service pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">At a plenary meeting of the social partners in July 1998, the Taoiseach took the initiative in calling for a better way to manage public service pay. Following from this, over the next 18 months or so there were detailed discussions between the public service employers and unions to find a better way forward. These discussions culminated in the negotiations which resulted in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness in early 2000. The  outcome was benchmarking. When the Government agreed to benchmarking, an important consideration was that the unions agreed the old system of cross-sectoral relativities was dead. This was a fundamental change from the old regime and has been copper-fastened in Sustaining Progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">Benchmarking was not some esoteric process or arcane mystery. It was essentially a process that measured the wages and salaries of workers in the public service and compared them to jobs in the private sector. In making this comparison, allowance had to be made for the differences between the two sectors, such as on job security and superannuation. The jobs were measured by a job scoring system which is a common approach to measuring differing jobs. The body that carried out this work from mid-2000 to its report in mid-2002 was an independent body, chaired by a High Court judge, and not controlled by either the employers or the unions.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">This was a major undertaking. Some may not realise that benchmarking spanned the entire public service, dealing with a large and diverse range of groups such as clerical, executive and management staff, and also technical and professional staff, in the Civil Service, local authorities and health boards, nurses and other health professionals, teachers, members of the Defence Forces, the Garda, firefighters, and the staff here in the Houses of the Oireachtas. These are the people whose pay increases Fine Gael wants to block.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">An essential principle underlying benchmarking was that the public service should be able to offer pay rates that would be fair to its employees and enable it to recruit and retain its fair share of good quality staff. The public service should not lose out unfairly but neither should it set the pace. This is what the benchmarking body was asked to address.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">The research exercise on private sector jobs carried out for the benchmarking body was one of the most extensive of its kind ever carried out not just in Ireland but anywhere. We have heard much of the argument that the process lacked transparency but I do not accept that this view is soundly based. The benchmarking body did publish an extensive description of the research it had carried out. What it did not publish was the raw data it had collected on private sector earnings. There were good reasons for this. First, most of the data collected on private sector jobs and earnings was received on a strictly confidential basis. It would not be possible to get it otherwise. Second, publishing masses of raw data would only create scope for endless challenge and nit-picking. This is the reality of how industrial relations works. Any sensible industrial relations practitioner would acknowledge this. There is a considerable amount of misunderstanding in this area. Anyone who has ever been involved in industrial relations, and who knows anything about the process of how an independent arbiter decides on a case, knows that the information  given by one side or the other is not thrown into the public domain for someone to nit-pick later. One would never get a result if that were the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">One can imagine the chaos that would ensue if the detailed workings of the benchmarking body were sent out to the public. Every group who considers it should have got a greater increase would come back and ask why such a thing was not taken into account. One of the purposes of setting up the benchmarking body was to get away from the relativities that have bedevilled industrial relations in the public service for the past 50 years. It is the one issue that successive Governments made extraordinary efforts to get rid of and none has been successful. Many years ago I was a member of a Cabinet which thought it had finally finished with this particular relativity. That was in the early 1990s and the Government of the day did not bother to appoint a conciliation arbitrator as all the unions had signed up bar a few. It was the closest we ever got to getting rid of it and the whole process started off again. It was not the fault of any one Government, it goes across Governments. Deputies will be aware that relativities have bedevilled industrial relations business. If one group gets an increase another group must get it.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">As one who enjoys being Minister for Finance, one thing I was not aware of when I took office was that an extraordinary amount of my time would be taken up by the role of Minister for the public service. I have learned that the smallest concession given to any group cannot be ring-fenced, even when the relevant Department tells me that it can. Nothing in the public service is ring-fenced. If the smallest increase was given to anybody in this room tonight, on a confidential basis and on the basis of excellent work, before 5 p.m. on Friday a group in some other area would look for the same concession. Anybody who has served in Government knows that. Deputies who are members of unions such as teachers' unions know that if an increase is given to anybody, somebody else will want the same. We could never get out of that situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">The biggest advantage of benchmarking is that everybody signs up for it. It examines the situation for once and for all and tries to get rid of the relativities. As people well know, if the usher at a hospital in Dublin got an increase, within a year the chief executive of the same hospital would have to get a proportionate increase or even more. Then the whole circle would start again. I make that point about one particular benefit of benchmarking. In Sustaining Progress this was signed off again. If we can stick to this benchmarking report the relativity problem will be solved once and for all and then anyone who tries to break out of that straitjacket will not have the protection of the Government. This is why we are not prepared to do as suggested. We have decided on this based on the independent body's report and this is what everyone has signed up to, including the unions.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">As I said, any sensible industrial relations practitioner would acknowledge this. The better approach is to appoint a suitable body of independent experts whose judgment and fairness can be accepted by all, to oversee research and reach conclusions. One will find that similar approaches are adopted by many comparable bodies in other jurisdictions. The review body on higher remuneration in the public sector, for example, as a result of whose report Members have benefited, which deals with top public service posts, has operated on this basis for over 30 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">The report of the public service benchmarking body was issued in mid-2002. The increases recommended averaged 8.9%. It is worth noting at this stage something which most people seem to have forgotten, that in the period prior to the report there were fairly widespread forecasts of across the board increases of 12% or 15%.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">The increases recommended ranged generally from about 4% to about 15%, with a small number of cases outside this range. Again, this spread of increases was wider than many would have forecast. The safe option for the benchmarking body would have been seen as recommending only a very narrow spread of increases. That the benchmarking body was not inhibited in this, but rather called it as it saw it, was a clear demonstration of its integrity and independence.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">The implementation of the increases was negotiated with the unions in the context of the new national agreement, Sustaining Progress. It had been agreed under the PPF that one quarter would be paid with effect from December 2001. As part of the public service pay agreement under Sustaining Progress it was agreed that half of the increases would be paid on 1 January 2004 and the final quarter on 1 June 2005, provided certain important conditions are met.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">It is important to remember that during the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, which preceded Sustaining Progress, there were no pay settlements in the public service above the standard pay rounds of the agreement. At the same time in the private sector, whether because of the tight labour market or otherwise, the terms were exceeded in a large number of firms. Inevitably the results of this were reflected in the benchmarking exercise which was in practice a catching-up exercise. The cost of the increases is high, about €1.1 billion a year when fully implemented. While I might have preferred if this cost came at a better time for the Exchequer, the Government made commitments on this for good reasons and I believe in sticking to the deals that I make. Moreover, with the final phase of the increases being payable from mid-2005, the cost is being spread over a number of budgetary periods.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">A further feature of Sustaining Progress which tends to be overlooked is that there is a six month pay pause at the start of the agreement. This does not apply in the private sector.</p>

          <from>Mr. McCreevy</from>
          <p eId="para_747">It has to be stressed that payment is not automatic. In the agreement the payment of the benchmarking increases is dependent on the absence of industrial action and progress on modernisation and increased flexibility to improve the delivery of public services. The same conditionality applies to the general round increases under Sustaining Progress. This is also a significant development.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">The Government will meet the bill on the basis of the conditions set down in the agreement. This means no industrial action such as we saw in recent years with hospital services being curtailed because of disputes or disruption to our schools. Any form of industrial action will be clear for all to see and would be a breach of the conditions of the agreement. I am aware that previous national pay agreements contained commitments to promoting industrial harmony and seeking to preclude industrial action. We all know that these had only a limited effect in preventing industrial action. The provisions in Sustaining Progress are more categorical, the commitments by the public service unions on this issue are clear-cut and the machinery to ensure compliance is straightforward and simple.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">The agreement sets out specific changes needed in individual sectors and organisations in the public service and more general requirements on co-operation with modernisation and change. Some of the changes will be obvious for all to see while others, by no means less important, will not, but all will contribute to improving and modernising our public services to give better customer service and improved value to taxpayer. Other Ministers will comment on changes in the sectors for which they are responsible but I will give some examples from the Civil Service. For the first time there will be some open recruitment to middle and senior management posts in the Civil Service. At the same time, there will be improvements in internal promotion arrangements, with greater emphasis on merit.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">There is to be legislation to modernise the recruitment and employment status of civil servants. In accordance with the agreement, the Government is legislating to modernise civil service recruitment practices. The Civil Service Commission will be overhauled. New commissioners will set recruitment standards and license office holders to carry out recruitment. A new public appointment service will be established to carry out recruitment and private sector agencies may be nominated by the commissioners to carry out recruitment on behalf of licence holders.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">The Government is also making significant changes to the management of staff in Departments. A new Bill on regulation will give Secretaries General and heads of office the power to dismiss civil servants below principal officer level. At and above principal officer level, civil servants may be dismissed by the Minister. Where a person is appointed by the Government, the power of dismissal remains with the Government. As  part of the same initiative, wider powers will be given to heads of office to deal with under-performance by staff. To ensure fair procedure, the Bill also provides that the existing unfair dismissals legislation will apply to civil servants.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">These important changes in the law will bring about significant improvements in the way that civil servants are recruited and in the way staff of Departments are managed. The framework is being laid for an efficient and flexible approach to the management of the Civil Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">Apart from important headline issues like these, there are specific and detailed elements right down through the action plans prepared by Departments and organisations across the public service. These involve issues like flexibilities, new working arrangements, new technology and extended opening hours. All these, if delivered, will provide benefits for the public. The Government wants to see a move away from old traditional methods of working towards a more modern, sophisticated service using up-to-date technologies and practice. This applies across the whole public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">One would think from some of the comments that have been made that the civil and wider public service have not changed and modernised in the past but are still operating on a 19th century model. There has been a process of continuous review and improvement across the public service over a number of years. Under Sustaining Progress, we seek to accelerate and deepen that change process.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">The agreement sets out the process to be followed for verification of achievement of the agreement. This includes the preparation of and reporting on action plans, verification of progress by performance verification groups with a strong independent element and final decisions by the relevant Secretaries General in each case that the necessary conditions have been met. Furthermore, if any grades, sectors or organisations fail to agree on specific actions to achieve the commitments or, having so agreed, fail to deliver on them, they should not expect the verification process to decide that pay increases are warranted.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">Central to the process are the performance verification groups or PVGs. These comprise an equal number of management, trade union and independent members, together with an independent chairperson. The PVG will assess progress not just at sectoral level but also at organisational and grade levels. In addition to making an assessment of progress, at the latest one month in advance of each of the five payment dates specified in the agreement, the PVG will maintain close contact with each of the organisations under its remit throughout the reporting period.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">The local partnership committees will agree action plans and submit them to the PVG for approval. Once approved, these will be translated into an organisational action plan by the head of the organisation for implementation. These heads  of organisations will prepare progress reports on implementing the plans for the partnership committees and these in turn will be submitted to the appropriate Secretary General responsible for that sector. In turn, the Secretary General will submit a report to the PVG along with his or her assessment of progress. The PVG will then decide whether the progress achieved warrants payment. The final decision on whether to make payment then rests with the relevant Secretary General.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">In order to ensure transparency, it is my intention that the performance verification groups will become scheduled bodies under the Freedom of Information Act and I will make the necessary order to this effect shortly. In the meantime, all action plans and associated priorities in respect of Government Departments have been published on the Department of Finance's website.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">The benchmarking route that the Government has adopted to determine and manage public service pay has the potential to yield significant benefits since it should lead to industrial relations peace, accelerated improvements in the delivery of public services and provide a new and better framework for pay determination for the future rather than the old relativities-based system of the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">The Government believes that this is the best way forward and is prepared to deliver on the commitments it has made. The onus is on the public service and in particular the public service unions and their members to deliver on the other side of the bargain and to demonstrate that the choice we have made is the right one.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">For the benefit of those who may not have heard me this afternoon, I remind Deputies that in 2001 I introduced a statutory measure which facilitates those who do not wish to accept an increase in salary. In view of the Fine Gael motion, I am particularly pleased to draw party members' attention to section 9 of the Ministerial, Parliamentary and Judicial Offices and Oireachtas Members (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001, which amends the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act 1938. I look forward to the Fine Gael Members availing of this facility, which is clearly demanded by their attitude. They can be assured that all payments forfeited will be put to good use. I commend the amendment to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_763">The question of payments to public servants recommended by the benchmarking body has been the subject of adverse comments from the Opposition recently, particularly in the context of the increasing pressures on the public finances which no one denies. We would not serve the people well, nor would it say much for the spirit of partnership if, at the first sign of difficulties, we reneged on a deal we made in the  recent past. Part of the problem with this discussion is that the adverse comments have focused particularly on the costs of paying the award and are based on a fundamental misunderstanding that there are no real gains available from the process for the Government as an employer or the public as customers of the public services.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">It is important we set the record straight on that issue and make it clear that there are specific gains for the Government and the public in terms of service delivery. It is important that we continue to remind the Opposition of the role played by social partnership in our recent economic success. That role of social partnership cannot be overstated. The benefits in terms of low inflation, wage restraint, rising standards of living, low unemployment rates and record levels of economic growth are due, in the most part, to a process which started at the end of the 1980s in the first social partnership agreement in 1987, the Programme for National Recovery, and carried on through to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">The establishment of the public service benchmarking body to review the pay of public servants was a key feature of the PPF agreement. As has been outlined by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, both the Government and the public service trade unions accepted and agreed that there was a need to find an appropriate way of benchmarking public service pay to the market. That, it was hoped, would ensure that public service was in a position to attract and retain the staff needed to deliver the quantum and quality of services the public is entitled to expect.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">Employers and unions recognised that the traditional approach to pay reviews in the public service based on the analogues and relativities had given rise to serious difficulties in the past, some of which the Minister for Finance outlined. Agreements reached on a claim in regard to one grade automatically gave rise to similar claims from other related grades. There was a continuous domino effect in regard to these claims. An alternative approach was clearly required which would be grounded in a coherent and broadly-based comparison with jobs and pay rates across the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">The public service benchmarking body was established as a totally independent body, chaired by a High Court judge. The benchmarking exercise involved comparing public service pay and jobs with pay and jobs across the economy with a view to ensuring that the public service pay rates compared favourably with comparable employment in the private sector. The body arranged its own independent research programme and sought written and oral submissions from all parties. It was therefore free and independent of the Government and the trade unions.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">The body produced its report in June 2002 and recommended an average increase of 8.9% in public service pay costs. It recommended that implementation of its pay awards should be made  conditional upon agreements on the issues of adaptability, change, flexibility and modernisation. The body also recommended that an appropriate validation process be established to ensure that agreements on these issues are implemented in accordance with their terms and this too has been done.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">It was agreed, under the adjustment to the PPF in December 2000, that one quarter of the increases recommended by the public service benchmarking body should be paid with effect from 1 December 2001 and that was paid on ratification of the new public service agreement, Sustaining Progress. The balance of the increases recommended by the body will be paid under the new agreement on the following basis: 50% of the increases from 1 January 2004 and 25% from 1 June 2005. In addition to that, the public service pay agreement provides for a pay pause of six months to be followed by 3% from 1 January 2004, 2% from 1 July 2004 and 2% from 1 December 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">One of the central themes of Sustaining Progress is a commitment to the modernisation of the public service. As part of that commitment and as a condition of payment for benchmarking awards, a modernisation agenda has been agreed for the public service which contains real and significant improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of public service delivery. This agenda will deliver a public service which is quality, performance and results driven, which achieves value for money and which is focused on the needs of the customer. If and when it delivers that, it will be a huge gain for the public. It will deliver a public service which is accountable and which will respond flexibly and rapidly to change.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">The agenda is particularly strong on the needs of the customer. The parties to the agreement are committed to improving the level of customer service and accept that all public services should be designed and delivered based on the needs of the individual citizen, business or community. An immediate example of this is in the education sector, where the agreement is to hold parent-teacher meetings on a half-in, half-out of school time basis during the current school year, with provision to extend this agreed commitment in a way which provides flexible formal parent-teacher meetings at times convenient to parents and teachers and which minimises disruptions to students and their parents in time for the 2004-2005 school year. Discussions in that area will commence shortly. In addition, mid-term breaks and holiday periods at Christmas and Easter are now standardised across all schools, which will provide clear benefits to families where children are attending different schools. The arrangements for in-service training will also be reviewed to lessen the impact of such training for teachers on the operation of schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">In the third level sector significant modernisation commitments are agreed. In the institutes of technology sector students and staff will be surveyed at least once each academic year to provide  feedback on course delivery and provision. Flexible modes of delivery of courses will be introduced and modularised in semesterised forms. Performance management and development systems are introduced for all staff in institutes of technology, vocational education committees and the university sector. The Minister outlined earlier the changes in recruitment and promotion procedures within the Civil Service. The focus in the health service is on a stable industrial relations climate where all stakeholders are committed to a culture of co-operation, collaborative working and partnership in the management of the industrial relations climate.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">It is important in the context of this evening's motion to underline again the fact that there is a verification process. The money will not be paid on the basis of an agreement which will not be implemented. There is a verification of co-operation with flexibility and ongoing change. There must be satisfactory implementation of the agenda for modernisation in each of the sectors. There must be maintenance of stable industrial relations and an absence of industrial action in respect of any matters covered by the Sustaining Progress agreement. Performance verification groups have been established for each sector to ensure this is done. There is provision in the agreement for the non-payment of the award where conditions for payment have not been met.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">The Government is committed to the social partnership process and its obligations under Sustaining Progress. The Government will honour its commitments in relation to the payment of benchmarking awards but it will insist that the other parties to the agreement live up to their side of the bargain and deliver on the modernisation agenda. There are processes in place to ensure this happens.</p>

          <p eId="para_775">When I read the motion, I wondered who would be best pleased at it. For the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, it must constitute considerable moral support as he enters a budget which through his mismanagement of the boom years of the economy leaves very large gaps in the public finances. In tabling the motion tonight, is Fine Gael hitting the right target?</p>
          <p eId="para_776">The system of social partnership has made a significant contribution to economic growth and development in this country. The system was entered into freely by negotiation between the parties. Would Fine Gael find it acceptable if the trade unions unilaterally walked away from the social partnership process and welshed on an agreement? I wonder why it is recommending tonight that the Government should walk away from a freely negotiated agreement. I found the remarks by Deputy Kenny that the agreement constitutes the politics of appeasement very harsh language in the context of public servants, many of whom are very poorly paid.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">The focus in the media, understandably, is on the fact that Deputies' pay is now linked to that  of principal officers in the public service. Principal officers are by any standards very well paid, with high levels of security and good conditions, the kind of scenario we would wish for high productivity, high output and a good wage economy. We do not want a low wage economy. Public servants at the bottom of the ladder are very badly off. Some of them qualify for family income supplement and some find it increasingly difficult to buy a house.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">I do not know whether the Fine Gael motion is partly based on focus group analysis whereby, given the deterioration in the public finances, people are looking for sectors to blame and public servants – not doctors or nurses – as a general class of people constitute an easy target. Prior to the last election, Fine Gael, rather disastrously, tried niche politics in relation to suggestions in respect of Eircom and compensation for taxi drivers under deregulation. I do not know whether this motion is another form of niche marketing or perhaps owes more to recall of the historic Tallaght strategy and is a genuine effort to contribute to public debate. I wonder if Fine Gael is hitting the correct target in making public service workers the target of this politics of appeasement. I say that because the Government badly needs to be called to account for its disastrously inept management of the public finances.</p>

          <p eId="para_785">—who has left this country with an unbelievable bill for services in relation to the Department's management of the asylum-seeker process.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">There are details in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report of how extensions to certain elements of PRSI and benefits ended up costing not just €9 million a year, as estimated, but €113 million a year, and rising. There are the escalating costs of projects such as the Cork School of Music and the courthouse in Cork. Above all else, what we have in terms of the Government's manage ment of the economy is the development of a corrosive notion of unfairness. Nowhere is that unfairness which Fianna Fáil, led by the nose by the Progressive Democrats, has fostered more evident than in the disclosures today by the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to the tax system.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">The annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General sought to examine, as has been discussed on a number of occasions, the cost of tax breaks and tax incentives. He identified 91 such allowances. Of those 91 allowances, which cost the State tens of billions of tax revenue, just 48 have cost indications. Ten have an estimated cost and there is no estimate for 33 others. It is not known, therefore, what is the cost of tax breaks given to the horse breeding industry. We have no idea because the people involved are not obliged to proffer accounts until this time next year. We have no idea of the cost of relief for the seaside resorts scheme or for the scheme of repatriation of income from foreign trusts. The Comptroller and Auditor General commented on the 400 wealthiest taxpayers. He examined their returns in 1999-2000 and the value of tax breaks, or the cost to everyone else of tax foregone, was £70 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">I refer to our colleagues in Opposition and the debate on the creation of a fairer, more responsible society. There must be balance and it is not only a case of picking on the public servant and deciding he or she is the target while the wealthiest people get away with murder in terms of tax breaks. Nothing is said about this except by the Labour Party. Similarly, the party has primarily called the Government to account regarding the redress deal negotiated with the religious institutions in terms of how taxpayers could be saddled with such a costly deal that gives no sense of justice to the people who suffered so cruelly in these institutions over the past 50 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">I refer to comments by both Ministers. The process of public sector reform undertaken in recent years has gone seriously off the rails because of the ineptness of Government management. An important study was published recently, which examined public spending in Ireland. It highlighted that over recent years expenditure, particularly on health and education, has reached the European average as a percentage of GNP. I can understand why people feel angry about this, given the significant increases in spending in these areas with absolutely nothing to show for it. The reform process has been incredibly badly managed by the Government and senior public servants.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">A bewildering example was the so-called reform of the former Eastern Health Board, which became the Eastern Regional Health Authority. Where once there was one body, inefficient as it was, there is now four bodies, each with its own directors and boards. A plethora of middle managers and directors of services was appointed. A significant element of their jobs is to pass reports up and down the food chain such  that more of the time of managers in areas such as nursing is devoted to paperwork than patient care. If we are to have a serious debate on the benchmarking process, we should discuss the Government's management of public service reform.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelAhern" eId="spk_436">
          <from>Mr. M. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_791">Is that what the debate is about? It took the Deputy 16 minutes to mention benchmarking.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_437">
          <from>Ms Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_792">By any standards, the Government has a poorer service to show for the significant money it has spent. A number of issues understandably irritate the public. Public servants with a strong public service ethos know that a number of practices are outmoded and ridiculous, such as the non-facilitation of parent-teacher meetings at hours that are convenient to parents. Teachers are aware that in most families both parents work and in one parent families the parent must work hard to raise his or her children. The teacher unions should address the needs of parents and they should not stall the implementation of logical reforms that constitute a strong continuation of the tradition of public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">I refer to another example of bad public service and ministerial management. It became clear in recent years that there were not enough nurses to care for the expanding population. Both the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment embarked on a worldwide recruitment campaign to attract foreign nurses to work in the domestic health service. They travelled around the world at great cost. Nurses came to Ireland and were trained over the past year and a half at a significant cost to the Exchequer. However, because of the stop-go approach that constitutes current health service management, most of these nurses are being poached by the NHS in the UK, which can offer them longer contracts and work visas for their partners and spouses. There has been vast public expenditure on the recruitment of foreign personnel for the health service but they are being let go. Is that not the worst value for money? It highlights the total ineptness of the Government's management of the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">I can understand Fine Gael's frustration regarding where all the money is going. However, proposing the breakdown of the partnership process as the way to cure the ills in our public service is ill-considered and not sufficiently thought out.</p>

        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_438">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_795">The publication every three months by the Revenue Commissioners of a list of tax defaulters has been going on for a number  of years, so much so that it has become a regular feature of Irish life. However, the publication last Friday of another list of tax defaulters, mainly the holders of bogus non-resident offshore accounts, who have been caught red-handed and forced to pay more than €35 million in tax, interest and penalties to the Revenue Commissioners, is a stark reminder of the extent to which people have been evading their taxes. In addition, the statement from the Revenue Commissioners shows 586 unpublished statements totalling €102 million in respect of settlements other than bogus non-resident accounts.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">The sheer scale of the list is breathtaking, some 419 tax cheats spread over more than 40 pages of <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> These are people who would, no doubt, regard themselves as pillars of society, the great and the good of the community, yet they engaged in a systematic campaign over many years to defraud the Revenue and effectively rob compliant taxpayers.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">It must be stressed, time and time again, that tax evasion is not a victimless crime. Every pound unlawfully evaded by those on the list was an additional pound on the tax bill of compliant citizens. Every pound successfully evaded was a pound less for essential public services such as health and education. What is even worse is that this criminal evasion was going on at a time when compliant taxpayers and particularly PAYE workers were being asked to endure what was close to a penal rate of taxation in order to keep those essential services going.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">The DIRT inquiry, in which I am glad to have played a part, has brought in just short of €600 million for the Exchequer. Those whose names appeared in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> last Friday are people who refused to avail of the voluntary disclosure scheme announced in 2001 which would have allowed them to settle their tax liabilities without having their names made public. The fact that so many failed to avail of that scheme suggests that many of those involved in tax evasion calculated that there was a reasonable chance they would not be detected and the risk of public ignominy was worth taking.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">All of this suggests that there is still a culture of tax evasion in certain quarters in this country and that many people regard the prospect of exposure and the imposition of penalties as a risk worth taking in view of the huge sums of money involved in successful evasion. It emphasises the need for us as legislators to continue to close off loopholes that facilitate evasion and the need for the Revenue Commissioners to systematically pursue evasion. It is time that we grew up in this country and shunned the "cute hoorism" and greed of blatant tax evasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">Unfortunately, the evidence again suggests that equivocation on tax evasion is alive and well within the biggest party in the House. People have been quite rightly shocked and angered that a Member of this House should have been included in the list published on Friday last.  There are many questions for Deputy Collins that require immediate answers. Rather than going to ground in west Limerick he should avail of the opportunity to make a personal statement in the House. When did he open the bogus non-resident account? When was it closed? Did he have other bogus non-resident accounts? He should say whether he availed of the 1993 amnesty and, if not, why he did not do so, given that it was in itself an offence not to avail of the amnesty if his tax affairs were not in order. He should say why he did not avail of the voluntary disclosure scheme. Deputy Collins should also say if he is satisfied that he supplied all the relevant information to the Revenue Commissioners when he applied for a tax clearance certificate subsequent to the election. Finally, he should say, given what we now know, how he felt able to sign a statutory declaration solemnly and sincerely declaring that he was in compliance with the obligations imposed by the tax Acts.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">There are even more important questions for the Taoiseach to answer. On Friday last we heard him give a carefully constructed answer to a question, which was clearly designed to give the impression that he knew nothing of Deputy Collins's tax evasion. Yesterday, we heard a quite different answer, confirming that he knew for some months that the Deputy had tax issues with the Revenue and, last night, a further clarification from his spokesperson, confirming that he had known about the situation since June. Surely his responsibility as party leader and Taoiseach was to call in Deputy Collins and ask him to outline the exact nature of the issues he had with the Revenue Commissioners. Why was it that the internal party investigation was only announced after the issue became public, although the Taoiseach had known about it for some months?</p>
          <p eId="para_802">The Taoiseach's lack of action in this case mirrors his handling of the Denis Foley affair in early 2000. On that occasion the Taoiseach had known for a number of weeks that Deputy Foley had issues with the Revenue Commissioners but left him in the sensitive position of vice chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts. On that occasion too, the Taoiseach was only stirred into belated action when the matter became public.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">The only conclusion that can be drawn is that Fianna Fáil will act against tax cheats in its own ranks only when the matter becomes public. That has been the history with Ray Burke, Liam Lawlor, Beverly Cooper-Flynn, Denis Foley and, now, Michael Collins. When Fianna Fáil is no longer prepared to welcome those who have been identified as tax cheats into its own ranks and into its corporate tent at the Galway Races, then and only then will we be able to believe what the Taoiseach and other Ministers say about there being no tolerance of the culture of tax evasion within that party.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
          <p eId="para_804">I apologise to Deputy Rabbitte  and the House for Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, who is unable to be with us this evening to respond to the debate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_440">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_805">It is the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, we need.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_441" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_806">As the Minister for Finance made clear in replies to parliamentary questions earlier today, the Government is fully committed to ensuring that measures are in place to improve tax compliance generally. In essence the approach has been twofold, namely, enhancing the powers generally available to the Revenue Commissioners in order for it to identify and deal with those who seek to evade taxes, and improving internal structures in Revenue to ensure that the organisation maintains an effective and efficient profile in countering tax evasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">The Revenue Commissioners has at its disposal a significant body of enhanced audit and investigative powers, much of which was provided during the term of office of the current Minister for Finance. He has also provided them with more than 400 additional staff in the past two years, most of whom have been deployed in the audit and compliance areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">On powers, probably the most important changes in recent years have been the substantial additional powers granted to Revenue in the context of the Finance Act 1999. These include facilitating direct access to material held by or in financial institutions; allowing access to the account of a named individual by way of an order issued by one of the three Revenue Commissioners where previously High Court approval was required; broadening the existing powers to get financial accounts of named individuals and providing this to a group or class of unidentified persons; empowering Revenue to apply to the courts for search warrants and to gain evidence of accounts for the purpose of criminal investigations; permitting Revenue to conduct on-site audits of a bank's affairs, not just a PAYE or VAT audit as had been the case up to then; enabling Revenue to obtain a greater range of information from third parties. These powers have facilitated the Revenue Commissioners in conducting successful investigations into Ansbacher, Clerical Medical International and NIB schemes and the identification of bogus non-resident account holders.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">The last mentioned group featured prominently in the list of tax defaulters published on 26 September. The size of the list shows the work undertaken in tackling such evasion. These powers were also successful in leading to the look-back audits which Revenue undertook in the financial institutions. All of these investigations have resulted in payments of €670 million to Revenue to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">Apart from the specific 1999 powers, the Minister for Finance has availed of the opportunity of annual Finance Acts to improve Revenue powers where necessary. In March this year, the Minister  for Finance established a high level group to examine Revenue powers and to make recommendations by the end of October for any changes needed. In announcing the establishment of the group, the Minister stated that there was an ongoing need to take regular stock of the remit of Revenue powers in order to assure the Government and the public at large that these are meeting the needs of the system and are being used fully as the Oireachtas intended. It is expected that the group's report will be forwarded to the Minister by the end of October.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">I would point out to Deputies that the Revenue Commissioners' Statement of Strategy 2003-2005 contains a strong emphasis on maximising compliance and the Revenue has recently advanced a number of key developments on restructuring with a view to improving tax compliance and tackling tax evasion. They include the establishment of an investigations and prosecutions division to deal with the prosecution of persons involved in serious tax evasion, a large cases division with specific focus on large companies and wealthy individuals, a computerised risk-based selection system, a new code of practice for Revenue auditors and increased resources for audit programmes. There will be a more integrated approach to case monitoring and more flexibility. Resources will be focused on non-compliance in all its formats.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">The Revenue Commissioners considers that this restructuring and the integration of the various revenue services will facilitate the delivery of a sharp, uncompromising response to evasion and default, while providing a high quality service to the compliant taxpayer. The Government will continue to support this effort to counter tax evasion. Like those who had the opportunity to do so, we have backed this up with legislation and by providing extra resources for those doing the job.</p>

          <p eId="para_815">I am disappointed that neither the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, nor the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, is present tonight for this debate. I would like to offer my sympathies to the people of north Mayo, particularly the people of Glengad, Dooncarton, Barnacullen and Pollathomas, who suffered a terrible tragedy earlier this month.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">I would like to stress to the House and the people of Ireland that this was a terrible tragedy for many families and for the local community. I was disappointed that I needed to call on a Minister to visit the site of the accident. The landslide  took place on a Friday night, but the Government was not represented at the scene until the following Tuesday, following my appeal the previous day. Members will recall a famous photograph that was published after there was some flooding in Dublin last year. I do not refer to the photograph of the Minister, Deputy McDowell, climbing a pole but to the photograph of the Taoiseach wearing wellingtons and a long coat. He had a sad face for the people of Dublin.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelRing" eId="spk_446">
          <from>Mr. Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_818">I was disappointed that neither the Taoiseach nor any other Minister came to meet the people of north Mayo before the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, decided to do so. I am disappointed that such disrespect was shown to the people who suffered. This was not just a national tragedy, but an international tragedy. Many families had to leave their homes as a result of this very serious incident and some of them have not yet returned. I was glad to be able to call out the public services on the Friday night and to be present at the scene on the Saturday.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">Before I talk about the tragedy itself, I would like to thank Mayo County Council, the ESB, the Garda Síochána, the Civil Defence, the coast guards and any other voluntary organisations I have omitted for their commitment and bravery. I would like in particular to thank Michael J. Carolan, a local man who, with his young daughter, placed his car in the middle of the road that night to flash down other motorists. He saved them from drowning. Given the amount of water that flowed down the mountain and the amount of damage that was done, including the collapse of bridges and roads, it is amazing there were no fatalities. I am delighted nobody died. I compliment Mr. Carolan and all those involved in the voluntary services. I thank RTE and Marian Finucane, who broadcast her radio programme from the area today. Very little national coverage was given to the landslide. The traffic in Dublin was held up for a few hours last year when there was a bit of snow there, and this was mentioned on every news programme for the following three or four days.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">This terrible tragedy affected many families. I would like to mention what I saw on Saturday, 20 September. Headstones were carried into a river. People never thought that their loved ones' graves would be washed away by a terrible flood. It was sad to see people crying because they had to leave their homes. It was sad to see so many people disturbed by this terrible storm. The people of north Mayo have received a great deal of sympathy from others throughout the country, but the time for sympathy has passed and other things are needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">I am disappointed no senior Minister is present to respond to my comments. The absence of such a Minister shows what the Government thinks  about north Mayo and rural Ireland. If this landslide had taken place in Dublin, Ministers would be crawling out of every corner with money in their pockets and they would hand it out the next day. This tragedy does not seem to matter, however, because it took place in rural Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">I would like a package of compensation to be put in place for those who lost their homes and their stock. Those who had to leave their homes should also be compensated. I would like the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to make funding available to repair the limited amount of infrastructure, such as roads and bridges, in the area. I would like national and European funding to be made available immediately. The time for sympathy is over and action is needed. I call on the Government to announce tonight, in the Minister of State's response, that a package will be put in place for the time being – we can come back later to get what we really need.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">Money is needed to help the people affected by this landslide. Some people will not be able to return to their homes. This will mean that they will no longer be able to live in the area in which they were born and reared. Some of the damage that was done cannot be repaired, but some compensation should be offered to those who have lost stock, land and their homes. All parts of the country should be treated equally. I am delighted people in Dublin received their rightful compensation when they suffered a tragedy, and the people of the west deserve equal treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">I would love to see the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Taoiseach, for example, in County Mayo, even at this late stage. They could fly from Dublin in a helicopter tomorrow to see the damage for themselves. Perhaps the Minister, Deputy McDowell, will fight for us at the Cabinet table, as the rest of the Government has let us down.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">I hope we will hear positive and good news tonight. I compliment and thank the voluntary organisations and the county council for the excellent services they provided. I assure the people of north Mayo that I will keep fighting for them in this House each week until a proper package is put in place.</p>

        <speech by="#JerryCowleyIND" eId="spk_447">
          <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
          <p eId="para_826">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this very important matter. Tá áthas orm a bheith anseo inniu, mar tá sé an-tábhachtach go mbeidh rud éigin práinneach déanta ar son mhuintir Mhaigh Eo. This is an extremely important issue. It is amazing that this incident took place in north-east Mayo, which has been shown to be the poorest socio-economic area in Ireland. Professor Séamus Caulfield has spelled out in his studies that nobody will be living in the area by the end of the century if present trends continue. Successive Governments over the years have contributed to a lack of balanced regional development. The area has been bleeding for many years and it seems that it has now been mortally wounded. The Government should do  something about it, but it has not responded so far.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">I am speaking in this debate tonight on behalf of the people of County Mayo who elected me, particularly the people of the area in which the landslide took place. The effects of the landslide can be seen on television, but it is said that "seeing is believing" and one cannot appreciate how bad the damage is if one does not see it with one's own eyes. I echo Deputy Ring's call for Ministers to see it for themselves. The wonderful spirit of the people of the region shone through when this terrible disaster took place. People from all parts of the county helped out. Some people tried to locate the remains of their relatives, which had been buried under mounds of debris. The fact that the remains of almost half a dozen people were washed out to sea, never to be found again, is terrible.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">I have to say that the local services were magnificent. I have often castigated Mayo County Council's planning decisions and its bureaucratic approach, but it proved that it could deliver the goods for the people of the area when this crisis presented itself. The local authority, from management level to the truly magnificent outdoor staff, was not found wanting. I commend the actions of the ESB, the Civil Defence and coastal rescue workers, all of whom helped the people and were magnificent. Such organisations have limited funds, however.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">A proper fund is needed to address the effects of the landslide. I saw 20-foot gorges that were gouged from the side of a field and a tractor that was flipped like a coin down a field. This was in an area where a house had been demolished by a 20 foot torrent coming down the mountain and washing everything before it. It was fortunate that this disaster occurred at night because if it had happened during the day many people would have been lost.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">I saw at least 20 areas where the whole mountainside had dropped to sea level. I could see soil washed miles out to sea. The land is no more and the people who treasured it and depended on it need compensation, not only from the local authority but also from central Government. The Government and the Red Cross must help the people of north Mayo as the people of Dublin were helped. This disaster was the biggest ever in Ireland. Other EU countries were compensated for disasters and the people affected by this are no less worthy of compensation.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">The graveyard resembled a scene from a horror film. One saw tombstones tossed, graves gone and people frantically searching for their loves ones. I saw a woman sitting outside her house and crying because of the shock she had received, for the land that was no more, for her frightened children, for the future, for a chance to stay in an area which she knew could be no more, for the fact that she would have to leave her house because the area is devastated and there is no future there. What help will that woman get? She got help from the local authority and from the  emergency services but, as with a bereavement, everyone will go away and she will be left to cope with her loss. The loss is truly astronomical but it is not recognised.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">That woman needs counselling, as do her family and many others. Where is the counselling for these people? These are a displaced people in an area that is already wounded. I have spoken on many occasions in this House about north west Mayo, which Séamus Caulfield has described as the most socio-economically depressed area of Ireland. My call for a special tax incentive scheme for that area fell on deaf ears. I hope my appeal tonight for proper compensation for this area does not also fall on deaf ears.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">I call for a multi-million euro effort. It has been estimated that the public damage amounts to €3 million and the private damage to €7 million. This area has been neglected over the years. Let it be neglected no more or there will not be a sinner left in it.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_834">I join the Deputies in expressing sympathy on my own behalf and on behalf of the Government to everyone affected by the recent landslides in County Mayo. This has been a very traumatic time for everyone involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">Following a torrential downpour on Friday night, 19 September, a large amount of land slid down the side of the mountains in the Glengad, Pollathomas and Barnacullen areas of north Mayo, causing serious damage to roads, bridges, water and power supplies and the local cemetery. The damage was caused, essentially, by a flood of liquified peat. A considerable number of houses were at risk and one suffered serious damage with a number of others suffering lesser damage. One bridge was washed away and serious damage was done to a number of other bridges and to road surfaces.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">I wish to record my appreciation of the immediate and professional response of the emergency services and staff of Mayo County Council, and of the many volunteers who assisted, without which the suffering endured would have been even greater. I would like to have visited the area that weekend but unfortunately, for personal reasons, that was not possible. However, I made contact with a number of people I know in the area from my days as an MEP when I represented County Mayo and I was kept fully informed by my party colleagues, Deputies Carty and Cooper-Flynn. In addition, after his visit to the area, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, made a presentation to Government and the Government is fully aware of the serious situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">My Department has received a detailed report from a senior departmental official who visited the area on the extent and nature of the damage to roads and bridges. I understand Mayo County Council has engaged consultant geologists to assess the risk of futher landslips and to advise on precautionary and remedial action. Some interim  repairs of infrastructure have already been put in place by Mayo County Council and the ESB.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">In such incidents human suffering is, of course, the first consideration. I am well aware of the serious effect of the landslide and the threat of further damage has had on the housing conditions of the people involved. Some of those forced to move from their homes will be in a position to stay with friends or relatives but there will, no doubt, be a certain number for whom this course of action is not an option. I am glad to say that Mayo County Council has already housed 16 families in emergency accommodation under homeless legislation – mainly in local bed and breakfast accommodation – and will continue to do so in the short-term until the families can either move back home or provide themselves with more suitable longer-term housing. My Department will recoup to the council 90% of the cost of providing the emergency accommodation. I can assure Deputies that the traumatic effects of the landslide on the people involved need not be exacerbated by the threat of homelessness. The health board community welfare officers will assist affected households by making urgent needs payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">The damage caused to roads and bridges was considerable. The council has submitted a preliminary breakdown of the estimated cost of repairing the damage to roads, bridges and water mains and my Department is examining ways and means of providing resources to assist with these costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">As the area affected by the landslide is in a CLÁR area it should also be possible to secure CLÁR funding. It is envisaged that any consideration of an assistance package will be carried out jointly by the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">We intend, therefore, that the more permanent reinstatement of infrastructures will be addressed under the non-national roads programme adminstered by my Department and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, on the basis of detailed assessments and of the developing situation. The scope and nature of the assistance required will be determined in this context.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">There have been suggestions that the Government should apply for EU disaster relief funding. However, assistance under the EU Solidarity Fund is only available in the case of a major disaster.</p>

I fully appreciate the seriousness of what happened in north Mayo on 19 September. The Government has been fully informed by my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, and the other Deputies who have visited the area.

        <heading>Planning Legislation.</heading>
        <speech by="#SeamusKirk" eId="spk_451">
          <from>Mr. Kirk</from>
          <p eId="para_846">The planning issues to be addressed by public representatives vary, depending on the part of the country one lives in. My constituency is on the east coast and there has been significant commercial, residential and industrial development in the area. A significant industrial development was granted planning permission by the local authority. That planning permission was appealed to An Bord Pleanála which gave a positive decision and the matter is now in the courts. I am concerned, having regard to the status of An Bord Pleanála in the normal planning process, that its decisions can be appealed to the courts and languish therein for a long period without a definitive position being established.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">I am sure this instance is not an isolated one and it may well apply in other parts of the country. It has profound implications for industrial development. The reality is that investors will not wait indefinitely for positive planning decisions in the process. It could be argued that the current planning process, involving the local authority and subsequent appeals to An Bord Pleanála, is lengthy in itself. However, when cases are appealed to the courts subsequently it prolongs the decision period even further. Investors, who will not wait around, will consider investment opportunities elsewhere within the EU. We now have a global market and a smaller world and the mobility associated with investment nowadays will mean that investors will simply move to other destinations.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">This issue revolves around the common good. To me, this is the creation of worthwhile jobs in areas that may, in normal circumstances, find it difficult to attract suitable industry. I fully appreciate that from a legal point of view there is no ready-made solution to the problem. I would be glad to hear the views of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who is here to respond.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_452">
          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_849">I thank Deputy Kirk for raising this issue. Legislation on planning is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minster for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. As the Deputy will appreciate, I cannot comment on planning matters and must, of necessity, confine  my comments to the court's response to the issues raised by the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">Generally, recourse to the courts in planning cases would normally arise at the end of what is usually a lengthy administrative process and any additional delay which might arise regarding adjudication by the courts would have to be viewed in this light. It would be undesirable and probably impossible to limit access to the courts in such matters. It is certainly not an approach which I support. I am certainly prepared to look at the issue of unnecessary delay if there is delay in processing such cases in the courts but in this matter I do not believe that there is evidence of such.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">The courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and therefore it is not open to me to comment or intervene in any way regarding how a particular case was conducted or the outcome of any such proceedings. These are matters entirely appropriate for the presiding judge and it would be inappropriate for me, as Minister, to comment or intervene in such matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">An appeal based on good grounds of a decision of a planning authority should normally be the end of the planning process. Court intervention should only be sought where there is a manifest error in the procedure that has taken place. The courts do not decide planning matters and the merits of planning decisions are not normally matters for the courts. People who believe that they can, by invoking the courts' jurisdiction, throw logs across the road of others' entitlements to develop their land should remember that they are invoking the jurisdiction of the court not on the merits of their case but purely on grounds of judicial review, which would be confined in large measure to procedural error, bias or wholly unreasonable decisions. I say this because some feel that when they are finished with the application they have opposed and the appeals procedure in which they have been unsuccessful, the next step is simply to go to the courts. The courts must be conscious that this is not a third level of appeal but that it exists purely to correct manifest error in the way in which the first two rounds of the administrative decision were made.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">It should also be said that the courts do not intervene lightly – I hope not – and should not do so in any circumstance in which damages would be an adequate remedy by way of injunction or restraining order.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">Those who invoke the jurisdiction of the courts, as of course, to object to everything with which they disagree at a primary and appellate level in the planning process should remember that they do so at their own expense and risk. I presume that in most of these cases – maybe I am wrong – undertakings as to damage suffered or likely to be suffered by the person affected by an injunction or undertakings to pay the damage occasioned by an injunction being wrongfully given are usually sought from the person who is looking for an injunction.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">Under the Courts Service Act 1998, the Courts Service, which is responsible for the day-to-day management of the courts, is independent in the performance of its functions. As Minister, I am responsible for ensuring that the service is adequately funded and, in this respect, €92.179 million was provided to it in 2003. This represents a 5.6% increase on 2002. The funding provided allows the Courts Service to progress the implementation of its strategic plans and policies specifically in the areas of information technology and capital building programmes. I am confident that the level of funding provided for the Courts Service is adequate to maintain existing levels of service and to implement the strategic plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">The strategic plan is designed in such a way that the courts can provide an efficient, speedy and user-friendly service for people seeking a legal remedy. The service places particular emphasis on the implementation of an IT strategy to meet the operational requirements of all offices and facilitate the provision of a high quality service for all who use the courts. The service actively assists the Judiciary in respect of all initiatives undertaken by it in relation to judicial case management. The implementation of judicial practice directions aimed at reducing waiting times in the non-jury-judicial review list in the High Court, which enables parties who are ready and willing to go to trial to obtain a speedy hearing, is a good example.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">Deputy Kirk will appreciate that the allocation of the business of the High Court is a matter for the President of the High Court. With regard to the particular concerns raised by the Deputy, I understand that the president last year assigned two judges with particular expertise in the area to deal with judicial review applications relating to planning and environmental matters, with particular regard to infrastructural projects. This was done with a view to according such cases the facility of an early hearing.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">As soon as the parties are ready to proceed the matter is given a date for hearing within a matter of weeks rather than months. I know there have been occasions on which parties turned up for a hearing although no judge was available. Normally, the delay in getting cases ready for hearing is largely a matter for the parties themselves. The solution to this is to apply rigorous case management to such cases, which would be a matter for the presiding judge. It is open to the trial judge to direct the timescale within which steps should be taken. The court has an effective remedy where the applicant is in default as the matter can be struck out for want of prosecution. However, where the delay is on the part of the respondent, usually a State or semi-State body, there is no effective remedy available to the judge if the timescales are not adhered to.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">On delays in court proceedings generally, section 46 of the Courts and Court Officers Act 2002 provides for a register of reserved judgments. The appropriate commencement date for that section is now under consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">As regards judicial resources, seven additional judges were appointed under the provisions of the Courts and Court Officers Act 2002 – two High Court judges, three Circuit Court judges and two District Court judges. Furthermore, at its meeting today the Government decided to introduce legislation to provide for two additional judges of the High Court. The provision of these additional resources is assisting the objective of reducing delays generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">With regard to a possible change of the jurisdiction of the courts, a high level working group on court jurisdiction was established last year by the Courts Service Board. This group is undertaking its task in modules. The first was criminal justice, which reported earlier this year. The group is now proceeding to examine civil jurisdiction and will, I have no doubt, as part of its work consider the issue of the desirability of a divisional structure for the High Court. That may be of relevance to the issues raised by the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">I have great sympathy for Deputy Kirk and the points he has raised. I also have great sympathy for anybody who feels, rightly or wrongly – I cannot comment on any particular case – that the courts jurisdiction is being invoked to effectively throw logs across the road when all the other procedures have been completed. However, remedies are available. The first is the vigilance of the Judiciary to stop the abuse of the system  by those who effectively use the courts as an appellant structure where an appeal is no longer available. Second, undertaking as to damages where injunctions are given pending the outcome of the case should be seriously looked at in cases where people are suspected of availing of the courts procedures simply on an obstructionist basis. Third, those who go to court in circumstances where somebody else will suffer severe damage if the matter is delayed at great length or if an injunction is wrongly given, must face the consequences that this is not a free service, freely available without cost, that there will be costs to be paid by unsuccessful parties and that parties who cannot measure up to the bar or be able to fund the damage they may cause by unnecessary litigation will have serious consequences exacted from them in the event of them failing to press home their case.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">I have great sympathy for the points raised by the Deputy. I cannot comment on any individual case, but the resources are available, as are the processes to reform civil procedure. However, even as things stand, there is every case for vigilance to ensure that having exhausted all the planning remedies, people do not simply resort to the courts as another stage in obstructing others from getting on with the business of developing this country for the good of all.</p>

          <p eId="para_869">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, based on the 2002 annual returns furnished by all qualifying savings managers, the total number of active accounts at 31 December 2002 was 1,143,418 and the average monthly subscription at that date was €158. They have also advised that the total number of special savings incentive accounts, SSIAs, that were closed since the commencement of the scheme on 1 May 2001 to 31 December 2002 was 39,557.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">It is not possible to give a definitive answer as to the eventual cost of the scheme as it is subject to a number of variables such as where participants die, withdraw from the scheme or vary their monthly contributions. If the current average monthly payment based on subscriptions to the scheme to 31 July 2003 continues for the full year, the annual cost in 2003 would be approximately €530 million. This, however, is not a conclusive figure, and the final figure may be different than that, if account holders change their monthly contributions.</p>

          <p eId="para_873">The Revenue Commissioners have at their disposal a significant body of enhanced audit and investigative powers, much of which was provided during my term of office as Minister for Finance.

          <p eId="para_874">The commissioners' Statement of Strategy 2003-2005 contains a very strong emphasis on maximising compliance and they inform me that they have recently advanced a number of key developments which will have a significant impact on tax compliance.

          <p eId="para_875">Revenue is undergoing a fundamental restructuring with a view to increased efficiencies in managing the tax system and it has informed me that this restructuring and integration will facilitate the delivery of a sharp, uncompromising response to evasion and default while providing high quality services to the compliant.

          <p eId="para_887">Tax relief for the film industry was first introduced in 1984 under the BES scheme and has continued in various forms for the past 19 years. This makes it one of the longest running sector specific tax reliefs in the economy and has seen an Exchequer contribution in terms of tax foregone of the order of some €265million in the last ten years alone. It should be noted that this relief has continued over time against a backdrop of the widening of the tax base and the reduction of rates generally. In Budget 2003, I referred to the generally accepted principle that such reliefs narrow the tax base and that a widened tax base is the price that must be paid to retain the current low tax rates. Consequently, all tax reliefs must be subject to ongoing review. In that context I announced in the budget that a number of these reliefs across a range of sectors including film relief would not be extended beyond 31 December 2004.</p>

          <p eId="para_892">I propose to take Questions Nos. 149, 167, 173 and 192 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">The National Pensions Reserve Fund is managed by commissioners who are independent of Government. They control and manage the fund with discretionary authority to determine and implement an investment strategy for the fund. This investment strategy is based on a commercial investment mandate with the objective of securing the optimal return over the long-term, having regard to (a) the purpose of the fund as set out in section 18(1) of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act, 2000, and (b) the payment requirements of the fund as provided for under section 20 of the Act, provided the level of risk to the moneys held or invested is acceptable to the commission.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_16">These features of the Act are similar to the trustee arrangements which exist in private pension funds. Along with the statutory prohibition on draw-downs from the fund prior to 2025, they insulate the fund from day to day pressures on Government and enable the commission to take a long-term view. This is essential if the purpose for which the fund was established, to meet as  much as possible of the cost to the Exchequer of pension payments from the year 2025 until at least the year 2055, is to be achieved.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_17">However, I would point out that under the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act, the chairperson of the commission is required to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts at that committee's request. Furthermore, the commission's annual report must be laid before each house of the Oireachtas and is required to include a detailed list of the fund's assets at year end. These requirements are designed to ensure that detailed information concerning the fund is made available to the public at the appropriate time. The commission's report for 2002 was launched on 23 July 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_18">The commission is specifically required to include in the report information on the investment strategy followed, a report on the investment return achieved by the fund and a valuation of the net assets of the fund at year end. These requirements are designed to ensure that detailed information concerning the fund is made available to the public at the appropriate time.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_19">The provisional market value of the fund at 18 July 2003, the latest date for which figures have been published by the commission, was €8,392 million. This represented a return for the year to that point of 5.2% and a reduction in the loss of capital to the fund from €737 million at end 2002 to €323 million. This capital loss is a net figure which takes account of investment income in both the temporary holding fund and the fund itself, and also of gains in the bond portion of the fund offset by declines in the value of equities.</summary>

          <p eId="para_897">The case of the defaulting stockbroking firm to which the Deputy refers has given rise to a number of applications to the High Court by the receiver. In a judgment of 6 May 2003, the High Court gave a ruling which covered, inter alia, the entitlement to ownership of shares recorded in the books of the firm or in nominee accounts.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">In a further judgment by the High Court on 31 July 2003, it addressed the issue of how to meet the fees, costs and expenses of the receiver in dealing with the distribution of client assets and the performance of his functions under the Stock Exchange Act, 1995, and the Investor Compensation Act, 1998, having regard to the fact that there were insufficient non-client assets to meet these costs. The High Court ruled that the receiver could access client assets to meet those costs, which could be in the order of €3 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">An order summarising the judgments issued by the High Court was perfected only recently on 9 September 2003. This order is long and complex, comprising almost 70 pages. Moreover, the 21 day period for appeal expires today and to the extent that parties avail of the appeal route, the outcome of such action will have to be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">In the circumstances, it is much too soon to arrive at definite conclusions on this complex issue. I have asked that the matter be looked into by officials from my Department, in conjunction with representatives of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland and of the Investor Compensation Company Limited. When their assessment of the situation is available, the question as to whether further legislation is required will be addressed.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_21">In the meantime, I would remind the Deputy that a scheme which meets the requirements of EU legislation to compensate investors for the failure of an investment or stockbroking firm already exists. That scheme, which is managed by the Investor Compensation Company Limited provides compensation for investors up to a  maximum of €20,000, or 90% of their compensatable loss, whichever is the lesser.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</from>
          <p eId="para_905">I propose to take Questions Nos. 153 and 171 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">I announced last December that there would be a reduction of 5,000 in authorised numbers in the public service over the next three years. I have made it clear on numerous occasions since then that I want to avoid or minimise the effect on front line staff providing a service to the public and to ensure that essential services to the public are not affected. I consulted with my ministerial colleagues on their contribution to the reduction in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_907">The Government approved my proposals on the timing and distribution of 4,300 of the 5,000 reduction last June. The breakdown by sector is as follows: health sector – a total reduction of 600; education sector – a total reduction of 1,000; Civil Service – also a reduction of 1,000; Garda Síochána – no reduction; Defence Forces – a reduction of 400; local authorities – a reduction of 1,000 and a reduction of 300 in the non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">I recognise that additional possibilities of achieving reductions in numbers may emerge at a later stage. Accordingly, I intend to revisit this issue early in 2004 to see where the balance of 700 posts can be identified.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_22">The implementation of the reduction in individual organisations is a matter for the management of the organisation. I consider that the  reduction is small enough to be manageable in the context of the substantial increases in public service numbers in the past few years. In keeping with the partnership approach to industrial relations in the public service, I would encourage dialogue with staff representatives on the implementation of the reduction in individual organisations. I should stress that the staff side was aware of the reduction at the time the Sustaining Progress agreement was reached and that there is no question of any increased payments to any staff on foot of the reduction.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_23">The Government had initially approved a reduction of 1,000 in Civil Service numbers. I subsequently decided that a further reduction of 49 posts should come from offices under the aegis of my Department. It has also been agreed that the reduction for the Department of the Environment and Local Government will be 72 rather than the 47 initially agreed.</summary>

      if his attention has been drawn to the criticism made by the Information Commissioner of the new charges for freedom of information applications and appeals, and particularly her concerns that the progressive nature of the charges could act as a financial disincentive to requesters exercising their right of appeal; if he intends to carry out a review of the charges in view of the commissioner's comments; the reason his Department did not consult with the office of the commissioner in advance of the new charges; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_977">I can assure the Deputy that I am aware of the views expressed by the Information Commissioner. However, I have no plans to initiate a review of the level of charges that have been introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">During the passage of the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003, I made clear my belief that the introduction of a new fee structure for FOI was overdue and that a better balance needed to be struck between the burden and cost of administering the FOI Act, which is unquestionably significant, and the need to allow people to continue to have access to information.</p>
          <p eId="para_979">I also made clear my belief that a sensible and balanced system of charges was needed to deter irresponsible use of the Act. While the majority of requesters make good use of FOI, the taxpayer and public bodies must be protected against the small minority who choose to use it in a frivolous or vexatious way. An increased charge for the later stages of an application and appeal is a well established procedure.</p>
          <p eId="para_980">The Information Commissioner is an independent office holder and is entitled to express her views. However, it is for the Government to determine policy and in the light of that policy to propose appropriate legislation to the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_981">The FOI Bill was thoroughly debated in the Oireachtas and passed into law in April this year. To the extent that there were outstanding issues to be decided in relation to fees, these related almost exclusively to the amounts to be set. As the Oireachtas had enacted legislation providing for such amounts to be determined by the Minister for Finance, the question of prior consultation with the Information Commissioner did not arise.</p>

          <p eId="para_983">I assume the Deputy is referring to the implementation of the NDP infrastructure programme via the Econ omic and Social Infrastructure Operational Programme, ESIOP, of the NDP. In the first three years of the programme – 2000-02 – significant physical and financial progress has been made in implementing the ESIOP and this is acknowledged in the recently published mid-term evaluation of the OP which is available on the NDP website <i>www.NDP.ie.</i> Expenditure under the programme during the first three years, at over €10 billion, has exceeded the financial projections by 6%, projects have been completed, are under way or in planning in key areas such as transport, environmental services and housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_984">I have previously acknowledged that the cost of completing the infrastructure elements of the NDP will be considerably greater than originally envisaged due to a variety of factors including construction industry inflation, higher land costs and initial underestimation. I also accept that the full targeted physical output will not be achieved by end 2006. Nonetheless, the plan will see a major enhancement of the economic and social infrastructure of the State by end 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_985">The Institute of Engineers and a variety of organisations and bodies have made submissions as part of the NDP mid-term evaluation process. The results of the individual OP evaluations will feed into a high level strategic evaluation of the NDP which is being conducted by a team led by the ESRI. When this evaluation is completed, the Government will consider its findings and give its response more generally to the mid-term review of the plan. This response will take account of the ESRI evaluation, the budgetary outlook and other relevant considerations, including Structural Fund allocations over the rest of the plan and the national spatial strategy.</p>

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_28">While I would have welcomed a decision by the Swedish electorate to support the question, I recognise that they have, in their non-binding referendum, decided by 56.1% to 41.8%, on a turnout of 81%, not to do so. The Swedish Government has indicated that it will abide by the outcome. The door to Swedish euro membership  has not been permanently closed and the possibility of later Swedish euro entry remains.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_29">As to any anticipated impact of the no vote, I note that the EU Commission, in a statement issued following the announcement of the outcome, said that it firmly believes the euro has brought and will continue to bring advantages to the euro area economy. The euro has provided much needed stability in the individual member states' economies and has created an appropriate springboard for the Lisbon agenda to make Europe the most competitive and socially cohesive area in the world. It has also contributed to international financial stability. The euro is the world's second most important currency but it is still a young currency. Its full impact has still to work its way through to the euro area economy and that is what we are in the process of achieving together. While I regret that the eurozone will not have the benefit of Sweden's participation and influence, I do not anticipate a major impact arising from Sweden's decision.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1009">Starting from an original staffing complement of nine, I approved two increases in staffing in February and July 2000, leading to a full complement of 19 staff, although this was not achieved until October 2001 because of delays in the selection and recruitment process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010">As a result of these extra staff and changes in work procedures, significant progress has been achieved in the completion of appeal cases in the last 20 months, and more particularly in the past eight months. For example, in the year 2002, the office completed 534 reviews, which represented an increase of 20% over the figure for the year 2001. The office has completed 417 cases in the first eight months of 2003 compared with a completion figure of 332 cases for the first eight months of 2002 which represents an increase in output of 25% between the periods.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011">There has, however, been a significant increase in review applications received in the first half of 2003. Applications are up 43% over the same period in 2002. Much of this increased volume can be accounted for by requests for records to the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Health and Children from former residents of industrial schools, special schools and other child care institutions. Decisions on these cases are being carefully monitored by the Departments concerned and their implications assessed. It is not clear, at this stage, whether the upsurge will persist.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_39">The Information Commissioner put new pro cedures in place last year in order that new cases are not delayed pending the clearing of an historical backlog of arrears. All review applications received since 1 April 2002 are now dealt with immediately in order that, to the greatest extent possible, they should be decided within the four month guideline provided for by the Freedom of Information Act.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_40">Cases received prior to 1 April 2002 will continue to be processed alongside the more current cases. At that time, the Commissioner envisaged that it may take two to three years to clear this backlog and the office is, so far, making good progress towards meeting this target. In light of this progress, I do not propose to provide extra resources at this time.</summary>

Because there has not been a significant flood event in the area during this period it will be necessary to extend the period of the trial. It is now expected that the report of the trial results will be available in May 2004.</p>

          <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</from>
          <p eId="para_1079">I propose to take Questions Nos. 164 and 195 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the matter to which the Deputy is referring is known as VAT carousel fraud. This involves the consignment of high value, low volume goods, typically computer processing units, CPUs, or mobile phones, through a chain of companies in two or more member states of the EU for the sole purpose of defrauding the Revenue authorities of the VAT payable on the goods in the country of eventual destination. The commissioners are well aware of this type of fraudulent activity and have been actively tackling it in collaboration with the Revenue authorities of the other member states concerned. To this end, the commissioners established a dedicated VAT carousel fraud unit some years ago, with the specific remit of addressing the issues and assisting other Revenue authorities under the mutual assistance directives and regulations. Since 2000, over 35 investigations have been carried out mainly in collaboration with the UK Customs and Excise but also with other Revenue authorities. The Criminal Assets Bureau has also been actively involved in some of these investigations.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_46">As a result of effective information exchange and concerted enforcement activity by the various Revenue authorities in the EU, it is believed that the bulk of this type of trade in CPUs between this country and the UK has all but ceased. Inquiries to date indicate there has been no significant loss of VAT to the Irish Exchequer as the fraudulent activity has been targeted at other jurisdictions. However, because some of the trade has passed through Ireland, Revenue has adopted a very proactive approach to combating the frauds elsewhere. This is evidenced by the fact that the VAT carousel unit has identified suspicious trading activity indicative of carousel fraud and spontaneously alerted the relevant Revenue authority under the mutual assistance directives and regulations. This has contributed significantly to the detection of fraudulent entities and individuals in other jurisdictions, particularly the UK. Successful prosecutions for VAT evasion have taken place abroad and a number of persons involved in organising this trade have been convicted and jailed. The commissioners have been actively supporting these prosecutions in other jurisdictions. Some of these cases have yet to come before the courts. In addition, the assets of persons associated with this fraud have been targeted and, in this jurisdiction, the Criminal Assets Bureau has successfully pursued cases  and frozen assets where such assets were located in this jurisdiction.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_47">In relation to the impact of this trade on the trade statistics, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have been in direct consultation with the Central Statistics Office since February of this year regarding the trade figures resulting from VAT carousel movements between the United Kingdom and Ireland. As a result the CSO has issued an interpretative note in its monthly publication for general guidance.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_48">The Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that the actions taken to date in close co-operation with the other Revenue and law enforcement authorities have been successful in significantly reducing the amount of this trans-national fraudulent activity. The commissioners have assured me their VAT carousel unit will keep the situation under constant review.</summary>

The Lisbon Process aims, among other things, to have the EU become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge based economy in the world by 2010; continued preparation of the acceding countries for membership. This will involve the integration of the acceding countries into the EU's economic policy co-ordination multilateral surveillance and Lisbon processes; developments in the Intergovernmental Conference that may continue into our Presidency and where issues relating to taxation, the euro, and economic governance may arise, and future financing of the EU in the period after the present Agenda 2000 agreement ends, i.e. from 2007 onwards, including future regional policy in the EU.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1094">The answer is "Yes". The National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, was established at the beginning of this year. Its role is to ensure that Departments, State authorities and agencies use the optimal form of financing in delivering public infrastructure projects. Key personnel have been recruited and they immediately commenced work on a thorough review of infrastructure projects. My Department issued guidelines to NDFA in March relating to investment priorities, currency composition, risk management, counterparty risk, guarantees and the use of financial consultants.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095">State authorities are now obliged to seek the advice of NDFA for individual projects and grouped projects costing in excess of €20 million. However, State authorities may seek advice on all projects. In order to ensure that the focus is on the priority infrastructure projects, five-year investment envelopes for Exchequer and PPP-NDFA funding are being put in place as part of this year's Estimates process now under way. All State authorities will verify to NDFA that any funding it is proposed to raise is consistent with their approved envelope.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096">Already the NDFA is making a crucial contribution to the financial evaluation and assessment of new projects being brought forward and I am satisfied that major benefits will follow in relation to better value for money and accelerated delivery of projects.</p>

Illegal street trading has not re-emerged to any significant degree since concerted enforcement action was taken by customs and the Garda following the introduction of tax stamps in 1995. Furthermore, the circumstances in which many of the seizures listed above were made, in addition to the brands of the cigarettes involved, would strongly indicate that a significant portion of the cigarettes seized in the State are intended for the UK market, where cigarette taxes are higher.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1155">At budget time last year GDP and GNP growth in 2003 were forecast to be 3.5% and 2.2%, respectively. These forecasts were revised to 1% for both GDP and GNP in the Economic Review and Outlook, which was published in August.</p>
          <p eId="para_1156">There were three major factors in the revision of the forecasts. The first is the budget day forecasts were predicated on a mid-2003 pick up in the international economy, which has been delayed. At this stage there are some signs that a recovery in the international economy may be developing, particularly in the US.</p>
          <p eId="para_1157">A second factor is that the budget day forecasts were based on preliminary data available for 2002. The CSO have since published their annual national income and expenditure accounts for 2002 which show that growth in 2002 was significantly lower in GNP terms than had been anticipated, 0.1% compared with the budget day forecast of 1.8%. This led to a revision of the base used to calculate the 2003 forecasts.</p>

While corrective measures were taken it seems likely that the Germany will again breach the 3% limit in 2003. In June 2003, the ECOFIN Council decided that there was an excessive deficit in France for the year 2002 and set a deadline of 3 October 2003 for France to take corrective action.

          <p eId="para_1169">Over the period 2001-2003 the Exchequer has received  funds from the Central Bank under three headings.</p>
          <p eId="para_1170">The first, and indeed normally by far the largest, is the regular transfer of the Central Bank's surplus income. Under the Central Bank Act 1989, the Central Bank is obliged to pay over to the Exchequer its annual profit less provisions in respect of superannuation, depreciation and a transfer to its reserves not exceeding 20% of its annual profit, usually paid in instalments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1171">In 2001 this amounted to €451,303,000, in 2002 to €530,639,000 and thus far in 2003 to €583,719,000. No further payments from this source are due this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1172">The second heading is accrued public moneys arising from the issue of coin. Section 137 of the Finance Act 2002 allows for the transfer to the Exchequer of income from the issue of coin. This represents the net proceeds earned by the Central Bank on its issuance of coin. The figure transferred to the Exchequer of €360 million in 2002 represented funds which had been accruing to the currency reserve of the Central Bank up to and including 2001, plus income earned in 2002. The 2003 figure to date is €29 million, and the projection for 2003 as a whole is €80 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1173">The third heading is proceeds from banknote receipts in the context of the euro changeover. The income arising from the issue of euro notes relates to the fact that the value of old Irish denominated notes redeemed in exchange for new euro notes was projected to fall short of the value of Irish notes outstanding. While the bank needed to be ready to redeem any additional notes which might be presented after the changeover to the euro, it was deemed reasonable to write off a portion of the still unredeemed notes on the basis that it is likely that most of them will never be redeemed having being destroyed, lost, etc. Of course, it was not the advent of the euro in itself that generated this surplus, but the changeover involved a process of taking in outstanding notes and issuing new ones so allowing the unredeemed old issue notes to be accounted for. By its nature this was an exceptional windfall to the Exchequer. It realised €240 million in 2002, but is not repeated in 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1174">As to anticipated receipts for 2004, I would refer the Deputy to the 2003 budget book table current receipts 2002 to 2005 which sets out the projected income to the Exchequer over this period. For 2004 it projects receipts under the Central Bank surplus income heading of €200 million and of a further €80 million arising from the issue of coin. These projections will be reviewed in the context of the 2004 budget.</p>

          <p eId="para_1187">As the Deputy will be aware, over the past number of years the Government has considered carefully the whole area of child care It has been decided as a matter of policy that child benefit will be the main instrument through which support will be provided to parents with children. One of the main benefits from this approach is that, whereas tax relief would be of little or no benefit to those with low or no incomes, the provision of support for parents through the child benefit route means equality of treatment for all recipients.</p>
          <p eId="para_1188">The 2001 increase of over 50% in child benefit rates marked the first step in a programme through which an additional €1.27 billion will be invested directly in child benefit. In budget 2002, I announced further increases in child benefit rates marking the second step and in budget 2003, I announced an additional €105 million in a full year to increase child benefit further. From April 2003, child benefit rates have been increased by €8 per month for first and second children to €125.60 and by €10 per month for third and subsequent children bringing the new rate to €157.30.</p>
          <p eId="para_1189">In addition, the Government has in place a package of other expenditure measures to support child care needs. The supply of formal child care places throughout Ireland is currently being stimulated through a programme of investment under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The equal opportunities programme is making capital grant assistance available with the aim of increasing the supply of quality child care places to address the child care needs of parents who wish to remain in or return to employment, education and training. The programme aims to increase by 50% the supply of child care places by end 2006. The total budget for the programme is €436.7 million and is funded by the Irish Government and the European Union. This funding and the recent increases in child benefit are a significant financial commitment and clearly show the Government's continuing support for the child care sector.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_79">While there is no specific tax relief available to parents in relation to the costs incurred for child  care I would point out that there is an exemption to the usual benefit-in-kind provisions for employees who enjoy free or subsidised child care facilities provided by their employers. The exemption applies whether the employer provides the facilities "in-house" or in a premises made available by the employer in another location. The exemption also applies if an employer provides child care facilities jointly with others for example, with other employers.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_80">Furthermore, capital allowances are available for expenditure incurred on child care facilities which meet the required standards for such facilities as provided in the Child Care Act 1991.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_81">Child care services are also generally exempt from VAT, so no VAT should be chargeable on fees levied by crèches.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_82">Finally, under the auspices of Sustaining Progress, the Government has committed itself to ensuringinter alia that the Department of Social and Family Affairs will review the contribution made by its income support system to people reconciling work and family life and prepare a national programme focusing on the development of family policy and supports to mark the 10th anniversary of the International Year of the Family.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1194">I propose to take Questions Nos. 193 and 196 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1195">I presume that Deputy Breen and Deputy Higgins are referring to tax expenditures and tax reliefs but not to those which are considered part of the structure of the tax system, such as the personal tax credits for income tax.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_87">Tax expenditures and tax reliefs are spread throughout the tax system and are found under all tax headings including income tax and corporation tax, the capital taxes and the indirect taxes. These are incentives within the tax code which are designed to meet a specific need within the  economy or society in general by encouraging and incentivising certain behaviours or reducing particular costs on the part of the tax paying public. They take a number of forms and have different and sometimes several objectives.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_88">As I said in budget 2003, I am a supporter of properly-focused, clearly-defined, specific reliefs which can encourage the development of goods and services, including public services, which might otherwise not be provided, or where provided, are too little or too late. However, as I also said, reliefs narrow the tax base. A widened tax base is the price that must be paid to keep tax rates low and all tax reliefs must therefore be subject to ongoing review. Accordingly, in the budget, I indicated that a range of reliefs would not be extended beyond their end-2004 termination date.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_89">There are difficulties in providing costs for some tax reliefs mainly due to the simplification of the tax returns process and the resulting aggregated nature of the information gathered. My Department is working closely with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to consider mechanisms to enhance the level of information captured in respect of tax reliefs in order to facilitate work on evaluation and review. In addressing this requirement, I am, of course, conscious of the need to balance the needs of the Exchequer with the desire to minimise as far as possible the administrative burden on taxpayers in general and on the business community.</summary>

This is essential in order to safeguard our competitiveness and prevent job losses.

      the steps he is taking to reduce the tax avoidance schemes, having regard to figures published showing that 51 of the top 400 earners paid tax of less than 5% in 2000 and 29 of them did not pay any tax at all; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</from>
          <p eId="para_1208">Since taking up office as Minister for Finance in 1997, I have acted swiftly on several occasions to control particular abuses of the tax legislation that serve to narrow the tax base. Indeed, the 2003 Finance Act contained a series of such anti-avoidance measures. I have also taken a succession of steps to reduce the opportunities for the kind of tax avoidance schemes to which the Deputy refers. These are particularly geared to reduce the opportunities for very high earners to pay relatively low effective rates of tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_1209">The figures referred to by the Deputy are extracted from a study carried out by the Revenue Commissioners in 2002 on the effective tax rates for high earning individuals based on the tax year 1999-2000. A similar study was undertaken in 1997.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_97">One of the conclusions drawn from the 1997 study was that the use of capital allowances on the expenditure on buildings in tax designated areas and on hotels was one of the main methods of reducing the tax bills of high earners to very low levels. I subsequently capped in December  1997 in my 1998 Budget the amount of annual capital allowances on such buildings that could be set-off against non-rental income and, in the case of hotels throughout most of the country, I abolished in total the capital allowances against non-rental income.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_98">In the case of the 2002 study by the Revenue Commissioners, which related to 1999-2000, it was noted that some individuals were still able to avail in 1999-2000 of the pre-1998 budget legislative provisions because of the normal transitional measures associated with the budget changes. The impact of these transitional measures has been declining in the intervening years and will eventually cease.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_99">In my last budget, I have also abolished capital allowances for investment in registered holiday homes and reduced capital allowances for hotels to the rate applying generally to industrial buildings. I have also indicated that a range of tax incentives will not be extended beyond their end-2004 termination date.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_100">In addition to these measures the Revenue Commissioners are also restructuring their efforts to focus more on maintaining and improving tax compliance. In this regard, a large cases division has been set up and a high wealth individuals business unit has recently been constituted in order to monitor and research behaviour patterns in relation to tax avoidance and evasion in this area.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1222">My Department requested all Secretaries General and other heads of offices to put in place the necessary measures to ensure that the civil service change and modernisation agenda set out in Sustaining Progress could be delivered. Secretaries General who are responsible for particular sectors of the public service were also requested to ensure both that the stakeholders and agencies within their sectors were fully informed of the terms of the agreement and that they would actively participate in pushing forward the change and modernisation agenda. Arrangements were also put in place by my Department to monitor developments in relation to the modernisation commitments in Sustaining Progress across the public service. In addition, the SMI implementation group of Secretaries General assumed and will continue to have an important role of overseeing and driving progress towards achieving these commitments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1223">In its report, the benchmarking body recommended that the implementation of the pay awards – apart from the first one quarter of any award – should be conditional on appropriate validation procedures verifying that sufficient progress was achieved in the implementation of the modernisation agenda. Sustaining Progress goes further in that it also links the payment of the general round increases in its pay provisions to the independent assessment of sufficient progress and also provides that such an assessment can be made in relation to each sector, organisation and grade across the public service.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_101">This verification or assessment process is being carried out for each of the sectors of the public service by separate sectoral performance verification groups, which will make an assessment of progress prior to the application of each pay element in the agreement. These groups include, as well as management and trade union representatives, independent members drawn from the private sector and customers of the relevant public sector. Assessments will be made in relation to action plans for each organisation derived from the commitments in the agreement which have been agreed by each performance verification group, as well as on an assessment of progress achieved in the relevant sector provided by the Secretary General responsible. The agreement also provides that each sectoral performance verification group will maintain close contact with each of the organisations under their remit throughout the reporting period, that is until June 2005. This will help ensure that action to  implement commitments will be consistent and effective.</summary>

In this connection, I announced, earlier this year, the establishment of a high level group, chaired by Mr. Justice Frank Murphy a former Supreme Court judge, to inquire into the statutory powers now available to Revenue. This review will touch  on issues such as the effectiveness of the powers, the balance between the need to secure the revenue of the State and the rights of the taxpayer, whether there is a need for further powers or streamlining of existing ones, comparable powers in other jurisdictions and other regulatory agencies in the State, and what review or appeal mechanisms should be applied.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1232">The rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, CPI, has moderated significantly over the course of this year due largely to the combined effect of mortgage interest rate cuts, favourable exchange rate developments and easing services sector inflation.

          <p eId="para_1236">There are already in place a number of tax incentives to support residential property purchases by first-time buyers. All owner-occupiers, including first-time buyers, are generally exempt from stamp duty on new houses where the property is 125 sq.m. or less. In addition, there is more favourable stamp treatment for first-time buyers of second-hand houses up to €381,000 as compared to other purchasers. First-time buyers in common with other owner-occupiers are also not subject to capital gains tax on the gain from the disposal of their main residence. First-time buyers also qualify for tax relief on mortgage interest payments and the Deputy will recall that in budget 2003, I increased the annual ceiling on mortgage interest payments by first-time buyers which qualify for relief from €3,175-€6,350, singlemarried or widowed, to €4,000-€8,000, single married or widowed. In addition, the period of time in which the higher amount of relief may be claimed was increased from five to seven years. First-time buyers who started to claim tax relief in respect of mortgage interest in the tax year 1998/99 or later stand to benefit from the new arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_1237">The housing market is a complex and dynamic one and demands continuous monitoring and adjustments to address changing circumstances. In view of the record increases in housing completions in recent years, I consider that the tax incentives available at present for the purchase of residential property represent the optimal mix and are adequately balanced in the light of the current state of the housing market. Any proposals to alter this position will be considered as part of the normal review of existing reliefs and examination of various proposals for changes raised in the context of the 2004 budget and Finance Bill cycle. In this context, I undertook in the Seanad debate on the Finance Bill 2003 to examine a proposal suggested to me whereby potential first-time buyers would receive tax credits in respect of savings made within a special scheme solely for the purchase of their first home.</p>

However, under the legislation, expenses incurred in respect of routine ophthalmic treatment are explicitly excluded from the relief. Routine ophthalmic treatment means sight testing and advice as to the use of spectacles or contact lenses and the provision and repairing of spectacles or contact lenses. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the inclusion of these items would cost an estimated €15 million per annum.</p>

An insured individual's entitlements under the optical benefit scheme include, a free spectacle sight test, a fixed contribution towards an eye examination for contact lenses, free glasses, if frames covered by the scheme are selected (or a fixed contribution towards the cost of glasses if  frames, other than the type covered, are selected), replacement lenses for existing frames and a contribution towards the cost of contact lenses.</summary>

While the current international climate has meant that we have not had the resources to implement some commitments as quickly as we may have wished, it is important to recognise that a programme for Government is an ordered series of priorities and the challenge in implementing it for us has always been to do it properly and for the long-term. That means making the right choices and ensuring our policies complement the sustainable growth of our economy into the future.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_112">The 100 year provision was adopted on the basis that very few of the persons recorded in a census would be alive 100 years after the event.  In this way, the seeming contradiction between the absolute guarantee of confidentiality given during the census and the subsequent public release could be represented as a reasonable proposition. Such an approach would be difficult, if not impossible, to sustain if the limit was reduced to 70 years since it is estimated that over 10% of the enumerated population, i.e. 330,000 would be still alive. As the guarantee of confidentiality is essential to the success of the census fieldwork, the director general of the Central Statistics Office has advised against any reduction in the time limit.

        <summary eId="sum_113">Over the course of the summer, and particularly over recent weeks, both Governments and the pro-Agreement parties have been working closely together to make the necessary progress to allow for the restoration of devolved government in Northern Ireland on a sustained basis. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Brian Cowen, and I met Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness of Sinn Féin on 4 September. I met a delegation from the SDLP led by Mark Durkan on 9 September; Prime Minister Blair at Chequers on 13 September, and David Trimble on 15 September. All parties are agreed on the need to redouble our efforts in the coming weeks to build on the groundwork that was done in March and April in order that we can make the necessary progress for elections that will result in a stable, working Executive. The good summer has had a settling effect on the situation generally since last May we have been proceeding with the implementation of the joint declaration in so far as we could and the independent monitoring  commission can play an important role in building confidence on all sides. Both Prime Minister Blair and I are determined to work jointly with the parties to get back to a position where we have the Executive and Assembly working effectively. The political parties, Nationalist and Unionist, are facing key challenges and I welcome the recent engagement between Sinn Féin and the Ulster Unionist Party which I hope will help those parties address the challenges facing them. Peace and a stable political environment are only possible on the basis of equality and inclusion. David Trimble recognises this and I commend his determination in the face of sustained opposition.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_114">Republicans have to fully embrace the reality that inclusive government is only sustainable on the basis of a democratic mandate alone and paramilitary activity must be put in the past. I believe that we must now make the necessary progress as quickly as possible.</summary>

It was agreed that the immediate key aim is to stabilise current employment at the facility. It was further agreed that Enterprise Ireland would investigate the possibility of utilising some of the unused portion of the site for further business and employment activities. I understand that the group met subsequently with the Tánaiste. I can assure the Deputy that the matter will continue to receive high level attention and commitment.</p>

In this regard, FÁS has confirmed that it will give every support and assistance to such projects in recruiting suitable participants for the positions in question thus ensuring ongoing service provision. Should FÁS encounter difficulties in replacing departing CE participants with suitable persons, the matter can be considered in the context of the 20% flexibility in relation to extending CE participation.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1651">My Department and its enterprise support agencies pay particular attention to the structure of the country's manufacturing base and how this is evolving in response to international market forces. The position of firms <i>vis-à-vis</i> the competitive appeal of other economies is continuously monitored, especially in the context of maintaining Ireland as an attractive and competitive location for investment. However, factors influencing a decision to  relocate all or part of a firm's manufacturing function are many, varied and complex. Many of these are outside the direct influence of government policy makers and may include business take-overs, consolidation and changes in product or market focus as well as relative wage rates and other costs and incentives. In a modern, entrepreneurial and open economy such as ours, manufacturing enterprise will always be influenced by competitive challenges and opportunities. The response by enterprise may well include the option of relocating operations to other economies. That is a fact of business life both in the context of an open Europe and in a global economy. On balance, Ireland gains more from the underlying movement of firms due to our competitive strengths and our attractions as an excellent European business location.</p>
          <p eId="para_1652">Nevertheless, I cannot be complacent about business problems, competitiveness challenges or the impact sluggish world economic growth has on firms and jobs in Ireland. A few weeks ago I set up a new enterprise strategy group under the chairmanship of Eoin O'Driscoll to recommend and prioritise new strategies and policies to ensure that the enterprise prosperity we enjoyed in the last decade will continue into the future. I have asked Eoin O'Driscoll's group to examine those issues that my Government colleagues and I must take into account to strengthen our enterprise environment, to promote a very different innovation and knowledge driven economy and to sustain those industries already providing employment here. I expect the group to complete its work within the next six to nine months.</p>

A decision on the future funding and structure of community employment and the job initiative scheme will be taken in the context of the Estimates provision for 2004, having regard to the outcome of the current review process, which is now nearing completion.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_295">An average participation rate in the region of 2,466 during 2003 and a year-end participation rate of 2,200 are targeted on job initiative schemes. Overall, there will be a reduction of 325 places on a phased basis this year. Participants exiting JI may avail of the high supports process which is designed to provide a flexible response for persons experiencing barriers in progressing from unemployment to employment in the open labour market and may also avail of the FÁS local employment services with a view to securing further training or employment.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_296">The average participation rate on the CE programme is expected to be in the region of 22,500 during 2003 with a projected year-end participation rate of 20,000. The allocation of places on a county-by-county basis and renewal of individual projects is a matter for FÁS. Projects are prioritised based on the services provided. Drugs task force activity and childcare service provision are ring-fenced from any reductions and projects in RAPID areas are given priority. CE places in the health sector which includes personal assistant services are being maintained at existing levels to ensure continuity of the delivery of these services.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_298">The number of CE projects has reduced from 2,274 in 1999 to 1,503 projects currently. In many cases projects have amalgamated into new entities allowing the activity to continue on a smaller scale. With regard to the current redundancy position, the level of notified redundancies last year was 25,348. This year to end August 2003, 17,590 redundancies have been notified to my Department, down by 0.5% on the same period last year. It is also worthwhile noting that the reduction in the level of places available on CE has taken place in a labour market environment where the number of long-term unemployed which are a key target group has reduced dramatically, from 103,300, 7.1%, in April 1996 down to 26,900, 1.4%, in April 2003.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1674">I am very much aware of the serious difficulties being experienced by small firms and other businesses due to the high cost of insurance. My Department does not have specific data concerning the number of small firms or businesses that have closed as a direct result of the increases in insurance premia. The insurance reform programme that I announced on 25 October last comprises a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. The key measures include the implementation of the recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board's action plan within a target time frame To date, 23 of the recommendations have been implemented and work is in progress on the implementation of those remaining. It is also planned to establish the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and in this regard the Government has approved the drafting of the general scheme of the Bill to place the PIAB on a statutory footing. It is hoped to enact the legislation before the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1675">My Department and the Competition Authority are undertaking a joint study into the insurance market. The study will identify and analyse barriers to entry and limitations on rivalry in the insurance marketplace. It is envisaged that the bulk of the work will be completed this year and that a report will be produced in the early part of 2004. I chair a ministerial committee established to drive the co-ordinated implementation of the reform programme across the relevant Government Departments and other bodies concerned. Substantial progress is being made on a range of other measures that will radically overhaul the functioning of the insurance market and help tackle the high cost of insurance. These include measures to reduce the number of accidents, to tackle fraudulent and exaggerated claims and streamline the law in relation to personal injury claims.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_300">While EU law prohibits the imposition of price control on insurance, I have made it clear that I consider there to be an onus on the insurance industry to ensure that the reforms to be taken will have the effect of significantly reducing the cost of premia to consumers and businesses. In this regard it is heartening to report that a number of insurers have announced reductions in motor insurance premia. As implementation of the reform continues, I expect this trend to continue.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1680">Financial and  other business enterprises engage in restructuring that can lead to out-sourcing or relocation of business functions including information technology. This is a standard feature of business activity and it impacts on many locations, including Ireland. In order to reduce the possibility of relocation, the State development agencies work with client companies to identify the measures required to ensure that they are successful. Companies must continually upgrade their operations and adapt in order to meet the changing economic environment in the marketplace. Where outsourcing entails a change of employer and constitutes a transfer of undertakings within the meaning of the European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003 (SI No. 131 of 2003), the rights and obligations of the original owner – the transferor – arising from an employment contract relationship existing at the date of the transfer shall, by reason of such transfer, be transferred to the new owner – the transferee.</p>
          <p eId="para_1681">In the particular case referred to in the Deputy's question, I understand that out-sourcing arrangements have been agreed by the parties concerned following their acceptance of proposals put forward by an independent mediator.</p>

          <p eId="para_1879">The insurance reform programme that I announced on 25 October last comprises a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. Initial indications are that the reform programme is having its desired effect. The Irish Insurance Federation has reported in September 2003 that there has been an average reduction of 11% in motor insurance charges in the year to date. More reductions are expected. Reductions are also expected in the costs of employers' liability and public liability insurance costs, which represent a significant burden for businesses. Reductions in insurance premia cannot be made by ministerial order. EU law prevents Governments or any other body from intervening in the underwriting policy of any insurance undertaking.</p>

          <p eId="para_1882">I propose to take Questions Nos. 246 and 250 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1883">The job initiative, JI, programme is a work experience programme for persons who have been unemployed for five years or longer. The fundamental objective of the programme is to prepare participants to progress into mainstream jobs. Funding of €45 million has been provided for the programme in 2003 which will provide for an average participation rate in the region of 2,466 and a year-end participation rate of 2,200. Overall, there will be a reduction of 325 places phased in during 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1884">Phase 1 and phase 2 participants of JI who are now on their fifth and sixth year, together with people referred to FÁS under the national employment action plan, are being targeted by the new high supports process which is being piloted in nine areas countrywide. The areas in question are Dublin, Cork, Letterkenny, Galway, Limerick, Dundalk, Sligo and Waterford. This new process is designed to provide a flexible response for persons experiencing barriers in progressing from unemployment to employment in the open labour market and will be based on the individual needs of clients with the support of a fund of up to a maximum of €2,200 per person. The high supports process aims to maximise progression into the open labour market of those being supported. Significant progress has been made in the implementation of the high supports process. Each region has put in place a multi-agency team with representatives from a range of organisations, including, where appropriate, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Department of Education and Science, health boards and FÁS. A budget has been allocated to each region based on the numbers identified in their area. Interaction is taking place with clients in all areas and referrals to appropriate services are being made on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1885">A number of participants on the JI programme, which was designed as a three-year programme, continue to have difficulty progressing from the programme to employment. A review of active labour market programmes is being undertaken by the standing committee on the labour market and in the context of this review, consideration is being given to addressing the needs of a small number of these participants who are unlikely to find employment, even with the new supports now being provided.</p>

          <p eId="para_1887">Funding support provided for the institutes of technology sector is primarily the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science and its agencies. While the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment does not have specific budgets to support research and development activity within the institutes of technology, funding is provided through a number of programmes. Up to €24 million is being made available via Enterprise Ireland over the duration of the national development plan 2000 to 2006 to develop incubation centres at 11 institute of technology campuses throughout the country. These centres will incorporate industrial research space to facilitate the commercialisation of research and development activity undertaken by the institutes. Funding is also available from other programmes to support research and development activities at the institutes. Such funding is allocated on a competitive basis to qualifying projects.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_316">Funding made available to the ICT sector for research and development comes from a number of agencies operating under the aegis of my Department. Funding allocations are all made on an individual, project by project basis. For example, of the total amount committed to date by Science Foundation Ireland to support research in the sciences underpinning ICT and biotechnology, €147 million has been committed in respect of ICT. Ireland's sustained economic growth and prosperity depends increasingly upon establishing a culture of scientific and technological innovation, a high level of research and development and a globally competitive knowledge based economy. Key among the areas receiving support in order to realise these objectives is support for research and development in the information and communication technologies sector and the build up of infrastructure to support the commercialisation of such research. In recognition of the importance of science, technology and innovation, my Department's science and technology budget  has increased to €159 million in 2003 from expenditure of approximately €72 million in 2001.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1889">The issue of job creation, and the decision to provide funding for a project, are day-to-day operational issues for the enterprise development agencies of my Department and are functions in which I have no direct role. The relevant agencies that fall under the aegis of my Department are Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, and Louth County Enterprise Board, all of which are committed to encouraging the establishment of industry in the regions, in particular, the Border, midlands and west, BMW, region of which Louth is a part. The funding paid to companies in any one year cannot be directly related to the number of new jobs in that year. Funding is generally paid to companies on a staged basis when agreed targets have been met. As such, payments made in any given year can include an element related to jobs created in a previous year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1890">Enterprise Ireland is the agency responsible for indigenous industry. The Forfás employment survey indicates that a total of 1,911 jobs have been created between 1998 and 2002 in County Louth in Enterprise Ireland client companies. The agency paid out over €8.5 million to client companies in County Louth in the same period. Details in tabular format are appended below at (i). The Forfás employment survey indicates that a total of 1,860 new jobs were created in Louth in the five-year period 1998 to 2002 in client companies of IDA Ireland, the agency responsible for attracting new foreign direct investment, while funding of almost €26.5 million was provided to client companies in the same period.

      asked the

       if she will review consumer legislation with a view to giving consumers greater protection under circumstances where an electrical appliance breaks down during the term of its parts guarantee and the maker will only honour this guarantee if the part is fitted by its own engineer and at exorbitant labour costs; if her attention has been drawn to the Office of Consumer Affairs' opinion that though this is a complaint frequently received by it, this practice seems lawful under current legislation; if she will undertake to amend legislation to make such contracts unlawful; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_2018">The Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980 contains specific provisions relating to guarantees given by manufacturers or other suppliers in connection with the supply of goods. These provisions do not prohibit the inclusion of terms in guarantees under which the servicing or repair of a product is required to be carried out by the manufacturer or a person authorised by the manufacturer. The provisions concerned also do not regulate the level of labour costs which may be incurred in this connection. While I am not aware that there are widespread difficulties arising from these aspects of the operation of these provisions, I have asked my Department to include the matter in ongoing work relating to the review of consumer legislation generally.</p>

      asked the

          <p eId="para_2021">I have been advised by IDA Ireland that since the Square D closure announcement in January 2003 there have been seven site visits to Ballinasloe. Construction of a second advance technology building of approximately 27,000 square feet, in the IDA Business and Technology Park is expected to commence in October 2003. In addition, IDA has reached an agreement with the ESB for the development of a 38KV substation on its estate which will significantly enhance the electricity supply infrastructure to the site and the surrounding area. IDA and other State agencies have actively participated in locally generated marketing initiatives and are involved in an ongoing ser ies of meetings with members of the Ballinasloe Town Council and Chamber of Commerce. The State development agencies are fully committed to ensuring an equal distribution of job opportunities and to encouraging the establishment of industry in the regions, in particular, the Border, midlands and west, BMW, region, of which Athlone and Ballinasloe are an integral part. However, over the past five years the overall challenges for companies have been difficult. Much of the midlands and BMW region is in a period of transition from dependence on the more cost competitive sectors, into the higher value added activities. Part of this transition has involved job reductions and losses in long established employers in the area and reinforces the importance and urgency of attracting more modern industrial and higher value added activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_2022">These efforts are being supported by specific IDA initiatives in the midlands, which include a comprehensive IDA property programme in place on the Athlone Business and Technology Park; two new technology buildings of approximately 25,000 square feet and a further office unit of 14,000 square feet which are complete and are currently being marketed by IDA. Alienware Corporation's official opening of their European operations centre in Athlone on 17 September, creating 80 jobs is also a welcome development. The State agencies under the auspices of my Department are and will continue to work closely in the interests of promoting Ballinasloe and Athlone for additional investment and job creation.</p>

There are no plans at present to significantly change this vacancy driven policy.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_3469">Ireland shares the generally felt disappointment at the outcome of the Cancún ministerial conference. The meeting failed to reach agreement on a framework for the continuation of negotiations under the Doha development agenda. As such, this is a serious setback for the DDA. The major losers from the failure to agree at Cancún are developing and least developed countries as the DDA is designed to effectively address their needs and to assist them integrate into the world economy. The Cancún conference did not fail for lack of effort on the part of the European Community. The EU for its part was among the most persistent advocates for a successful conference and negotiated in good faith. The EU also, among WTO partners, provided significant inputs to the WTO in the lead-in to Cancún. During this period EU member states agreed the substantial reforms in agriculture under the medium term review proposals in June.</p>
          <p eId="para_3470">Ireland continues to believe that a rules-based multilateral system of trade and a strong World Trade Organisation represents the best prospect for further progressive trade liberalisation while protecting the trade interests of the least developed economies. The EU Commission is undertaking a detailed assessment of the outcome of the Cancún ministerial conference for discussion with member states. It is too early to assess the medium term implications of Cancún conference and the setback for the DDA, or to reach any firm conclusions about the position of the European Community regarding the round or the next steps to be taken. A process of internal reflection and consultation among member states and within and between the EU Commission and Council is now beginning. The Cancún conference concluded with a ministerial declaration that instructed officials to continue work on the outstanding issues and to convene a meeting in Geneva on 15 December to take the action necessary to enable us to move towards a successful and timely conclusion to the negotiations.</p>
          <p eId="para_3471">Notwithstanding the setback at Cancún, Ireland is fully committed to the full implementation of the mandates of the Doha development agenda.</p>

          <p eId="para_3478">The legal requirements relating to winding up of a company  are set out in the Companies Acts 1963 to 2001, principally in Part VI of the Companies Act 1963, and Part V of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001. The relevant regulatory authorities coming under the aegis of my Department are the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE) and the Companies Registration Office (CRO). I am not in a position to answer for the Revenue Commissioners or other authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_3479">There are three different types of liquidation or winding up – compulsory liquidation where the winding up is ordered by the High Court, members' voluntary liquidation where the company is solvent, and creditors' voluntary liquidation where the company is insolvent. More detailed information on the different types of liquidation, including the statutory requirements, is available on the Companies Registration Office website www.cro.ie under the heading "Doing business with us/Solvency".</p>
          <p eId="para_3480">The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, has responsibility, <i>inter alia,</i> for enforcing company law in relation to insolvent companies. Section 56 of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001, requires certain liquidators appointed to insolvent companies to submit reports to the ODCE within six months of their appointment. The ODCE has published three decision notices outlining the legal requirements and its approach to insolvent companies, including the section 56 reporting mechanism. These decision notices are decision notice D/2002/3 entitled “The Liquidation-Related Functions of the Director of Corporate Enforcement”, decision notice D/2002/4 entitled “Unliquidated Insolvent Companies” and decision notice D/2003/1 entitled “The Liquidation-Related Functions of the Director of Corporate Enforcement – Further Commencement of Section 56 of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001”. Copies of these notices may be obtained from the ODCE directly or may be downloaded from the ODCE's website at www.odce.ie/publications/decision.asp.</p>
          <p eId="para_3481">In the particular case referred to by the Deputy, I have no doubt that the staff of the CRO and the ODCE would be happy to answer any queries the club may have. However, I would also advise them to seek independent legal or professional advice, as appropriate. There is no financial assistance available from my Department in a winding up situation.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Fahey)</from>
          <p eId="para_3485">Terms and conditions of employment for construction workers working in Ireland are regulated by the Registered Employment Agreement (Construction Industry Wages and Conditions of Employment) Variation Order 1996, with effect from 17 June 1996 and Registered Employment Agreement (Construction Industry Pensions Assurance and Sick Pay) Variation Order 1994, with effect from 10 October 1994. Because the variation order governing wages and conditions of employment has not been updated, due to legal difficulties, the going rate in the industry is much higher than that which is provided for in the 1996 variation order and legally enforceable. While the Labour inspectorate has a role in the investigation of complaints in respect of alleged non-compliance with the provisions of the Registered Employment Agreement, the Labour Court also has an enforcement role. Labour inspectorate activity in the area of pay and conditions of employment show that ten cases were finalised during 2002. To date in 2003, nine such complaints have been received by the Labour inspectorate of my Department and are receiving attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_3486">Under the Industrial Relations Acts 1946 to 2001, a trade union representative of employers or workers may complain to the Labour Court that any employer to whom the agreements relate has failed or neglected to comply with either agreement. The Labour inspectorate assists the Labour Court in its endeavours in this regard by carrying out examinations of relevant employer's records. It is this work that makes up the bulk of the inspectorate's activity in respect of the pensions assurance and sick pay REA as it is the norm that such complaints are processed through the Court. Complaints for the most part come from the Construction Industry Federation. The Labour Court having finalised their examination of a complaint, will issue a court order if appropriate. Legal proceedings for failure to comply with the court order are processed by my Department as necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_3487">Regarding the pension and sick pay registered employment agreement, the inspection statistics for the year 2002 show that my Department's inspectorate handled 12 cases. In 2003 to date the inspectorate has received 38 such cases of which 12 have been finalised.</p>

However, if there is evidence that particular Irish construction workers are being treated less favourably than their non-national counterparts then a complaint of alleged discrimination can be made to the Equality Tribunal under the Employment Equality Act 1998. The Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, provides that an employer shall not permit an employee to work more than 48 hours per week, averaged over a period of four or six months. An employee or any trade union of which the employee is a member, may, with the consent of the employee, present a complaint to a rights commissioner that an employer is in breach of the average weekly working hours provisions of the Act.</p>

          <p eId="para_3498">The issue of job creation is a day-to-day operational issue for the enterprise development agencies of my Department and not one in which I have a direct function. IDA Ireland is the agency statutorily charged with the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland and its regions. IDA is actively promoting County Cavan on an ongoing basis through their network of overseas offices as a potential location for overseas investment. Ultimately however it is the investor who decides the location including what locations they want to visit. In an effort to enhance the attraction of County Cavan to overseas investors IDA has recently invested €1 million in upgrading its 16.5 hectare business park in Cavan to flagship standard which has greatly enhanced its attractiveness for new inward investment. The work involved the extension of internal roads, services and extensive landscaping. Planning permission has been received from Cavan County Council for two 2,500 square metre advanced technology  units and construction of the first of these buildings will commence after a project has been secured for the former Teradyne premises, which IDA is actively marketing to overseas investors at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_3499">Despite the global economic downturn, the level of foreign direct investment in Ireland, relative to the size of the economy, remains one of the highest in the world. Ireland today competes with many other countries for new projects and, indeed, the relative attractiveness of one regional location in Ireland to another is often the decider for a company as to where it will locate. The designation of Cavan town as a hub under the Government's national spatial strategy confers on it a strategic position in the overall development plans for Ireland that further enhances the attractiveness of the county as a potential location for overseas investment. Cavan town, along with Dundalk, Monaghan and Drogheda, is one of the four towns of emphasis in the north east region for the IDA and is being strongly marketed for new investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_3500">In relation to indigenous industry, Enterprise Ireland provides preferential funding for companies, with detailed export plans, which are expanding or establishing a business in the county as part of the BMW region. In 2003 Enterprise Ireland is putting in place a range of new initiatives geared towards clients developing export markets for the first time in market mentors, training workshops, and market visits. Enterprise Ireland has focused on building and construction materials as a targeted sector for County Cavan and is endeavouring to build on the existing cluster of companies in the county. In addition an €88 million investment by Abbott Laboratories, the Chicago based health care company, to expand its nutritional manufacturing plant at Cootehill, County Cavan, was supported by Enterprise Ireland and will lead to the creation of 100 new jobs over the next three years. The latest available figures from Enterprise Ireland show approvals totalling €4,524,914 in funding to client companies in County Cavan in 2002, in addition to €479,987 in 2003 – to 26 September. Total payments amounted to €733,257 in 2002 and €229,749 in 2003 to 26 September 2003.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_349">Under the second call for proposals for the Community Enterprise Scheme 2002, operated by Enterprise Ireland, I have just announced that Bailieboro Community Development Group has been approved €250,000 for the building of a new community enterprise centre. This will add further impetus to job creation in the county. On a micro-enterprise level, Cavan County Enterprise Board is actively involved in the promotion of micro-enterprise and an enterprise culture throughout all areas of County Cavan. From 1 January 2000 to 30 September 2003, Cavan CEB approved €1.608 million for 90 projects with potential to create 227 full-time and 39 part-time jobs. During the same period 889 people participated on management development and other training programmes organised and delivered  through the County Enterprise Board. Cavan Innovation and Technology Centre, a joint initiative of Cavan County Enterprise Board and the Cavan County Enterprise Fund, has been developed as part of a cross-border programme to support local, regional and national agencies in stimulating an environment conducive to innovation, entrepreneurship and inward investment in the Cavan-Fermanagh region. Total investment in the centre to-date amounts to €3.2 million.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_350">I am confident that the efforts of the industrial development agencies in partnership with other local organisations as well as the continuing commitment of the Government to regional development will bring positive results to Cavan.</summary>

          <p eId="para_3504">On 27 May 2003 the Government approved the priority drafting and publication of the general scheme of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Bill. It is intended to introduce the published Bill into the Houses of the Oireachtas in the autumn and enact it by year end, allowing the Personal Injuries Assessment Board to be up and running and hearing cases early in 2004. It is generally accepted that the medical and legal costs associated with the settlement of insurance claims are disproportionately high in Ireland. The main objective of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board will be to reduce the cost of delivery of compensation. It is not designed to reduce the level of awards. It will initially deal with employer  liability cases where liability issues do not arise and subsequently extend its remit to cover public liability cases and claims involving motor accidents.</p>

          <p eId="para_3513">Irish legislation sets minimum standards for pay and conditions of employment for workers employed in Ireland. The national minimum wage was introduced in Ireland on 1 April 2000.

          <p eId="para_3521">On 15 January 2003, I approved, in principle, the report of the Reserve Defence Forces Review Implementation Board for the implementation of the recommendations of the special steering group on the reserve, which had reported to me in September 1999.</p>
          <p eId="para_3522">The Permanent Defence Force is now organised in a three brigade structure and a Defence Forces training centre. The Reserve Defence Force will be similarly reorganised and restructured and it is envisaged that the implementation of these changes in the Reserve Defence Force will take place over a period of approximately six years.</p>
          <p eId="para_3523">The report of the special steering group indicated that the existing first line reserve system satisfactorily addresses any Air Corps Reserve aviation requirement. Former Air Corps personnel who volunteer for service on the first line reserve, or who have a first line reserve commitment, can be attached to an appropriate unit of the Air Corps. The steering group did not recommend that any special reserve unit or formation be established specifically for the Air Corps. However, the report did highlight the importance of encouraging participation in the Reserve Defence Force in major urban areas. Its recommendations included the provision of Army reserve units in Baldonnel to cater for young people living in south and west Dublin, which includes the catchment areas of Tallaght and Clondalkin. I have asked that these recommendations be addressed as part of the review process.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_352">The White Paper on Defence recognised that a notable and important feature of the existing FCA organisation is its countrywide, geographical spread. This particular aspect will, in general terms, be retained in the future. The full organisational and establishment details of the new reserve will be determined in the course of the ongoing detailed implementation process. The objective of this process is to ensure that better training and other facilities will be provided to members of the Reserve Defence Force. No decisions have yet been taken on the location of proposed newly amalgamated units but the military authorities have advised me that all proposed amalgamations will provide an optimal environment for personnel in the relevant areas to par take in the new enhanced Reserve Defence Force.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_353">Members of the FCA are already seeing the benefits of the reorganisation process in terms of better clothing and improved equipment and more and better quality training. As the process develops we will see additional benefits in terms of a clearer role for the FCA, a better overall organisation structure, and opportunities for suitably qualified Reserve Defence Force personnel to serve overseas. We will also see benefits from the closer integration of the FCA with the Army.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_354">I must emphasise I am very mindful of the need to preserve and to retain the very many traditional and well established strengths of the current system, not least the admirable spirit of individual voluntary commitment, close social links with local communities and a good depth and scope as regards nation-wide geographical spread. I have been advised by the military authorities that no Defence Force Reserve location will be closed and no member will be asked or required to terminate their service. However, no final decision on the amalgamation of any FCA units will be taken until I have had the opportunity to examine and approve the final amalgamation proposals.</summary>

I feel that there is no additional statement or commentary which requires to be entered, other than to tender again condolences to the family concerned. I understand that the Defence Forces were officially represented at the funeral of the individual in question and that the Defence Forces also  provided a military bearer party, which rendered ceremonial honours at the funeral. The normal courtesies extended at the funerals of former members of the Defence Forces, where the family of the deceased requests military honours, were provided. These courtesy honours are a public acknowledgement by the Defence Forces of the service rendered to the State by the deceased as a member of the Defence Forces. I am satisfied in these circumstances that it would be inappropriate to meet the family concerned.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_356">The individual concerned retired voluntarily in 1970. At the date of his retirement he held the commissioned rank of captain and he was paid a captain's pension for the past 33 years. There is no statutory provision under which a posthumous promotion of the nature suggested by the Deputy could be made. His widow has been granted a widow's pension under the Defence Forces pensions schemes at a rate appropriate to her late husband's retiring rank. There is no provision in those schemes under which a widow's pension could be related to a rank higher than the deceased's retiring rank.</summary>

The benchmarking body linked implementation of its recommendations to modernisation in the public service. Agreement between the public service employers and the ICTU-affiliated public service unions on implementation of the benchmarking body's report was reached earlier this year in the context of the new social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_3530">The agreement provides, subject to its acceptance by the individual unions and representative associations involved, for payment of 25% of the benchmarking increases from 1 December 2001. It also provides for payment of the balance of the increases in two phases viz. 50% from 1 January 2004 and 25% from 1 June 2005. Under Sustaining Progress, payment of these final two phases is dependent on real and verifiable modernisation, industrial relations stability, co-operation with change, and achievement of a number of specific commitments in each sector, in line with the recommendations of the Public Service Benchmarking Body.</p>

          <p eId="para_3567">My Department is currently pursuing recovery of overpayments under the early retirement scheme from 968 persons.

          <p eId="para_3568">It is a condition of the scheme that on reaching the age of 65, participants and their spouses or partners in joint management cases, must apply to the Department of Social and Family Affairs for either the contributory or the non-contributory old age pension.

        <summary eId="sum_365">The primary purpose of the scrapie monitored flock scheme is to permit participants to meet the export certification conditions for breeding sheep in so far as they relate to scrapie. These conditions are laid down in EU law and include,inter alia, a requirement that sheep intended for export for breeding have been kept continuously on a  scrapie monitored holding since birth or for the last two years. Additionally, female sheep may only be introduced into these flocks from other monitored flocks.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_366">These rules are in place to avoid the very real risk of spreading scrapie from non-scrapie monitored flocks to scrapie monitored flocks. While an entirely rigid interpretation of the rules might preclude the public sale of sheep from scrapie monitored sheep at all, my Department has sought to facilitate sales without prejudicing the status of scrapie monitored flocks. It has been possible to do so by permitting sales of monitored sheep subject to strict segregation rules.</summary>

An interim reply issued to the Land Registry on 7 August 2003 pending the examination of a vesting order, which was lodged in the Land Registry office in 1998. The query raised by the Land Registry office was answered on 18 September 2003 to the effect that the said vesting order contained an error and it is considered that this will have to be rectified by means of a judicial amending order in accordance with section 30(3) of the Land Act 1931.

          <p eId="para_3976">The person named applied for special beef premium under the 2002 scheme in respect of 92 animals. Under the EU regulations governing the 2002 special beef premium a stocking density of 1.9 livestock units per hectares applies, based on the forage area declared on an applicant's area aid application. As the forage area declared on the area aid application is 41.37 hec tares, the number of units that may be calculated for livestock premia purposes is 78.60 livestock units.</p>
          <p eId="para_3977">The reckonable livestock units are obtained in respect of the calendar year as follows: male cattle up to and including 24 months old applied on for 2002 special beef premium and bull premium – 0.6 livestock unit each; male cattle over 24 months old applied on for 2002 special beef premium – 1.0 livestock unit each; ewes on which the producer applies for 2002 ewe premium – 0.15 livestock unit each; suckler cows: 1.0 livestock unit each; milk quota of 876 gallons (if not in milk recording) – 1.0 livestock unit each. Milk quota livestock unit equivalent is obtained by dividing a producer's milk quota in respect of a given calendar year by the national average yield per cow for that year, or by the recorded average milk yield per cow where the producer is in an official milk recording scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_3978">The person named successfully appealed the level of milk quota recorded against the premia applications downwards to 8,854 gallons. Consequently the number of reckonable livestock units on which special beef premia for 2002 may be calculated has been revised to 68.5 livestock units in total.</p>
          <p eId="para_3979">To date the person named has been paid special beef premium and extensification premium in respect of 63.28 animals, less 12.5% due to special beef premium overshoot reduction to applicants with in excess of 50 animals.

Schedule E 1. (<i>f</i>) (iii) of SI 112 of 1996 precludes bovine semen not collected in an approved semen collection centre from intra-community trade. In addition my Department has put in place a protocol governing the on-farm collection of bovine semen which clearly states that semen collected on-farm can only be used in the herd of origin. This class of semen will not be eligible for either domestic or intercommunity trade.</p>
          <p eId="para_3993">A herd owner wishing to arrange for the collection of semen from his bull on-farm must make the appropriate application to my Department in accordance with the terms and conditions governing the on-farm collection of bovine semen.

          <p eId="para_3996">The European Communities (Trade in Bovine Breeding Animals, their Semen, Ova and Embryos) Regulations 1996 set out conditions that regulate the trade in, approval for breeding of breeding animals, their semen, ova and embryos, excluding embryos derived by transfer of nuclei. In particular, Schedule J to these regulations sets out the conditions applying to donor animals and requires, among other things, that the donor animals must come from herds that are officially brucellosis free or brucellosis free. Thus  the harvesting of embryos from animals in brucellosis restricted herds is prohibited.</p>
          <p eId="para_3997">Brucellosis is a contagious disease primarily affecting cattle, swine, sheep, goats, and occasionally horses and dogs. In Ireland the disease is found in bovines and is the subject of an eradication programme. It is acknowledged that congenital infection can occur in calves born to infected dams. Whilst infection in calves may persist for only a short period, some calves born to infected dams continue to excrete brucella abortus in their faeces for a considerable period of time and are thus a source of infection for other animals and herds.</p>
          <p eId="para_3998">As well as the economic losses associated with the disease, infection with brucella abortus presents a potential risk to human health. Humans become infected by coming in contact with animals or animal products that are contaminated with these bacteria. In humans brucellosis can cause a range of long lasting symptoms that are similar to flu and may include fever, sweats, headaches, back pains and physical weakness.</p>

      if his attention has been drawn to concerns expressed by farmers who sell calves and weanlings that they will suffer huge losses arising from decoupling of direct payments due to no account being taken of the fact that premium payments were reflected and factored in to the prices obtained by them during the reference years, rather than by way of direct payment to them; and if he has proposals to remedy this anomaly under the new regime.

While it may be some time yet before the position is clear, my officials have raised and continue to raise a number of issues relating to farmers who have retired under the early retirement schemes and the implications for them of the decoupling and single payment proposals. By definition, retired farmers cannot activate entitlements earned during the reference period and the Commission's position is that entitlements should not be linked to land but should go to farmers who were active during that period. However, it has also indicated that it favours arrangements that family members who were not farming during the reference period, but subsequently take over a holding, will have access to the national reserve. My officials are working to secure as favourable  an outcome as possible, having regard to the legitimate aspirations of all stakeholders.</summary>

      <b>Ms Burton</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Finance</b>
      if his attention has been drawn to the fact that, since 3 December 1997 when the capital gains tax was halved, management companies have been used by very wealthy people to avoid tax, the net benefit on liquidation being 14.5%, that is, ?145,000 on every ?1 million of profit; the total estimated loss of revenue to the Exchequer from this device; if he has plans to close off this loophole; if he will consider a surcharge on the liquidation of such companies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_4061">It is not clear as to the basis for the figure of 14.5% referred to in the Deputy's question. When a company goes into liquidation – whether a management company or any other type of company – a distribution made by the liquidator to the shareholders, in the form of cash or other assets, is effectively treated as a disposal of the company's shares for capital gains tax purposes. It follows that the 20% rate of capital gains tax applies in such circumstances.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_431">Any accumulated profits giving rise to funds available for distribution in a liquidation situation would currently suffer corporation tax at either 12.5% or 25%, depending on whether the profits are considered to arise from trading or non-trading activities. In the case of service companies, that is, companies providing employment or professional services, the profits may also have attracted an additional surcharge of 15% to the extent that they were not distributed within a certain period and where the companies were, in broad terms, controlled by five or less individuals. Where a management company receives fees from a connected company, in order to be allowable for tax purposes the management service must be genuinely provided and the charge for the service must be realistic by reference to similar services provided at arms length in that sector.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_432">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that while they are investigating one particular group of companies involving the use of a management company and a subsequent liquidation, at present they do not have indications of widespread use of avoidance schemes in this area. However, the matter will be kept under continual close review and I will, of course, consider introducing appropriate anti-avoidance measures if evidence emerges of any significant abuse, in line with what I have done on several occasions in the last few years to counter such abuses.</summary>

          <p eId="para_4063">I can confirm that I received proposals from the Garda Síochána Retired Members Association regarding the pensions of retired members of the Garda. The proposals in question relate to the pensionability of Garda allowances for those members who had retired before certain allowances were made pensionable. My colleague, Deputy McDowell, Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has primary responsibility for the Garda pension scheme and my Department has been liaising with his officials on the details of these proposals. However, I hope to be in a position to respond to the association in the near future.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_433">I am advised that the background to this matter is that a 1983 arbitration finding recommended that certain Garda allowances should be made pensionable with effect from 1 October 1982. The finding was applied only to personnel who retired on or after that date. The pensionability of the Garda unsocial hours allowance was treated in a similar way when it was introduced effective from 1994. The position was consistent with that in other areas of the public service where in the context of making allowances pensionable the bene fits were confined to those retiring after a specified date and did not extend to pensioners who retired before that date.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_434">The Commission on Public Service Pensions as part of its deliberations examined the specific issue of the pensionability of allowances for those who had retired prior to the implementation date, in respect of members of the Garda Síochána and others but, having addressed the arguments involved, did not recommend any increase in pension for the groups involved.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_435">As the Deputy may be aware, the Government has decided to accept the thrust of the package of reforms recommended by the commission and is currently awaiting a report from the implementation working group in relation to the operational details.</summary>

          <p eId="para_4066">I propose to answer Questions Nos. 339 and 385 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_4067">There are no special income tax allowances for unmarried couples living together. In this context, I would point out that tax law follows the general law relating to marriage. Generally speaking, the basis for the current taxation of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy <i>vs</i> the Attorney General (1980) which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together. The tax treatment of unmarried couples who cohabit was unaffected by the Murphy judgment. Each partner is taxed as a single person and each is entitled to the tax credits and standard rate band appropriate to single persons.</p>
          <p eId="para_4068">The position of married couples in relation to income tax is accorded recognition through the married person's tax credit and the home carer's tax credit. I have no plans to change the arrangements in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_4069">In budget 2000 I initiated the process of band widening with a view to establishing progressively a single standard rate income tax band for all individual taxpayers. When this process is complete the position of all couples will be the same with respect to the standard rate tax band.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_436">As the Deputies will be aware, the tax treatment of cohabiting couples was last examined comprehensively in the report of the working group examining the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent families under the tax and social welfare codes. The group, which was established by the Minister for Social Welfare in May 1997, reported in August 1999 – the report is available from the Government Publications Sale Office. The group was sympathetic in principle to changes in the tax legislation to address the issues raised relating to cohabiting couples and reported that the options that it set out should be considered further.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_437">The working group acknowledged that a key issue in relation to the tax treatment of cohabiting couples is whether tax law should proceed ahead of changes in the general law on the matter. For that reason, and while I am cognisant of the issues faced by cohabiting couples, I have no plans to extend the married person's tax credit to such couples at the present time.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_438">The treatment of married and cohabiting couples under the social welfare code is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_440">The advertisement and recruitment process to fill professional, technical and general service grades in the Irish Civil Service is carried out by the Civil Service Commissioners. Competitions are frequently advertised in theIrish Independent on Thursdays and The Irish Times on Fridays and these newspapers are available in Northern Ireland. Competitions are also published on the Civil Service Commission's website at www.publicjobs thereby ensuring that the notice  is far reaching and available to all. All potential applicants within the European Union have equal entitlement to apply once they meet the relevant eligibility criteria.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_441">In determining print media advertising, consideration is given to the potential target audience on a competition by competition basis. The Civil Service Commissioners have no immediate plans to include advertising in the Northern Ireland news media as a matter of course. However, advertisements for specialist posts are placed there from time to time and such advertisements frequently appear in newspapers, journals, and periodicals which are circulated in Northern Ireland. As an example, in the last six months two director posts in the Environmental Protection Agency were advertised in theBelfast Telegraph and the Irish News; an engineer grade II post in the Office of Public Works and a fire safety officer post in the Irish Prison Service were advertised in Recruitment Ireland.</summary>

A draft of the final report was received by Office of Public Works last month and is being given careful examination by Office of Public Works and the three local authorities concerned, Meath and Fingal County Councils and Dublin City Council. When all submissions have been considered the report will be finalised as quickly as possible in order for further decisions to be taken on the whole of the River Tolka catchment. The final report follows on from the preliminary reports prepared for the local authorities following the severe flooding from the River Tolka in November 2002. As a result of the preliminary reports, Office of Public Works is undertaking interim flood alleviation works along the river following Part 8 public exhibition by both Meath County Council and Dublin City Council. All the works contained in the package exhibited by the Dublin City Council are expected to be completed in the next two months.</p>

There is no stamp duty on the purchase of new residential property for owner-occupiers, including first-time buyers, where the dwelling is not greater than 125 square metres. If a new dwelling is more than this size, stamp duty is charged on the site value or on one-quarter of the full house value, whichever is the greater. With regard to the transfer of second-hand property, first-time buyers are exempt from stamp duty where the consideration is up to €190,500 and can avail of significantly reduced rates in stamp duty compared with other purchasers where the consideration is up to €381,000.</p>

The most significant factor influencing house price increases is the demand for housing generally. However, various Government measures introduced over recent years have increased the supply of new housing, which has led to greater moderation in house price increases. The year 2002 was the eighth successive year of record house completions, with 57,695 units completed, up almost 10% on 2001 levels and up 48.5% on 1997 levels. This positive trend in supply has continued into this year, with first quarter statistics from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government showing that overall house completions were up 14.5% on the same period last year (at 13,709 units), while completions in the Greater Dublin Area were up by 16.2% – 4,838 units – and up 18.2% in Dublin, with 3,123 completions.</summary>

          <p eId="para_5348">The OECD, in its 2003 Economic Survey of Ireland, points out that Ireland's remarkable growth performance that began from the mid-1990s and continued into the start of the new millennium has led to rapid convergence of productivity levels towards the EU average. Growth since the mid- 1990s has been above the economy's potential growth rate. The diversification of FDI in recent years seems to have helped buffer Ireland's growth performance. A persistent and widening gap between GDP and GNP is an important feature of the economy and arises from a dependence on foreign direct investment as it arises mostly from profits accruing to foreign companies operating in Ireland and this affects productivity measurement.</p>
          <p eId="para_5349">As to the future, the OECD is of the view that the Irish economy is operating at or close to full employment and participation rates are now close to the EU average placing the focus on underlying productivity as the key determinant of the potential growth rate. Average productivity growth is forecast by the OECD to decline slightly as high technology industries mature and the economy continues to become more services intensive. In their central scenario, productivity as measure by GDP per worker is assumed to grow by 3.5% per year.</p>
          <p eId="para_5350">The IMF's most recent report on Ireland states that over the medium term, output is projected to grow at a trend rate of about 4-5% a year reflecting slower labour force and productivity growth compared with the late-1990s due to income convergence and lower foreign direct investment flows following the bursting of the global ICT bubble. IMF directors have commended the Irish authorities for their exemplary track record of sound economic policies, which have resulted in a dynamic, open, and robust economy – with growth notably above the EU average over the past decade – and resilience to external shocks. Directors saw signs, however, that trend growth was beginning to moderate toward euro-area levels, with implications for macroeconomic policy implementation and the expectations of economic agents.</p>
          <p eId="para_5351">As to my views on the way in which productivity can be improved, in addition to our industrial policy which is geared at moving the economy to higher value added activities, it is important to ensure a robust healthy economic environment in which businesses can prosper and by implication, productivity can be maximised. I would strongly agree with the assessment and recommendations of both organisations. It is important to ensure that both income expectations and public finances adjust to a slower growth environment, assist competitiveness, reflect closely changes in productivity and economic conditions and ensure fiscal sustainability. I would agree with the IMF conclusion that: "the likelihood of sustained slower growth in the period ahead calls for a sharper policy focus on reducing inflation further toward the euro-area average, improving competitiveness, safeguarding financial sector soundness and flexibility, and securing the medium-term fiscal position, in line with the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) objective".</p>

          <p eId="para_5353">The most recent inflation figures show an inflation rate, as measured by the annual change in the consumer price index, CPI, of 3.2% in August. This was significantly lower than the 5.1% rate of increase in February 2003. The sustained strength of the euro relative to the dollar and sterling, together with the fall in mortgage interest rates and easing domestic pressures should have a positive effect on the rate of inflation for the remainder of the year although oil prices, which have witnessed some increase recently, may exert some upward pressure. The Economic Review and Outlook, published in August revised the budget day forecast for CPI inflation from 4.8% to 3.6% for 2003 as a whole. This updated forecast, as always, was based on the technical assumption of unchanged interest rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_5354">Tackling domestic inflationary pressures is a priority for this Government. In this context, adherence to the pay arrangements set out under the draft new social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, is essential. The anti-inflation initiative agreed by Government, employers and union leaders, to target key domestic sources of inflationary pressure under Sustaining Progress is also important and I look forward to the first formal report of the Anti-Inflation Initiative Group, which is due to be submitted to Government shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_5355">I am also of the view that keeping public expenditure on target is essential if our inflation rate is to moderate. My Department will continue to closely monitor spending to ensure that expenditure remains within budget.</p>

These are the absence of industrial action and the achievement of the objectives of the modernisation agenda. The absence of industrial action is very important since such actions have in the past disrupted services to the public for example in hospitals and schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_5362">The aim of the modernisation process is to improve the delivery of public services. There are a number of general themes included in this agenda: increased flexibility of staff in how the service is delivered, changes in recruitment methods to attract those with the necessary skills and expertise, achieving better value for money, and an emphasis on improving customer service.</p>
          <p eId="para_5363">In addition to some of the general themes listed above there are other modernisation objectives and specific targets for the main sectors – health, Civil Service, education and local authorities. These include changes in the education sector to standardise the school year, parent-teacher meetings taking place outside school hours initially on a half-in half-out basis, and other changes relating to examinations. In the Civil Service there will be a widening of the access to jobs at all levels and a new Civil Service Regulation Bill. These are just some of the changes. However, in addition to these specific targets there is a general commitment by the unions to co-operation with ongoing change. This should allow for continued developments either through technology or otherwise to improve services.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_446">A verification process was established to oversee the implementation of the commitments in the agreement and payment of both the general rounds and the final two phases of benchmarking are linked to the changes outlined. Performance verification groups were established in each sector. These have a strong independent representation. The PVG will assess progress not just at the sectoral level but also at the organisational and grade level. In addition to making an assessment of progress, at the latest, one month  in advance of each of the five payment dates specified in the agreement, the PVG will maintain close contact with each of the organisations under its remit throughout the reporting period.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_447">The local partnership committees will agree action plans and submit them to the PVG for approval. Once approved, these will be translated into an organisational action plan by the head of the organisation for implementation. These heads of organisations will prepare progress reports on implementing the plans for the partnership committees and these in turn will be submitted to the appropriate Secretary General responsible for that sector. In turn, the Secretary General will submit a report to the PVG along with his/her assessment of progress. The PVG will then decide whether the progress achieved warrants payment. The final decision on whether to make payment then rests with the relevant Secretary General.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_448">I have said that the Government will pay the increases on the basis of the conditions set down in the agreement. We are determined that all of the public service commitments agreed in Sustaining Progress must be delivered by the unions. There can be no rolling back on any of these commitments and there will be no renegotiation of them.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_449">The agreement sets out the process to be followed for verification of achievement of the agreement. If any grades, sectors or organisations refuse to agree on specific actions to achieve the commitments or, having so agreed, fail to deliver on them, they should not expect the verification process to decide that pay increases are warranted.</summary>

          <p eId="para_5365">As the Deputy is aware, the stamp duty on credit cards under previous legislation was in respect of an account maintained by the bank on 1 April, which would have allowed cardholders to cancel their cards in a particular manner so as to avoid this annual charge. In view of this, an anti-avoidance provision was included in the Finance Act 2003 to ensure the stamp duty charge will arise where the credit card account is maintained by the bank at any time during the 12 month period ending on 1 April rather than only maintained specifically on 1 April. This change is effective where the charge arises after 1 April 2003.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_450">Accordingly, if an individual having used a card at any time cancels the credit card after 1 April in a year, a stamp duty charge of €40 is payable on closure of the account, as the account had been maintained by the financial institution during the year ending on 1 April of the following  year. This is consistent with applying a stamp duty charge for a year or part of a year for which the credit card account is held.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_451">As the Deputy will appreciate, there would be revenue implications in any change to the current provisions. However, I will keep this matter under consideration in the context of the 2004 budget and Finance Bill, which is the normal context for any changes in taxation arrangements.</summary>

          <p eId="para_5367">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that data is not collected in a manner that enables the provision of precise details relating to the stamp duty yield associated with the sale of second-hand homes, including those to first-time buyers. The Revenue Commissioners have, however, advised that the yield from stamp duty in 2002 on all house purchases by first-time buyers was €29 million approximately. As purchases of new houses certified by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government as having a floor area of less than 125 metres square are exempt from stamp duty, it is reasonable to assume that by far the major portion of this yield from all house purchases by first-time buyers arises from the purchase of second hand homes and that this would have been the cost of such exemption in 2002. A current cost figure is not available.</p>
          <p eId="para_5368">I am not in favour of giving a total exemption from stamp duty on second-hand houses to first time buyers for both Exchequer cost reasons and because there is no guarantee that the tax revenue thus foregone would accrue to the purchasers. However, I should point out that first-time buyers can avail of a significantly reduced rate of stamp duty in a number of the price bands associated with the purchase of second-hand residential property compared with other owner-occupiers, and also compared to investors who pay stamp duty at the full rate on any residential property purchased, whether new or second-hand.</p>

          <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</from>
          <p eId="para_5382">As the Deputy will be aware, the home carers allowance, now a tax credit, was introduced in Finance Act 2000 to recognise the contribution made by a spouse who remains working in the home in order to care for certain dependent persons who may not be the spouse of the claimant. It may be claimed by a married couple who are jointly assessed for tax. The dependent person is defined as a child in respect of whom child benefit is being paid, a person aged 65 years or over, or a person who is permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity. This definition includes a person related by marriage to the claimant and a person in respect of whom the claimant is or was the legal guardian. The tax credit currently amounts to €770 per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_5383">The provision is intended to cover situations where a spouse has forfeited a second income to care for dependents in the home. However, there is an income disregard, whereby the home carer may have some income in their own right without affecting their spouse's eligibility for the tax credit. In addition there is a taper system, which means the tax credit is not lost all at once when income exceeds the amount of the disregard. The tax credit is due in full where the home carer's annual income does not exceed €5,080 and where it exceeds that amount, the tax credit is reduced by half the excess. Effectively €1 of tax credit is subtracted for every €2 by which the income exceeds €5,080, so that where the annual income exceeds €6,620 no tax credit is due.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_452">There are no special income tax allowances for unmarried couples living together. In this context, I point out that tax law follows the general law relating to marriage. Generally speaking, the basis for the current taxation of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Mur phy v. the Attorney General (1980) which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together. The tax treatment of unmarried couples who cohabit was unaffected by the Murphy judgment. Each partner is taxed as a single person and each is entitled to the tax credits and standard rate band appropriate to single persons.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_453">The position of married couples in relation to income tax is accorded recognition through the married person's tax credit and the home carer's tax credit. I have no plans to change the arrangements in that regard.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_454">In budget 2000 I initiated the process of band widening with a view to establishing progressively a single standard rate income tax band for all individual taxpayers. When this process is complete the position of all couples will be the same with respect to the standard rate tax band. As Deputies will be aware, the issue of the tax treatment of cohabiting couples was last examined comprehensively in the report of the working group examining the treatment of married, cohabiting and one-parent families under the tax and social welfare codes. The group, which was established by the Minister for Social Welfare in May 1997, reported in August 1999 and the report is available from the Government Publications Sale Office. The group was sympathetic in principle to changes in the tax legislation to address the issues raised relating to cohabiting couples and reported that the options that it set out should be considered further.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_455">The working group acknowledged that a key issue in relation to the tax treatment of cohabiting couples is whether tax law should proceed ahead of changes in the general law on the matter. For that reason, and while I am cognisant of the issues faced by cohabiting couples, I have no plans to extend the home carer's tax credit to such couples at the present time.</summary>

          <p eId="para_5400">As the Deputy is aware there is a statutory obligation on taxpayers to make correct returns of their tax liabilities and pay the correct taxes due for all years of assessment. Where it becomes known to the Revenue Commissioners that tax has been underpaid it is their responsibility to recover the unpaid taxes together with interest and penalties.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_456">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that in the case of bogus non-resident account holders, Revenue provided an opportunity to those who had underpaid their taxes to make voluntary disclosures of the undeclared income, together with payment of the resulting tax liability and an amount of interest and penalties, capped at 100% of the tax liabilities, before 15 November 2001. This voluntary disclosure  scheme was very widely publicised, as was Revenue's very clear intention to pursue those who did not avail of the scheme. A total of €227 million was received from 3,750 individuals who availed of this scheme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_457">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that information supplied by financial institutions under section 908 High Court orders became the principal basis of identifying bogus non-resident account holders who did not avail of the voluntary disclosure scheme. To date information relating to about 76,000 non-resident accounts, where the account holders had Irish addresses, have been passed to Revenue by financial institutions on foot of the High Court orders.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_458">Inquiry work in relation to the examination of the first batch of taxpayers commenced on 11 October 2002. Further general issues of inquiry letters were made in January, May, July and September 2003. To date 142,000 inquiry letters have been issued to taxpayers in respect of 73,000 non-resident accounts that had Irish addresses connected to them. Further inquiry letters will issue in the coming months.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_459">Because the project is ongoing, with regular tranches of inquiry letters being issued and being responded to in very large numbers, it is not possible at present to state exactly how many replies have been received at this particular time. However, to date approximately €223 million has been received from more than 6,000 individuals which brings the total amount of money raised to €450 million when the money raised under the voluntary disclosure scheme is included. There are also a substantial number of cases where there is no additional liability to tax. Revenue have advised that to date, in excess of 11,000 inquiries have been closed off on this basis.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_460">The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that in general, taxpayers who held bogus non-resident deposit accounts will be considered for an investigation with a view to prosecution where they do not engage or co-operate fully with the current bogus non-resident deposit account inquiry programme. While no prosecutions have been initiated so far, a number of such cases have been considered and as the enquiry proceeds more will be considered.</summary>

However, there is a need to have one of the stations operating with cell accommodation at any one time. Accordingly, a strategy has been agreed with the local Garda  Síochána whereby Burnfoot will be refurbished first. It is proposed to place a contract for the works at Burnfoot Garda station at the end of 2003. It is anticipated that those works will be completed before end 2004 at which time works at Buncrana Garda station could commence.</p>

It is vital that all involved are consulted, be they staff concerned about their futures or departmental managements concerned about the delivery of the public services for which they have responsibility. The process of reaching a decision on a major initiative such as a new programme of decentralisation is still ongoing, but the Government remains committed to moving forward the progressive decentralisation of Government  offices and agencies. I am aware of the case made for Mullingar and it will be given full consideration, together with all of the submissions and representations which have been received by my Department, as part of the deliberative process.</p>

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_463">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that their principal concern in relation to liquidations is to ensure that outstanding taxes, if any, are paid. Where a liquidation relates to the winding up of a solvent company, it is to be expected that all outstanding liabilities will be paid as part of the winding up process. Where the company being wound up is insolvent the amounts recover able are determined in accordance with the Companies Acts and the Taxes Acts. As provided in these Acts, Revenue has super preferential status for all outstanding PRSI, preferential status for the most recent years outstanding fiduciary taxes, principally PAYE, VAT and relevant contracts tax, and preferential status for any one year's corporation tax.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_464">The Revenue Commissioners actively monitor all liquidations, attending most meetings of the creditors and actively participating in committees of inspection where this is considered necessary. On occasions, the Revenue Commissioners petition the courts for appropriate action where they are dissatisfied with the conduct of a liquidation or with the legality proceedings at a creditors' meeting.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_465">The Revenue Commissioners also petition the courts for the winding up of companies where Revenue is a significant creditor. Such petitions are usually made following formal demand for payment in accordance with section 214 of the Companies Act 1963, or exceptionally by application to the High Court for the appointment of a provisional liquidator. All decisions to seek the liquidation of a company are approved at senior management level in Revenue.</summary>

The process of reaching a decision on a major initiative such as a new programme of decentralisation is still ongoing, but the Government remains committed to moving forward the progressive decentralisation of Government offices and agencies.

          <p eId="para_5509">I assume that the Deputy is referring to the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) scheme. This scheme provides a range of tax reliefs in connection with the purchase and use of vehicles by drivers, passengers and organisations. It is a fundamental requirement for the above relief that the applicant must meet the medical criteria specified in the regulations and be in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer, who is an official of the local health board. In this regard it should be noted that the medical criteria relate essentially to disabilities that affect the physical mobility of the person concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_5510">Where the issue of the required certificate is refused this can be appealed to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal, an independent body whose decision is final. The medical criteria for the purposes of the tax concession under this scheme are set out in the disabled drivers and disabled passengers (tax concessions) regulations 1994. Six different types of disablement are listed under the regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them. The six types of disablement are as follows: a) persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; b) persons who are wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; c) persons without both hands or without both arms; d) persons without one or both legs; e) persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; and f) persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and has serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_471">An individual who qualifies under the medical criteria as set out above is issued with a primary medical certificate. Possession of a primary medical certificate provides for remission or repayment of vehicle registration tax plus a repayment of value added tax on the purchase of the vehicle, plus a repayment of VAT on the cost of adaptation of the vehicle. Repayment of the excise duty on fuel used in the motor vehicle and  exemption from annual road tax to local authorities are also provided for.</summary>

          <p eId="para_5518">Medical expenses are only allowable for tax relief purposes where they are not otherwise recoverable from any public or local authority or under any contract of insurance. Additionally, only expenses in excess of €125 per annum for an individual and €250 per annum for a married couple or a family are allowable for the purposes of section 469. Relief for medical expenses is available at the taxpayer's marginal rate of tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_5519">With regard to disability generally, the parent or guardian of a child who is certified medically as being permanently incapacitated from maintaining himself or herself may claim and receive the incapacitated child tax credit –€500 for the current year.</p>

In this way we can best support and sustain our domestic employment base.</p>

          <p eId="para_5533">The budget day forecast was for total tax receipts of €31,646 million in 2003. Exchequer tax receipts to end-August were €19,093 million. The end-August position showed pluses and minuses between the various tax heads. Net receipts for corporation tax were 4.2% below target reflecting a weaker than expected level of economic activity. Excise duties were 5.6% below target and VAT is about 1% below profile reflecting lower than expected levels of personal consumption. Receipts from capital taxes were 12% below target but the bulk of receipts from this source are not due until the last four months of the year.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_478">On the other hand, overall receipts from income tax were broadly on target while stamp duties were running 22.8% ahead of target due to the level of activity in the residential property  market. With the release of the end-June 2003 Exchequer returns, I said that a shortfall in revenue of up to €500 million may arise at year end. My Department will review the position as part  of the end-September Exchequer returns which will be published on 2 October.</summary>

          <p eId="para_5601">The report of the National Competitiveness Council published last November identified the key competitiveness issues for the Irish economy. The most significant issues listed by the council include rising costs, adverse exchange rate developments and inadequate infrastructure, including telecommunications and energy. While wage growth is slowing in response to economic conditions, it is still in excess of that of our main trading partners. Improvements in infrastructure have not kept pace with rapid economic growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_5602">As we are all aware, losses of competitiveness lead to lower economic growth and the risk of higher unemployment. It is important that wages growth be sufficiently flexible to adjust to the changed economic environment and be closely aligned to productivity growth, particularly in the public sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_5603">Competitiveness is fundamental to our future prosperity. In the medium term, the emphasis must be on the elimination of excessive wage growth, the provision of low inflation, productivity gains, and a competitive business environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_5604">Given that Ireland is one of the most open economies in the world, it is important that steps are taken to position the economy to maximise the benefits and growth potential from any upturn in the global economy.</p>

          <p eId="para_5606">As a small open economy our prosperity is, to a large degree, determined by our ability to supply goods and services to the global economy. In this regard, it is essential that we regain some of the lost ground in relation to competitiveness in order to protect existing jobs and attract new ones.</p>
          <p eId="para_5607">Relatively high wage growth in Ireland along with the appreciation of the euro against sterling and the dollar, has implications for Irish competitiveness. The rapid appreciation of the euro exchange rate in 2003 is likely to impact on the profit margins of many firms. Particularly exposed are those firms in the more traditional sectors of the economy, which are relatively labour intensive.</p>
          <p eId="para_5608">The Irish economy has the capacity to grow at up to 5% per annum over the medium term. Achieving growth rates of this magnitude, however, is conditional upon, <i>inter alia,</i> improvements in competitiveness. It is important that expectations in relation to wages, prices and public spending measures adapt to the newer environment of increasing international competition, weaker global demand and lower economic growth. It is also important that wages developments closely reflect productivity growth, particularly in the public sector.</p>

          <p eId="para_5625">The Department of Foreign Affairs is not aware of any application by the US authorities to transport either napalm or Mark 77 air-drop bombs through Shannon. Foreign military aircraft landing in Shannon have to comply with the stipulations that they are unarmed and carry no arms, ammunition, explosives or intelligence gathering equipment. Chartered civilian aircraft sometimes transport military cargo through Shannon. However, this primarily involves personal weapons and ammunition for those weapons. Permission for the transport of any military cargo on civilian aircraft must be obtained in advance from the Department of Transport which, in turn, consults with the Department of Foreign Affairs before reaching a decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_5626">The Government is accordingly satisfied that all aircraft in the employ of the US defence authorities are compliant with our national stipulations governing permission to avail of landing facilities in Shannon.

In the absence of specific evidence demonstrating the use of such weapons in Iraq, I cannot comment further on the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_5644">I presume the Deputy is referring to the regulation on reproductive and sexual health and rights, which was adopted by the Council of Ministers on 20 May 2003. In March 2002, the European Commission submitted a proposal to the Council and the European Parliament for a new regulation on reproductive and sexual health and rights in developing countries. The previous regulation expired on 31 December 2002 having been in force since 1997. The purpose of both the previous regulation and its replacement is to allow the Commission to continue to support programmes in developing countries in the area of reproductive and sexual health and rights. The Commission's role in relation to development co-operation is laid down in Articles 177 to 181 of the treaty establishing the European Community.</p>
          <p eId="para_5645">The previous and current regulations form an important part of the EC's development policy. In particular, the legislation addresses the specific United Nations Millennium Development Goal relating to maternal health, which calls for the reduction of maternal mortality by three quarters over the period 1990 to 2015. Throughout the developing world, and particularly in the poorest countries, hundreds of thousands of women continue to die in childbirth because health systems cannot afford proper medical care and appropriate services.</p>
          <p eId="para_5646">The current regulation, like the previous 1997 to 2002 instrument, is based on the programme of action agreed by consensus at the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development in 1994 and the "Cairo + 5" follow up conference of 1999. Ireland's position in the Council negotiations on both the current regulation and its predecessor was that they must be in strict conformity with the Cairo programme of action, which provides that abortion is not to be promoted as a family planning method and that regulations regarding abortion are solely for individual countries to decide. The Government is satisfied that the current regulation meets this requirement and that it represents a substantial contribution by the European Union towards implementation of the millennium development goals, to which the international community is committed.</p>

          <p eId="para_5648">On 20 March 2003, the President of the Security Council was informed by the permanent representatives of the US and the UK to the United Nations that coalition forces had commenced military operations in Iraq in response to Iraq's failure to comply with its disarmament obligations under relevant Security Council resolutions. These Security Council resolutions included Resolution 1441 which mandated arms inspectors to verify Iraqi compliance. This inspection process has not been completed. In their reports to the Security Council, the inspectors indicated that Iraq had failed so far to co-operate satisfactorily and that many major questions about Iraqi holding of weapons of mass destruction remain unanswered.</p>
          <p eId="para_5649">The Government made it clear, on the adoption of Resolution 1441, that it expected any decision to sanction the use of force to be taken by the Security Council itself in a further resolution. Alongside this, we recognise that the US and UK in carrying out military action claim they were doing so under an existing mandate arising from previous UN resolutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_5650">The Government has from the outset called on all parties in the conflict to respect their obligations under international law. Furthermore, Security Council Resolution 1483 "Calls upon all concerned to comply fully with their obligations under international law including in particular the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the Hague Regulations of 1907". This should be interpreted as including all relevant international legal instruments, including the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The US and UK have publicly committed themselves to doing so. However, the situation on the ground remains volatile, creating difficulties for the occupying powers in immediately meeting all their obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention and also under the 1954 Hague Convention with regard to the protection of cultural property.</p>

          <p eId="para_5652">The primary multilateral regime to promote nuclear  disarmament and to prevent proliferation is the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, NPT, which came into force in 1970. The NPT does not prohibit the possession of nuclear weapons by those states which had manufactured and exploded such weapons prior to January 1967 – the US, UK, France, Russian Federation and China. However, Article VI of the NPT requires each state party, <i>inter alia,</i> to pursue negotiations in good faith on nuclear disarmament. Non-nuclear weapon states parties have agreed not to acquire or develop nuclear weapons, non-proliferation compliance being monitored via a comprehensive safeguards agreement negotiated by each signatory with the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA.</p>
          <p eId="para_5653">India, Pakistan and Israel are not state parties to the NPT and accordingly are not bound by its provisions nor have they entered into comprehensive safeguards agreements with the IAEA. As a consequence, IAEA inspections cannot take place in these countries. In relation to India and Pakistan, Ireland strongly supports United Nations Security Council Resolution 1172 passed in June 1998 which, <i>inter alia,</i> calls on India and Pakistan to become parties to the NPT and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, CTBT, and to immediately stop their nuclear weapons development programmes, including the development of ballistic missiles capable of nuclear weapons delivery.</p>
          <p eId="para_5654">On 10 January 2003, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, DPRK, announced its "immediate withdrawal" from the NPT after it had directed IAEA inspectors to leave the nuclear site they were monitoring at Yongbyon. Ireland and its EU partners remains seriously concerned at the DRPK's nuclear programme and its failure to comply with its IAEA safeguards agreement. The EU has urged the DPRK to visibly, verifiably and irreversibly dismantle its nuclear programme, as a fundamental step to facilitate a comprehensive and peaceful solution.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_492">Proliferation concerns have also been expressed in respect of Iran following that country's failure to inform the IAEA of the scope and scale of its nuclear programme. Ireland, together with its EU partners, has called on Iran to enter into accelerated co-operation with the IAEA and provide full transparency to allow the agency to provide the necessary reassurances. On 12 September, the IAEA board of governors adopted a resolution without vote to this effect and called on Iran to ensure verification of compliance with its commitments by taking a proliferation concerns have also been expressed in respect of Iran following that country's failure to inform the IAEA of the scope and scale of its nuclear programme. Ireland, together with its EU partners, has called on Iran to enter into accelerated co-operation with the IAEA and provide full transparency to allow the agency to provide the necessary reassurances. On 12 September, the IAEA board of governors adopted a resolution without vote to this effect and called on Iran to ensure  verification of compliance with its commitments by taking all necessary actions by the end of October 2003. Contacts between the IAEA and Iran are ongoing and the director general of the agency, Dr. Mohamed El Baradei, is expected to report to the board by the end of October on the situation.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_493">At EU level, Ireland is participating actively in the elaboration of a comprehensive EU strategy on weapons of mass destruction, WMD, proliferation. The European Council in Thessaloniki adopted a declaration on this issue and agreed a set of basic principles. It is envisaged that an EU strategy to address the threat of WMD proliferation will be completed by the end of the year. Ireland places particular emphasis on the parts of the basic principles document which focus on strengthening multilateralism and the development of the role of the UN Security Council in relation to non-proliferation. We will work to ensure that the action plan being developed will promote the universalisation and reinforcement of the multilateral agreements in this area. We believe that the WMD strategy offers a valuable opportunity to give the EU a higher profile on this issue.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_494">At the UN level, much of the practical work of devising general principles on disarmament takes place in the UN disarmament and international security committee commonly known as the first committee. The first committee meets during the UN General Assembly to deal with disarmament issues on the agenda of that session, and its consultations shape the tone of the disarmament debate. Ireland is an active participant in the first committee and uses all useful opportunities to ensure that the pursuit of disarmament and non-proliferation stays at the fore of the committee's deliberations and output. In 2002, Ireland, as co-ordinator of the New Agenda Coalition, NAC, introduced two resolutions on nuclear weapons, which were both adopted by the General Assembly. The resolutions,inter alia, called upon nuclear weapon states to implement their NPT commitments, to apply the principle of irreversibility by destroying their nuclear warheads in the context of strategic nuclear reductions and avoid keeping them in a state that lends itself to possible redeployment. The resolutions also called for concrete agreed measures to reduce the further operational status of non-strategic nuclear weapons systems.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_495">As a founder member of the NAC, Ireland has made it clear that continual irreversible progress on nuclear arms reductions is a pre-requisite for promoting nuclear non-proliferation. The last NPT review conference in 2000 agreed to a final document which laid out concrete steps toward achieving the elimination of nuclear weapons. Ireland, with its New Agenda Coalition partners, was to the forefront of the negotiations leading to this agreement. We will continue to press for its full implementation in the process leading to the next NPT review conference in 2005.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_5656">Irish and EU policy towards Cuba is defined by the EU Common Position adopted in December 1996. This policy, which has not changed since 1996, aims to encourage and not to enforce by external coercion of any kind a peaceful transition to democratic pluralism, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and a sustainable increase in the living standards of the Cuban people.</p>
          <p eId="para_5657">In line with this policy, the EU remains steadfastly opposed to the unilateral US economic embargo against Cuba. This opposition is reflected in Ireland's voting record when the issue has arisen at the General Assembly of the United Nations.</p>
          <p eId="para_5658">Also consistent with the basic policy set out in the common position, and indeed in implementation of that policy, the EU was obliged in June 2003 to take a number of steps following the summary trial and lengthy prison sentences imposed on 75 dissidents earlier this year for exercising their right to freedom of speech and the summary trial and rapid execution of three ferry-boat hijackers in breach of international minimum standards for the implementation of the death penalty. The measures adopted on 5 June 2003 were: to limit bilateral high-level governmental visits; to reduce participation in cultural events; to invite Cuban dissidents to national day events at EU embassies in Havana; and to proceed to an early re-evaluation of the EU common position, which had not been due to take place until December 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_5659">On 21 July 2003, the General Affairs and External Relations Council, GAERC, confirmed the objectives of the common position as I have stated them at the outset. The Council noted that since the previous evaluation of December 2002 not only had there been no positive steps by the Cuban Government, but that the human rights situation had severely deteriorated as demonstrated by the large-scale arrests of dissidents, summary and arbitrary judicial processes and the severe sentences for the exercise of the right to freedom of speech and participation in public affairs as well as the breach of minimum standards for the administration of the death penalty.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_496">The Council also noted that since the beginning of 2003 the Cuban authorities have clamped down on private small businesses, further curtailed access to the Internet, impounded satellite televisions and confiscated foreign newspapers  and radios. The Council could not also fail to note that the previous month the Cuban authorities had mounted official mass demonstrations headed by President Castro against the embassies of two EU member states in Havana and that the Cuban state media had conducted an unacceptable campaign of personal vilification against certain EU Heads of Government.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_497">Nevertheless, the Council reaffirmed the validity of the common position's constructive engagement with Cuba as the basis of EU policy towards that country to be pursued through continuing political dialogue with a view to producing tangible results in the political, economic and civil rights spheres, as well as by means of development co-operation in order,inter alia, to improve the living standards of the Cuban people. The Irish and EU policy of constructive engagement with Cuba remains, therefore, quite unchanged.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_498">As regards health and education standards in Cuba, Ireland and its EU partners recognise the idealism which inspired the Cuban revolution, and respect its undoubted social achievements, particularly in the health and educational fields. However, we cannot accept that these achievements can be used to justify the curtailment or denial of other human rights and we believe it is necessary for the Cuban government to match those egalitarian accomplishments with similar advances across the whole sphere of human rights and fundamental freedoms.</summary>

          <p eId="para_5661">I share the Deputy's concern about the current situation in Chechnya. A number of terrorist bombings in Chechnya and in neighbouring republics in recent months have caused significant loss of life, including a suicide bombing in Znamenskoye on 13 May which killed 60 people and another suicide attack on a hospital in Mozdok on 1 August, which resulted in the deaths of 52 people. There are, at the same time, continuing and credible reports of human rights violations by Russian troops against Chechen civilians.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_499">Beginning with the adoption of a new constitution for Chechnya in March 2003, the Russian Federation has made a concerted effort to build the basis of a new political system in the republic. A technical mission from the OSCE's Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, ODIHR, noted the numerous expressions of hope from voters that the referendum would lead to a political process and bring peace and stability. On the basis of the March constitution, a  presidential election will take place in Chechnya on 5 October, and it is to be hoped that this will mark a fresh start for the Chechen people. The incoming president will need to secure the trust of the Chechen people if he or she is to be successful in bringing peace, stability and reconciliation to the region. Ireland and its EU partners believe that only a political solution will bring lasting peace to Chechnya.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_500">Ireland recognises the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation, and acknowledges the right and responsibility of its government to fight against terrorism and crime, and to protect its population. However, the fight against terrorism, in the Russian Federation as elsewhere, must be conducted in accordance with internationally-accepted human rights standards.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_501">As I stated in reply to a parliamentary question on 29 May last, Ireland, together with its partners in the European Union, supports continued dialogue with the Russian Federation on the situation in Chechnya. Ireland has raised the issue of human rights violations in Chechnya bilaterally with the Russian Federation through diplomatic channels. It has also raised the issue in a number of international fora including the European Union and the OSCE and, in March 2003, at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, UNCHR, in Geneva. The Taoiseach expressed Ireland's concerns about the situation in Chechnya to President Putin at the EU-Russia Summit in St. Petersburg on 31 May 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_502">I recognise the great interest and concern here in Ireland with regard to the situation in Chechnya. As will be clear, this interest and concern is shared by the Government. I will continue to work in all available fora to promote lasting peace and reconciliation there, in the interests of the Chechen people.</summary>

          <p eId="para_5663">The Government has repeatedly expressed its deep concern at the killing of innocent civilians and the violence which has led to the large number of deaths of children in the current conflict. The Government has made these concerns known directly to the participants on numerous occasions. The Government accords a very high priority to a final and comprehensive settlement of this problem. The Deputy may recall that, as a member of the Security Council, Ireland co-sponsored Security Council Resolution 1435 on 24 September 2002, which addressed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and, among other things, reiterated the need for respect in all circumstances for international humanitarian law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention relative  to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War.</p>
          <p eId="para_5664">In my statement of 27 September 2002, I called on the government of Israel to immediately comply in full with the requirements of Resolution 1435 and to conduct itself in a manner which is fully consistent with international humanitarian law. I have also called repeatedly for an end to terrorist attacks on Israeli civilians which have resulted in the deaths of many Israeli children. This remains the position of the Government and, as such, is consistently advocated by Ireland in meetings of the European Union, the United Nations and other relevant international bodies.</p>

          <p eId="para_5666">The J-1 visa programme is administered by the Department of Homeland Security in the United States. The Government has no involvement in the operation of the programme. However, as part of the Department's consular role to assist Irish citizens abroad, our embassy and consulates general in the United States monitor the situation of Irish J-1 visa holders closely and raise their concerns with the US authorities as necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_5667">I am aware of the difficulties experienced by the individual to whom the Deputy refers and by many of the J-1 visitors arriving in the United States in 2003, in obtaining social security numbers. I understand that these problems were not unique to Irish citizens or to this category of visa, and were encountered by visa holders from other countries also. I am informed that they arose from new procedures introduced by the social security administration last year as part of a general tightening of the regulations that apply to immigrants in the United States following 11 September which required that confirmation of an applicant's immigration status be obtained from the Department of Homeland Security before a social security number could be issued. This led to delays in the issuing of social security numbers to J-1 visa holders.</p>
          <p eId="para_5668">The embassy in Washington on my instructions took up this matter with the US State Department. Following this intervention, the Department of Homeland Security undertook to devote additional staff resources to processing requests, and I understand that this did help to overcome the difficulties.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_503">The US authorities indicated that J-1 visa holders do not require a social security number to begin work but that they must have applied for a social security number and obtained a letter from the relevant office to that effect before they can be paid. It is possible for employers to engage J-1 employees pending receipt of the actual number  but it appears that many employers were not aware of this and, in the current economic and security climate, were reluctant to take on employees who did not have a valid social security number.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_504">The US authorities also stressed that applications for the visa should be made in good time to allow for the relevant clearance to issue. The Irish organisations involved in this process have been made aware of this.

          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_5675">I propose to take Questions Nos. 424 and 425 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_5676">I have been encouraged by the significant human rights reforms adopted by the Turkish Parliament over the past two years and the commitment of the Government to complete the remaining legislative work by the end of 2003. It is important now that the legislative reforms be fully implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_5677">In 2002, Turkey adopted a series of human rights reforms which included legislation providing for the abolition of the death penalty, the abolition of torture and ill-treatment of people in custody and the lifting of restrictions on broadcasting in minority languages. Additional legislative packages approved this year include significant provisions for judicial reform, civilian control of the military, prison reform and the exercise of fundamental freedoms. I welcome these reforms and the mechanisms being put in place to monitor their implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_5678">The December 2002 European Council reaffirmed that Turkey is a candidate country destined to join the European Union on the basis of the political criteria which apply to all candidate countries. These were laid down by the Copenhagen European Council in 1993, and stipulate that a candidate country must achieve stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities. The Commission prepares an annual report on Turkey's progress towards meeting these criteria, the most recent of which, for 2002, stated that the adoption of the human rights reforms "demonstrates the determination of the majority of Turkey's political leaders to move towards further alignment with the values and standards of the European Union". It noted that these reforms had been adopted under difficult political and economic circumstances and represented a major shift in the Turkish context.</p>
          <p eId="para_5679">The Copenhagen European Council last December gave the commitment that if the European Council in December 2004 decides that Turkey has fulfilled the Copenhagen political criteria, the EU will open accession negotiations without delay. A crucial element in this decision will be the assessment of the improvement in the human rights situation and the effective implementation of the legislative reforms. We have explained to the government of Turkey that we will continue to pay close attention to developments.</p>

          <p eId="para_5681">Contacts between representatives of the Kurdish community and officials of my Department, mainly at the United Nations in New York, have taken place on various occasions. Discussions with these representatives have been wide-ranging, including such topics as the oil for food programme and developments in the General Assembly.</p>
          <p eId="para_5682">The Government has a number of concerns relating to the situation of the Kurdish people. We are working with our partners in the EU to ensure that concerns about the human rights of the Kurds are raised in contacts with the governments in the region. At the time of the most recent conflict in Iraq, I expressed the Government's concern about the potential impact of military action on Kurdish populations in the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_5683">This House adopted a motion tabled by the Government declaring its commitment to the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Iraq. We have called on all parties to any conflict to respect the provisions of international humanitarian law, in particular, the Geneva Conventions. We have also called on the United Nations to assume a central role in securing the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people and the reconstruction of Iraq, in which Ireland will play its full part.</p>

      asked the

      the action he has taken and intends to take to address the ongoing tragedy in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
      [19821/03]

          <p eId="para_5687">Progress continues to be made towards the establishment of peace and stability in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, DRC. In July, the new  transitional government comprising representatives of the government of President Kabila and of the main Congolese armed groups met for the first time and in August, the interim parliament was officially inaugurated. I welcome the meeting on 25 September between the DRC, Burundi, Uganda and Rwanda in the presence of UN Secretary General Annan in which the countries agreed to refrain from interference in each other's affairs and to prevent arms shipments to warring groups in the eastern area of the DRC.</p>
          <p eId="para_5688">In June, Operation Artemis was deployed to the eastern town of Bunia to stabilise the situation there as at the time it was spiralling downwards with serious consequences for the civilian population. This EU-led operation, the first to undertake implementation of Petersberg Tasks outside Europe, was deployed at the request of the United Nations Secretary General and on foot of UN Security Council Resolution 1484. In September, the EU-led emergency multinational force, Operation Artemis, handed over control of Bunia to a strengthened United Nations Mission in the DRC, MONUC, having fulfilled its mandate of restoring stability to the town. Ireland contributed five army officers to Operation Artemis and a proportionate share of the costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_5689">At the same time, the situation in the Ituri region and the North and South Kivus continues to be a source of concern. It is imperative that the newly formed transitional government establish its presence throughout the country and, in particular, in this north-eastern region of the DRC. To this end, I welcome the decision by the transitional government to send 3,000 police officers to the Ituri region. I also welcome the release of European development funds totalling €205 million to support the transitional government in institution-building, constitutional reform and the strengthening of the rule of law, as well as funding for health services and debt relief.</p>
          <p eId="para_5690">In July, the General Affairs and External Relations Council reiterated its determination to deploy all its instruments in support of the political process under way in the DRC. To this end, the EU is committed to providing support for the work of the Ituri interim administration and the Ituri pacification commission, support for the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration process and the launch of a local reconciliation process. The Council also asked High Representative Solana, and the Commission to consider, <i>inter alia,</i> support for the police force in Kinshasa and support for the electoral process. The Council issued a reminder that perpetrators of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide cannot go unpunished and urged all parties to refrain from any act contrary to the cease-fires agreement, in particular in the eastern part of the Congo.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_505">On 28 July, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1493 which provides MONUC with a stronger, peace enforcement mandate and a substantially increased force level of 10,800 personnel. This demonstrates a strong commitment by the international community to resolve the crisis  in the DRC. I welcome the strengthened mandate of MONUC, which will greatly contribute to the stabilisation of the situation in the Ituri region and will provide greater protection to ordinary citizens there.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_506">My Department continues to avail itself of bilateral meetings with regional and pan-African parties to stress Ireland's support for the peace process in the DRC and to encourage others to fully support the transitional institutions in that country. In August, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, met the Ugandan Foreign Minister, Mr. James Wapakhabulo, and his colleague, Investment Minister, Mr. Sam Kutesa, to discuss the situation in the DRC. Mr. Wapakhabulo emphasised the government of Uganda's support for the peace process in the DRC and its commitment to a complete disengagement from that country. The foreign minister pledged that Uganda would use its influence with all parties to positive effect and would bring to account those implicated in human rights abuses and illegal exploitation of mineral wealth in the DRC. Discussions have also taken place between my Department and the Rwandan High Commission in London at which my officials stressed the importance of Rwanda's full commitment to the peace process in the DRC as a linchpin of lasting peace in the region.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_507">The Government has provided substantial humanitarian assistance in response to the enormous suffering caused by conflict and natural disasters in DRC. Development Co-operation Ireland, DCI, the official development assistance programme of the Government, has delivered almost €5 million in emergency humanitarian aid for the people of the DRC since 2000. Much of this humanitarian aid was provided to assist the estimated 350,000 people affected by the volcanic eruptions in Goma at the beginning of 2002. Funding was provided to Irish humanitarian NGOs such as Concern, GOAL, Trócaire, as well to the Red Cross and UN agencies for the provision of food, clean water and medical supplies. In addition, under DCI's multiannual programme scheme, an estimated €1.1 million is being provided to Concern for a three year development assistance programme in the sectors of health and livelihood security.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_508">Together with its EU partners, Ireland will continue to ensure that the situation in the DRC is a priority issue in its relations with Africa and will remain so during its forthcoming Presidency of the European Union.</summary>

          <p eId="para_5712">Over the past three years the Government has substantially increased the volume of financial resources allocated to programmes to prevent the spread of HIV-AIDS in developing countries and to provide care and support to those infected with or affected by the disease. Annual funding is now in the region of €40 million and is directed at activities which are primarily focused on Africa. Ireland's support is provided through international organisations, NGOs and regional initiatives and in programme countries. The focus of our support is on developing the capacity of  partner governments and national AIDS councils in the countries concerned to prevent the spread of HIV-AIDS and to mitigate the social and economic consequences of the pandemic.</p>
          <p eId="para_5713">On 7 July last the Taoiseach and former President Clinton signed a memorandum of understanding between the Government and the William J. Clinton Presidential Foundation. They agreed on a partnership which will also involve developing country governments and will provide financial and technical support for the preparation of integrated HIV and AIDS treatment, care and prevention programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_5714">A sum of €50 million has been earmarked for this partnership with the foundation over a five-year period. The focus of this is partnership will be on Mozambique in the first instance. Funding will be allocated to agreed activities in the HIV-AIDS strategic plan of the ministry of health in Mozambique and will be released following full appraisal of this plan in-country and approval by the Development Co-operation Ireland approvals committee. Funding will not be donated to the foundation but will be directed to HIV-AIDS programmes in Mozambique in the first instance and provided through the Mozambican Government. It will be allocated from the HIV-AIDS special fund established within Development Co-operation Ireland in the wake of a pledge made by the Taoiseach at the UN General Assembly Special Session on HIV-AIDS in June 2001 in relation to the resources that Ireland would commit to dealing with this crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_5715">The William J. Clinton Presidential Foundation has made the global battle against HIV-AIDS a major area of attention. It is committed to assisting poor countries and their leadership in the creation of strategic plans, the mobilisation of international resources and the development of their internal resources to defeat the HIV-AIDS epidemic. The Government's partnership with the foundation will assist in the development of the human resources necessary to initiate and sustain treatment, care and prevention programmes and to strengthen the public health system in Mozambique. It will also facilitate the development of quality management and information sharing mechanisms that will allow these programmes to scale up rapidly while improving the quality of service delivery. Furthermore, there will be a focus on the development and implementation of pharmaceutical procurement strategies, including assistance in negotiations with pharmaceutical companies that produce patented and generic drugs.</p>

          <p eId="para_5721">I have recently received representations alleging that the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, UNFPA, was involved in supporting forced sterilisations in Peru. It was alleged that a report confirming UNFPA's involvement had been adopted by the Peruvian Congress on 10 June 2003. This report entitled, <i>Subcomision Investigadora de Personas e Institutionas en las Acciones de Anticoncepcion Quirurigica Voluntaria,</i> AQV, maintains that a forced sterilisation campaign had been operational in Peru from 1990 to 2000, with the support of the UNFPA and the Peruvian Administration which was in power at that time.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_514">I asked our permanent mission to the UN to raise the claim with UNFPA that the AQV report was adopted by the Peruvian Congress. UNFPA  replied that, at its meeting on 10 June 2003, the Human Rights Commission of the Peruvian Congress did not adopt the AQV report. It was simply discussed, and a motion was passed inviting the minister of health and the chairman of the council of ministers of Peru to a subsequent meeting of the commission to discuss this issue further.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_515">To put the AQV report in context, a sub-committee of the Peruvian Congress, created to examine the claims made in the AQV report, submitted its final report in January 2003. It concluded that the charges were invalid and were based on "error and misinformation". The sub-committee evaluated all the testimonies and documents it had received as evidence. Based on that, it reported that the complaints against UNFPA were "devoid of any foundation."  The report concluded: "In the area of family planning, UNFPA supports national programmes so that all people will have full and accurate information that enables them to exercise the right to decide freely and responsibly on the number of their children and when they will have them, as well as access to the services for doing so, both by artificial methods and by natural methods."</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_516">I am satisfied that the UNFPA abides by its internationally agreed mandate, which specifically forbids coercion, and that its programmes both in Peru and around the world are based on the principles of voluntarism. My officials will continue to monitor closely the activities of the UNFPA, including allegations relating to UNFPA's programme in Peru.</summary>

          <p eId="para_5723">The draft calendar of Council meetings which will be held in Brussels and Luxembourg during our Presidency has been circulated to our EU partners and a copy placed in the Oireachtas Library last week. The two scheduled European Council meetings will be held in Brussels.</p>
          <p eId="para_5724">As far as meetings in Ireland are concerned, I will be hosting an informal EU Foreign Ministers meeting in Tullamore on 16-17 April 2004. Six other informal ministerial meetings as well as other high level conferences will also be held in Ireland during the Presidency and I have arranged that a calendar of such high level meetings, giving details of dates and locations, be deposited in the Oireachtas Library and kept regularly updated.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_517">On the external side I envisage that we will hold five summits during our Presidency in the first half of 2004. The EU-US summit and the EU-Canada summit are likely to be hosted by the Taoiseach in Dublin. We are currently discussing suitable dates with the US and with Canada for  these summits and it appears likely that they will take place in the May-June 2004 period. The Taoiseach will also co-host the EU-Latin America and Caribbean summit with Mexican President Vicente Fox which will take place in Mexico on 28-29 May 2004. An EU-Russia and an EU-Japan Summit are also expected to take place during our Presidency in Moscow and Tokyo, respectively.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_518">We also have a broad range of commitments as regards political dialogue at foreign ministerial level. I expect to meet my counterparts from the US, Canada, Russia, Ukraine, China, Japan and Turkey among others.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_519">In addition, I will host a meeting of ASEM Foreign Ministers, which brings together EU ministers with ten of their Asian counterparts, in April in Ireland and an informal Euromed foreign ministerial, which provides an opportunity for dialogue between EU foreign ministers and their Mediterranean counterparts, on 6-7 May 2004 in Dublin Castle.</summary>

          <p eId="para_5726">I am aware of this case to which the Deputy refers. Since the arrest of the person in question my Department has been active in providing consular assistance to him and to representatives of his family. He has been visited in prison by a consular official from the honorary consul in Palma de Mallorca.</p>
          <p eId="para_5727">Most recently, and following intervention by the Irish embassy in Madrid, his mother has been granted two family prison visits during her one week stay in Ibiza. This is an exception to the normal prison regulations that allow for one family visit per month. The Irish embassy is continuing to liaise with his mother to ensure that she receives every assistance from the prison authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_5728">I can assure the Deputy that my Department, through the consular section in Dublin and the Irish embassy in Madrid, and the honorary consul in Palma de Mallorca, will continue to provide all appropriate consular assistance to the person in question and to his family.</p>

          <p eId="para_6245">Assassinations of the type carried out by Israeli forces against Palestinian figures are a breach of Israel's obligations in international law. The Deputy will recall that, in my press statement of 9 September last, I identified an end to this practise as one of the immediate steps which need to be taken if the peace process is to be revived.</p>
          <p eId="para_6246">The Israeli security cabinet's decision to expel President Arafat poses a serious threat to the Middle East peace process. President Arafat is the elected leader of the Palestinian people and should, therefore, play a central role in negotiations that would lead to a comprehensive settlement of the conflict. Any attempts by the Israelis to forcibly remove President Arafat would lead to a major upsurge in violence. Our concerns were expressed in the press statement which I issued on 12 September. We also voted in favour of a United Nations General Assembly resolution on 19 September, which demanded that Israel cease any threat to remove President Arafat. This concern was further reiterated in the Taoiseach's address to the UN General Assembly on 25 September when he told the world leaders assembled in New York that: "Threats to expel or assassinate President Arafat are deeply misguided and dangerous and can only further delay efforts to achieve a settlement."</p>

          <p eId="para_6249">The resolution called upon the authority, consistent with the charter of the United Nations and other relevant international law, to promote the welfare of the Iraqi people through the effective administration of the territory, including in particular working towards the restoration of conditions of security and stability and the creation of conditions in which the Iraqi people can freely determine their own political future. It called upon all concerned to comply fully with their obligations under international law, including in particular the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the Hague Regulations of 1907.</p>
          <p eId="para_6250">This is also the position strongly supported by the Government and expressed on numerous occasions. The occupying powers, in their support for Resolution 1483, have accepted fully their obligations and responsibilities under international law.</p>

Seeking retrospective  pardons for those 26 Irish born soldiers, who in the opinion of the Irish Shot at Dawn campaign, were unjustly executed while serving in the British Army during the Great War, is a complicated issue. The Government is sympathetic to the objective of the campaign but mindful that the matter has to be handled with care and sensitivity, particularly in terms of the relatives concerned.</p>

          <p eId="para_6257">The Government does not consider there is at present any possibility of the EU agreeing on suspension of the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement with Israel. Consensus within the European Union would be required for such a step. Furthermore, the argument has been made that such action would not serve any useful purpose and could have undesirable consequences. These might include undercutting, as far as Israel is concerned, the role which the European Union has in the peace process, blocking Palestinian trade with the European Union, and rendering the continuation of our programmes of assistance to the Palestinian Authority and people more difficult to implement.</p>
          <p eId="para_6258">Article 2 of the association agreement reinforces obligations which already fall to the signatories with respect to human rights. The European Union, especially at the meetings of the association councils with Israel, has conveyed its concerns to the Israeli authorities at the human rights implications of its security policies. Together with our partners in the Union, we will continue to take these opportunities to press the Israeli government to respect fully its obligations under international humanitarian law, in particular the fourth Geneva Convention, and under Article 2 of the association agreement.</p>

          <p eId="para_6267">The Government's concerns about the human rights situation in Turkey, including the situation of the Kurdish population, are raised regularly in our contacts with the Government of Turkey and its representatives, and in co-operation with our partners in the European Union. We continue to monitor the human rights situation through the embassy in Ankara, in the context of relations between the EU and Turkey, and through our membership of international organisations, including the Council of Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_6268">I have welcomed the significant legislative reforms in the field of human rights adopted by the Turkish Parliament over the past two years. The 2002 reform packages provided for the abolition of the death penalty, the lifting of states of emergency and the authorising of broadcasting and education in languages other than Turkish. The legislative packages approved in recent months covered judicial reform, increased civilian control of the military, prison reform and the exercise of fundamental freedoms. If fully implemented, these measures should enhance the cultural and ethnic rights of all citizens, including those of Kurdish origin. I urge the government of Turkey to take all action necessary to achieve this objective as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_6269">Turkey is a candidate country for membership of the European Union. A decision on the opening of accession negotiations will be made by the European Council in December 2004. It will be based on an assessment of Turkey's fulfilment of the Copenhagen political criteria, which require a candidate state to achieve stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities. The overall human rights situation, including that of Kurds, will be a central element of that assessment.</p>

Special representative Holkeri hopes to launch the process at a meeting in Vienna in mid-October. The EU is encouraging the provisional institutions of self-government in Pristina and the authorities in Belgrade to engage fully in the dialogue. I am convinced that a sustained dialogue can achieve practical results and help build confidence for the future of the people of Kosovo.</summary>

These concerns are shared by our partners in the EU. The United States is well aware of the Government's view that those detained at Guantanamo Bay should be treated in accordance with the provisions of international human rights and humanitarian law. These concerns have been conveyed most recently to the US embassy in Dublin by my Department last week.</p>
          <p eId="para_6274">In expressing these views, I do so as a friend of the United States. The Government recognises the danger posed by terrorists' networks such as al-Qaeda. Together with our EU partners, we are committed to working with the United States in the fight against international terrorism. However, when confronting those who abuse all forms of human rights it is important that the highest standards of international law are maintained at all times, including through scrupulous respect for international law.</p>

      the measures the Government has taken to express its concern to the Burmese govern ment at the current condition of Aung San Suu Kyi.
      [21333/03]

          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_6278">I am gravely concerned at the situation of Nobel Prize winner, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, in Burma. Deputies will be aware that she has been in custody since her re-arrest earlier in the summer. Deputies will also be aware that I issued a statement on 4 September, in which I called for her release and reiterated our belief that this is essential to the process of national reconciliation in Burma. Media reports over the past weekend have said that Aung San Suu Kyi has been released into house-arrest, at her home, following a period in hospital. I welcome this as a first step towards her full release.</p>
          <p eId="para_6279">The United Nations Secretary General's special representative for Burma, Mr. Razali Ismail, begins his latest visit to Burma today. We fully support his mission and maintain regular contact with him. It is expected that during this visit, he will have an opportunity to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi. Officials of my Department met with Dr. Sein Win, head of the Burmese government-in-exile, in September and were briefed by him and his delegation on the current situation in Burma, the road-map provided by the government-in-exile. This is the latest in a series of meetings my officials continue to have with parties concerned with Burma.</p>
          <p eId="para_6280">The EU common position on Burma, which provides for a visa ban on members of the regime and a freeze on all their financial assets in the European Union, is due for review later this month. Ireland, together with our EU partners, will discuss what further revisions may be necessary in view of recent developments there. The EU also carried out a series of démarches in June and July 2003 in the capitals of ASEAN member states and other regional players – China, Japan, India, Korea – urging them to use their influence in Burma to effect the release of Aung San Suu Kyi. In this regard, I welcome the recent efforts made by the former foreign minister of Indonesia, Ali Alatas, and by the Japanese government.</p>
          <p eId="para_6281">The issue of Burma was also discussed at the ASEM foreign ministers meeting in Indonesia in July 2003, and Ministers called, in their conclusions, on the government of Burma to release Aung San Suu Kyi immediately and to resume its efforts towards national reconciliation and the restoration of democracy. Discussions with China on the issue of Burma recently took place at official level in New York. The EU expressed its particular concern at the downward spiral perceivable in Burma, at the deteriorating economic situation, the political stalemate, the human rights violations and the worrying humanitarian situation. The EU side also conveyed its disappointment at the consistently negative Burmese reaction to events and the lack of credible commitment to change from the regime there.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_546">At the External Relations Council in April 2003, the EU member states decided to make an  exception to the ban on official visits to Burma, to allow an EU troika, at political level, to travel there to convey the EU's position to all interested parties. However, concerns about the level at which the troika would be received following the events of 30 May 2003 and the effectiveness of such a mission at that time led EU partners to decide subsequently that it would not go ahead. The possibility of a troika mission, at some future date, has not been ruled out. We will continue to take every opportunity to register our serious concern at the practices of the Burmese regime and with our EU partners, closely review events in Burma.</summary>

However, my Department is willing to explore with the school authorities concerned how aspects of the proposed centre could be developed in the context of available resources.

Due to the commercial sensitivity of the process involved, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on any individual aspect at this time. However, the report is being considered in the school planning section in the context of framing the capital programme for 2004. Any decision to proceed with a purchase will be dependent on the financial allocation for 2004 and subsequent years and the competing priorities for that funding. In the meantime, my Department will continue to grant aid the use of temporary accommodation by the school at a rate of 95% of the cost.</p>

          <p eId="para_6325">I propose to take Questions Nos. 465 to 469, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_6326">The Data Protection Amendment Act, 2003, which came into effect on 1 July 2003, brought manual records within the scope of data protection legislation and strengthened the rights of data subjects, persons whose personal data are retained on a file. Every person who holds personal data, whether manual or otherwise, is bound by the provisions of the Data Protection Acts.</p>
          <p eId="para_6327">In August 2003, my Department issued an advisory notice to schools in order to ensure that school management authorities were aware of their obligations under the Data Protection Acts, 1998 and 2003. It is advisable for schools to have a written data protection policy in place which sets out the types of personal data they collect, their purpose/s for collecting the data and the persons or bodies to which they are likely to disclose it. Data subjects should be made aware of the policy, and, in the case of data pertaining to the student and/or the student's parent/guardian, the process of making them aware of the policy should commence, ideally, in the context the enrolment process.</p>
          <p eId="para_6328">The Data Protection Acts allow data subjects to establish the existence of personal data relating to them, have access to, and be given copies of the data – with limited exceptions and to have inaccurate data rectified or erased. Sensitive personal data may also be obtained, processed and disclosed by a school where the principal is required to do so under an enactment, for example, the Education Welfare Act, 2000. Where the provisions of such an enactment apply, therefore, the consent of the data subject is not required.</p>
          <p eId="para_6329">There are modifications to the right of access in the interest of the data subject or the public interest, designed to protect the individual from hearing anything about himself/herself which might cause serious harm to his or her physical or mental health or emotional wellbeing. The office of the Data Protection Commissioner should be contacted regarding any queries on the legislation or its application, including complaints in relation to schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_6330">Under the procedures for hearing and determining appeals under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998, a board of management will be asked to submit any information or documentation which it considers may be relevant to the appeal, including, where appropriate, a statement outlining the reasons for the decision of the board of management. Information submitted by the board of management may also include relevant school records, documentation relating to any local procedures used, or such psychological or medical reports as may be held by the school in respect of the pupil concerned.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_548">All information and documentation provided by the appellant and by the board of management to assist the appeal is treated in strict confidence  and, save as otherwise provided by law, the appeals administration unit will not disclose such information or documentation to a person who is not party to the appeal without the consent of the appellant or board of management as the case may be.</summary>

          <p eId="para_6333">I propose to take Questions Nos. 470 and 471 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_6334">There were 48 primary schools included in the school building programme for 2002 where major building projects were either to proceed to tender stage or where tenders had already been accepted on publication of the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_6335">It became clear in late 2002 that the funding allocation for 2003 might be less than anticipated. On this basis, it was prudent therefore not to proceed in late 2002 with any projects that had not gone to tender or reached construction stage and to defer further progress of these projects until the funding landscape was more certain. Of the 48 primary school projects concerned, 28 had advanced to construction during 2002. Of the remaining 20 primary school projects where progress was paused, eight are part of the large scale primary school projects scheduled to proceed to construction in 2003 while the remaining 12 projects are still at architectural planning stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_6336">Had the eight primary school projects that are part of the large scale primary school projects in the 2003 building programme advanced to construction in 2002, the costs incurred in that year would have been determined chiefly by the month in which construction commenced. If these projects had been allowed to proceed in late 2002, the bulk of the costs would have been incurred during 2003 at an estimated cost of almost €7 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_6337">It is not possible to provide a similar estimate in respect of the 12 primary school projects that did not proceed in 2002 but are included in the architectural planning section of the 2003 school building programme. It is not the practice of my Department to publish cost estimates in relation to such projects in advance of tenders, as to do so could compromise the competitive tendering process.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_549">On the second level school building programme in 2002 a saving of €12 million was declared and while none of the major projects in the post-primary sector were deferred a number of projects did not advance as quickly as anticipated. As part of a large capital programme difficulties of this nature arise due to a broad range of factors including difficulties relating to ownership of sites not finalised to allow construction to commence, delays in signing building contracts, projects not commencing on due dates, poor weather conditions, reduction in the size of projects and project reviews due to demographic changes.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_550">The list of the eight primary school projects deferred from 2002 and included in the 2003 school building programme under large scale projects that are scheduled to proceed to construction are Scoil Aghina, Macroom, Cork, Dunmanway Model School, Cork, Cnoc na Naomh, Gortahork, Donegal, Our Lady's Abbey, Adare, Limerick, Yellow Furze NS, Beauparc, Meath, Ballyfeeney NS, Roscommon, Roxboro NS, Roscommon and Scoil Ioseph Naofa Templeraine, Wicklow.</summary>

          <p eId="para_6349">While percentages in relation to the exact number of Travellers who leave school early is not readily available, support is provided for an estimated 5,900 Traveller children at primary level including junior Traveller education centres and special schools for travellers, an estimated 1,600 Traveller children at second level, 955 in senior Traveller training centres and 220 in Youthreach, while current CSO figures indicate a population of 6,593 Traveller children between the ages of 5 to 14 years and 4,850 Traveller young people between the ages of 15 to 24 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_6350">It is acknowledged that the drop out rate for Traveller children has been unacceptably high. The factors contributing to early school leaving among Travellers and identified by surveys include nomadism, insufficient achievement at primary level, Traveller culture and identity not being validated in the mainstream curriculum, housing and accommodation issues including unsuitable conditions for home study and reduced levels of parental support.</p>
          <p eId="para_6351">My Department's policy in relation to the education of Travellers is that all school-going Traveller children should be fully integrated into and educated in mainstream education provision. Resources amounting to approximately €40 million annually are provided to support the education of Travellers in the ordinary school system. These special resources include resource teachers for Travellers, enhanced capitation grants, transport, information technology, parental support through the visiting teacher service for Travellers, psychological assessments, etc.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_555">The 1995 Task Force on the Traveller Community made 167 recommendations in the field of Traveller education, more than half of the total number in the report. This is a reflection of the complexity of the education service provision, from early years to adult, from formal schooling to youth work. If we are to successfully address the on-going and emerging challenges, this must be balanced with innovation and fresh thinking. I want to ensure the highest standards of practice possible and at the same time have a cost effective educational service for Travellers. The  development and implementation of a Traveller education strategy has the potential to guarantee maximum benefit to Travellers and reasonable cost to the Government.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_556">My Department is committed to developing a five year Traveller education strategy, including an evaluation of existing initiatives in this area. Work has commenced in developing a framework for the strategy and it is expected that the scope and organisational structure for the strategy exercise will be agreed shortly. The main focus of the Traveller education strategy exercise will be to review/evaluate existing activities, the wide range of inputs, the quality of outcomes and the experience of Traveller learners within the education system.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_557">The strategy will provide recommendations on the way forward in relation to Traveller education, taking account of the complexity of the issues involved, the history of provision and existing measures and recommend a phased implementation plan. Clear objectives will be set and it is envisaged that any baseline data required to support implementation of the strategy will be identified and the required arrangements to benchmark performance against these baseline data during the five year implementation period will be outlined. The outcome should provide a more integrated approach across all sectors, greater retention and attainment of Travellers in education and improved value for money from the considerable investment in this area.</summary>

          <p eId="para_6353">The total annual amount paid in respect of fee-charging secondary schools is €77.5 million. Of this sum approximately €68.5 million relates to salaries and allowances of teachers. The balance includes the Protestant block grant, funding towards support services such as secretarial and caretaking services and grants towards supervision arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_6354">The payment of teachers salaries is part of a complex scheme of funding for fee-charging schools, which has traditionally sought to balance considerations of equity, pragmatism and State support for minority religions. Teachers in fee-charging schools, irrespective of the denominational ethos of the school, are paid by the State. This may well reflect a long-standing pragmatism that the State would be required to provide teachers for the pupils in question were they located within the free education scheme.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_558">There are 58 fee-charging second level schools in the country, of which 21 are Protestant. The latter schools receive funding by way of the Protestant block grant, which has its origins in the  desire of the State to enable students of the Protestant persuasion to attend schools which reflect their denominational ethos. The block grant includes payments in respect of capitation and these schools also qualify for payment of such grants as the transition year support grant and secretarial and caretaking grants. Fee-charging schools not embraced by the Protestant block grant do not qualify for payment of capitation or related supports. This support has been a long standing feature of our education system and one continued by successive Governments. I have no plans at this stage to withdraw State support for the payment of teachers in fee-charging schools. Accordingly, I will not be bringing proposals to Cabinet.</summary>

It is my intention to ensure that available educational resources are targeted at the most disadvantaged people in the education system at all levels. My objective is to ensure that all young people leave the education system with a high quality education and related qualifications to support their full participation in society and in the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_6357">My overall approach to tackling educational disadvantage is set in the context of the Government's National Action Plan Against Poverty and Social Exclusion 2003-2005 and the latest partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, which contains a special initiative focused on literacy, numeracy and early school leavers. Some €460 million is being provided by my Department in 2003 for programmes specifically designed to tackle educational disadvantage in accordance with the strategies outlined in the NAPSincl and Sustaining Progress.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_559">I fully recognise the importance of early intervention as a means of preventing future educational disadvantage and at pre-school level my Department continues to support a number of early intervention programmes including the Early Start Project which caters for pupils aged three to four years who are most at risk in areas of social disadvantage. My Department has also provided a budget of €3.4 million over a three year period for the Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education, which was established in September 2001. The centre is charged with developing appropriate quality standards in relation to the wide range of issues affecting early childhood education, in pursuance of the objec tives in the White Paper on early childhood education Ready to Learn (1999).</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_560">The centre will also develop appropriate forms of early intervention and support for children from disadvantaged backgrounds and children with disabilities, building on the experience of existing programmes. It is envisaged that the recent OECD Review of Early Childhood Education and Care, which will be published shortly, will also inform policy and programme development in this sector and will assist the work of the Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_561">At primary school level, my Department has provided more than €70 million in 2003 for disadvantaged programmes such as the disadvantaged areas scheme, the home school liaison scheme and the giving children an even break programme. Under GCEB, 2,350 participating schools are benefiting from a range of additional supports including teacher posts and financial supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school. Schools included in the GCEB programme and already in receipt of additional resources under the disadvantaged areas scheme and-or breaking the cycle pilot project retain their entitlements under these schemes.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_562">The main programme within my Department for tackling early school leaving is the school completion programme which was introduced in 2002. The objective of the SCP is to provide a range of interventions in areas of disadvantage that support the retention of young people in education. Eligible schools were selected on the basis of their retention rates from the Department's post-primary pupil database. Schools are grouped into 82 clusters of one or more second-level schools and their major feeder primary schools. At present, 400 schools have been included in the SCP – 112 post-primary and 288 primary – and total funding of €23 million has been provided for the programme in 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_563">In all this work I am advised by the statutory educational disadvantage committee set up under the Education Act, 1998, to advise on the policies and strategies to be adopted to identify and correct educational disadvantage. This committee, chaired by Dr. Áine Hyland, brings together experts from across the community of education interests and is a very important resource for me in ensuring that real progress is made in this area. The committee is currently undertaking a "root and branch" review of all of the disadvantaged schemes operated by my Department in order to ensure optimum synergy and integration. In March 2003, the committee submitted a report to me on the issue of teacher supply and staffing in disadvantaged settings. This report is currently under consideration.</summary>

Under the Act, the National Educational Welfare Board was established to ensure that every child attends school regularly or otherwise receives an education.

A management team was put in place earlier this year. Some 36 new staff are currently being recruited, which will bring the total number of staff delivering educational welfare services nationally to 73.

          <p eId="para_6377">My Department, in the context of improving customer service to teachers, decided to introduce revised cheque and payslip stationary for primary teachers in August 2003. This development had the support of the teacher union and management authorities. The new payslip is laid out in a format that is much more legible than the old payslip and the introduction of pressure sealing provided enhanced security and confidentiality. The new payslip was introduced with the upgrading of the computer system.</p>
          <p eId="para_6378">In view of the changes to the payslip stationery, it was decided to issue a leaflet to primary teachers to inform them of the changes. Informing teachers of the changes to the new payslip facilitated a smooth transition to the new arrangements. The cost of printing the information leaflet was €6,994 including value added tax. Overall, my Department has received a favourable response from teachers to the introduction of the new payslip.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_570">There has been a major increase in the past number of years in the level of additional teaching resources made available by my Department  to schools in order to assist them in catering for children with special educational needs. This positive intervention has provided very significant additional educational support from highly qualified teachers in schools across the country. These additional appointments do however bring with them the need for additional training in the special needs area and this is being addressed on an ongoing basis. There is a range of programmes in place and additional programmes are being planned.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_571">Since 1994, a national programme of training for learning support teachers has been in place. At present, six centres – two universities and four colleges of education – provide postgraduate courses for teachers at primary and post-primary levels. In 2000, guidelines for learning support teachers were issued to schools and a major training programme based on the guidelines is well under way. Learning support teachers, resource teachers and whole school staff are included in this training programme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_572">In the current academic year, diploma courses in special educational needs are being provided for teachers at St. Patrick's College Drumcondra, St. Angela's College Sligo, Mary Immaculate College Limerick, Church of Ireland College of Education Rathmines and at NUI, Belfield. An induction programme for newly appointed resource teachers in primary schools is also under way in the current school year. This programme of training is delivered by the colleges of education.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_573">My Department has recently established a special education support service with a view to supporting teachers working with children with special educational needs. In addition to the above, my Department provides funding for a wide range of shorter courses for teachers in the special needs area. These are mainly provided through the network of education centres, through teachers' organisations and through the programme of summer courses for primary teachers. In this regard, four e-learning courses were provided on a pilot basis during July and August of this year for teachers in the areas of autism, dyslexia, inclusion and ADHD. The courses were delivered online and 900 teachers availed of them.</summary>

          <p eId="para_6388">The institution referred to by the Deputy incorporates two schools, a recognised post-primary school and a private primary school. The post-primary school qualifies for payment of teacher salaries in the normal way. Up to 1994 it was technically permissible to operate a four year junior cycle in post-primary schools although in practice very few schools did this. Subsequently the junior cycle was restricted to three years on a mandatory basis. In this instance the school continued a four year junior cycle post 1994, in the mistaken belief that it had permission to do so, and thus its pupil numbers for purposes of teacher allocation were overstated. This came to light following examination of the school's return for 1997 and the teacher allocation was regularised from 1998.</p>
          <p eId="para_6389">The reduction in the school's quota of grant aided posts brought about by the restriction on the duration of the junior cycle did not affect the entitlement of permanent teachers employed in 1994 to continue in their posts for so long as they fulfilled the terms of their contracts.</p>

          <p eId="para_6392">The family to whom the Deputy refers resides 0.8 miles from the route of service to Carnacon national school, their nearest school. As a rule primary school transport routes are planned so that, as far as possible, no eligible child will have more than 1.5 miles to travel to a pick-up point. Pupils living off the main route of a service are generally expected to make their own way or to be brought to convenient pick-up points along the main route. Home pick-ups were never envisaged as being part of the school transport scheme as the cost involved on a countrywide level would be prohibitive.</p>
          <p eId="para_6393">As the family concerned is considered to have a reasonable level of service in the context of the general operation of the school transport scheme, and as extra cost would be involved in rerouting the service, I regret that it is not open to my Department to alter the route as requested.

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_574">In 1998 my Department, in consultation with the Radon Protection Institute of Ireland, took a proactive approach to identifying and eradicating radon in schools. This commenced with my Department commissioning the RPII to conduct a survey of radon levels in all primary and post-primary schools. This survey predated legislation on the issue of radon in the workplace by over two years and the action taken exceeds any legislative requirement in that all schools, regardless of whether or not they were situated in areas of high radon, were invited to be tested. In addition, in June 2001, circular letter 46/01 was issued to  all boards of management informing them of my Department's initiative and advising schools on the course of action necessary for radon mitigation. All remediation works carried out are fully funded by my Department.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_575">During the course of the survey, 4,072 schools were invited to participate, of which 3,798 schools responded and were sent detectors. Radon surveys were subsequently completed in 3,444 schools. Approximately 240 schools had radon concentrations above the workplace reference level of 400 Bq/m. All 240 schools were advised to secure the services of suitably qualified personnel to carry out all remedial works specified by a consultant architect. Some 90% of these schools have since been remediated and the remaining 10% are expected to commence remediation work shortly.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_576">Where radon levels in classrooms were between 200 Bq/m and 400 Bq/m, my Department issues a grant of €191 per classroom advising schools to install suitable vents in these classrooms. Some 898 schools qualified for grant aid under this category.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_577">Post-remediation measures will be a continuous feature of this project. Initially, following completion of remediation works, post-remediation measurements were carried out by the RPII within a three to nine month period after remediation had taken place. This process is ongoing and the RPII continue to carry out post-remediation testing in schools. Consultations are ongoing between my Department and the RPII on the issue of the long-term efficiency of radon mitigation systems which have been installed in schools and also to ensure that radon levels remain below the accepted reference levels.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_578">A number of schools to date have not responded to the invitation to have radon measurements carried out. My Department's building unit and the RPII are currently addressing the most appropriate way of having these schools examined and remediated, where necessary. I would also like to assure the Deputies that my Department's building unit ensures that radon barriers are included in the designs of all new school buildings.</summary>

          <p eId="para_6413">Under Giving Children An Even Break, schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils, including the school referred to by the Deputy, are supported, where necessary, through staff allocations to implement a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes – infants through second class – and a pupil teacher ratio of 27:1 in senior classes (third through sixth classes).</p>
          <p eId="para_6414">In line with normal staffing arrangements for national schools, teacher post allocations for the purpose of Giving Children An Even Break in respect of the 2003-04 school year are determined by reference to enrolments in junior and senior classes at 30 September 2002. On the basis of this approach and in order to enable the school to adhere to the maximum class size guidelines for all junior and senior classes, two teaching posts under Giving Children An Even Break have been allocated for the 2003-04 school year. An independent appeals board was established to adjudicate on appeals from boards of management on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. The appeals board operates independently of the Minister and the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_6415">The staffing at St. John of God's national school for the 2003-04 school year was considered by the appeals board. The board, having considered the appeal in accordance with the criteria outlined in my Department's Circular 19/02, was satisfied that a departure from the staffing schedule is not warranted in this case. The board of management of the school was notified of the decision of the appeals board on 3 July 2003. The decision of the appeals board is final. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent appeals board.</p>

          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_6467">I propose to take Questions Nos. 521 to 524, inclusive, and 527, 540, 541 and 544 together.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_580">I think it is important that, in responding to the various issues raised by the Deputy, I begin by again reiterating that I, together with my colleagues in Government, remain fully committed to ensuring that victims of abuse are helped to find peace and healing in their lives and that those responsible for abuse are held accountable. These two factors have been the driving force behind all of the Government's initiatives in this area since the Taoiseach's apology in May 1999 and will continue to be such into the future. In order for the final report of the commission to be relevant to survivors, and for it to assist them in  reaching some form of closure, it is important that it be produced within a reasonable timeframe.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_581">I greatly regret that Ms Justice Laffoy reached the conclusion that she could no longer continue as chairperson of the commission. I have previously indicated that Ms Justice Laffoy's resignation was a matter of considerable surprise to me and to the Government. I have also acknowledged and expressed my thanks for the commitment she has given in carrying out her role as chairperson. I would add that Ms Justice Laffoy continues in place as chairperson of the commission until the publication of an interim report by the commission, which is expected in November. In the circumstances it is not correct to imply that the commission is without a chairperson.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_582">Furthermore, on 26 September 2003 the Government appointed Mr. Seán Ryan, senior counsel, as chairperson designate of the commission. Mr. Ryan will immediately undertake his own independent review of the commission which I expect to be completed within eight weeks. In carrying out this review Mr. Ryan will take account of the interests of victims of abuse, the need for the commission to complete its work within a reasonable period of time and in a manner consistent with a proper investigation without incurring exorbitant costs.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_583">It was therefore with the needs of survivors uppermost in mind, and the fact that the commission, based on the resources then available to it, estimated that it would take between eight and 11 years to complete its work, that the Government undertook the review process. A report by the commission in that timeframe would be far too late for many of those for whom it was established. In addition, the estimated legal costs of €200 million, if the process were to take that amount of time, was also a factor. I would add that, in relation to the question of increasing the staffing resources of the commission, the Government was concerned that the provision of additional resources in itself may not be enough to ensure that the investigation committee could complete its work in a timely manner.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_584">It is my intention to introduce amending legislation to reflect any changes that are necessary to enable the commission to complete its work in a reasonable timeframe and without incurring exorbitant costs. This legislation will also take account of the awaited judgment in the High Court challenge to the Commission to Inquire Into Child Abuse taken by the Congregation of Christian Brothers.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_585">While I accept that the review process has created some uncertainty for the commission, it is my view that spending some time now on finding an approach that will work is time well spent. In an attempt to counteract this uncertainty for the commission, it was advised of the progress of the review at regular intervals.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_586">In relation to the Deputy's request for all relevant current information in relation to the resig nation of Ms Justice Laffoy, the Government, in its response to Ms Justice Laffoy's letter advising it of her intended resignation, published correspondence with the commission dating back to December 2002 and the announcement of the review of the commission.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_587">I believe that while nobody would have wished for events to take the course that they have taken, it is important now to focus on the future rather than the past. In this regard I remain committed to ensuring that the process of review will be completed as quickly as possible and that appropriate amending legislation will be enacted which will allow for the completion of the work of the investigation committee within a reasonable timescale and without incurring exorbitant costs.</summary>

          <p eId="para_6472">Due to the special position of Irish in the Constitution there is a constitutional obligation to provide for the central role of Irish as the first language in schools and to respect pupils' rights in this matter.

        <summary eId="sum_590">I look forward to the report from the NCCA on the review of senior cycle education. On the basis of the report's recommendations I will decide what action should be taken to meet the evolving language needs of a multicultural learning society while at the same time recognising that each citizen has a constitutional right to access his/her heritage and to enrich it within the overall provisions of the educational system.</summary>

          <p eId="para_6528">Every effort was made by my Department to ensure that all children with special educational needs due to start school this September were enabled to do so. To that end, priority was given over the summer period to the processing of applications for new entrants. On receipt of the supporting documentation, decisions on these new entrant cases issued between 18 and 27 August 2003. By the end of August, all complete applications in respect of new entrants to schools had been responded to. However, in some instances, delays occurred because no supporting professional reports were provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_6529">There were instances also where applications were not received until close to the closing date of 31 August. Where all necessary documentation was submitted, responses issued in these cases, also. Where officials in the special education section of my Department were made aware of particular difficulties surrounding the attendance at school of a new entrant pupil, my officials sought supporting documents and processed the application as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_6530">Some schools may find that, due to pupils with special educational needs having left or leaving the school, either teaching or special needs assistant resources should already have been or now fall to be suppressed. Where such schools have submitted an application for additional resources in the period 15 February to 31 August 2003, they may retain the surplus resources up to the level of resources applied for in the above period.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_597">The Government has committed very significant levels of resources to schools in recent years.  Since 1999, when an automatic response to support pupils with special educational and care needs was introduced, in excess of 2,300 resource teachers and almost 5,500 full-time and part-time special needs assistants, SNAs, have been allocated. In addition, the number of learning support teachers now stands at 1,531, enabling a learning support service to be accessed by every primary school pupil in the country. This is tangible evidence of the Government's commitment to facilitate such children to benefit from education to the greatest extent possible.</summary>

          <p eId="para_6541">My Department allocates teaching resources to vocational education committees to support the delivery of education programmes in the prison system. Such allocations are made under the heading of Co-operation Hours with other Institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_6542">A total of 214.24 whole-time equivalent teaching posts has been allocated to this service for the 2003-04 school year. The allocation to the service for the 2002-03 school year was 221.3 whole-time equivalent teacher posts.</p>
          <p eId="para_6543">The allocation of teaching resources under the co-operation heading has to be managed within the overall teaching resource available to my Department and in the context of the cap on public sector numbers generally. This inevitably requires prioritisation in the utilisation of available resources. In this context, I am satisfied that the very small reduction in the allocation to the Prison Service is not unreasonable and I understand that arrangements have been made within the service to maintain a satisfactory level of programme delivery for the coming year. A list of the allocations granted to vocational education committees in respect of individual prisons is being prepared and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p>

Children of compulsory school-going age must have a place in a national school and overall there are more than enough places available. Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_598">It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 which, subject to very limited exceptions, prohibits schools from discriminating against people in relation to a num ber of matters including the admission or the terms or conditions of admission of a person as a student to the school. Where a board of management refuses to enrol a student in a school the parent of the student, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science. A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases appeals must be dealt with in 30 days. Where appropriate, the Secretary General may give whatever directions to the board of management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of. The parent of the children concerned should raise the matter of their enrolment with the chairperson of the board of management of the school.</summary>

These guidelines lay considerable stress on the use of suspensions and expulsions only as a last resort. Each board of management is responsible for formulating, in consultation with parents, a fair and efficient code of behaviour. This code should ensure that the individuality of each child is accommodated, while acknowledging the right of each child to education in a relatively disruption free environment. This code should include provision for dealing with serious breaches of discipline and continuously disruptive pupils. The report on discipline, commissioned by my Department and completed by Dr. Maeve Martin, deals comprehensively with the issue of discipline in schools, and sets out models of best practice in this area.

          <p eId="para_6604">My Department operates three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for students attending third level education as follows: the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme and the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees. The higher education grants scheme is administered by the local authorities; the other two schemes are administered by the vocational education committees and, in the case of the third level trainees scheme, assisted by the institutes of technology. The cost of the three schemes in 2002 was €120 million. Students who are entering approved courses for the first time are normally eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions regarding age, residence, means and nationality. My Department also meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending approved full-time undergraduate courses. The cost of this provision in 2002 was €240 million.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_599">My Department has responsibility for promoting access and participation opportunities for students in higher education and on PLC courses. Under the social inclusion measures in the national development plan, there is provision for a third level access fund totalling €121 million, over the period 2000 to 2006, aimed at tackling under-representation by three target groups: students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students, students with disabilities. The report of the action group on access to third level education, published in 2001, sets out a blueprint for the development of a co-ordinated framework to promote access. The third level access fund comprises the following funds-measures: special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, the ESF-aided student assistance fund, the ESF-aided fund for students with disabilities; the ESF-aided millennium partnership fund for disadvantage.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_600">Since 1997, spending on third level access measures funded directly by the Department of Education and Science has been increased from €500,000 million to €24 million in 2002. By any standards this represents a quantum leap in the commitment of resources. The provision for 2003 is €26 million, an increase of €2 million, 8%, on the 2002 outturn.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_601">I was pleased to announce, on 25 May 2003, a new package of measures costing €42 million in a full year to further address and ameliorate the problems facing students from low to moderate income households in accessing third level education. This package combines substantial improvements in the level and coverage of the maintenance grant for those on low to moderate incomes, with increases in the level of "top-up" grant for those who are most disadvantaged. The main provisions arising from the €42 million package are: an increase of 15% in the maintenance grant, to give a maximum grant of €2,885, benefiting, it is estimated, approximately 56,000 students; significant increases in the reckonable income limits and in the allowance by which the income limits may be increased for each dependant where two or more children are in further or higher education; the introduction of a revised income limit schema, to include the following threshold levels; (i) a new "part maintenance, 75%, and full fees", (ii) an upgrading of the "full fees only" income limit to become a "part maintenance, 25%, and full fees" entitlement.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_602">The top income limit has been increased from €36,897 to €40,000, ensuring that a significantly higher number of students from households with moderate incomes will not have to pay the student service charge; significant improvements have been effected in the special rates of maintenance grant, or "top-up grants", for students from disadvantaged backgrounds: the higher, non-adjacent rate has been increased to €4,495 an amount equal to the maximum personal rate of social welfare unemployment assistance. The adjacent rate has been increased to €1,800. These  increases represent "top-ups" on the ordinary grant of €1,610 and €645 respectively; the annual income threshold for the special rates of grant has been increased by 10.8% to €13,760.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_603">I believe that this substantial package of measures will provide the opportunity, in an unprecedented manner, for students from disadvantaged backgrounds to achieve their full potential in the education system.</summary>

          <p eId="para_6611">I propose to take Questions Nos. 591 and 674 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_6612">There are no plans to change the status of Waterford Institute of Technology. My Department, however, continues to work with Waterford Institute of Technology in developing and upgrading the institute. In July 1996 the Government approved, in principle, the recommendations in the report of the steering committee on the future development of higher education, as a benchmark for future planning in the sector. The steering committee concluded that an upgrading and expansion of Waterford Regional College, now Waterford Institute of Technology, represented the most appropriate response to the higher education needs of the south-east region. The committee's report also recommended an increase in student places, an increase in degree level awards and a change of title. It was recommended that the major focus of expansion be at degree level. It stated that such provision would place the college at the top end of the spectrum in terms of provision of degree places and would enable the region to reach the national average participation rate in degree programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_6613">The Government accepted these recommendations. The provision, in both the total number of places and in degree level courses, in Waterford Institute of Technology, has been expanded annually and incrementally in line with available resources. In this regard, figures supplied to my Department by Waterford Institute of Technology indicate that in the region of 40% of students enrolled on full-time certificate, diploma, degree and postgraduate courses are enrolled on courses at degree and postgraduate levels. These measures, combined with the change of title of the college provide the necessary status and capacity for the institute to meet the identified higher education needs of the region over the coming years. Consistent with this approach, WIT is among the first institutes of technology to be given authority to make its own educational awards under the terms of the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999.</p>

          <p eId="para_6624">In accordance with section 10 of the Education Act 1998, I may designate a school to be recognised for the purposes of this Act under certain conditions as outlined in the Act, for example, Section 10(2)(<i>e</i>) states “that the school complies with health safety and building standards as are determined by law and any further standards as are determined from time to time by the Minister”. Section 10(2)(<i>f</i>) states “ that the patron agrees that the school shall operate in accordance with such regulations as may be made by the Minister from time to time under section 33 and with this Act and with any other terms and conditions as may reasonably be attached to recognition by the Minister”. The current practice and procedures in relation to newly established primary schools is that the provision of interim accommodation during the period of provisional recognition is a matter for the school patron and is, accordingly an integral part of the proposal being sponsored by the patron.

          <p eId="para_6628">The process of assessing and meeting the need for new educational facilities at primary or post-primary level in any given area requires a detailed examination of all relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends, housing developments and existing school provision in the general area.</p>
          <p eId="para_6629">As part of the needs determination process, the Minister for Education and Science is included among the prescribed authorities to whom local authorities are statutorily obliged to send draft development plans or proposed variations to development plans. My Department monitors these plans and meets with local authorities, as required, to establish the location, scale and pace of major housing developments. An assessment is carried out of the likely implications of such developments on the capacity of existing schools and their potential for expansion to meet emerging needs. If deemed appropriate, the local authority is requested to reserve a site for extra educational provision in the form of a new school or schools. In this way, every effort is made to ensure that there is adequate existing provision, or that timely arrangements can be made to extend capacity where necessary. Liaison with existing schools is also an important part of the process, as school authorities would usually alert my Department where, in their view, the need for additional accommodation is anticipated.</p>
          <p eId="para_6630">As a specific part of the process, school planning section works closely with the four local authorities in the Dublin region in monitoring demographic changes and assessing the likely impact on primary and post-primary school provision of planned new developments. A dedicated forum, the Dublin school planning committee, chaired by school planning section interacts with the Dublin local authorities. This forum comprises representatives of the local authorities in Dublin together with representatives of the patron bodies of primary schools. It meets three times a year.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_605">At primary level, where my Department has established the need for new school provision and the matter has not been the subject of an application by local promoters, the case is generally taken up with the established patron bodies to determine their interest. At second level, the options available are a community school, a community college and a voluntary secondary school. Generally, the model chosen in each case is determined following local consultation.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_606">With regard to the patronage of a school, this issue may be determined in a number of ways. Historically, schools at primary and post-primary level were predominantly denominational in character and privately owned. The development of a network of second-level schools under the aegis of vocational education committees and, more recently, the emergence of all-Irish and multi-denominational primary schools under State ownership, have added to the variety of patronage and trusteeship.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_607">Going forward, the entire organisation and structures of the planning and building unit of my Department are being refocused. The intention is to permit more proactive planning by disaggregating to a much greater extent the planning function from the operational or delivery function thus permitting the school planners to plan in a more coherent and strategic manner and by drawing together first and second level needs determination. The ultimate aim is to map the future strategic shape of the educational landscape to assist in informing critical investment decisions in a demonstrably public way.</summary>

Additional supporting documentation was received in the Department on 22 September 2003 and the case is now being reviewed by the national educational psychological service.

          <p eId="para_6646">Teacher allocations to second level schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. Each school management authority is required to organise its teaching timetable and subject options having regard to pupils needs within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. The rules for allocating teach ing resources provide that where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments, my Department will consider applications for additional short-term support. An independent appeals mechanism is available to school authorities which wish to appeal the adequacy of their teacher allocation.</p>
          <p eId="para_6647">The school in question applied for a curricular concession allocation and was allocated 2.36 whole-time equivalent teacher posts. The school was notified of this allocation in April 2003 and advised that, in the event of its not being satisfied with this allocation, it could appeal in writing before 6 May 2003 to the independent appeals committee. The school did not avail of the independent appeals mechanism.</p>
          <p eId="para_6648">The total staffing allocation to the school for the current school year is 14.42 whole-time equivalent teacher posts and three special needs assistants. This allocation includes one disadvantaged area post and 0.5 of a whole-time equivalent teacher post in respect of home school community liaison. This level of allocation leaves the school with an actual pupil teacher ratio of 7.8:1. Having regard to the number of pupils enrolled at the school, I am satisfied that the level of teaching resources made available represents an adequate response which is fully in line with allocations generally in the second level system.</p>

          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_6653">Under the terms of my Department's third level maintenance grants schemes, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are, generally speaking, eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment. Under the nationality clause of the schemes a candidate must either hold EU nationality; or have been granted humanitarian leave to remain in the State; or have permission to remain in the State by virtue of marriage to an Irish national residing in the State, or be the child of such person, not having EU nationality; or have permission to remain in the State by virtue of marriage to a national of another EU member state who is residing in the State and who is or has been employed, or self-employed, in the State, or be the child of such a  person, not having EU nationality; or be nationals of a member country of the European Economic Area, EEA.</p>
          <p eId="para_6654">The grants schemes contain a change in circumstances clause which provides that a candidate's eligibility may be assessed or re-assessed in the event of a change in circumstances in relation to, <i>inter alia,</i> reckonable income, the number of dependent children and normal residence. Following a review of the “change in circumstances” clause in 2002, it was decided to implement a revision in the 2002 grants schemes through the addition of “nationality, where the candidate becomes an Irish national or the national of another EU member state” to the categories of circumstances which would allow for the reassessment of an application, arising from a change in the applicant's circumstances. This revision allows candidates who acquire nationality during the course of their studies to apply to be assessed or re-assessed for grant assistance with effect from the academic term when the change occurs.</p>
          <p eId="para_6655">With regard to my Department's free fees initiative, under which the State meets the tuition fees for eligible undergraduate students following approved courses, the position is that such fees will be paid in respect of EU nationals who have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to their third-level. Tuition fees will also be paid in respect of EU migrant workers, their children and spouses, regardless of the spouse's nationality. Persons who have been granted official refugee status are subject to the terms and conditions of the free fees initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_6656">I consider the conditions of the student support provisions outlined above to be reasonable. Any cost-increasing changes in the grant schemes or the free fees initiative, as suggested by the Deputy, could only be considered in the context of available resources and the demands of other priorities in the education sector.</p>

          <p eId="para_6658">The Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992 provide that the means to be taken into account for the purpose of assessing eligibility under the scheme are those of the student, if any, and of the parents or guardians of the student. The Acts make special provision for the assessment of means in the case of mature students. Under the terms of the higher education grants scheme, mature students are categorised as either independent mature students or mature students dependent on parents. An independent mature student is defined to mean a  mature student who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from the October preceding their entry to an approved course. Independent mature students are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or address. The statutory definition of a mature student is a person of not less than 23 years of age who has reached that age on the 1st day of January in the year of entry to an approved course. Parental income must, therefore, be taken into account irrespective of the individual circumstances, when assessing the means of students other than independent mature students. The other student support schemes have similar provisions in relation to the means assessment of students.</p>

          <p eId="para_6666">For the purposes of my Department's maintenance grants schemes reckonable income means all amounts, with the exception of defined social welfare and health board payments, received or receivable by an individual without reference to his or her residence or domicile, from both Irish and foreign sources, which are liable to Irish income tax, Irish capital gains tax or Irish capital acquisitions tax, or which would be so liable but for exemptions and ensure that all types of income will be included in determining a person's income for grant purposes. For the purposes of determining grant eligibility, all investments must be declared, including deposit accounts, savings certificates, life assurance bonds and other financial instruments where the interest/profit is accumulated and paid out as a lump sum at the end of the investment period. Where income is paid out annually, as happens with a bank deposit account, the amount so paid is required to be included in reckonable income. Where income is not paid out annually but is "rolled-up" and paid out with the original investment at the end of a defined term, the annual amount required to be included in reckonable income is the "rolled-up" income divided by the number of years in the term of the investment. This procedure has been in place for the past ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_6667">Given its similarity with "roll-up" savings products it was deemed appropriate to include, as reckonable income, income from SSIAs on an annual basis. The treatment of the SSIAs in this regard is consistent with the treatment of similar financial products such as post office savings certificates. My Department is satisfied that the approach taken to computing reckonable income for purposes of determining eligibility under the maintenance grant schemes is appropriate.</p>

At the end of the 2003 school year each school submitted a claim form for payment of moneys for these duties to teachers on the Department's payroll.  All teachers on the payroll who part took in the supervision and substitution scheme between Easter and June 2003 and where a claim form for payment was submitted by the school have received payment. The balance of hours between the school's total allocation and hours paid through the payroll is then paid as a grant payment to schools.

          <p eId="para_6676">The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 outlines the duties and responsibilities of parents and schools in relation to school attendance. The National Educational Welfare Board was formed to ensure that every child either attends school regularly or otherwise receives an education. Under the Act, children aged 6 to 16 years of age must either be on a school register or registered with the board as otherwise receiving an education. A child's name can only be removed from a school register when the pupil is either enrolled in another school or registered with the board. This provision will ensure that all children are receiving an education. There are very specific reporting requirements concerning school attendance under the legislation. When a child is absent from school for 20 days or more or where the school is concerned about a child's attendance, the school is required to make a report to the educational welfare officer, EWO, who will follow up and liaise with the family of the child, the school and other agencies as appropriate. Where all efforts to improve attendance fail and the EWO is of the view that the parent is being negligent in carrying out his/her duties in relation to the child's education, the board will consider taking legal action.</p>
          <p eId="para_6677">Schools are required to submit a school attendance report to the local EWO at the end of the school year. This will provide the basis for the compilation of comprehensive data on the levels of school attendance nationally and for analysis of trends and issues in relation to school attendance generally. The first standardised attendance reports will be received by the board at the end of the current school year 2003-04.</p>

          <p eId="para_6684">The proposed large-scale building project for Camross national school is listed in Section 7 of the 2003 school building programme which is published on my Department's website at <i>www.education.ie</i>. This proposed project is at stage three of architectural planning (developed sketch scheme). It has been assigned a “band 3” rating by my Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects. Projects listed in Sections 6 and 7 will not be authorised to progress beyond their current stage of architectural planning at this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_6685">Budgetary provisions in 2004 and subsequent years will determine the rate of progression to tender and construction of these projects in conjunction with the band rating individually assigned.

          <p eId="para_6719">The initial assignment of a project to a particular band rating does not preclude its subsequent reassignment to a different band rating as circumstances change, e.g. an amalgamation which was agreed subsequent to a band rating being assigned to a project at a school or significant structural deterioration in a school building which was not known at the time of the initial assignment of a band rating. In the event of such circumstances arising, band ratings are changed with the updated position reflected in subsequent updates on my Department's website.</p>

          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_6722">The RAPID programme is designed to harness the opportunities and resources of the national development plan, NDP, through the frontloading and prioritisation of investment to the 45 most deprived communities in the country – 25 urban areas and 20 provincial towns. This does not involve additional funding to that being provided under the NDP.</p>
          <p eId="para_6723">The area implementation team in Athy has submitted five proposals under the RAPID programme. The current position on each proposal is outlined below:</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_618">Ke-Athy-001 concerns the construction of a new community college in Athy. The 2003 schools building programme was published earlier in the year and full details in relation to individual projects are available on the Department's website atwww.education.ie. This project is included in section 7, large-scale post primary projects that are at an early stage of architectural planning.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_619">The current position is that a stage 1 – site suitability, briefing and site report – submission has been sent to the Department by County Kildare VEC for examination and approval. This submission will be considered as soon as possible and a letter will issue to the chief executive officer. However, as stated in the building programme, projects at the early stage of architectural planning will not be authorised to proceed beyond their current stage of architectural planning in 2003. Further progress will be considered in the context of the allocation for the 2004 schools building programme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_620">Ke-Athy-002 concerns home-school liaison for Scoil Mhichil Naofa primary school and St. Patrick's CBS. The home-school-community liaison scheme was last expanded in September 1999. This expansion included any remaining schools designated as disadvantaged that did not have a home-school-community liaison service. There are no plans at present to expand this scheme but in the event of any future expansion of the home-school-community liaison scheme, the needs of Scoil Mhichil Naofa and St. Patrick's CBS will be fully considered.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_621">Ke-Athy-003 concerns the Early Start programme for Scoil Mhichil Naofa primary school. This proposal relates to the early start pre-school pilot project. The early start project, which was launched in 1994, is currently in place in 40 selected schools in disadvantaged areas. The project is aimed at children, aged between three and four years, who are considered to be most at risk of not reaching their potential. It provides young children with an educational programme that will enhance their overall development and lay a foundation for successful educational attainment in future years.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_622">The question of developing and funding particular pre-school initiatives or the extension of the Early Start project to additional schools will be considered by the Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education. This centre, which was established in 2001, has been established to co-ordinate developments in the early education sector on behalf of the Department on foot of the White Paper on early childhood education, Ready to Learn, 1999. It will be involved,inter alia, in developing targeted interventions on a pilot basis for children from disadvantaged backgrounds and children with disabilities, building on the experience of existing programmes. This RAPID proposal has been sent to the centre for its consideration in this context.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_623">Ke-Athy-012 concerns expanded Kildare Youth Service activity for Athy youth. The Athy  youth project received an allocation of €69,479 in 2002 under the special projects for youth scheme. This allocation has been increased to €70,174 in 2003. Due to the large number of existing commitments in the youth sector, it was not possible to provide any additional funding for the Athy youth project this year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_624">Ke-Athy-017 concerns the application for the inclusion of Athy in the school completion programme. The school completion programme, SCP, which was launched in 2002, incorporates the learning experience and best practice derived from previous early school leaving initiatives and assimilates the existing eight to 15 early school leaver initiative, ESLI, and the stay-in school retention initiative at second level, SSRI. Athy community college, which is one of the schools in Athy seeking admission to SCP, is already in the SSRI.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_625">The objective of the school completion programme is to provide a range of interventions in areas of disadvantage that support the retention of young people in education. Eligible schools were selected on the basis of their retention rates from the Department's post-primary pupil database. This analysis also identified the main feeder primary schools and these did not include those primary schools located in Athy.</summary>

The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme.

          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_6739">The millennium partnership fund for disadvantage is one of a number of access measures recommended in the 2001 report of the action group on access to third level education. Two other key recommendations were the establishment of a national office of equity of access to higher education and the introduction of special rates of maintenance, or top-up, grants. There have been significant developments in relation to both recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_6740">As the Deputy is aware, on 25 May I announced a package of measures costing €42 million in a full year to address the problem of disadvantage in third level education. The main provisions are: an increase of 15% in the maintenance grant, to give a maximum grant of €2,885 – this compares with €2,510 in 2002-03; significant increases in the reckonable income limits for purposes of the ordinary and special rates of grant; the introduction of a revised income limit scheme, to include the following threshold levels: (i) A new "part maintenance, 75% and full fees" and (ii) an upgrading of the "full fees only" income limit to become a "part maintenance, 25%, and full fees" entitlement; the top income limit has been increased from €36,897 to €40,000, ensuring that a significantly higher number of students from households with moderate incomes will not have to pay the student service charge; the higher, non-adjacent rate of the special rate of maintenance grant has been increased to €4,495 an amount equal to the maximum personal rate of social welfare unemployment assistance; the adjacent rate has been increased to €1,800. These increases represent top-ups on the ordinary grant of €1,610 and €645 respectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_6741">The action group report recommended an allocation of €1.27 million each year, for the millennium partnership fund, for the duration of the national development programme to 2006. This recommendation was implemented when the fund was introduced with effect from the 2001-02 academic year. However, for the 2002-03 academic year, I significantly increased the allocation to €2 million in recognition of the contribution being made by the partnerships and community groups to promoting participation from their areas in further and higher education. In the light of these developments and expenditure commitments, the provision of €2 million will continue to be made in respect of the millennium partnership fund for 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_6742">The allocation of funding as between the various measures aimed at increasing access to third level education will, however, be kept under review within my Department.</p>

          <p eId="para_6745">This package combines substantial improvements in the level and coverage of the maintenance grant for those on low to moderate incomes, with increases in the level of top-up grant for those who are most disadvantaged. The main provisions arising from the €42 million package are: an increase of 15% in the maintenance grant, to give a maximum grant of €2,885, benefiting, it is estimated, approximately 56,000 students; significant increases in the reckonable income limits and in the allowance by which the income limits may be increased for each dependant where two or more children are in further or higher education; the introduction of a revised income limit schema, to include the following threshold levels: (i) a new "part maintenance, 75%, and full fees" and (ii) an upgrading of the "full fees only" income limit to become a "part maintenance, 25%, and full fees" entitlement; the increases range from 9.5% to 16.3% and are well above the 7.6% normal reference increase in the average industrial wage; the top income limit has been increased from €36,897 to €40,000, ensuring that a significantly higher number of students from households with moderate incomes will not have to pay the student service charge; significant improvements have been effected in the special rates of maintenance grant, or top-up grants, for students from disadvantaged backgrounds; the higher, non-adjacent rate has been increased to €4,495 an amount equal to the maximum personal rate of social welfare unemployment assistance; the adjacent rate has been increased to €1,800; these increases represent top-ups on the ordinary grant of €1,610 and €645 respectively; the annual income threshold for the special rates of grant has been increased by 10.8% to €13,760.</p>
          <p eId="para_6746">This substantial package of measures will provide the opportunity, in an unprecedented manner, for students from disadvantaged backgrounds to achieve their full potential in the education system.</p>

          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_6796">Children with dyslexia are generally catered for on an integrated basis in ordinary primary schools where they can be supported by the learning support teacher service or the resource teacher service. At present there are 1,531 learning support teachers and in excess of 2,300 resource teachers and in the primary system.</p>
          <p eId="para_6797">Where the condition is of a more serious nature, provision can be made in one of the four special schools or 23 special classes attached to ordinary primary schools and dedicated to the needs of children with dyslexia. Decisions on placements are based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child and parental wishes in relation to their children. All special schools and special classes dedicated to children with dyslexia operate at a reduced pupil teacher ratio of 9:1 and pupils attending such facilities attract a special increased rate of capitation funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_6798">My Department also provides funding to schools for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers to assist children with special needs with their education, including children with dyslexia. Grant aid is also provided to the Dyslexia Association of Ireland to support its work with persons with dyslexia.</p>
          <p eId="para_6799">The report of the task force on dyslexia contains more than 60 individual recommendations ranging across a wide variety of issues from identification and assessment, to models of service delivery, specialist training for service providers, to issues relating to structural reforms. Since the task force reported, a number of initiatives have been taken in the area of dyslexia. These include the introduction of the first on-line training course for teachers catering for pupils with dyslexia; the appointment of ten new learning support trainers to the primary curriculum support programme specifically to provide in-depth support for the implementation of learning support guidelines for children with dyslexia; and a reduction from 11:1 to 9:1 in the pupil teacher ratio applicable to special classes catering for children with dyslexia.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_635">In addition to the above measures, a key focus of my Department has been on advancing the fundamental structural and legislative measures, which are necessary to underpin the development and delivery of services for persons with special needs, including children with dyslexia. A key development on the structural front has been the  Government's decision to approve the establishment of the national council for special education. The national council, which will have a local area presence, will play a key role in the development and delivery of services for persons with special needs, including children with dyslexia. It will have a research and advisory role and will establish expert groups to consider specific areas of special needs provision. It will also establish a consultative forum to facilitate inputs from the education partners and other interested parties.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_636">Arrangements for the establishment of the council are now well advanced. A chief executive officer designate has been appointed, the Oireachtas has approved an order establishing the council and the recruitment of council staff is in hands.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_637">I have also published the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2003, aimed at establishing the rights and entitlements of persons with special needs, including those with dyslexia, to an appropriate education service and providing the necessary framework for effective service delivery. My objective is to secure the passage of this legislation through the Oireachtas at the earliest possible date.</summary>

      the programmes operated by his Department in the area of school retention, contrasting money spent and numbers involved with the previous academic year.

          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_6936">The approximate expenditure on programmes with a specific focus on the area of retention, including the school completion programme, the National Educational Welfare Board and youth encounter projects, was €16 million for 2002. The equivalent allocation for 2003 is €29.2 million, allowing for considerable additional investment this year in the school completion programme, which was made available under the National Development Plan 20002006 with the assistance from the ESF and in the development of the services of the National Educational Welfare Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_6937">The main programme within my Department for tackling early school leaving is the school completion programme which was introduced in 2002. The school completion programme builds on two previous initiatives, namely the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative and the stay in school retention initiative at second level. The objective of the SCP is to provide a range of interventions in areas of disadvantage that support the retention of young people in education through in-school, after-school, out-of-school and holiday time supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_6938">A total of 82 projects, consisting of 112 post-primary schools and 288 main feeder primary schools participate in the project strand of SCP. In addition, 53 SSRI schools, which were not selected for inclusion in the project strand of the school completion programme, continue to be funded on a phasing out basis under the stay in school retention strand of the programme over the next three years up to 31 August 2005. Total funding of €23 million has been provided for the programme in 2003. In 2002 to 2003, the target group identified for support under the school completion programme, including the SSRI strand is approximately 18,000.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_654">Expenditure on the school completion programme in 2002 was €14.2 million, which supported 17 projects – 29 post-primary and 51 primary schools – under the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative and 118 post-primary schools under the stay in school retention initiative. A  total of 9,527 young people at risk of early school leaving or who had already dropped out of the system were targeted in 2001 to 2002. A budget of €5.4 million has been allocated to the board for the current year. Expenditure in 2002 was €1 million.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_655">There are five youth encounter projects. Three are in Dublin and one each in Cork and Limerick, which are supported by the Department to provide educational facilities for young people aged between ten to 15 years who have become alienated from the conventional mainstream education system. Many of the pupils are persistent truants and have become involved in, or are at risk of becoming involved in, minor crime and delinquency. The primary objective of the youth encounter projects is to rehabilitate these pupils and return them to mainstream education in the shortest time possible. The projects liaise closely with specified schools in their catchment areas. Expenditure on the youth encounter projects in 2002 was €806,000 and the allocation for 2003 is €915,000.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_6949">I already met the Irish Federation of Sea Anglers, IFSA, on Tuesday 3 December 2002 to discuss the regulations. Furthermore, the director general of the maritime safety directorate met with representatives of the Belmullet sea angling club in Westport on 25 March 2003 on my behalf. This meeting took place, at the request of the Belmullet sea angling club, before the information seminar being held in Westport on the same day at the request of the Connacht provincial council of the IFSA to explain and publicise the newly introduced passenger boat regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_6950">It was explained at that meeting that my primary concern is to enhance safety at sea and on inland waters. The licensing of all passenger boats through their compliance with the new regulations is the best way to ensure the safety of crew and passengers.</p>
          <p eId="para_6951">I recognise that sea angling festivals are of importance in tourism terms, particularly in peripheral coastal areas. However, I have continually made the point that we cannot build our tourism industry on a poor safety regime. There are long-term benefits to the tourism industry in being able to demonstrate that the highest safety standards are adhered to in sea angling. In this regard it is extremely important that the number of suitable licensed boats for use in competitions is increased. At the meeting on 25 March the Belmullet sea angling club was advised that the Department would consider applications for passenger boat licences in respect of fishing vessels subject to certain criteria, in recognition of the fact that the majority of vessels used historically in sea angling competitions and festivals have been fishing vessels. Furthermore, my Department has also encouraged the IFSA to support an approach involving flexibility in relation to existing licensed passenger boats. In particular, passenger boats licensed to operate in a particular area would be given flexibility to operate in a different area for the purpose of sea angling competitions only.</p>
          <p eId="para_6952">These measures, together with the acquisition by the industry of new boats meeting the required safety standards, provide the opportunity to increase the number of licensed passenger boats available for use in sea angling competitions and festivals and thereby increase and build on the valuable contribution these events make to local economies.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_658">In view of the circumstances outlined above, in particular the meeting already held between the  maritime safety directorate with representatives of Belmullet sea angling club at which my position on safety and the passenger boat regulations was explained, another meeting is unlikely to clarify the position any further.</summary>

The primary objective of this investment is to create a sustainable, competitive and quality driven seafood industry which will maximise its contribution to exports.</p>
          <p eId="para_7428">The NDP includes schemes in such areas as adjustment of the fishing effort, renewal and modernisation of the fishing fleet, supporting measures for sea fisheries development, seafood processing, seafood marketing and seafood training. Substantial progress has already been achieved in relation to the renewal and modernisation of the fishing fleet, training and marketing initiatives and also on the supporting measures programme which supports diversification options for fishermen. Significant investment in seafood processing is also being supported. I am confident that the successful implementation of these schemes will allow for the progressive development of businesses in the seafood sector of which fishermen are an integral part.</p>

       if BIM will carry out a survey report of the Mayo coastline to assist the fishing industry.

          <p eId="para_7430">The primary fisheries along the Mayo coastline are inshore in nature. The main fisheries on which the Mayo inshore fleet depends are brown crab, lobster and salmon. BIM maintains an ongoing programme of liaison with the inshore fishing industry in Mayo. It has been involved, in co-operation with local inshore fishermen, in a number of studies and surveys in recent years on the status of these stocks and attention has also been paid to the identification of alternative fisheries and thus reduce the pressure on the lobster and crab stocks in particular. As a result a number of vessels are now "jigging" for whitefish full time and further possibilities in this area are currently being investigated. A major wild salmon quality initiative has also been implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_7431">Given the dependence of the Mayo inshore fleet on a small number of species and the unlikelihood that there are unexploited inshore resources yet to be identified, BIM considers that development efforts in the future should focus on the better management of inshore fisheries resources in the context of a national management strategy for inshore stocks.</p>

          <p eId="para_7433">The licensing authority, established under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003, will decide on the granting of licences in respect of applications received under the scheme for the licensing of traditional pot fishing boats in the Irish inshore fleet. The licensing authority is the Registrar General of Fishing Boats, a statutory position held by a senior official in the Department. I understand that 1,146 licence applications were received by the closing date for the inshore scheme and the applications are at various stages of processing.</p>
          <p eId="para_7434">An inshore licensing assessment standing committee, comprising representatives of the Department and BIM, has been established to oversee the processing of applications under the scheme, to evaluate compliance with certain conditions of the scheme and to make recommendations to the licensing authority with regard to licensing. I understand that the standing committee is due to meet shortly to assess and make recommendations on an initial batch of applications which are at an advanced stage of processing.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_731">Where the licensing authority is satisfied that applications meet the eligibility criteria and conditions of the scheme, including that the boats  concerned are safe and seaworthy, licences will issue. The licensing authority proposes to decide on the issuing of licences in respect of all applications under the scheme as soon as possible.</summary>

          <p eId="para_7530">I propose to take Questions Nos. 762 and 763 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_7531">I would like to clarify the position in relation to this issue. In December 2002 the EU Council adopted a framework regulation, Council Regulation 2371/2002, for the Common Fisheries Policy, which set down a new policy for fleet management at EU level. Under the new policy, overall fleet capacity limits, in terms of tonnage and engine power, are established for each member state and there is an overall requirement that the current level of fleet capacity does not increase.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_733">In March 2003 the European Commission brought forward draft implementing rules in respect of the new EU fleet policy. The rules as drafted would have meant,inter alia, that capacity, tonnage and engine power, not on the fishing boat register on 1 January 2003 could not be reintroduced into the fleet. The fishing industry was made aware of the draft EU proposals. However, following intense negotiations between my Department and the European Commission,  the EU implementing rules were amended, and clarifications given, which significantly addressed Irelands concerns. The EU rules, as finally adopted in Commission Regulation 1438/2003 of 12 August 2003, provide that the capacity of the fleet on 1 January 2003 may be increased to take account of administrative decisions taken in the period 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2002 which granted approval for the introduction of additional capacity into the fleet. Any such increase to the capacity situation set down for 1 January 2003 must be subject to EU fleet capacity limits for the Irish fleet set under the Fourth Multi-Annual Guidance Programme being respected on a fleet segment basis. The capacity must be reintroduced into the fleet not later than three years after the date of the administrative decision. The EU rules also allow for the use of ‘off-register' capacity towards the introduction of vessels into the fleet, subject always to the capacity limits set at EU level not being exceeded.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_734">I recently introduced new policy proposals for sea fishing boat licensing, taking account of the new EU policy and the overall capacity situation of the Irish fleet. The new policy proposals are designed to ensure,inter alia, that capacity currently being held by fishermen ‘off-register' can be reintroduced into the fleet, and that binding EU fleet capacity limits are complied with. The policy proposals have been the subject of consultation with the industry. I propose to finalise and introduce the new licensing policy shortly.</summary>

          <p eId="para_7533">The proposed charges at the fishery harbour centres – Castletownbere, Killybegs, Howth, Rossaveale and Dunmore East – were published on 21 May 2003 and following the statutory consultation period and a subsequent meeting with representatives of the harbours and the industry the order was made on 17 September 2003 with substantial changes to those originally proposed. The following table shows the main changes made.</p>
          <p eId="para_7534">The revised charges were introduced to address an operating deficit of €544,990 in 2002 and an accumulated deficit of €1.2 million at the fishery harbour centres. The income generated will be used to meet the operational costs of the harbour and the capital development will be funded as heretofore from the Exchequer, €30 million in 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_7535">In respect of Dunmore East, I have recently appointed engineering consultants to develop proposals in respect of the design and the preparation of the statutory permissions for the development. The advancement of the development will be dependent on the Exchequer funding available in the 2004-07 period for fishery harbour development projects and overall national priorities.</p>

          <p eId="para_7581">I believe that competition in markets drives down costs and provides choice to consumers. A number of competing private sector shipping companies provide shipping services between Ireland and Britain. While these companies have been innovative in their provision of jumbo ferries, fast ferries and dedicated container ships to serve the Irish economy, I consider that there are always opportunities for more innovative products. Having a flourishing competitive market is one way to assist.</p>
          <p eId="para_7582">There is at present no lack of shipping capacity on the sea routes serving Ireland and competition exists between ship operators, fast and conventional ferries, ports and port terminals.</p>
          <p eId="para_7583">Irish Ferries' recent acquisition of one of the world's largest ferries, for service on the Irish Sea, is one indication of the dynamism of the Irish shipping sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_7584">The Government is fully committed to the development of our maritime sector and to the maintenance of a competitive market. Targeted fiscal reliefs, such as the recently introduced tonnage tax, are used to create a favourable climate for ship operators. The Irish shipping sector has its own dedicated development agency, the Irish Maritime Development Office.</p>

          <p eId="para_7596">A grant of €400,000 was provisionally allocated to Cork City Council under the 2002 sports capital programme towards the provision of ancillary facilities, e.g., changing rooms, fitness studio, at the Churchfield leisure complex. Payment of the grant will be made by my Department on receipt of the necessary documentation and certification from Cork City Council in accordance with the terms and conditions of the sports capital programme. No application for funding for the project was received under the 2003 sports capital programme, for which I recently announced all provisional allocations.</p>

Under this programme, following the initial submission of a feasibility study, projects progress through four stages: preliminary report, contract documents, tender and construction, with formal approval required before progressing from one stage to the next. The maximum grant available under the local authority swimming pool programme is €3.8 million, subject to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Grant aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved for the project and the grant amount is capped at the time of allocation.</p>

These, in order of progress, are preliminary report, contract documents, tender and construction. My Department's technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant aid is allocated when tenders have been approved for a project and is capped at the time of allocation.</p>

          <p eId="para_8148">As the Deputy will be aware the revitalising areas through planning, investment and development, RAPID, programme aims to target the most disadvantaged areas of the country for enhanced development. No additional funding has been set aside for the programme but rather these areas are prioritised for support within existing budgets. The main programmes operated by my Department where a particular focus exists on RAPID areas are the national lottery-funded sports capital programme and the local authority swimming pool programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_8149">One of the stated main objectives of the sports capital programme is to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of facilities. The programme is run on an annual basis and allocates funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_797">For the 2003 sports capital programme, following consultation with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, DCRGA, it was decided that disadvantaged areas were those that have been designated by Government for special support through the schemes administered by DCRAGA, that is, RAPID 1, RAPID 2, local drugs task force areas and CLÁR areas. Athy is one of 20 urban locations covered under the RAPID 2 programme. The 2003 programme was  the first for which RAPID 2, and accordingly RAPID designation in Athy, was in place.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_798">A total of 1,337 applications were received under the 2003 sports capital programme. Of these, two were located in the RAPID area of Athy, both of which had to be deemed ineligible as they did not meet with the minimum qualifying requirements under the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_800">Under the local authority swimming pool programme, projects which are developed in areas designated as disadvantaged, qualify for financial support at 90% of the eligible cost of the project subject to a maximum grant of €3.8 million.

The speech and language therapy service has been relocated to a different area within the centre. Essential health and safety improvements have been made in the last year. Improvements to the electrical system have also been carried out. A health and safety audit, conducted in November 2002 noted significant improvements since the previous inspection and further recommendations from this recent audit are being actively addressed. It is planned to relocate the addiction services before the end of 2003.

          <p eId="para_8174">Following the publication of the report of the joint review group on psychological services in the health service in March 2002, a major priority for my Department was to promote an integrated and co-ordinated approach by the health boards to its implementation over time. This applied in particular to the major recommendations of the report relating to the organisation and management of psychology services, entailing very substantial increases in the number of principal and director level psychologist posts.</p>
          <p eId="para_8175">Given the key role of the health boards executive in fostering collective working and progressing organisational change and development in the health service, my Department secured the agreement of the executive to work with the directors of human resources in the health boards towards the implementation of the recommendations of the report. The present position is that the directors of human resources are in the process of individually considering the recommendations contained in the report and how their boards might propose to proceed with the implementation process in due course. This work is being undertaken in the light of: service imperatives; funding priorities; and the budget 2003 announcement on public service numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_8176">In this context, it is important to bear in mind that the overall budgetary and economic position in 2003 has had important implications for all aspects of public spending, as is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by Government for 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_8177">Moreover the health service reform programme was announced on 18 June 2003. The programme's priority focus is improved patient care, better value for taxpayer's money and improved health care management. The reform programme has drawn on the conclusions and recommendations of the two reports, the Commission on Financial Management and Control Systems in the Health Service and Audit of Structures and Functions in the Health System, which were also published on the same day.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_807">Psychological services are currently delivered as part of broad primary, community and continuing care umbrella. Within the new structure, psychological services will be delivered under the  primary, community and continuing care directorate of the health services executive. Any implications of the new structures for the recommendations of the joint review group will be examined in the context of the implementation of the reform programme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_808">My Department, together with the directors of human resources in the health boards, is currently prioritising support for the implementation of a key recommendation of the joint review report relating to human resource planning through the provision of a substantial number of additional postgraduate training places in clinical psychology. Since end 1999 there has been a threefold increase, from 26 to 83, in the number of trainee clinical psychologists employed in the health services. At present, there are about 105 clinical psychologists undertaking postgraduate training in the State. Over 60 students are enrolled on the Psychological Society of Ireland's clinical psychologist postgraduate training diploma, 24 are enrolled on the doctoral programme in clinical psychology at TCD – 12 in first year and 12 in second year – and 19 are enrolled on the doctoral programme in clinical psychology at UCD – ten in second year and nine in third year. The National University of Ireland, Galway is commencing a new postgraduate doctorate in 2003 and plan to enrol an additional 12 students while the University of Limerick also has plans to introduce doctoral programmes in clinical psychology with a proposed intake of nine students.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_809">My Department remains committed to working on an ongoing basis with health agencies, educational providers and the education authorities to ensure adequate provision of training places in clinical psychology, consistent with the medium-term human resource requirements of the health service as detailed in the important recommendations on investment in training and education detailed in the action plan for people management published in November 2002. A particular priority is to secure the best return, in terms of graduate output, on the very significant financial resources currently being invested in the health service to support postgraduate clinical psychology training. Consequently, my Department, together with the health boards' directors of human resources, have been examining various issues in relation to human resource planning for clinical psychologists in the health service, including the requirement to increase the number of postgraduate psychology training places on a planned and sustainable medium-term basis. A paper outlining a proposal to develop a new model has been produced and this document has been circulated to the relevant parties for discussion. It is hoped that agreement to move to a new model will help maximise the number of psychology training places in the system, in line with service requirements.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_810">In addition to ongoing contacts with the directors of human resources group in this matter, officials of my Department have over recent months met with representatives of the heads of  psychology services, the Psychological Society of Ireland and IMPACT to discuss progress in implementing the recommendations of the joint review group report.</summary>

          <p eId="para_8179">Officials of my Department, including the chief medical officer, have met representatives of the Irish ME Trust, both this year and last year. The Department's chief medical officer has pointed out the limitations on the health care system's ability to provide a full range of services for those who are already diagnosed with CFS-ME. These limitations are the same as for those who suffer from other chronic diseases. The allocation of resources needs to be based on priority health needs and on evidence as to what interventions are seen to be most effective in combating these conditions. It is difficult in the current circumstances to identify funding to establish specialised units for CFS-ME sufferers.</p>
          <p eId="para_8180">In view of the meetings which have taken place, I do not believe a departmental liaison person needs to be appointed as suggested by the Irish ME Trust.

          <p eId="para_8185">Representations have been received in my Department on behalf of Age Action concerning increases in VHI premiums. The position is that the setting of premiums is the responsibility of the VHI board. The legislation requires the board to set premiums at a level sufficient to cover costs and make proper allowance for reserves. The board is however, obliged to notify the Minister of the day in advance of putting proposed increases into effect. The Minister may prevent the introduction of an increase, but must have good reasons for doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_8186">Having given the VHI's submission on its recent increase careful consideration I was satisfied that the board's decision was in accordance with its legal duty in setting premiums. The additional income yielded by this increase shall be spent in meeting claims costs. It will enable the VHI to provide the level of services required by its subscribers, including older subscribers, whose propensity to claim is higher than other groups. Experience nationally and internationally is that health insurance costs rise considerably in excess of the level of annual inflation, driven by higher prices in the health sector and increased incidence of claims which arise due to a range of factors including ageing of the population, medical and technological advances, and heightened consumer expectations. Our community-rated system of health insurance ensures that premiums for older persons are significantly lower than they would be under a risk rated system.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_813">Additional funding of €27 million was allocated to services for persons with disabilities in 2003 to meet the full year costs of 2002 developments and to further enhance the services in the sector. This funding is in addition to the very significant rev enue investment, amounting to €288 million which has been made in these services in recent years and which is built into the ongoing budget base.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_814">Approximately €100 million in additional ongoing revenue has, since 1997, been provided with regard to the maintenance and development of services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. Such services include residential, respite, home support services which include personal assistance services, therapy services and day care services. A significant proportion of this funding, over €20 million, has been provided specifically for home support services. A further €81 million has been provided in once-off grants for capital projects and issues such as the provision of technical aids and appliances.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_815">The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, as is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health service.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_816">I wish to advise the Deputy that I announced in July 2003 that additional revenue and capital funding of €50 million was being made available to services for people with disabilities by my Department in 2003. Of this, €15 million is being made available for services to people with intellectual disability and those with autism to meet costs associated with emergency residential placements during 2003, the provision of day services for young adults who have just left school and some enhancement of the health related support services for children.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_817">The provision of the revenue funding, in particular, will provide around 175 emergency places and over 600 day places and will enable the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards to address key issues of concern which had been identified by the various representative groups.

          <p eId="para_8196">One of the recommendations of the strategic task force on alcohol which I established last year concerns limiting the exposure of children and adolescents to alcohol marketing. This includes limiting where alcohol advertisements can be placed and regulating their content to ensure that they do not appeal to children. The Cabinet has approved a draft general scheme for an alcohol products Bill for the control of advertising, sponsorship and marketing practices-sales promotions. Issues such as the advertising of alcohol in public places will be addressed in this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_8197">Tobacco advertising plays an important role in promoting tobacco products, particularly in relation to young people. A complete ban on all forms of advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products is necessary if we are to reduce children's exposure to inducements to tobacco products. The advertising and sponsorship of tobacco products by the tobacco industry, other than limited retail and trade advertising and advertising in low volume foreign publications, has been prohibited since July 2000. Section 33 of the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002, when commenced, will introduce a total ban on all advertising of tobacco products including in-store, point-of-sale and retail advertising.</p>

Analysis of hospital discharge data for 2002 indicates that approximately 19% of all in-patient bed days were accounted for by patients with a principal diagnosis from the above list. A similar figure is obtained when data for earlier years are analysed. The figure of 19% is considerably lower than the figure of 50% mentioned in the Deputy's question, but it nevertheless represents a very significant proportion of hospital in-patient activity. It should be emphasised, however, that these illnesses also affect non-smokers, and it is not possible to determine what proportion of bed days may be directly attributable to smoking. The data are derived from the hospital in-patient inquiry,  HIPE, system which captures information on all discharges from publicly funded acute hospitals.</p>

The question of additional investment in neurology and neurophysiology will be considered in the light of the Comhairle review, other competing priorities, and the availability of adequate funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_8211">In relation to neurosurgical services, the Deputy will be aware I have asked Comhairle na nOspidéal to carry out a review of neurosurgical services and to prepare a report for my consideration. Comhairle has been asked to focus, in particular, on the provision of adequate capacity and consideration of equity of access to neurosurgical services having regard to best practice in the provision of quality healthcare. I understand that the work of the Comhairle committee on neurosurgical services is ongoing. Decisions in relation to the further organisation of neurosurgical services will be informed by the Comhairle report.</p>

          <p eId="para_8213">There are serious ethical and medical concerns about the provision of "alternative" medicines for patients suffering from serious conditions such as cancer, in cases where the treatment is not being carried out under the direction of a registered medical practitioner or in the absence of evidence in relation to the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal products concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_8214">In order to gain the most from these types of medicinal products it is essential that they be controlled by an appropriate authority to ensure that, like all other medicinal products, they are of an appropriate quality and safe for the consumer to use. The interests of public health can best be realised when there is a formal mechanism for the assessment of these products and a subsequent means of monitoring their use in order to assure their continued safety in use.</p>
          <p eId="para_8215">The Irish Medicines Board is the statutory agency with responsibility for assessment of medicinal products and my Department is currently examining proposals from the IMB for the regulation of alternative and traditional medicinal products, the aim of which is to provide the consumer with an assurance that the traditional products which they buy are: produced to an appropriate quality standard; safe under the recommended conditions of use; can be expected to be effective in the context of their established tradition of use; and are appropriately labelled.</p>

          <p eId="para_8217">The death registration system is the principal source for statistical information on causes of death. Information on specific occupations and professions is recorded as part of death certification in all countries but is known to be subject to many sources of bias, incompleteness and unreliability. For this reason the Central Statistics Office does not provide any analysis of cause of death by specific occupation.</p>
          <p eId="para_8218">International evidence does however exist which shows that members of the medical profession experience higher than average levels of problems associated with substance abuse, including alcohol.

The article stated that medical students were the heaviest smokers followed by law students. I am unable to confirm whether this is the case in Ireland as the Slán survey collects data based on the educational status of respondents, not on the subjects that students are studying. The categories in the Slán survey are as follows: ED1a: No schooling-primary school edu cation only; ED1b: some secondary education; ED2: complete secondary education; ED3a: some third level education at college, university, RTC-IT; ED3b: complete third level education at college, university, Regional Technical College-IT.</p>

      the details of the ?50 million announced over the summer recess for services for people with disabilities; and if St. Vincent's Centre, Navan Road, Dublin 7, St. Michael's House, Ballymun, Dublin 11 and children seeking wheelchairs will benefit from this announcement.

          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p eId="para_8299">Additional revenue and capital funding of €50 million was made available to services for people with disabilities in July 2003. Additional revenue funding amounting to €20 million has been provided in 2003, with a full year cost in 2004 of €30 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_8300">A sum of €15 million has been made available for services to persons with intellectual disability and those with autism to meet costs associated with emergency residential placements during 2003, the provision of day services for young adults who have just left school and some enhancement of the health related support services for children.</p>
          <p eId="para_8301">A sum of €5 million has been made available for services for people with physical or sensory disabilities to meet service pressures as identified by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in consultation with other relevant agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_8302">Capital funding amounting to €30 million –€15 million for services to people with intellectual disability or autism and €15 million for services to people with physical or sensory disabilities – has also been allocated to the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in respect of minor capital works in services for people with disabilities. This funding will allow the authority and the health boards to address such areas as the backlog of maintenance, refurbishment, re-equipping, replacement of vehicles used within the services or works related to fire precautions and health and safety issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_8303">The provision of funding for these minor capital works will, when completed, help to upgrade many existing facilities. In the case of services to people with intellectual disability or autism, specific provision is being made in relation to a number of services, including St. Joseph's Services, St. Ita's, Portrane, St. Raphael's, Youghal, Grove House, Cork, St. Senan's, Wexford and St. Brigid's, Ballinasloe.</p>
          <p eId="para_8304">From the additional revenue funding made available, €6.571million has been allocated to the ERHA in 2003, with a full year cost of €11.362 million in 2004, in respect of the provision of emergency places and day places for adults. The distribution of this funding, together with the distribution of the €5.585 million capital funding, is a matter for the authority and I have asked the chief executive to investigate the matter and reply directly to the Deputy. A sum of €312,000 has been provided for the Daughters of Charity Services, St. Vincent's in respect of the provision of health related support services for children in 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_8305">The provision of the revenue funding, in particular, will provide around 175 emergency places and over 600 day places and will enable the authority and the health boards to address key issues of concern which had been identified by the various representative groups. The allocation of an additional €50 million is further evidence of the Government's commitment to these services and to supporting people with disabilities and their families.</p>

      asked the

      if his attention has been drawn to the fact that only 5% of Travellers are over 50 years of age and 2% are over 65 years of age; and if he has immediate plans to deal with this crisis in health care.

          <p eId="para_8307">I am aware of the discrepancy in the life expectancy of Travellers when compared to that of the general population. In February 2002 I launched Traveller Health – A National Strategy 2002-2005, which is now Government policy. This strategy is operating in the context of the national health strategy, Quality and Fairness – A Health System for You.</p>
          <p eId="para_8308">The Traveller health strategy contains 122 action points, which when fully implemented will have a positive impact on the health of Travellers. A key action point of the strategy calls for the conduct of a Traveller health needs assessment and health status study which will expand on the indicators collected in the 1987 study of Travellers' health and inform appropriate actions required in the area of Travellers' health. My Department has entered into partnership with the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Northern Ireland, in order that this study can be carried out on a 32-county basis. The Institute of Public Health in Ireland has been requested to design the study in consultation with all interested bodies. The consultation phase of the design process, involving Travellers, Traveller representatives and relevant statutory health service providers in both jurisdictions, is nearing completion and the final design of the study will be submitted to both Departments in January 2004.</p>

          <p eId="para_8311">There are serious ethical and medical concerns about the provision of alternative medicines for patients suffering from serious conditions such as cancer, in cases where the treatment is not being carried out under the direction of a registered medical practitioner or in the absence of evidence in relation to the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal products concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_8312">In order to gain the most from these types of medicinal products it is essential that they be controlled by an appropriate authority to ensure that, like all other medicinal products, they are of an appropriate quality and safe for the consumer to use. The interests of public health can best be realised when there is a formal mechanism for the assessment of these products and a subsequent means of monitoring their use in order to assure their continued safety in use.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_821">The Irish Medicines Board is the statutory agency with responsibility for assessment of medicinal products and my Department is currently examining proposals from the IMB for the regulation of alternative and traditional medicinal  products, the aim of which is to provide the consumer with an assurance that the traditional products which they buy are produced to an appropriate quality standard; safe under the recommended conditions of use; and can be expected to be effective in the context of their established tradition of use; and are appropriately labelled.</summary>

      <b>Mr. F. McGrath</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Health and Children</b>
      if persons with severe intellectual disabilities, in particular children, could not be issued with medical cards automatically once they meet initially the requirements and are in receipt of at least one medical card.

          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p eId="para_8314">Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on residency and means rather than income. Under the Health Act 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, other than for persons aged 70 years and over who are automatically eligible for a medical card. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.</p>
          <p eId="para_8315">Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his/her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board if they are unable to provide health services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.</p>
          <p eId="para_8316">As the Deputy is aware the health strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the medical card income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low income who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children and particularly children with a disability. However, increased investment in this or any other developmental aspect of the strategy agenda, is dependent on the availability of the necessary additional resources. Due to the prevailing budgetary situation I regret that it is not possible to meet this commitment this year but the Government remains committed to the introduction of the necessary changes within the lifetime of this Government.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_8318">Adoption is a service for children and the principle underpinning adoption legislation and practice is that of best interests of the child. No adult has a right to adopt and the principle of best interest of the child continues to be the basis of new developments in adoption.</p>
          <p class="Center" eId="para_8319">Irish adoption law allows either married couples or single people to adopt if they have been found suitable. The effect of this is that where a non-married couple (whether same sex or heterosexual) living together wish to adopt, the adoption is legally only in one person's name. The partner in such cases has no parental or guardianship rights. Non-married, same sex couples are legally in the same position as non-married heterosexual couples. Birth mothers, and in the case of inter-country adoption the authorities in the sending country, have a significant role in the selection of adopters and they tend to select traditional nuclear families as adopters.</p>
          <p eId="para_8320">I initiated a consultation process on adoption legislation earlier this summer to give interested groups and individuals the opportunity to comment on existing and proposed adoption legislation. During the course of the consultation process, which will conclude with an oral consultation in October, I received a number of submissions on a variety of issues, including that of adoption by non married couples. The Deputy will appreciate that I do not wish to pre-empt the outcome of the consultation process by commenting on any of the issues at this stage.</p>

The General Medical Services Payments Board processed more than 9 million items for the DPS in 2002. It would be cost prohibitive to report back to each individual client the specific cost per family claim.</p>
          <p eId="para_8326">However, work is ongoing on the development and implementation of a unique client identifier which would enable more detailed management and control of client registration under the scheme, and ultimately permit more detailed information regarding the cost of individual DPS claims to be extracted.</p>

These limitations are the same as for those who suffer from other chronic diseases. The allocation of resources needs to be based on priority health needs and on evidence as to what interventions are seen to be most effective in combating these conditions.

As Minister for Health and Children, I have to deal with the fact that an international scientific consensus exists that exposure to and inhalation of environmental tobacco smoke is a cause of disease, ill health and  death. The reality is that a significant proportion of our population do not work in safe smoke-free environments. The primary purpose of the prohibition is to provide a safe clean workplace free from toxic environmental tobacco smoke which the World Health Organisation has classified as a class A carcinogen.</p>

          <p eId="para_8525">I presume the Deputy is referring to palliative care as the term "home care" normally refers to palliative care services delivered in a person's home. Palliative care has only developed as a medical specialty in its own right since 1995. As the Deputy may be aware, the national advisory committee on palliative care produced its report in October 2001 and made a number of recommendations for the development of palliative care services over the next five to seven years. While no specific funding has been made available for home care services, my Department has allocated funding of €9.128 million in the past two years for the implementation of the advisory committee's recommendations. Provision for the development of home care services was included in this funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_8526">Development of palliative care services remains the responsibility of the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards. My Department has requested information on home care services from the authority and the boards and the information received is as follows:</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_966">Eastern Regional Health Authority:There are a total of seven home care teams providing services across the Eastern Regional  Health Authority area. Funding for St. Francis's Hospice in Raheny is provided by the Northern Area Health Board and the services provided by St. Francis's Hospice include the provision of home care services. Increased funding was provided in 2002 and 2003 for the further development of additional home care service in the Dublin 15 area. Home care services in the South-Western Health Board area are provided by Our Lady's Hospice in Harold's Cross. Home care services are also provided in the Kildare-west Wicklow area by general nurses or public health nurses employed by the South Western Area Health Board. Home care services for the East Coast Area Health Board are provided from Blackrock Hospice which is managed by Our Lady's Hospice, Harold's Cross, and the public health nursing service in community care area 10 in Wicklow. Home care services may be accessed in a number of ways. Patients who are in-patients in a hospice or in an acute hospital may be referred to the home care service on discharge. GPs may also refer a patient directly to the home care service.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_967">Midland Health Board:Home care services form an integral part of the Midland Health Board's palliative care service. The home care teams catered for 430 patients in 2001 with over 4,000 home visits and over 1,000 visits to hospital carried out. The service complements the in-patient service which is provided by the board in this area.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_968">Mid-Western Health Board:Milford Hospice is the designated palliative care service provider for the Mid-Western Health Board area and it commenced its home care service for the region in June 1989. The home care service is funded by the Mid-Western Health Board through a service agreement and all the home care nurses are employed by Milford Hospice.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_969">North-Eastern Health Board:The North Eastern Health Board is committed to developing a range of specialist palliative care services in it's functional area. The development of such services will be informed by the recommendations in a regional needs assessment study on palliative care services which has just been completed. Specialist home care services are also being developed across the board's area as resources permit. Palliative care services are being developed in the board's area through a consultative and partnership process with all service providers, both statutory and voluntary, who are represented on the regional palliative care development committee.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_970">North-Western Health Board:The North Western Health Board has considered the development of home care services as a priority over the last number of years. A total of eleven home care nurses are employed in this service; seven are employed by North West Hospice, two are employed by Foyle Hospice, and two are employed by the board. The home care service delivered by the North West Hospice was  extended from a five day to a seven day service in March of this year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_971">South-Eastern Health Board:Home care services in the South Eastern Health Board area provided through the voluntary sector and are part funded by the board. Access to home care is through referral by the patient's GP, through the consultant led palliative care service or through the public health nursing service.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_972">Southern Health Board:Funding for the home care service in the Southern Health Board amounted to €253,946 in 2000, and €213,306 in 2002. The regional development committee for specialist palliative care makes recommendations to the chief executive officer of the board on how development funding for palliative care, including the home care services, should be used.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_973">Western Health Board:Home care services are provided through a number of service providers in the Western Health Board area. Home care services for Galway are funded entirely by the Galway Hospice Foundation and these services complement the board's funding of in-patient and day care services in this county. In Mayo and Roscommon home care services are provided by the board in collaboration with the Mayo-Roscommon Hospice Foundation and the Irish Cancer Foundation.</summary>

          <p eId="para_8573">Under the Health (Amendment) Act 1986, health boards may impose charges on all patients for treatment arising out of injuries sustained in road traffic accidents where compensation is subsequently payable. The Act does not withdraw eligibility for public hospital services from road traffic accident victims, but allows health boards to recover the costs of all services provided to the them. Following enactment of the legislation my Department directed that charges be calculated on the basis of the hospital's average daily cost. Following legal challenge, the Supreme Court, on 11 July 2001 in the judgment referred to by the Deputy, ruled that this costing approach is reasonable, proper and intra vires the Health (Amendment) Act 1986.</p>
          <p eId="para_8574">Letters were issued by my Department to the health boards outlining the judgment and directing them to charge the average daily cost in all road traffic accident cases. An implication of the judgment was that some bills previously issued by health boards may have had to be reviewed upwards. My Department outlined the steps to be followed in calculating outstanding amounts to ensure that the full average daily cost was recovered.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_975">While bills are generally issued in all road traffic accident cases they are only settled where compensation is received and then forwarded to hospitals. Also, compensation may be significantly reduced in cases where contributory negligence is established. In the event of a person fail ing to obtain a compensation award, that person will only be liable for the normal statutory and maintenance charges, where applicable.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_976">The health boards are the legal entities identified in the Health (Amendment) Act 1986 entitled to make a charge upon a road traffic accident victim for in-patient or out-patient services. The administration of the charging system is a matter for the individual boards and my Department has no function in this regard.</summary>

This review of services will include all services provided at Cherry Orchard Hospital and pending the outcome of this review, services will be maintained at current levels. The board has informed the authority that any change to the current level of service provision will be negotiated by way of agreement and consultation with its partners under the terms of Sustaining Progress.</p>

          <p eId="para_8584">A working group was established by the Minister for Health and Children in June 2000 to make recommendations on how child and adolescent psychiatric services should be developed in the short, medium and long-term to meet identified needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_8585">The first report of the working group on child and adolescent psychiatry was published in March 2001 and recommended the enhancement and expansion of the overall child and adolescent psychiatric service including the recruitment of additional consultant child and adolescent psychiatrists.</p>
          <p eId="para_8586">In furtherance of the group's recommendations, additional revenue funding of €6.061million was allocated in 2002 to provide for the appointment of additional consultants, for the enhancement of existing consultant-led multidisciplinary teams and towards the establishment of further teams. A further €1.64 million was allocated in 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_8587">The first report also recommended that a total of seven child and adolescent in-patient psychiatric units for children ranging from six to 16 years should be developed throughout the country. Project teams have been established to develop child and adolescent in-patient psychiatric units in Cork, Limerick, Galway and one in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area – at St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_977">The second report of the working group on child and adolescent psychiatry published in June 2003, contains proposals for the development of psychiatric services for 16-18 year olds. It recommends that, in the further development of the child and adolescent psychiatric service, priority should be given to the recruitment in each health board area of a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist with a special interest in the psychiatric disorders of later adolescence. Further implementation of the recommendations of the  reports of the working group on child and adolescent psychiatry will be considered in the context of the Estimates process for 2004 and subsequent years.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_978">The future direction and delivery of all aspects of our mental health services, including child and adolescent psychiatry, will be considered in the context of the work of the recently established expert group on mental health policy.

          <p eId="para_8589">In the mental health services, social workers operate as a part of a multidisciplinary consultant-led team. At all times, each catchment area has a consultant on call to deal with emergency psychiatric cases. Generally, in the event of the unavailability of a social worker, it would be the practice for other members of the team to examine a patient in need of treatment and to arrange necessary follow-up.</p>
          <p eId="para_8590">In terms of the accessibility of social work services generally, the Deputy will be pleased to learn that a number of steps have been taken at national level over the past years to improve the recruitment and retention of social workers in the health service. These include the provision of significant additional training places and also the establishment of the national social work forum to progress a number of key issues for the social work profession arising from the recommendations included in the report of the expert group on various health professions. A further initiative is the undertaking, under the aegis of the forum, of a social work workload management study with a view to facilitating the best use of professional social work time. The effectiveness to date of these initiatives can be seen in the substantial increase of 39% in the overall numbers of social workers employed in the health service in whole-time equivalent, WTE, terms from end 2000 to end 2002.</p>

          <p eId="para_8593">I propose to take Questions Nos. 849 and 851 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_8594">The purpose of the reform programme is to remove obstacles to the delivery of the national health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You,  and to achieve: a new structure which will provide a national focus on service delivery and executive management of the system; a reduction in fragmentation and duplication of effort, thereby making the system more manageable and efficient; a far greater consistency between the level and types of services provided in different parts of the country; and the alignment of responsibility and accountability throughout the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_8595">Both the Brennan and Prospectus reports speak of the likelihood of savings in the implementation of their respective recommendations. However, the Prospectus report also states that it is extremely difficult to accurately predict the true financial impact of programmes of this scale. Our primary purpose is not to make savings but to ensure that the maximum possible of the resources allocated to the health sector reach the service user. What savings can be made, will be identified and appropriately redistributed.</p>
          <p eId="para_8596">The Minister for Finance has already made a statement in relation to a possible reduction in the overall number of staff in the system. He indicated that with the reduction in the number of agencies and the general streamlining in management structures some jobs will no longer be needed in the new system. This does not imply that there would be redundancies. It is anticipated that changes will largely be absorbed by natural wastage and redeployment. The intention is that freed up resources can be put into the improved delivery of front-line services.</p>
          <p eId="para_8597">It is important to note that the reform programme is not only about structural change but about improving processes such as planning, financial management and control and the linking of funding and planning in a coherent way. Existing services will continue to be delivered in a coherent and standardised manner, through the new organisational structures that are being adopted by the Government.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_979">It is likely that it will take between 18 months and two years to carry through all of the proposed changes to their full statutory basis. However, it will be possible to effect many changes on an administrative basis in the meantime. I would hope that all of the key elements will be in place within three years. However, it must be recognised that change of this order must be carefully planned and organisational development processes carefully managed to fully bed down the new structures. The management of the transition to the new structures will have to go beyond the establishment of the new bodies to  support the successful and effective development of the new structures internally. In relation to activity since the Government's announcement on 18 June, the following should be noted. A structured feedback process has been undertaken by the Office for Health Management on behalf of the Department of Health and Children since Governments announcement. This was a large undertaking involving more than 20,000 staff. The OHM will be reporting to the Department very shortly. Detailed work has also been going on to scope and plan the programme of change agreed by Government. Terms of reference and membership of action projects to advance specific aspects of the programme are almost finalised. A project office to support the programme is currently being established with key staff to lead and support the development of the programme already appointed.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_980">A national steering committee and board for the interim health service executive are to be appointed in the coming weeks. I am currently considering possible nominees and will be reporting to Government shortly following consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_981">Change cannot be achieved by diktat from the centre; it will require an enormous effort and belief on the part of all of those working in the system at present. The need for constant communication around a change process on this scale is well acknowledged and formed a strong recommendation in the Prospectus report on the audit of structures and functions in the health system. The early feedback has been that this first step in informing, and seeking feedback from staff has been extremely well received and will have dividends in the longer term. I am convinced that the preparatory work currently nearing completion is well worth getting right and is key to the future success of the reform programme.</summary>

          <p eId="para_8626">The owner, occupier or person in charge of a workplace is legally responsible for ensuring compliance with health and safety requirements. As part of the process of monitoring compliance with health and safety requirements, including the prohibition on smoking in the workplace, authorised officers from the health boards, the Office of Tobacco Control and the Health and Safety Authority will visit premises as part of their enforcement duties. I expect that the vast majority of employers, employees and the public will comply with the new health and safety measure which is being introduced primarily to protect people from exposure to toxic environmental tobacco smoke. A decision to call the Garda Síochána to a premises for whatever reason is a matter for the person in charge.</p>

          <p eId="para_8628">A prohibition on smoking in all places of work, including licensed premises, is being introduced  from January 2004. This prohibition is based on recommendations contained in the report on the health effects of environmental tobacco smoke, ETS, in the workplace prepared by an independent scientific working group commissioned by the Office of Tobacco Control and the Health and Safety Authority which was published on 30 January 2003. The primary purpose of the prohibition is to protect the health and safety of workers and the public from exposure to toxic environmental tobacco smoke.</p>
          <p eId="para_8629">Similar prohibitions have been in place in parts of the United States, in particular in California and New York and the experience there has been positive. Clearly being able to work and socialise in an environment free from the harmful effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is a welcome development which has positive health benefits for all concerned.</p>

          <p eId="para_8685">I propose to take Questions Nos. 874, 875 and 887 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_8686">As the Deputy is aware, the provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible patients is the statutory responsibility of the health boards in the first instance.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_986">Entitlement to orthodontic treatment is determined by reference to orthodontic guidelines, a set of objective clinical criteria applied by health board orthodontists when assessing children's priority of need for treatment. The orthodontic guidelines were issued by my Department in 1985 and are still in use. The orthodontic guidelines are used to ensure that orthodontic resources are prioritised for and applied equitably to the most severe cases. When a health board orthodontist decides that a child is in clinical need of orthodontic treatment in accordance with the criteria, he or she is then placed on a treatment waiting list. The guidelines are intended to enable health boards to identify in a consistent way those in greatest need and to commence timely treatment for them. The number of cases treated in the Western Health Board is dependent on the level of resources available in terms of qualified staff in the area and this is reflected in the treatment waiting list. In fact, the provision of orthodontic services is currently severely restricted due to the limited availability of trained specialist clinical staff to assess and treat patients. However, the chief executive officer of the Western Health Board has informed me that patients assessed as category A in the board's area are seen directly upon referral and are not put on a waiting list for treatment.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_987">I have taken a number of measures to address this shortage. The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. This year my Department and the health boards are funding 13 dentists from various health boards, including two from the Western Health Board, for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training in 2001. Thus there is an aggregate of 19 public service dentists currently in training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. Furthermore, two specialists who completed their training last year took up duty with the Western Health Board. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_988">The chief executive officer of the Western Health Board has informed me that at the end of June 2003 there were 827 cases awaiting orthodontic assessment in the board's area. There were no category A cases awaiting treatment and there were 840 category B cases awaiting orthodontic treatment. The chief executive officer has further reported that the board's orthodontic service was providing orthodontic treatment to 1,614 patients at the end of June 2003. This means that there are twice as many children getting orthodontic treatment as there are children waiting to be treated.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p eId="para_8728">The national uptake rate for the measles, mumps and rubella, MMR, vaccine among children of 24 months of age is calculated on a quarterly basis by the National Disease Surveillance Centre. Data provided by the NDSC indicates that in quarter 1, 2003, the national uptake rate for MMR vaccine was 77%. In addition, uptake rates reported by individual health boards ranged from 71% to 87% – See Table 1. This represents an increase of 2% in the national uptake rate when compared with the previous quarter and an increase of 7% in comparison with the same quarter in 2002. The national uptake rate has increased from 69% in Q4, 2001 to 77% in Q1, 2003 – See Table 1. This trend has been reflected in each of the health boards with all health boards having reported an increase in the uptake rate for MMR over this time period. Although MMR uptake rates have been improving over the past year and a half, they are still considerably lower than the national target rate of 95% which is required to provide population immunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_8729">The NDSC has advised that MMR uptake in the United Kingdom has decreased from 84% in Q4, 2001 to 79% in Q1, 2003. This trend is further reflected in the uptake rates reported by England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland where each region has reported a decrease in uptake of MMR vaccine over the same time period.</p>
          <p eId="para_8730">The primary concern of my Department in relation to immunisation is that the vaccines in use are safe and effective. The Irish Medicines Board and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland support the use of MMR on the grounds that it has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective vaccine. There is a sound evidence basis for the use of MMR in the national programme.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_989">The health board chief executive officers established a national immunisation steering committee to address a wide range of issues relating to the childhood and other immunisation pro grammes, including the identification of issues that are hampering the achievement of uptake targets. I launched the report of the steering committee on 22 April 2002. This report is a significant step towards improving immunisation uptake and also enhancing and developing the key systems which underpin the immunisation programmes. In July 2002 a national immunisation implementation group was established and is responsible for co-ordinating the planning and implementation of immunisation programmes in order to improve uptake. This group reports to the national steering committee.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_990">In order to improve vaccine uptake, I have made an additional €2.116 million available in 2003 to fund specific projects and measures which will improve immunisation uptake. There is concern among some parents in relation to the MMR vaccine. Negative coverage on this issue has added to the confusion of parents in deciding whether to vaccinate their children. Last year I launched the MMR Vaccine Discussion Pack – an information guide for health professionals and parents. The pack was produced by the National Disease Surveillance Centre, the Department of Health and Children, the Southern Health Board and was published by the Health Boards Executive on behalf of the health boards. The pack sets out the facts in relation to the most common concerns about the MMR in a way that will help health professionals and parents to explore these concerns together, review the evidence in relation to MMR and provide the basis for making an informed decision. The information is presented in such a way as to allow full discussion between health professionals and parents on each issue. The pack also contains an information leaflet for parents. The layout of the pack is in question and answer format and addresses such issues as the alleged link between MMR and autism and Crohn's disease, the safety and side effects of the vaccine, the purpose of a second dose of vaccine, combined vaccine versus single doses and contraindications to the vaccine. The pack will be of great assistance to health professionals and will enable them to respond to the very real concerns of parents.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_991">I would like to take this opportunity to again urge all parents to have their children immunised against the diseases covered by the childhood immunisation programme in order to ensure that both their children and the population generally have maximum protection against the disease concerned.</summary>

      <b>Mr. Allen</b>
      asked the

      if he will make a statement on a situation where thousands of Irish men will die of prostate cancer while his Department awaits the results of a European study on screening, in view of the fact that his Department has blocked population based screening until the outcome of the European study and that approximately 520 men die of prostate cancer every year here.

          <p eId="para_8888">There are approximately 7,800 deaths annually from cancer, of which approximately 540 are due to cancer of the prostate. I do not accept that my Department has blocked population screening until the outcome of the European study referred to by the Deputy. As the Deputy is aware, a new national cancer strategy is currently being developed by the National Cancer Forum in conjunction with my Department. As part of this work, a sub-group of the National Cancer Forum was established on generic screening. This multidisciplinary group has reviewed all issues relating to screening, including examining specific diseases such as prostate and colorectal cancer. As regards screening for prostate cancer in particular, the group recommended that there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the introduction of a population based prostate screening programme in this country. The group recommended that this issue should be reassessed when the results are available from randomised trials currently being conducted. The group's recommendations will inform the development of the new national cancer strategy.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_997">I advise the Deputy of draft proposals from the  European Commission for a Council of Europe recommendation on cancer screening. The proposal, which is expected to be accepted by the Health Council before the end of the year, provides a framework for consideration by member states of cancer screening programmes. The proposals do not provide for specific recommendations in respect of screening for prostate cancer. The proposals also recognise that ethical, legal, social, medical, organisational and economic aspects have to be considered before decisions can be made on the implementation of cancer screening programmes. Decisions should also be based on priority setting for healthcare resources in each member state.</summary>

          <p eId="para_8890">The Mental Health Act 2001 was enacted in July 2001. It provides for the establishment of the Mental Health Commission, which was established in April 2002. The commission's primary function is to promote and foster high standards and good practices in the delivery of mental health services and to ensure that the interests of detained patients are protected. The detailed work programme of the commission is a matter for the commission itself to determine, in accordance with its statutory functions under the Mental Health Act. However, I understand that one of the priorities for the commission over the next year will be to put in place the structures required for the operation of mental health tribunals, as provided for in Part 2 of the Act. Additional funding will be required for the commission in order to implement the Act and this will be considered in the context of the Estimates process for 2004 and subsequent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_8891">The commission has been involved in discussions with my Department, the health boards and other organisations to ensure that all elements of the organisational and support system are in place prior to the commencement of Part 2 of the Mental Health Act 2001 and that there is capacity to support the operation of the mental health tribunals. Work in this regard is continuing.</p>

In preparing this, the group conducted a national assessment of needs for radiotherapy services having regard to the demography and epidemiology of cancer and the gaps in current service provision. All health boards have been afforded the opportunity to meet with the group and make submissions on a number of occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_8963">The report addresses the following key issues: access to radiotherapy services, comprising information, financial access and organisational components of access; the need to provide a high-quality, evidence-based service; the need to take account of current and new developments in health technology; the requirements of the system in terms of human resources; international norms in relation to service provision, planning and staffing; and the organisational development of the services in terms of structures and processes which need to be in place in a radiotherapy facility. The report is currently being considered by Government and I expect to publish it within the next few weeks.

          <p eId="para_8965">Responsibility for record management lies with individual agencies; the health board management structure includes a director of information  services. In 2003 I have provided approximately €30 million for information systems development and infrastructure.

The national health information strategy will also provide for improvements in record management.</p>
          <p eId="para_8966">The National Archives Act 1986 does not apply to any bodies under the aegis of my Department. Freedom of information legislation applies to many such bodies but its requirement is for access to records retained rather than the retention of any additional records.

          <p eId="para_8968">I understand that my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, recently met with the chief executive officers of the health boards to discuss a number of issues, including the future of the community welfare service, in the context of the health service reform programme. It was agreed that in the first instance, the relevant issues should be examined by a liaison group at senior management level. In addition, the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is subject to the general direction and control of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and administered by the health boards' community welfare services, is currently being reviewed by an interdepartmental working group. The current review is a fundamental appraisal of the scheme aimed primarily at improving customer service and administrative efficiency. The desirability or otherwise of transferring the community welfare service, in part or wholly, will be assessed in the light of the above evaluations. In deciding that issue, the primary objective will be to enhance the service to those who avail of the supports provided in a manner that maximises the effectiveness of the supports and the efficiency with which they are delivered.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</from>
          <p eId="para_8970">On 15 July 2002, in my role as Minister of State with special responsibility for services for older people, I set up – and now chair – the interdepartmental group on the needs of older people. The group's brief was to examine, on an interdepartmental basis, a range of issues that affect the lives of older people and its goal is to bring a positive influence to bear on the various services provided to older people.</p>
          <p eId="para_8971">Issues warranting the particular attention of the group include housing matters and the various home improvement schemes, the information gathering process in relation to older people and the demands placed on them by that process, the consolidation and simplification of application forms, the security of the elderly and equality matters in relation to older people, incorporating the recommendations of the Equality Authority entitled Implementing Equality for Older People. Of the areas requiring immediate attention, housing alteration and improvement for older persons was identified as a priority. Arising from consideration by the group, a streamlined application system for grants is now in operation between the Northern Area Health Board and Dublin City Council. Other matters to be considered by the group include public transport, support to carers and financial incentives to encourage older people to continue working, by reviewing the various schemes currently in operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_8972">To date, in the first 14 months since its inception, the group has met 16 times and, along with my Department, the different Departments that have made contributions to its work include the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Department of Transport, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Valuable contributions and submissions have also been made by the Equality Authority, Comhairle, the national agency responsible for the provision of information; Dublin City Council, Longford County Council, the special housing aid scheme for the elderly task force, the Association of Health Boards in Ireland, the Senior Citizens Parliament, the health boards' chief executive officers, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the Northern Area Health Board, the North Western Health Board, the pensions office, Sligo, the National Council on Ageing and Older People, the Occupational Therapy Special Interest Group on Housing in Ireland and the National Federation of Pensioners Associations.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_999">The group recently received summary submissions from its contributors to date and work is currently under way to identify areas of particular concern to older people on which it might be  possible to make progress on the basis of a cross-cutting approach. I am particularly anxious that the group focus on how integrated packages of care for older people could be put in place on the basis of a combined approach by local agencies. I hope that the group will be able to make a decisive contribution to making progress on this matter. As a contribution to the overall process, my Department has organised a conference at which I hope the more immediate and pressing needs of older people might be identified and examined in a meaningful manner.</summary>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_1107">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_8985">Since 1997 approximately €179 million of additional revenue funding has been invested through the health boards in the development of child welfare and protection services, including an additional €8 million for 2003. This has provided for a wide range of developments including family support projects, preventive services and intensive community based services. Approximately €40 million in capital funding has been made available by this Government through the health boards to put in place additional high support and special care places to provide for a small group of non-offending children who need more intensive intervention than mainstream residential or foster care services.</p>
          <p eId="para_8986">The number of high support and special care places has increased from 17 in 1996 to a current total of more than 120. This includes the Ballydowd special care unit, in the eastern region, which provides a national service to young people aged 11 to 17 years, with capacity for 18 young people. It is anticipated that the Ballydowd service will incorporate an off-site step-down high-support facility with capacity for six young people in addition to the 18 places on site. In the Southern Health Board area the Gleann Álainn special care unit for girls provides a seven-place regional service for the Southern, South Eastern and Mid-Western Health Boards. In addition, work has been completed on Coovagh House special care unit for boys, which is located in the Mid-Western Health Board area and provides five places. This unit will provide a regional service for the Southern, South-Eastern and Mid-Western Health Boards. The Mid-Western Health Board has indicated that referrals are currently being considered for placement in Coovagh House.</p>
          <p eId="para_8987">While health boards have experienced some difficulty in recruiting and retaining suitably trained staff for these services, progress has been made in this area through targeted recruitment campaigns, recruitment abroad and the expansion of training courses. As I am sure the Deputy is aware, a new career and pay structure for child care workers was introduced in 2001. This aims to ensure that more people are attracted into child care and to ensure that child care workers are trained to an appropriate level. From time to time health boards have also put in place individual high support packages to meet the specific needs of children. A number of intensive community based services have also been put in place to provide for the needs of this group of children, including the Edge Project in County Mayo and the youth advocacy pilot projects in the Northern Area Health Board and Western Health Board areas, which commenced last year.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_1000">In addition, Extern, a voluntary organisation, has agreements with a number of health boards to provide intensive community based services for children at risk. These programmes provide an added dimension to the health boards' provision of community based services to meet the needs  of children at risk. While High Court orders of detention are currently required by health boards to detain non-offending children with challenging behaviour in special care units, work is at an advanced stage with a view to introducing Parts II, III and XI of the Children Act 2001 later this year. These parts provide a statutory scheme for non-offending children in need of special care or protection to be placed in special care units on foot of a special care order made by the District Court in appropriate circumstances as a last resort and for as short a period of time as possible.</summary>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_8989">The further actions proposed in the national children's strategy to meet the needs of children with emotional and behavioural difficulties are being addressed <i>inter alia</i> in the context of the implementation of the Children Act 2001. The National Children's Office is co-ordinating the cross-departmental implementation of the Act. Work is at an advanced stage with a view to introducing Parts II, III and XI of the Children Act 2001 later this year. These parts provide a statutory scheme for non-offending children in need of special care or protection to be placed in special care units on foot of a special care order made by the District Court in appropriate circumstances as a last resort and for as short a period of time as possible. Since 1997 approximately €179 million in additional revenue funding has been invested through the health boards in the development of child welfare and protection services. This includes an additional €8 million for 2003. This has provided for a wide range of developments including family support projects, preventive services and intensive community based services. These developments will support the implementation of the Children Act, 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_8990">As stated in the health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You, the dominant focus in child care services since the early 1990s has been on the protection and care of children who are at risk. This policy has shifted in recent times to a more preventive approach to child welfare involving support to families and individual children; the aim is to avoid the need for further more serious interventions later on. This year I established the review of family support services. This review will map out a national policy and plan for the future development of family support services by health boards in line with section 27 of the health strategy. It will report within 18 months.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_1001">The intensive community based services put in place to provide support for children who may have emotional and behavioural problems include the Springboard Initiative and the youth advocate pilot projects. In 1998 the Cabinet committee on social inclusion approved spending of €9.14 million over a three year period from the young persons' services and facilities fund on a number of pilot projects for children at risk, working intensively with children, mainly in the 7-12 age group, who are at risk of going into care or getting into trouble with their families. These projects – the Springboard Initiative – were funded and established through the health boards. Twenty-one such projects have been established throughout the country since 1998. Children and families are generally referred to Springboard through social work departments, schools and other statutory agencies. At present over 700 children attend the projects either for intensive group work or individual work. These children present with a variety of behavioural and psychological problems. There are almost 400 parents attending the projects and either through individual or group work programmes they are learning new patterns in parenting that improve their own self esteem and also the quality of life of their children.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1002">Youth advocate programmes, YAP, have been established on a pilot basis since 2002 in the Northern Area Health Board and in the Western Health Board. The programme works with children and families to reduce the number of young people entering out-of-home placement, reduce the length of stay of young people in care and return children to the most appropriate family placement as quickly as possible by providing a range of intensive community based services. The service is an internationally successful community based alternative to special care and high support placement. About 50 young people are catered for at any one time by the two projects. YAP designs interventions to meet the unique needs of each family with connections to other services as needed and incorporates a crisis intervention service. It attributes its success to its core principles: no eject and reject, strength based approaches and unconditional care.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1003">Among the many programmes which are operating in the various health boards are neighbourhood youth projects, health advice cafés and teen parents' support projects, which aim to provide direct intervention with young people who are at risk of experiencing personal, family, education or social problems, to enable them to grow and develop to their full potential. Another example of a community based support service for children is the Edge Project in Mayo. This is an intensive service for young people with extreme challenging behaviour developed by the Western Health Board to support families as an alternative to secure care placement as defined in the Children Act, 2001. Referrals to the service are assessed on the basis that the behaviour of the young person poses a real and substantial risk  to his or her health, safety development or welfare. Young people identified by these services as needing further treatment are referred to other services as appropriate such as child and adolescent psychiatric services.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1004">The Deputy will be aware that internationally acknowledged best practice for the provision of child and adolescent psychiatric services is through the multi-disciplinary team. In furtherance of the recommendations of the working group on child and adolescent psychiatry, additional revenue funding of €6.061 million was allocated in 2002 to provide for the appointment of additional child and adolescent consultants, for the enhancement of existing consultant led multi-disciplinary teams and towards the establishment of further teams. A further €1.64 million was allocated in 2003. Each health board now has a minimum of two teams in place. The working group also recommended that a total of seven child and adolescent in-patient psychiatric units for children ranging aged six to 16 should be developed throughout the country. Project teams have been established to develop child and adolescent in-patient psychiatric units in Cork, Limerick and Galway and in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area – at St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1005">The second report of the working group on child and adolescent psychiatry, published in June 2003, contains proposals for the development of psychiatric services for 16 to 18 year olds. It recommends that in the further development of the child and adolescent psychiatric service, priority should be given to the recruitment in each health board area of a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist with a special interest in the psychiatric disorders of later adolescence. Further implementation of the recommendations of the reports of the working group on child and adolescent psychiatry will be considered in the context of the estimates process for 2004 and subsequent years. The future direction and delivery of all aspects of our mental health services, including child and adolescent psychiatry, will be considered in the context of the work of the recently established expert group on mental health policy. It is expected that the expert group will report within eighteen months.</summary>

          <p eId="para_8998">The VHI has not been given a Government subsidy. The White Paper on Private Health Insurance referred to the matter of a financial injection to facilitate the restructuring of VHI, in the context of implementing legislation to give the VHI commercial freedom and enable it to seek authorisation as an insurer, having regard to its level of reserves at that time. The White Paper also identified compliance with EU obligations among the principal objectives to be considered  in relation to the restructuring of VHI and stated that any financial injection would have regard to EU requirements. It is my intention that any legislative change to VHI's status will facilitate the operation of a competitive market within the community-rated pricing framework currently in place. Ultimately, proposals by the Government for change in VHI's status will require legislation and will therefore arise for consideration and discussion in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>

          <p eId="para_9002">The 2001 national health strategy, Quality and Fairness – A Health System for You, acknowledges that the broad determinants of health including environmental factors must be taken into account in order to develop an effective health system. The first goal of the strategy is better health for everyone, and this part of the strategy includes the preparation of a national environmental health action plan, NEHAP, which is an inter-sectoral action plan to deal with environmental health issues in Ireland. The draft NEHAP, A Shared Vision for Quality of Life, is currently being finalised. The key objectives of the draft NEHAP are to promote the influence of environmental health factors on quality of life in Ireland and to protect and enhance the environment and living conditions in order to promote human health, to provide a strategic framework for the development and implementation of a multi-sectoral and ongoing partnership at local, regional and national levels in the field of environmental health, and to ensure policy and executive cohesion in implementing, monitoring and reviewing all agreed national and local action plans.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_1006">In June 2003 the European Commission launched a European environment and health strategy. The strategy aims to achieve a better understanding of the environmental threats to human health, to identify the disease burden caused by environmental factors in the EU, and to plan policy responses to the challenges that emerge. The main thrust of the strategy is to fill the knowledge gap in the link between environment and health in a phased basis. The strategy will have a particular focus on children as a unique section of the population with a particular susceptibility to environmental agents. The first cycle, 2004-10, will focus on developing a better understanding of the link between environmental factors and the following health issues – childhood respiratory diseases, asthma and allergies, neurodevelopment disorders, childhood cancer, and endocrine-disrupting effects.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1007">To assist in the implementation of the strategy the commission established a consultative group on environment and health and is currently establishing several technical working groups, each with a specific role and mandate. My Department has nominated representatives to the consultative group and to relevant technical working groups with a health focus. The work of the consultative group and technical working groups will result in an action plan for 2004-10 which the Commission will adopt in the spring of 2004. The action plan will be presented prior to the WHO ministerial conference on environment and health in Budapest in June 2004 and will be the Commission's contribution to the conference.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1008">The theme of the Budapest Conference is the future of our children. It recognises that children and future generations lie at the heart of sustainable development and that policies that protect them protect everyone. One of the major policy outcomes envisaged from the Budapest conference is a children's environment and health action plan for Europe, CEHAPE, which will incorporate those recommendations for follow-up action relevant to this age group. Addressing children's needs will also address the needs of other population sub-groups and will have a long-term benefit on future generations. Evidence to date indicates that there is a link between poor health and environmental problems. It is estimated that approximately 25% to 33% of the burden of disease in industrialised countries can be attributed to environmental factors, the bulk of which affects children and vulnerable groups.</summary>

          <p eId="para_9027">Arising from a number of meetings with various interest groups, I requested Comhairle na nOspidéal to conduct a review of neurological services and related issues. Comhairle established a committee to, <i>inter alia</i>, examine existing arrangements for the provision of consultant level neurology and neurophysiology services nationally and to make recommendations on the future organisation and development of those services. The Comhairle report has recently been published and recommends significant enhancement of neurology and neurophysiology services, including increases in consultant manpower. The report also recognises that there are aspects of a number of other specialties and services such as rehabilitation medicine, geriatric medicine and old age psychiatry which are related to and overlap with neurology services.</p>
          <p eId="para_9028">Comhairle has recommended that a national multi-disciplinary review of rehabilitation services be undertaken to further inform the policy framework in relation to the development of neurology services. Consistent with this recommendation, and in line with commitments in the national health strategy, a national action plan for rehabilitation services is currently being prepared by my Department. The action plan will set out a programme to meet existing shortfalls in services and to integrate specialised facilities with locally based follow-up services. The rehabilitation action plan, together with the Comhairle report and the work undertaken by the Neurological Alliance of Ireland through its own publications, will offer a more comprehensive policy framework for the future development of neurology and neurophysiology services in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_9029">I will be meeting with representatives of the Neurological Alliance on 8 October next to discuss the Comhairle report and to seek its input to the preparation of the rehabilitation action plan. In addition, my Department will continue to work closely with the alliance and the Irish Consultant Neurologists Association, in the form of a joint working group, in relation to the future development of services in this area. The case for additional investment in neurology and neurophysiology will be advanced having regard to the evolving policy framework in this area.</p>

          <p eId="para_9031">Health boards are not legally obliged to provide chiropody services to medical card holders. The formal position is that arrangements for the provision of services, including chiropody services, are a matter for the individual health boards, having regard to their priorities within the funding allocated. Accordingly, chiropody services provided by health boards vary somewhat throughout the country but priority is usually given to medical card holders who are aged 65 years and over, people who have contracted hepatitis C directly or indirectly from the use of human immunoglobulin anti-D or from the receipt within Ireland of any blood product or blood transfusion and who have Health (Amendment) Act, 1996, cards, and people with illnesses such as diabetes or arthritis. A person must be referred for chiropody services by their general practitioner or a public health nurse and most boards provide three chiropody treatments per annum to all medical card holders over the age of 65 when considered clinically necessary. There are no plans to change the manner of delivery of the service at present.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_1009">Construction of phase 1 of the new hospital development at James Connolly Memorial  Hospital is now complete with the exception of some snagging work, which is being carried out in a planned programme by the contractors. This major development is being funded jointly by the Northern Area Health Board – through the sale of surplus lands – and my Department. The projected full project cost is €101.4 million. This includes an amount of €5 million approved earlier this year to facilitate refurbishment works at the hospital which are necessary as part of the transition process to the new hospital and to facilitate a land transfer in line with the project development arrangements.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1010">The development includes a number of facilities which have already been completed. My Department is advised that the coronary care and cardiac unit and the rehabilitation day hospital transferred to the new hospital in recent weeks. Other facilities already completed include an operating department and a surgical day unit as well as in-patient and associated accommodation and medical support services. The new hospital will provide 12 new five-day beds and 34 additional acute psychiatric beds. Discussions are ongoing between the authority, the Northern Area Health Board and the hospital about facilitating the transfer of existing services to the new accident and emergency department, which is due to open in November 2003. Consultations between my Department and the authority are ongoing in relation to the further additional revenue funding required to continue the phased transfer to the new hospital.</summary>

          <p eId="para_9037">The respite care grant, RCG, was introduced in 1999 for recipients of carer's allowance. In 2000, RCG was extended to recipients of domiciliary care allowance, DCA. In 2001 an increased payment was made where there were two or more eligible persons in a family. The current rate of the RCG is €735 where there is one eligible person in a family or €1,470 where there are two or more eligible persons in a family. RCG is a once-yearly payment, which is paid during the first week in June. The RCG is automatically paid to all recipients of DCA, without application being required. The health boards are responsible for paying the RCG to people in receipt of DCA only. The Department of Social and Family Affairs is responsible for paying the RCG to recipients of both the carer's allowance and DCA and to those in receipt of carer's allowance only.</p>

          <p eId="para_9044">The Health Act, 1947, and the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981, provide the legislative basis for the control of infectious diseases, including tuberculosis. The control of infectious diseases is a matter for the health boards and, in this instance, the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_9045">The report of the working party on tuberculosis, which was established to evaluate policy on the prevention and treatment of the disease in Ireland and to make appropriate recommendations, was published in 1996. The report made recommendations, on which my Department's TB strategy is based, for the prevention and treatment of the disease. The recommendations covered a range of issues including epidemiology, surveillance, screening, preventative therapy, clinical management and laboratory diagnosis. As recommended in the report, a permanent committee – the national tuberculosis committee – was established to advise on a detailed national strategy for the control and management of tuberculosis. The committee meets when necessary to review all issues concerning the control and management of tuberculosis.</p>

          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p eId="para_9167">On 25 July 2003 I published the report of Mr. Kevin Bonner in relation to Monaghan General Hospital. I indicated at that time my acceptance of the main recommendation of the report that Monaghan General Hospital should continue to play a vital role in the delivery of acute hospital services to the local community within the Cavan-Monaghan Hospital group. I have also accepted that additional services can be developed at the hospital to the benefit of the local community. In particular, I welcomed the proposals in the report aimed at strengthening the management capacity of the hospital within the Cavan/Monaghan group. The central involvement of consultant staff within this new structure is a very significant development which should enhance the ability of the group to deliver high quality services.</p>
          <p eId="para_9168">Mr. Bonner has recognised in his report that the pattern of acute hospital service delivery is changing worldwide and that Monaghan Hospital's best guarantee for the future is to participate in and accept those changes which will ensure its future viability. In this context, the report's recommendations in relation to the range and configuration of acute services to be delivered within the Cavan/Monaghan Hospital group are appropriate for consideration by the North-Eastern Health Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_9169">The forthcoming national task force on medical staffing, Hanly, report will further inform decisions in this regard. The task force was asked to make recommendations about how to best organise hospital medical staffing within the hospital system, having regard to the requirement of the European working time Directive to reduce the average weekly working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors and the recommendations of the forum on medical manpower. The report of the task force on medical staffing is currently before Government for consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_9170">In accordance with the recommendations in the Bonner report, I am making additional capital funding available to the North-Eastern Health Board under the national development plan. This will allow the board to address urgent capital needs at Monaghan General Hospital in areas such as equipment replacement, refurbishment, fire precaution and other health and safety measures.</p>

          <p eId="para_9176">As part of the implementation process for the strategy, a review of all existing eligibility legislation is ongoing in my Department.

          <p eId="para_9210">The review has now been completed. The Sec retary General of my Department addressed the Committee of Public Accounts on this matter on Thursday 25 September 2003. A copy of his statement for the Deputy's information accompanies this reply.</p>
          <p eId="para_9211"><i>GMS Medical Card Overpayments</i>I welcome the opportunity to bring the committee up to date on this issue. The Committee will be aware of my previous appearance before the Committee on 18 January 2003 and this Departments previous statement to the Committee on 27 March 2003, when it met with the chief executive of GMS Payments Board and of the various Health Boards, that a substantial exercise has been under way involving the ERHA, the three Area Boards and the seven Health Boards to review the entire GMS register. This exercise has been directed by the Department and involved close co-operation with the GMS Payments Board and has been coordinated by a dedicated team led by the Health Boards Executive, which represents the chief executive officer's of the ERHA and the Health Boards. The exercise has now been completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_9212">When work commenced it was necessary to identify the actual cards which were considered to have generated an overpayment, and the amount of that overpayment. Detailed guidelines were agreed by all boards whereby three months from the date when eligibility ceased could be considered a reasonable period for the processing and removal of such a record from the GMS register. This is comparable to the equivalent timeframe for normal deletion of other public service benefits i.e. under the social welfare system. Accordingly, records discovered to have been on the GMS register for more than three months since eligibility ceased were therefore prioritised for indepth examination in relation to overpayment. The degree of overpayment for individual record would depend on the length of time between identification and removal, and the date when eligibility was determined to have ceased.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_1025">Deletion of recordsAll medical card records removed from the register have now been examined. At this point, a total of 80,931 records relating to clients aged more than 65 years have been removed from the GMS register. Of these, 72,495 records relate to over 70's. Based on the agreed guidelines, not all of these records would have generated an overpayment and the bulk of these records would therefore relate to normal activity i.e. removal due to death or a person moving to another Board area. Of the remainder a total of 28,156 are more than three months on the register and have generated an overpayment. The estimated overpayment arising from the removal of these cards from the register amounts to €7,540 million in relation to  capitation payments, with an additional €0.754 million in respect of superannuation, a total of €8,294 million. This is the extent of the overpayment identified.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1026">I would stress that the total deletions amounting to 80.931 records, comprise mostly what would be considered by the Health Boards to be normal deletions – due to death, change in eligibility status or persons moving from one board area to another. In calculating the overpayments relating to over-70s, it was decided to concentrate on those records which were in excess of three months out of date. It is this cohort which comprises the 28,156 over 70 records and which have generated the overpayment above. I would also point out that at the time that full medical card eligibility was extended to all over 70's, i.e. 1 July 2001, some 16,884 cards were more than three months out of date amounting to an overpayment of €6,649 million at that point in time. This constitutes the bulk of the overpayment identified as these cards would have been on the system for a longer period.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1027">GP non-capitation allowancesBecause of the many changes to the contractual agreements with general practitioners over the period in question, the GP non-capitation allowances element of overpayments is proving more difficult to calculate. A detailed exploratory analysis by the GMS Payments Board has shown that there was an overpayment in respect of these allowances. The Board is presently attempting to quantify this amount. Analysis to date shows that it is extremely resource intensive to calculate the overpayment under this heading for individual GPs. When more complete information is available on this, a judgment will need to be made as to where the balance of advantage lies in the context of the best use of taxpayers money.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1028">Future management of databasesDuring the course of this exercise Health Boards have dedicated substantial resources to examining and reviewing the management of their record systems. Additionally, improvements in the General Register of Births, Marriages and Deaths have assisted in the process of deleting records. As indicated previously, the ultimate solution to accurate record maintenance of the GMS register is the development of a unique client identifier. Work is ongoing on the implementation of this project, which will deal, inter alia, with the issue of data integrity and the management and control of client registration going forward. As one element of the Health Reform Programme, the absorption of the General Medical Services (Payments) Board as part of the new Health Services Executive will lead to a single consolidated database for medical cards nationally.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1029">Recoupment of overpaymentAs previously signalled, we are committed to the recovery of excess payments, taking account of the legal and practical issues involved. Legal advice, based on existing statutory and case law, and the detail of the GMS GP contract has been obtained. That advice, including Senior Counsel opinion, has only recently come to hand. It is now being considered by the chief executive officer's of Health Boards, the GMS Payments Board and the Department. Our consideration is informed by the knowledge that any attempt at recoupment is likely to be challenged in the Courts and we acknowledge that great care needs to be taken on how to proceed from here. Any steps taken in this regard will need to be proofed against the probability of legal challenge. The IMO have already indicated that they will resist any attempt at recoupment. Subject to clarifying legal issues, the Department's intention is that full recoupment will be pursued. I will be formally notifying the IMO of this when I meet with them in the coming week.</summary>

          <p eId="para_9214">As the Deputy is aware, the provision of orthodontic treatment for eligible persons is the responsibility of the health boards-authority in the first instance. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures  to improve orthodontic services on a national basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_9215">The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. This year, my Department and the health boards are funding 13 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training in 2001. Thus there is an aggregate of 19 public service dentists currently in training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</p>
          <p eId="para_9216">Orthodontic initiative funding of €4.698 million was provided for the health boards-authority in 2001. This has enabled health boards to recruit additional staff, engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients and build additional orthodontic facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_9217">In June 2002, my Department provided additional funding of €5 million from the treatment purchase fund for health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_9218">The chief executive officers of the health boards-authority have informed me of the following information on their orthodontic waiting lists as at the end of the June 2003 quarter, which is detailed in the table following:</p>

          <p eId="para_9290">Additional revenue and capital funding of €50 million was made available to services for people with disabilities in July 2003. Additional revenue funding amounting to €20 million is being provided in 2003, with a full year cost in 2004 of €30 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_9291">Some €15 million is being made available to services to persons with intellectual disability and those with autism to meet costs associated with emergency residential placements during 2003, the provision of day services for young adults who have just left school and some enhancement of the health related support services for children.</p>
          <p eId="para_9292">Some €5 million is being made available for services for people with physical or sensory disabilities to meet service pressures as identified by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in consultation with other relevant agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_9293">Capital funding amounting to €30 million €15 million for services to people with intellectual disability or autism and €15 million for services to people with physical or sensory disabilities – is also being allocated to the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in respect of minor capital works in services for people with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_9294">This funding will allow the authority and the health boards to address such areas as the backlog of maintenance, refurbishment, re-equipping, replacement of vehicles used within the services or works related to fire precautions and health and safety issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_9295">The provision of funding for these minor capital works will, when completed, help to upgrade many existing facilities. In the case of services to people with intellectual disability or autism, specific provision is being made in relation to a number of services, including St. Joseph's Services, St. Ita's, Portrane, St. Raphael's, Youghal, Grove House, Cork, St. Senan's, Wexford and St. Brigid's, Ballinasloe.</p>
          <p eId="para_9296">The provision of the revenue funding, in particular, will provide around 175 emergency places and over 600 day places and will enable the authority and the health boards to address key issues of concern which had been identified by the various representative groups. The allocation of an additional €50 million is further evidence of the Governments commitment to these services and to supporting people with disabilities and their families.</p>

          <p eId="para_9300">Approval of the appointment of a design team for the preparation of a development control plan, DCP, for the whole hospital development was granted in August 2001. As the approval increased the scope of the phase 2B project to include indicative accommodation proposed in the design brief, for construction in phases subsequent to 2B, the board's project team was requested to review the design brief to reflect procurement of all phases under a single building contract.</p>
          <p eId="para_9301">The revised design brief was approved by my Department and the design team and project team are progressing the preparation of the DCP for the whole hospital development. Funding of €600,000 approximately has been allocated for 2003 for the preparation of the DCP which is at an advanced stage of the development.</p>
          <p eId="para_9302">The delay in progressing finalisation of the DCP for this project is not considered significant given the complexity of the planning issues encountered in meeting the design brief's demanding requirements related to stageing the works and the need to maintain a working hospital for the duration of the construction period.</p>

          <p eId="para_9361">Implementation of the national roads programme is a matter for the NRA within the strategic framework set out in the NDP and the economic and social infrastructure operational programme. Within this framework and having regard to funding available the implementation of individual projects and the allocation of funding, is the responsibility of the NRA.</p>
          <p eId="para_9362">The position overall in relation to funding of the national roads upgrade programme is that the annual exchequer investment in the programme is at an all time high of €1.209 billion. Total exchequer investment over the period will be approximately €3.8 billion – over 30% in excess of that forecast in the NDP. The beneficial impact of this investment is evident throughout the country in the schemes completed since 2000, those currently under way and those at tender stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_9363">In accordance with the strategic framework and the priorities set out in the NDP, the upgrading of the major interurban routes and the removal of bottlenecks on these routes has been prioritised. However, this has not been to the exclusion of upgrade work on other national primary routes. Major upgrade work is currently under way (in addition to that on the major interurban routes) on: N2 – Carrickmacross bypass; N4 – Hughestown-Meera; N5 – Strokestown-Longford; N11 – Glen of the Downs and Rathnew-Ashford bypass; N18-N19 – Hurler's Cross; N22 – Ballincollig bypass; and the N26 – Ballina-Bohola.</p>

          <p eId="para_9365">The NRA will keep the balance of the programme under review to ensure that high priority schemes throughout the country are advanced to construction and through planning as quickly as available funding allows. It is important, however, in this process that the NRA continue to deal with major bottlenecks and to advance the upgrading of the road links between our major cities and towns as a means of promoting more balanced regional development.</p>

          <p eId="para_9369">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1026, 1050 and 1062 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_9370">The matters raised by the Deputy are matters for the contractor, Dublin City Council and the NRA. I am informed by the NRA and Dublin City Council that the port tunnel passes under approximately 50 apartments and 334 houses. The first of the two tunnel tubes has been successfully completed, having passed under or close to all of these properties. From the 2.25 kilometres of bored tunnel which has been constructed a small number of complaints have been received claiming damage to some properties. I understand that any verified damage connected with the tunnelling will be made good by Dublin City Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_9371">I understand that a number of measures are in force to ensure the safety of properties. All properties lying within a 30 metre zone of influence on either side of the tunnel have pre-construction and post-construction building condition surveys carried out by independent building surveyors. Any damage attributable to tunnelling works are covered by a property protection guarantee issued by Dublin City Council to all the property owners before the tunnelling works commenced. There is also provision for interim surveys should complaints arise during the construction period. The project's insurance loss adjusters are also available to assess any damages arising from property owners claims, if and as they arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_9372">I also understand that other significant measures have also been taken to monitor and ensure the safety of buildings over the tunnel including: vibration monitors being installed at various properties to monitor any vibration from the works; settlement surveys being carried out on an ongoing basis during tunnelling under houses; and an extensometer being installed in certain boreholes along the route which remotely monitors ground movements in the rock before such movements appear at the surface and provides substantial information on the ground behaviour associated with the tunnelling.</p>
          <p eId="para_9373">Within the tunnel, monitoring of the tunnel walls is also carried out. This involves the setting up of deformation points, which are regularly checked for position and movement. Any movement or misalignment will be registered. A 24-hour hotline and emergency response is in place.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_1037">This package of measures along with the other various controls and monitoring arrangements  that exist represents a comprehensive approach to ensuring the safe passage of the tunnelling works under properties. It is in line with the best international practice and is part and parcel of the successful delivery of tunnels around the world.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1038">I understand that Dublin City Council, which is managing the project, has consulted and continue to consult extensively with local residents on all aspects of the project.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1039">In relation to the cost of the scheme, the contract for the port tunnel, which is a design and build contract, was awarded in December, 2000. The contract was awarded (excluding provision for price variation) in the sum of €448 million. At that time it was anticipated that the all-in-cost including construction, land acquisition, construction supervision, etc., would be in the region of €580 million. The construction period will extend to 2005 and allowing for price inflation over that five year period, it is currently estimated that the final out-turn cost (including price variation) will be in the region of €680 million in current prices.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1040">More generally, cost estimation and control procedures have been strengthened in the NRA. In particular the greater use of design and build lump sum contracts will secure greater certainty in outturn costs.</summary>

          <p eId="para_9390">Section 23 of the Road Traffic Act 2002, which was commenced on 31 October 2002, provides for major increases in certain financial penalties for road traffic offences including an increase in the general penalty that applies to the majority of offences under the Road Traffic Acts, including the offence of illegally parking in a cycle track.</p>
          <p eId="para_9391">Where a person is convicted of this offence he or she is liable to a fine not exceeding €800 for a first offence, increased from €190, a fine not exceeding €1,500 for a second or subsequent offence and if a third or subsequent such offence is committed within 12 months, the person is liable to a fine not exceeding €1,500 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or both. The determination of the actual fine to be imposed in each particular case is a matter for the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_9392">The offence of parking illegally in a cycle track currently comes within the scope of the on the spot fines system. The amount of the on the spot fine applicable to this offence is €19, which is the level that applies to the majority of parking offences. Where an on the spot fine notice is issued, it is open to the person to whom the notice is addressed to pay the relevant amount so as to avoid the matter proceeding to court. The Road Traffic Act 2002 provides for the replacement of the current on the spot fines system by a fixed charge system. The new system will bring greater certainty to the application of administrative charges for the traffic and parking offences to which it will apply. I expect that the full roll out of the fixed charge system will be completed by mid-2004.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_1044">In the context of the introduction of the fixed charge system I envisage that consideration will  be given to updating the charges associated with parking offences including this offence.</summary>

          <p eId="para_9395">Hackneys, as private hire vehicles, are not subject to fare controls imposed under the public service vehicle regulations. In the case of taxis, the fare is generally established at the end of the hire by reference to the taximeter and any other legal charges. However, in the case of hackneys, the fare should be agreed on a private hire basis in advance as the hire should not involve the vehicle either standing or plying for hire. Accordingly, it is a matter for the person hiring a hackney to agree the fare for a journey in advance, including the manner of its calculation.</p>

          <p eId="para_9399">I have received from Cabra Community Council their proposals for the development of a rail link from central Dublin through "Cabra Junction" linking the Dublin-Maynooth line, Dublin Airport and Swords including connections with Heuston station and the Luas. The Dublin Transportation Office strategy, A Platform for Change, is the accepted blueprint of the transport needs for the greater Dublin area. The DTO's preference for a rail link to Dublin Airport is for a metro line via Broadstone as part of a wider metro system. This is the only context in which re-opening of the Broadstone line has been considered in recent years.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_1046">Phase 1 of the metro as proposed by the rail way procurement agency, RPA, involves a line from the airport to the city centre. The RPA, charged with procuring the metro, has concentrated its work on developing the outline business case for Phase 1 of the metro. I have received the outline business case for Phase 1 from the RPA. I am considering all of the options and will be bringing proposals to the Government in the coming weeks.</summary>

I directed that the study should also examine the possibility of using the Phoenix Park tunnel on a more regular basis for scheduled services. At present, mainly because of capacity constraints at Connolly Station, this tunnel is used only for unscheduled or occasional services such as All-Ireland matches. I understand that the feasibility study was completed recently and will be submitted formally to my Department for consideration shortly. The Luas service on the Tallaght line, when operational in summer 2004, will provide a direct link between Heuston and Connolly Stations.</p>

My Department has appointed consultants to review the feasibility, safety implications and cost of raising the height of the Dublin Port tunnel, including the evaluation of various options to achieve an increase in operational height. I am keeping the matter under review having regard to any additional information that becomes available on foot of this review.</p>

In July last, the Government decided to establish the three State airports at Dublin, Shannon and Cork as fully independent and autonomous authorities under State ownership. I will shortly be seeking Government approval for the drafting of the necessary amending legislation to give effect to this decision and I would hope that this legislation could be enacted by the end of the year. I appointed the chairmen of the new boards-desig nate for the three airport companies on 28 July last and I expect to be in a position shortly to announce the other members of these boards. My Department is also at an advanced stage of a public procurement process to engage expert advisers to assist with the implementation of the Government decision. It would be my hope that the three new State airport companies could be up and running on a statutory basis in the first half of next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_9434">There has been a broad level of support for the Government's decision to establish the three airports as fully autonomous authorities under State ownership. The new arrangements are designed to strengthen and expand each of three airports and to give both Shannon and Cork a fresh, debt-free start under strong and visionary leadership. I believe that all three airports can perform even better than they have to date and, through more focused commercial operation, each can play a greater role in stimulating and supporting regional economic activity to the benefit of their customers, both airlines and passengers, and of Irish tourism, trade and industry.</p>

          <p eId="para_9441">Irish regulations require lamps that show a light to the front of a vehicle to be fitted and constructed in order that they will not dazzle or mislead other traffic when lit. In addition, they must be either white or amber in colour. Such lamps must be fitted with a dipping device in order that the beam of light from the lamp, when dipped, is incapable of dazzling a person more than 25 feet away from the lamp and in a specified position, which approximates to that of the driver of an oncoming vehicle. Dipped headlamps must be used when a vehicle is either passing another vehicle or travelling close behind one. Within this framework a maximum power rating is not specified for vehicle lights. Checks on headlamp alignment and condition are carried out as part of both the national car test and the commercial vehicle testing scheme.</p>

Within this framework, gas discharge headlamps and other headlamps that contain inert gases such as halogen or xenon, have been type approved in accordance with European Union law and are consequently in compliance with Irish lighting law.</p>

          <p eId="para_9444">In order to be licensed as a wheelchair accessible taxi, a vehicle must comply with the requirements of the public service vehicle regulations including a specification for a wheelchair accessible taxi that is detailed in the Schedule to the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations 1998 – S.I. No. 47 of 1998. The Government is committed under the agreed programme for Government to continue the process of making taxis wheelchair accessible. In this regard, the recently enacted Taxi Regulation Act 2003, which provides for the establishment of a Commission for Taxi Regulation, specifically provides that an objective of the commission will be to promote access to small public service vehicles by persons with disabilities. The commission will be tasked with the determination of future policy in relation to accessible taxis and it is anticipated that this  will involve consideration of improvements to the existing wheelchair accessible taxi specification.</p>

The new report was introduced in February 2002 on a phased basis and generally has been positively received. The report grades faults according to their seriousness under various headings and aspects of driving. The report is also used by driver testers as a marking sheet, and faults are recorded as they occur during the test. The revised report provides more information in relation to the actual driving fault in respect of which a fault is marked. Pass or failure is dependent on the number and type of faults incurred which are clearly indicated on the report sheet.</p>

          <p eId="para_9458">The strategic rail review, SRR, provides the Government with a policy framework for the future development of rail passenger and rail freight sectors in Ireland. In the course of the review proposals were received for the development of a rail link from Sligo to Cork via Limerick. The proposal was evaluated in the review and while it noted that this particular route complements the objectives of the national spatial strategy, the financial and economic appraisals were such that it was not included in the recommended investment strategy. The review found that a separate detailed evaluation of the western rail corridor, with due consideration for its full range of potential and complementary land use and settlement policies, would need to be examined rigorously to ensure that the scheme or any element of it satisfies rail viability requirements in terms of patronage and revenue generation.</p>
          <p eId="para_9459">Recognising that the western rail corridor fits in well with the aims of the national spatial strategy, I provided the relevant regional authorities in the west with consultancy advice to ensure that they are fully aware of the necessary prerequisites that would need to be put in place before a rail feasibility study could be commissioned on the western rail corridor.</p>
          <p eId="para_9460">Earlier this month, officials from my Department organised a seminar in Athlone together with the review's consultants to outline to the regional authorities in the border, west, mid-west and south-west areas the context in which the western rail corridor was considered within the overall strategic rail review. The seminar also dealt with the land use and settlement issues that would be critical to such a proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_9461">The seminar was timely, as the regional authorities are currently in the process of drawing up planning guidelines for their regions. Therefore, the seminar was an opportunity for the western rail proposal to be discussed within the context of the regional planning guidelines. The seminar has been followed by direct one-to-one discussions between the consultants and each of the regional authorities. A similar seminar is being arranged for the western development commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_9462">While it is entirely a matter for the regional authorities to consider the potential for rail developments such as the western rail corridor in their upcoming planning guidelines, I would have to stress that such proposals must be supported by land use and settlement strategies that would underpin and support the rail proposals if they are to have any chance of success.</p>

      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Transport</b>
      if his attention has been drawn to the recommendations from members of the European Parliament that taxi drivers who put their homes up as collateral for taxi plates should be compensated in full; and if he will reconsider his refusal to do so.

          <p eId="para_9613">The Government has approved the implementation on a phased basis of the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel. This independent three-person panel was established to report in general terms on the nature and extent of extreme personal financial hardship that may have been experienced by individual taxi licence holders arising from loss of income as a direct result of the liberalisation of the taxi market. The report of the taxi hardship panel recommended the establishment of a scheme to provide payments to individual taxi licence holders who fall into one of six categories that the panel assessed as having suffered extreme personal financial hardship arising from taxi liberalisation. Category 5 of the report refers to particular circumstances where large loan repayments are outstanding and these have been secured against a family home.</p>
          <p eId="para_9614">I am aware of the report of the EU Committee on Petitions in relation to its fact-finding mission to Ireland in connection with the effects of taxi liberalisation. As I have explained previously in the House, based on legal precedent there can be no legal duty on the State to compensate taxi licence holders in relation to open market licence values that may have existed prior to liberalisation. This position remains unchanged and I have no proposals for any payments beyond the total recommended by the panel report.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_1049">Area Development Management Limited, ADM, has been engaged to administer and manage a scheme to implement the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel report. My Department is making arrangements with ADM to facilitate an application process and payment scheme on the basis of the panel recommendations and I expect that these arrangements will be finalised  in the near future with a view to commencing payments to qualifying persons before the end of 2003.</summary>

          <p eId="para_9744">I appreciate fully the patience of those business people and residents who are being inconvenienced by Luas works in their area. I understand from the railway procurement agency that most, if not all, of the current track laying work should be completed by the year-end, which should alleviate the situation. I should add that constructing a major light rail system in a built city environment cannot be undertaken without disruption and most cities which have recently constructed similar systems have encountered similar problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_9745">Luas is part of an expanded future public transport system designed to alleviate traffic problems in Dublin, as outlined in the Dublin Transportation Office's, A Platform for Change. In the medium to long-term, the emphasis of the strategy is to move to rail-based public transport such as Luas-metro and suburban rail. This strategy will achieve a modal shift from the private car to a more sustainable integrated public transport system. Indeed, the strategy responds to the Deputy's concerns about congestion on our roads. As a further step in implementing this strategy, I intend bringing proposals shortly to Government on the first phase of a metro system for Dublin.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_1053">As the Deputy is aware, the railway procurement agency, RPA, is responsible for the management of the Luas project. In relation to the Deputy's concerns about the Red Cow roundabout in the context of Luas, the agency has informed me that alignment of the tram path at the roundabout was the subject of detailed discussions with the National Roads Authority and South Dublin County Council prior to the granting of an order to construct the Tallaght to Connolly Station line. This followed detailed consideration at the public inquiry held into the proposals put forward by the then CIE light rail project office, whose work was subsequently taken over by the RPA. The RPA's view is that  Luas will have no negative impact on traffic conditions at this roundabout. However, concerns had been expressed at the potential for traffic congestion at the Red Cow roundabout, and in response, my Department commissioned a technical report to analyse the feasibility of providing a separation between the Luas and local road infrastructure. This report is being reviewed at present by all the relevant State agencies, including the RPA, to identify the best long-term solution to address the traffic issues at the Red Cow roundabout.</summary>

          <p eId="para_9834">The Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 2002 strengthens the disciplinary regime for solicitors in a number or respects of which the following are examples. It doubles the maximum membership of the tribunal to cater for an increased workload and the speedier processing of cases. The tribunal is now required to make a separate finding on each ground of alleged misconduct. Regard must be had to previous findings of misconduct by a solicitor when imposing a sanction in the current case. The maximum amount which a solicitor, in respect of whom there has been a finding of misconduct, may be ordered to pay to an aggrieved party or to the Law Society's compensation fund increased from £5,000 to €15,000. There is a right of appeal to the High Court on all aspects of the tribunal's work. The Act provides for remedies against solicitors who fail to co-operate with investigations. The circumstances in which the Law Society may refuse to issue a practising certificate or impose conditions on a certificate are spelt out in more detail than before. The circumstances in which the society can send an investigator to inspect documents at a solicitor's office are also extended.</p>
          <p eId="para_9835">The purpose of the new provisions is to make the disciplinary regime for solicitors more effective. Their operation will be kept under review. In that context, I would remind the Deputy that the Progressive Democrats election manifesto 2002 contains a commitment to establish an office of statutory ombudsman to protect the interests of clients of the legal profession. This commitment is not included in the agreed programme for Government between Fianna Fail and the Progressive Democrats. However, in the foreword to the agreed programme, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste state that, in government, it is open to either party to seek to persuade colleagues to pursue any individual policy included in their respective manifestos. Accordingly, it remains open as to whether proposals to Government for the establishment of a statutory ombudsman for the legal profession will be made.</p>

Parties to such actions will have to swear an affidavit verifying the content of their pleadings. Notwithstanding that swearing falsely is already a criminal offence, a specific statutory offence will be created in respect of falsely swearing a verifying affidavit and this will carry a maximum sentence of ten years imprisonment and or a fine. I also propose to provide for a statutory offence of tendering or adducing false evidence with similar penalties. I would add that, under section 7 of the Criminal Law Act 1997, any person who aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of an indictable offence shall be liable to be indicted, tried and punished as a principal offender.</p>

          <p eId="para_9848">All accommodation providers and companies managing State owned accommodation centres are required under contract, generically approved by the Office of the Attorney General, to ensure that all accommodation centres comply and operate in accordance with all statutory requirements of local authorities and state agencies in relation to bedroom capacity, food, food hygiene, water supply, fire safety and general safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_9849">In addition, all operators are required to offer menus which reflect the reasonable ethnic needs of asylum seekers. There are approximately 100 nationalities with hugely divergent food and ethnic needs accommodated by the agency and in all the large centres 56 day menu cycles are in place. Other centres, depending on their size, operate 28 day and 14 day menu cycles. The agency also requires the chef in each centre to meet on a regular basis with a representative group of asylum seekers to discuss their food requirements and asylum seekers are encouraged to give demonstrations to chefs on the preparation and serving of ethnic dishes. In addition, particular emphasis is laid on meeting to the greatest extent possible the religious needs of asylum seekers. For example, special arrangements are made to cater for the needs of Muslims observing Ramadan.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_1068">Staff from the agency, including senior management, regularly eat in accommodation centres in order to assess the food on offer and in the vast majority of cases, they have expressed themselves  satisfied. In centres where it is felt that the food on offer is not of a satisfactory standard the matter is pursued vigorously with centre management.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1069">In circumstances where asylum seeker parents and their children are accommodated in centres operating under the aegis of the agency, particular emphasis is placed on meeting their needs.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1070">It is the policy of the agency that cots are provided in all centres where infants are accommodated and that toilet and bathroom facilities are provided in accordance with relevant statutory requirements. In this regard, the contracts with accommodation providers and operators stipulate that, at a minimum, in addition to cots, the following should be available: infant formula; infant food; access to fresh water, for the preparation of infant formula; sterilisers, sufficient for the number of infant children; kettles for boiling water; fridges, for infant formula bottles; microwave-bottle warmers.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1071">The agency engages independent external assessors to conduct comprehensive inspections of all centres on at least an annual basis. These inspections are always unannounced and the inspectors look at all aspects of the accommodation centre in relation to the proprietors' obligations under the contract which cover such areas as reception, management and staff cover, menus and facilities being provided, maintenance of the property and fire and safety issues. In addition the agency has an in house inspections unit which also conducts inspections of each of the properties used to accommodate asylum seekers at least on a twice yearly basis. Further unannounced visits are made on a regular basis by senior management to accommodation centres throughout the State to ensure that standards are being maintained. Staff from the agency hold clinics on a regular basis in the larger accommodation centres which affords asylum seekers an opportunity to comment on accommodation and operating standards.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1072">Any diminution in standards which comes to the attention of the inspection teams is immediately followed up and proprietors are requested to make any changes and improvements deemed necessary. Where necessary, follow up inspections are also arranged. Diminution in standards are treated very seriously by the agency and in cases where they have not been remedied, contracts have been terminated in the past.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1073">The introduction of direct provision on 10 April 2000 brought Ireland into line with other member states of the European Union, including the United Kingdom, and followed thorough investigation and planning. It is widely accepted that a harmonised approach to asylum seekers is by far the best approach and I believe the system of direct provision is a humane, fair and effective means of meeting the basic needs of our asylum seeker population. In fact, I would strongly contend that the treatment of asylum seekers in this  State is, at a minimum, on a par with the best on offer anywhere in the world.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1074">While the operation of the scheme is being monitored on an ongoing basis, I have no plans, at present, to introduce alternative arrangements.</summary>

The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities received a broad range of submissions from the different disability organisations and from individuals, including proposals for the recognition of Irish sign language as the language of deaf citizens and for education to be provided to deaf children through Irish sign language. The commission pointed to the need for sign language to be recognised but did not recommend inclusion as an official language or specify a particular form of sign language. Arising from its deliberations the commission made proposals relating to the education of deaf children and access to further education options  through sign language. In this regard, the Education Act, 1998 has made provision for support services in respect of students learning through Irish sign language or any other sign language, including interpreting services. The Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2003, which is currently before the Oireachtas, addresses the provision of services for children in education, focusing on the assessment of the needs of the individual child and this may include the consideration of appropriate sign language services.</summary>

In that regard, the recommendations contained in the report of the review of the coroners service are an essential part of the process.

          <p eId="para_9875">In the context of fulfilling the Government's commitment to modernisation of our coronial system, I met with representatives of the Coroners Society of Ireland on 30 June last. Our discussions centred on key issues of concern which had been highlighted by the report of the review group or otherwise, for instance by decisions of the courts. We agreed that a certain number of issues needed to be addressed as a priority. These would include the issue of attendance of medical and other witnesses at inquest, increased sanctions for those who refuse to cooperate at an inquest and a more coherent restatement of the scope of the provisions for mandatory inquests, to include all deaths in custody situations.

          <p eId="para_9884">The term "gangland killing" or organised crime is widely used by the media in referring to the nature of certain serious crimes, including a number of unlawful killings. Regardless of their classification within the media, the Garda subject all murders to detailed investigation – the fact that the people involved may have already been associated with alleged criminal activity does not lessen the gravity of the offence or the Garda's determination to solve such murders.</p>

          <p eId="para_9888">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1121 and 1213 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_9889">Following a review of Garda vetting arrangements, a central vetting unit was established in January 2002 to deal with the then known demand for vetting. The unit currently processes approximately 100,000 vetting requests per annum in respect of, <i>inter alia,</i> prospective employees of health boards entering full-time employment who would have substantial unsupervised access to children or vulnerable persons.</p>
          <p eId="para_9890">When the central vetting unit became fully operational and all its backlogs were cleared, it was envisaged that a phased extension of the vetting arrangements to other groups would take place. To this end, a working group was established to examine the issue, taking account of all aspects of the vetting of persons coming in contact with children and vulnerable persons – be they full-time, part-time, voluntary or community workers or students on placements.</p>
          <p eId="para_9891">Membership of the working group, which originally comprised representatives of the Garda Síochána and my Department, was subsequently extended to include representatives of the Office of the Attorney General and the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science. It has met on four occasions to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_9892">The work of the group is ongoing and I hope to receive the outcome of its deliberations in about two months.</p>

          <p eId="para_9896">The Children Act 2001 contains a range of innovative measures on restorative justice for juvenile offenders in accordance with modern thinking and best international practice. Three Departments have a role in implementing the Act; the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science. The National Children's Office has responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the Act and co-ordinate regular working group meetings. During the passage of the Act through the Oireachtas, it was made clear by the Government that implementation would have to take place on a phased basis given its complexities.</p>
          <p eId="para_9897">Significant parts of the Act have already been commenced. The first commencement order under the Act in respect of my Department was signed by my predecessor on 23 April 2002. The order, which came into force on 1 May 2002, provided for, <i>inter alia: </i>(i) the establishment of the Garda diversion programme on a statutory basis and the introduction of a diversion conference based on restorative justice principles as pioneered in New Zealand; (ii) the establishment of the Children Court; (iii) the introduction of a fines structure for children found guilty of offences and the payment of compensation by parents in respect of offences committed by their children; (iv) the introduction of a curfew for children found guilty of offences; (v) court orders to parents to exercise proper control over their children; (vi) the updating of the law in relation to cruelty to children and persons who cause or encourage a sexual offence on a child; (vii) reversing the burden of proof on parents whose children are found begging; (viii) a limited “clean slate” in respect of most offences committed by children; (ix) provisions relating to the safety of children at entertainments.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_1082">The Garda juvenile diversion programme provides that, in certain circumstances, a juvenile  under 18 years of age who freely accepts responsibility for a criminal incident may be cautioned as an alternative to prosecution. The programme has proven to be highly successful in diverting young people away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families. In the more serious cases, juveniles are placed under the supervision of Garda juvenile liaison officers, who are specially trained members of the Garda Síochána responsible for administering the programme at the local level.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1083">Part 4 of the Children Act 2001 introduced the concepts of restorative justice, specifically restorative cautioning and restorative conferencing, to the juvenile diversion programme. Essentially, these provisions provide for the inclusion, where appropriate and possible, of the victim, the juvenile's family and the wider stakeholding community in the process of diversion. To facilitate these innovative developments, most of the Garda juvenile liaison officers have now received training in mediation skills, with advanced training being provided to selected officers.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1084">Ongoing evaluation of restorative justice practice is being carried out by the Garda research unit. It is intended that, as Garda juvenile liaison officers become more skilled in administering restorative justice, they will be able to focus on the more complex and high-risk offenders, with a view to further reducing the incidence of recidivism.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1085">In addition to the Garda juvenile diversion programme, there are in existence a total of 64 Garda youth diversion projects. These projects are a community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiative which seeks to divert young persons from becoming involved – or further involved – in anti-social and-or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1086">My Department has a strong commitment to the principles of restorative justice and is very clear about the advantages it offers to communities and victims of crime. Under the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act, 1983, a court may make a community service order as an alternative to a sentence of imprisonment or detention in respect of any individual over the age of 16 years who has been convicted of a criminal offence and who consents to the order being made. The order requires an offender to perform unpaid work for between 40 and 240 hours, usually to be completed within 12 months. The aim of a community service order is to rehabilitate the offender through the discipline of having to work in the community and the making of meaningful reparation to that community for his or her crime.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1087">My Department also funds two restorative justice projects through the probation and welfare service – (i) the victim-offender service in Tallaght and (ii) the Nenagh reparation project. Both projects work closely with the community and  have community representation on their management committees.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1088">In their broad range of work probation and welfare service staff are very aware of the impact of crime on victims and communities and their work with offenders has a strong focus on ensuring that offenders take responsibility for the hurt and damage caused by their crime. Expansion of the dedicated restorative justice projects is desirable and I intend to develop further such projects through the probation and welfare service as and when resources allow.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1089">I can assure the Deputy that through their involvement in Garda intervention projects and other initiatives, gardaí are committed to maintaining good relationships with the community which they serve.</summary>

          <p eId="para_9905">A grant application for capital grant assistance from the 2000-2006 equal opportunities childcare programme was received from this community based group in April 2003. All applications for grant assistance undergo a thorough assessment and appraisal process against the programme criteria by Area Development Management Limited. On completion of the assessment process, applications are considered by the programme appraisal committee, chaired by my Department, for a recommendation before I make a final decision. There has been considerable demand from community based groups for capital grant assistance under the programme and every county has benefited from significant grant commitments to provide new and enhanced community based child care facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_9906">The equal opportunities childcare programme 2000-2006 is currently undergoing an independent mid-term review as part of the review of the National Development Plan 2000-2006. My Department is also currently carrying out an extensive review of the programme's capital commitments to date to ensure that those grant commitments previously entered into will be realised by the groups on the ground. At the same time, it is also reviewing the different budget lines under the capital programme to ensure that the most effective use is made of all remaining capital funding in accordance with the objectives of the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_9907">All applications for capital grant assistance are appraised in accordance with the programme criteria in order to ensure that those projects which best meet the aims and objectives of the programme receive the capital grant assistance which will enable them to provide quality childcare in areas where there are service deficits. It would be premature of me to comment further on specific applications for capital grant assistance at this time.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_1094">The duties and powers of a peace commissioner set out in section 88(3) of that Act allows for (a) signing summonses, except against a garda, (b) signing warrants, (c) administering oaths and taking declarations, affirmations, information, bonds and recognisance's and (d) signing certificates for the registration of clubs. They are also empowered to sign certificates for the destruction of food unfit for consumption under food hygiene regulations. The issuing of summonses and warrants was subject to a number of legal challenges in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and decisions of the superior courts raised serious doubts about the constitutional competence of peace commissioners to exercise such powers. Peace commissioners are therefore no longer requested to exercise the powers to issue summonses, warrants for arrest and to remand persons in custody or on bail.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1095">The requirement in particular that search warrants be issued by a district judge was based on specific legal advice in March 2000. This was to the effect that the search warrant should be issued by a judge as it applies to offences which carry a sentence of five years or more. The requirement is in line with the policy on search warrants which has been pursued for some time in relation to other legislation. Examples include section 55 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994, section 14 of the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996 and section 10 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 which contains a general provision on search warrants. In emergency situations, such as under the Offences Against the State Act and other statutes, it is possible for senior members of the Garda Síochána to issue warrants.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1096">At present the powers and duties of peace commissioners consist primarily of taking statutory declarations, witnessing signatures on documents for various authorities and signing certificates and orders under various Acts. I do not propose to amend the legislation relating to peace commissioners at this time but I will keep the matter under review.</summary>

          <p eId="para_9922">There are almost 900 civilian clerical and administrative staff employed as a support to the Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_9923">In November 1997 the Government accepted in principle the recommendations set out in the report of the steering group on the efficiency and effectiveness of the Garda Síochána. That review was conducted in the framework of the strategic management initiative, SMI, across the public service. The report contained a number of recommendations requiring a more comprehensive development of issues relating to the organisation, operations, financing and performance and accountability of the Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_9924">The report recognised the potential for further civilianisation within the force. It stated that the concept behind the introduction of civilianisation was to allow for certain jobs to be done at a more economic cost and to free up gardaí for work more suited to their training and development, while at the same time increasing the operational capacity of the force.</p>
          <p eId="para_9925">In January 1998 the Government established a new Garda SMI implementation steering group to develop the report's recommendations for implementation. To this end, a bottom-up review group was established to focus on organisation structures-systems and the deployment of operational resources and to bring recommendations to the steering group in the areas for which it was responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_9926">As the Deputy will be aware, in October 2001 the Government approved the report on civilianisation in the Garda Síochána which recommended a programme of civilianisation of 496 technical and administrative posts occupied by gardaí to allow for the release of Garda members to operational policing. These posts are located in Garda headquarters, in the Garda College and in districts and divisions throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_9927">The civilianisation report also provides for the transfer of finance functions from the Garda district clerks to civilians, and the subsequent upgrading of the new civilian role to staff officer. In this regard, an office notice issued recently to invite applications from clerical officers to compete for the posts.</p>
          <p eId="para_9928">A working group, comprising representatives of the Garda Síochána and my Department, is overseeing implementation of the report. It is envisaged that the posts will be civilianised on a phased basis over a number of years. Some 65 posts have been identified to commence this process and it is envisaged that the remaining posts will thereafter be civilianised on a phased basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_9936">I am informed by the Garda authorities that the establishment of a second Garda station in Tallaght would necessitate placing additional gardaí on indoor administrative duties, and often such personnel can be utilised more effectively in providing a visible Garda presence on outdoor policing duties. Moreover, Garda clinics have been provided, in partnership with South Dublin County Council, in Killinarden, Jobstown, and Fettercairn-Brookfield and these clinics are staffed for a minimum of one hour, one day per week. A member of the housing staff of the council is present to deal with accommodation problems and anti social behaviour in the local authority areas. It should be noted that gardaí attached to Tallaght Garda station maintain continuous contact with each of these communities.</p>

          <p eId="para_9961">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1143 and 1144 together.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_1097">According to the website of the Council of  Europe only six of its 45 member states have ratified the 1969 European Agreement on Au Pair Placement. They are Denmark, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway and Spain. Luxembourg denounced the agreement with effect from March this year. There are no immediate plans, on my part, to propose to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that Government approval be sought for ratification of this agreement. Ratification of the agreement would require the establishment of an authority – the essential purpose of which is to monitor the welfare of the au pairs in question. The agreement is not based on reciprocity and those states which are parties to it are bound to extend its protection to all non-nationals including EU nationals who are largely exempt from immigration control. Thus ratification of the agreement would involve issues for a number of Departments.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1098">With regard to permission to remain for au pairs for a two year period, the position is that the question of granting permission to remain does not arise in the case of nationals of EU countries or nationals of Iceland, Liechenstein, Norway or Switzerland who are here as au pairs. From 1 May 2004 it will no longer arise for nationals of the ten accession countries. It seems, in relation to nationals of other countries, that the essence of the Deputy's question is that the immigration authorities should grant a blanket two year permission to remain on the premise that recruitment agencies will notify the immigration authorities of any change in the position.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1099">The idea of granting more limited permission – which can be extended – is to allow Garda registration officers to monitor the presence of the persons in question and to ensure that the stated purpose of their presence in the State remains their true purpose. Even the aforementioned European agreement states in its preamble that au pairs are neither students nor workers but belong to a special category which has features of both. The host family is required to pay the au pair in question an unspecified sum of money and to give the person in question adequate time to attend language courses. There is no specific obligation on the au pair to attend such courses. A danger at present for example is that certain persons, whose sole function is childminding, might seek to style themselves as au pairs. This is because since last April the policy of the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment has been not to issue work permits in respect of childminders. This policy followed an intensive analysis of the skills profile of job seekers with FÁS.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1100">It should also be borne in mind that an au pair arrangement is not predicated on the involvement of a third party such as an agency. Even the aforementioned 1969 European agreement, which deals with a form of placement which is quite restricted, envisages a contractual relationship between a host family, and an au pair. Second, some agencies which are involved in the recruitment of au pairs are also involved in the  recruitment of childminders and nannies. For that reason I would not be in favour of the Deputy's proposal.</summary>

The Deputy will appreciate that the Children Act is very complex and comprehensive legislation and, for those reasons, provisions under the Act are being implemented on a phased basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_9964">The first commencement order under the Act in respect of my Department was signed by my predecessor on 23 April 2002. The order, which came into force on 1 May 2002, provided for, <i>inter alia</i>: (i) the payment of compensation by parents in respect of offences committed by their children – section 113 of the Act; (ii) a court order which would require parents to exercise proper and adequate control over their children – section 114 of the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_9965">Section 111 of the Act provides that, "in any proceedings where a child is found guilty of an offence, the court may make an order for the supervision of the child's parents – a "parental supervision order"– where the court is satisfied that a wilful failure of the child's parents to take care of or control the child contributed to the child's behaviour. A parental supervision order may order the parent of the child to do any or all of the following: (a) to undergo treatment for alcohol abuse or other substance abuse, where such facilities are reasonably available; (b) to participate in any course that is reasonably available for the improvement of parenting skills; (c) adequately and properly to control or supervise the child to the best of their ability, except where the terms of any community sanction imposed on the child make such control or supervision impracticable; (d) to comply with any other instruction of the court that would in its opinion assist in preventing the child from committing further offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_9966">Implementation of the new parental supervision order provided for under section 111 of the Act will require a very significant input from the probation and welfare service. In this context, additional probation and welfare officers are being recruited. Nine additional probation and welfare officers took up duty in September 2003 and a response to other offers of appointment is awaited.</p>

          <p eId="para_9969">The vast majority of members of an Garda Síochána perform their duties to the highest standards. However, as in any organisation, a small group can abuse the trust placed in them.</p>
          <p eId="para_9970">It is important that no matter how infrequent the incidence of disclosure of confidential information by individual members of the Garda Síochána, the law must be visibly adequate to the task of deterring or, where it occurs, dealing with such behaviour, especially given the highly confidential and intimate nature of the information held by the Force on victims of crime and others.</p>
          <p eId="para_9971">For that reason I included in the general scheme of the Garda Síochána Bill, 2003, a provision on the prevention of the unauthorised disclosure of confidential information from within the force. In making this proposal, I have made clear that it is not intended in any way to interfere with normal and proper relations between the Force and the media. In publishing the general scheme, in advance of the finalisation of the Bill itself, my aim was and is to facilitate public debate and consultation on its provisions. The note included in the draft scheme of the Bill at head 26 specifically states that the precise scope of the provision and, in particular, whether there is a need to provide for exemptions, will be considered further during the drafting stage of the Bill. I will give careful, fair and open-minded consideration to any comments or suggestions on the general scheme, including the provision on the disclosure of information.</p>

Stenography is provided only in criminal jury trials where an appeal may be taken to the Court of Criminal Appeal where a transcript of the evidence would be required.

          <p eId="para_10026">The issue of <i>ex parte</i> orders in the family law courts usually arises in the context of orders made under the Domestic Violence Acts, 1996 and 2002. These Acts provide that interim barring orders and protection orders may be granted <i>ex parte.</i> The 2002 Act remedied a defect in the provision in the 1996 Act relating to <i>ex parte</i> interim barring orders which the Supreme Court held to be unconstitutional for failing to prescribe a fixed period of relatively short duration during which the interim order would remain in force. The Supreme Court stated that it was not beyond dispute that the legislature could provide for the granting of interim barring orders on an <i>ex parte</i> basis. However, when such an order is made, there has to be an early return date and this is specifically provided for in the 2002 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_10027">I believe that the power to grant orders <i>ex parte</i> is essential to protect victims of domestic violence in some situations. I will, of course, consider any suggestions that are put forward to improve the existing provisions or to remedy any defects.</p>

          <p eId="para_10029">The issue of Judicial Conduct and Ethics has been considered in the recent past  by the constitutional review group and by an All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution which, <i>inter alia,</i> recognised the need for improved oversight of judicial conduct and, in the case of the All Party Committee, recommended the establishment of a judicial council to review judicial conduct.

In relation to children born outside marriage, the mother is the sole guardian. However, under section 6A of the 1964 Act, as inserted by section 12 of the Status of Children Act 1987, an unmarried father may apply to the court to be appointed a guardian of his child. Alternatively, where there is agreement between the parents, they can make a statutory declaration under section 2(4) of the Act, as inserted by section 4 of the Children Act 1997, conferring on the father the status of guardian. Section 8(4) of the Guardianship of Infants Act provides that a guardian holding office by virtue of these provisions may be removed only by the court.</p>
          <p eId="para_10034">Section 11 of the Guardianship of Infants Act provides that the guardian of a child or the unmarried father of a child, even if he is not a guardian, may apply to the court for its direction on any question affecting the welfare of the child, including orders on custody and access.</p>

          <p eId="para_10042">I can assure the Deputy that I did not refuse to meet the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Mr. Royston Brady. Last Thursday I had a useful meeting with the Lord Mayor and Councillors Frances Fitzgerald, Vincent Jackson and Dermot Lacey. Among other issues, we discussed the work of the Garda Síochána and my Department in regard to crime detection and prevention and how Dublin City Council might contribute to making Dublin a safer city.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_1104">The Garda authorities have put a number of initiatives in place to deal with anti-social behaviour in Dublin. Among these is a new city centre policing initiative which was launched on 9 June 2003 by the Assistant Garda Commissioner for the Dublin metropolitan region. This initiative provides high visibility policing presence in specific target areas in the north and south inner city centre areas. It targets issues of concern such as public order, assaults, street theft, shoplifting,  addicts, beggars and general vagrancy. Another Garda initiative, Operation Boulevard, targets anti-social behaviour in the environs of O'Connell Street.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1105">With regard to gang-related deaths, the term "gangland killing" or "organised crime" is widely used by the media in referring to the nature of certain serious crimes, including a number of unlawful killings. It is often qualified by the suggestion that the victim was "known to the gardaí". While this speculation is understandable, it does not correspond to the manner in which the Garda Síochána classifies crime or individual offences.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1106">I have had a number of meetings with the Garda Commissioner and other senior Garda personnel to discuss crimes which might be put in the category of gangland or organised crime. I am satisfied that the necessary resources, both financial and operational, are being directed towards the containment and detection of such serious criminal activity. I have also confirmed to the Garda authorities my willingness to consider any further measures which they feel would assist in addressing this problem.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1107">I am glad to note that the fourth and latest report of the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism, which covers the period November 2002 to April 2003, does not support the suggestion of an ongoing increase in racist incidents. I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 663 of 10 June 2003 for a detailed account of the Government's anti-racism strategy.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1108">The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2002, gives the gardaí significant additional powers when dealing with anti-social behaviour. In addition, all sections of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, have been in operation since yesterday, Monday, 29 September 2003. The latest provisions to come into effect change the closing time on Thursdays to 11.30 p.m., grant licensees discretion to exclude young persons from bars, and oblige persons aged 18 to 20 to carry an age document if they wish to purchase alcohol. I am confident that these reforms will improve compliance with, and enforcement of, the licensing laws. The many structural reforms to the licensing system recommended by the Commission on Liquor Licensing will be addressed in the codification of the licensing code. I expect that an outline of a codification Bill will be available by mid-2004.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1109">Finally, as the Deputy will be aware, the preliminary draft scheme of the Garda Síochána Bill 2003, made public on 30 July, contains a number of measures on the organisation, management, performance and accountability of the Garda Síochána aimed at improving the efficient and effective use of Garda resources. The publication of the preliminary draft scheme allows all concerned, and the public at large, the opportunity to take part in the consultative process that will inform the drafting process of the Bill.</summary>

          <p eId="para_10045">Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of L &amp; O, the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish born child ended on 19 February 2003. The Government decided that the separate procedure would not apply to cases which were outstanding on that date. There are a large number of such cases outstanding at present, including the case to which the Deputy refers.</p>
          <p eId="para_10046">Since the person in question does not have an alternative legal basis for remaining in this jurisdiction the issue of permission to remain will be considered – but only in the context of a ministerial proposal to deport her. In that context she will be notified of the proposal and given an opportunity to make representations in relation to it. If, in the light of those representations and the range of factors set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, the Minister decides not to make a deportation order she will be given leave to remain on a humanitarian basis.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_10075">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1171 and 1172 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_10076">I am aware of the newspaper reports as referred to by the Deputy and I wish to congratulate the achievement of prisoners in several prisons who secured excellent examination grades in 2003. However, I would make the point that, in the prisons, enrolment in third level-degree courses is through the open university and not through the standard CAO system as is implied in the particular newspaper article.</p>
          <p eId="para_10077">The annual report for 2002 of the Irish Prison Service, which was recently presented to me and which has just been published, gives an overview of the provision of education in our prisons. As well as commenting on the principal features and major developments in relation to the prison education service during 2002, the individual prison profiles contained in the annual report give a snapshot as to the extent of participation by prisoners in educational facilities in the different prisons and places of detention. As mentioned in the report, however, set courses and examinations are but a part of prison education.</p>
          <p eId="para_10078">Successive policy initiatives in relation to the prisons, dating from the Whitaker report in 1985, have placed emphasis on the crucial role education can play in the management and rehabilitation of prisoners. In the individual institutions, participation varies with factors such as facilities, turnover of the prisoner population and the need to segregate certain groupings of prisoners. Participation in education is voluntary; each student has an individualised timetable which caters for his/her identified needs. In 2002, 54% of all prisoners were involved at some level in education: the take-up in the different education units ranging from 43% to over 80%.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_1210">I would call the Deputy's attention to a particular commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government which states "we will tackle the high level of illiteracy and lack of educational accomplishment prevalent in many prisoners by supporting enhanced educational programmes within prisons". Specific actions in relation to the above Government commitment by the Irish Prison Service include the prison education curricu lum is currently under review to ensure continuing relevance to prisoner needs; the recent launch by the Irish Prison Service of a research study on adult literacy levels among prisoners, which measures the extent of the problem in an objective manner and most importantly compares the literacy levels of prisoners with those of the general population; and the development by the prison education service of guidelines for quality literacy work in prisons which aims to facilitate prison education units to reach and retain a larger number of prisoners with literacy problems. Implementation of the guidelines is in progress in all prisons and places of detention.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1211">Continuing curriculum development is a particular feature of the prison education service. Furthermore, the service has been to the forefront in the planning and development of innovative classroom material for literacy and basic education students.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1212">As regards the mention by the Deputy of a possible linkage between participation in education by prisoners and a reduction in recidivism, the Irish Prison Service has recently confirmed an allocation of part funding to a leading criminological academic body to enable it to undertake a multi-level study of prisoner recidivism. Among variables to feature in the analysis will be data on a sizeable sample of prisoners including offence and offender characteristics such as age, gender, education, marital status, criminal history, offence type, length of sentence served, whether the offender participated in specialised programmes etc. It is intended that the research will begin in the coming months and will run for about three years.</summary>

The Government decided that the separate procedure would not apply to cases which were outstanding on that date. The case to which the Deputy refers is one of those cases. In that context she was notified on 22 July 2003 that there is no separate process for considering such applications and her original documentation was returned to her.</p>

As I stated in that reply, this person was granted permission to remain in the State in September 2001 for one year as an exceptional measure on the basis that she was dependent on her brother. She is no longer a minor and she has indicated that she does not reside with her brother and, as a  consequence, is no longer dependent on him. Consequently, the permission to remain which was originally granted to her cannot simply be extended on the basis of dependency. Although her family and domestic circumstances will be taken into account in the context of her application they will be evaluated by reference to the fact that the applicant is no longer a minor.</p>

          <p eId="para_10126">I am informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the day to day allocation of resources, including personnel, that the east Meath area is policed by the Louth-Meath Garda division. The personnel strength, all ranks, of the Louth-Meath division as at 24 September 2003 was 536.

          <p eId="para_10131">I am informed by the Garda authorities that on 21 September 2002, the person in question was notified of a protection order under section 17 of the Domestic Violence Act 1996. Two gardaí were present at the time of the notification. The order had been issued at Dublin District Court on 18 September 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_10132">I am further informed that, at 10.15 p.m. on the same date, two gardaí responded to a complaint against the person alleging that she had breached the protection order. The person was arrested for the alleged breach and was subsequently charged and bailed to appear at Kilmainham District Court on 17 October 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_10133">On the following day, at 8 a.m., two gardaí responded to a separate complaint against the person alleging that she had breached the protection order. The person was arrested for the alleged breach and was subsequently charged at Celbridge Garda station and bailed to appear at Kilmainham District Court on 27 September 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_10134">Both cases were subsequently listed for hearing at Kilmainham District Court on 29 January 2003. On that date the complainant attended court and the charges were withdrawn as he refused to give evidence. Both parties were legally represented.</p>
          <p eId="para_10135">The gardaí have attended the home in question on a number of occasions. On each occasion on which the person was arrested her sister was present in the home and accompanied her to the Garda station, while the complainant remained in the home to take care of their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_10136">Execution of a protection order under section 17 of the Act does not require corroboration. Before execution of a protection order, the gardaí must be satisfied that the respondent has been made aware of the order and its contents. In this case, the respondent was notified of its existence on 21 September 2002, in the presence of two gardaí. The document in this case is a court order to arrest and bring before the court the person alleged to have been in breach of the order. The gardaí in both instances acted on the court order, which they are obliged by law to do.</p>

          <p eId="para_10141">I am informed that the Deputy is referring to the telephone helplines in the immigration and citizenship division of my Department in Burgh Quay, Dublin 2. This division operates four separate dedicated helpline services to facilitate members of the public with queries which are specific to the work of that area. The four helplines in question provide assistance in relation to visas, citizenship, general immigration and applications for residency based on parentage of an Irish born child.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_1220">The Deputy will appreciate that the huge increase in the number of non-nationals who are present in the State in recent times is, of course, reflected in the demand for the services of the immigration and citizenship division. For example, the number of non-EEA nationals registered with the Garda Siochána in 2002 was in excess of 97,000. This compares with a figure of 47,262 in 2000, an increase of more than 100% in two years. In addition, the division has to provide certain services for persons who wish to tra vel to the State – 38,000 visa applications in 2002 – as well as asylum seekers and other classes of immigrants within the State. Given the unprecedented demand for the services of this division and in the interests of better customer service and more efficient use of staff resources, a decision was made to try to minimise time spent on phone calls and maximise the time available for decision making.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1221">The helplines and their respective hours of operation are as follows: general immigration queries are dealt with daily from 9.30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. Visa queries are dealt with on Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 10 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. Citizenship queries are dealt with on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 10 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. Following the Government decision on outstanding claims for residency on the basis of parentage of an Irish born child a separate helpline was set up in July 2003 to deal with queries regarding these applications which operates daily from 10 a.m. to 12.30 p.m.</summary>

The commissioner has projected, based on the anticipated rate of retirement, that this level of recruitment will result in the maximum authorised strength of 12,200 being achieved during 2004. These extra gardaí will be assigned to the areas of greatest need.

The Navan patrol car patrols the district on a 24-hour basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_10200">The extension of the current opening hours at Ardee Garda station to 24 hours would necessitate the employment of Garda personnel on indoor administrative duties. In this regard, Garda authorities inform me that such personnel can be utilised more effectively in providing a visible Garda presence on outdoor policing duties. Resources are augmented from within the district or division as required. Personnel allocated to Collon Garda station regularly assist with the policing of the Ardee area. The district detective unit and divisional traffic unit also patrol the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_10201">Garda management will continue to appraise the policing and administrative strategy employed at Ardee with a view to ensuring that an effective Garda service is maintained. The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available, the needs of the Ardee area will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.</p>

With regard to Garda resources, the Deputy may be aware that a new Garda recruitment competition is under way. It is planned that 690 Garda trainees will be taken into the Garda college during 2003. The Commissioner has projected, based on the anticipated rate of retirement, that this level of recruitment will result in the current maximum authorised strength of 12,200 being achieved during 2004. I have already stated that as soon as budgetary circumstances permit, the Government will work towards the target strength of 14,000 provided in the programme for Government for achievement by 2007.</p>

I am committed to supporting the Garda Síochána in every way I can in tackling crime, not only through increasing Garda numbers, but through facilitating and promoting change and reform, both within the force and in the criminal justice system in general, aimed at meeting the challenges of present day crime. I have received Government approval to bring forward a criminal justice Bill which will assist the Garda in the fight against crime. I expect the Bill to be published during the spring session of 2004. The purpose of the Bill is to amend criminal law and procedure in light of the recommendations of the expert group on criminal law.</p>

I also intend to press ahead, as quickly as circumstances permit, with the civilianisation, on a phased basis, of up to 496 technical and administrative posts occupied by gardaí to allow for the release of Garda members to operational policing.</summary>

All members of the Garda Síochána employed on immigration duty are well aware of their legal obligation to receive such applications. With regard to the immigration unit at Dublin Airport it should be pointed out that between 1 January 2000 and 26 September 2003, a total of 5,571 persons applied for asylum at Dublin Airport and their applications were dealt with in accordance with the law by members of the Garda Síochána attached to the Garda national immigration bureau at Dublin Airport.</p>

          <p eId="para_10410">There is no two-tier system of Irish citizenship. While an Irish citizen child has certain rights to remain in Ireland, these are not absolute. In cases where the non-national parents of an Irish born child are found not to have an entitlement to remain in the State the law recognises their responsibility in certain cases to bring their child out of the State with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_10411">I am fully aware of the obligations imposed on the State under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and I consider the Government's policy to be compatible with these obligations, including Articles 2, 7 and 9. In respect of Article 2, the question of breaching the prohibition on discrimination does not arise. Article 7 is fully complied with as the children concerned have been registered, have the entitlement to Irish citizenship and are not prevented from knowing and being cared for by their parents. Contravention of Article 9 is not an issue as the State is not forcing a child to be separated from its parents against their will. I am satisfied that adherence to the convention does not entail, as a condition precedent, that parents of Irish-born children should derive an automatic right to reside in the State by virtue of that fact alone. The absence of such automatic rights of residence are a feature of the immigration regimes of virtually all of the countries that have ratified the convention to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_10412">In considering claims for leave to remain in the State from the non-national parents of Irish-born children, the circumstances in each case will be examined and each case will be decided individually. The welfare of the Irish citizen will be a consideration in every case.</p>

My Department also recoups to local authorities two thirds of their expenditure on the payment of grants; this has increased from a recoupment level of 50% in 1997. It is the responsibility of the authorities to fund the remaining one-third from their own resources from amounts provided for that purpose in their annual estimates of expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_10448">Expenditure on the scheme increased from €13 million for 2,455 grants in 1998 to €52.6 million for 5,932 grants in 2002.

          <p eId="para_10461">In examining population trends in wild bird populations, priority has been given in the past to rare, localised and threatened species.

          <p eId="para_10462">There is insufficient data at present to establish whether the house sparrow has declined in Ireland. In time the countryside bird survey project will identify such trends on a national scale but it will require further research to identify causes of any declines in particular species. Many species even in quite pristine environments experience cyclical variations in their populations extending over several years.</p>
          <p eId="para_10463">Any perception that house sparrows may have declined in some localities here could be misleading in the absence of firm data.

The Dúchas brand name was adopted on a non-statutory basis, and the division was not conferred with agency or other powers beyond those vested in the Minister.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_1239">The former Dúchas division was transferred to my Department in July 2002. I immediately instigated a comprehensive review of heritage functions at central government level so as to ensure the optimum alignment and integration of these functions within their new departmental setting. Following completion of this review, which involved wide consideration with interested parties, the Government approved in April 2003 a new set of arrangements for the discharge by the State of its heritage functions. Under these new arrangements the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government retains responsibility for policy and operational matters relating to our natural heritage. The Minister also retains responsibility for built heritage policy – including architecture and archaeology – while operational and management functions involving the built heritage are being transferred to the Office  of Public Works. Rather than utilising the separate Dúchas brand, which has been in place for several years, my Department was instead re-titled the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The role of the Heritage Council, particularlyvis-à-vis the policy role of the Department, is to be redefined and there is to be a progressive expansion of the remit of local authorities regarding heritage matters.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1240">These changes are designed to achieve the optimum use of the organisational resources available to the Government. They build on my Department's strengths in terms of experience of regulation and policy development, particularly in the environmental area, and the strong tradition of the Office of Public Works in the areas of conservation and property management.

In the course of carrying out the exhumations it was discovered that there were remains interred in the burial ground that were not covered by the exhumation licence granted on 25 May and for which there appeared to be no records to assist with identification.</p>
          <p eId="para_10473">A further exhumation licence covering these unidentified remains was granted on 31 August 1993. The information provided at the time by the applicants was to the effect that the additional remains were those of former residents of the convent who would have been placed with the Sisters of Charity for various reasons and who would have remained in residential care until their deaths. The investigation of whether any of the deaths of those exhumed were unregistered is a matter for the Garda authorities who have in the course of their inquiries examined the Department's file in the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_10484">The approach in environmental law is to ensure that the disposal, by combustion or otherwise, of waste materials is managed in such a manner as to minimise or eliminate any negative effects on health and on the environment locally, regionally and globally. The Waste Management Act 1996 places a general duty on the holder of waste not to hold, transport, recover or dispose of waste in a manner that causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution. Local authorities have specific powers under the Act to require measures to be taken to prevent or limit environmental pollution caused by the holding or disposal of waste, and mitigate or remedy the effects on the environment of any such activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_10485">Under the Air Pollution Act 1987, the occupier of any premises other than a private dwelling is required to use the best practicable means to limit and, if possible, to prevent an emission of a pollutant to the atmosphere from such premises. In addition, the occupier of any premises is prohibited from causing or permitting an emission in such a quantity or manner as to be a nuisance. Local authorities have powers under the Act to serve a notice on the occupier of any premises from which there is an emission specifying the measures necessary to prevent or limit air pollution. The issue of preventing wood worm and other wood attacking insects in dead and old timber from causing damage to houses in the vicinity of woodlands may be one of best practice in forestry management, and this would be a matter to be addressed by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources or one of the agencies under his aegis.</p>

The cost of the former gratuity is about €0.6 million and of the latter about €1 million if all councillors who were also Members of the Oireachtas were to retire within the period mentioned. Assuming they are replaced by new councillors, a further amount of up to €1.6 million in a full year could arise in respect of representational payments to these new councillors. However, the actual costs involved are likely to be somewhat  less as they are dependent on the number of Oireachtas councillors who choose to resign before the next local elections, the dates of resignation chosen by such individuals and the requirement for a minimum period of three years qualifying service for a gratuity.</p>

Nonetheless, I am aware of the importance of accessibility issues and a number of improvements have been made to the voting machine to improve its user friendliness since its first use in 2002. The new features include an increase in the size and legibility of candidate's details; the use of larger preference numbers and brighter displays for better visibility and the use of a redesigned "Cast Vote" vote button, following consultations with the National Disability Authority, NDA, and National Council for the Blind in Ireland. The possibility of developing a facility to allow visually impaired persons use the voting machine independently is also being examined. Finally, my Department is procuring customised tables for the voting machines with a tilt facility for easier access for people with a physical disability and, in particular, for persons using wheelchairs.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_1246">Electoral law provides for a number of measures in relation to accessibility to polling  buildings. The Electoral (Amendment) Act 1996 provides that local authorities, in making polling schemes, shall endeavour to appoint polling places where at least one polling station is accessible to wheelchair users. The Act also requires that the returning officer shall, where practicable, provide polling stations which are accessible to wheelchair users. The returning officer must, in addition, where practicable, give public notice of all polling stations which are inaccessible to wheelchair users not later than eight days before polling day. If an elector has difficulty gaining access to their polling station, the person may apply in writing for authorisation to vote at another polling station in the same constituency.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1247">Once in the polling station, persons with a physical disability or with a literacy difficulty may avail of companion voting or may seek the assistance of the presiding officer. Alternatively, if a person has a physical disability or illness which prevents them from going to the polling station, they can vote by post if they apply to be included in the postal voters' list which is drawn up each year as part of the register of electors.</summary>

      if the regulations for eligibility for shared ownership require that a person (details supplied) in Dublin 14, declared eligible in one year on income grounds and in the following year when housing becomes available for purchase under a council lottery scheme, should be declared ineligible and lose the opportunity to access the limited housing available, on the basis of being temporarily over the income limit as a result of a once off lump sum union negotiated payment.

Implementation and management of the shared ownership scheme, including determination of eligibility, is a matter for each housing authority.</p>

          <p eId="para_10550">Under sections 11 and 12 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, any member of the public may, in writing, make a submission or observation in relation to  the review of the development plan. Over the course of the review of the development plan, there are normally three opportunities for members of the public to comment on the contents of the draft plan: before a new plan is drafted; following publication of a draft plan and, if the elected members have agreed to include a material alteration to the draft plan on foot of earlier submissions made on the draft plan, when the draft plan is redisplayed. The manager must then report to the members of the authority on the submissions or observations made. In the report, he or she must list the persons or bodies who made submissions or observations, summarise the issues raised by those persons or bodies and give his or her response to the issues raised. These requirements ensure that the process of public consultation engaged in by the local authority when reviewing the development plan is properly transparent and open and there are no proposals to amend them.</p>

          <p eId="para_10552">Under Part II of the Waste Management Act 1996, each local authority is required to make a waste management plan in respect of its functional area. These plans are required, <i>inter alia</i>, to address the prevention or minimisation of the production or harmful nature of waste, and to ensure that such waste as cannot be prevented or recovered is disposed of without causing environmental pollution. The definition of “environmental pollution” in this context covers the holding, transport, recovery or disposal of waste in a manner which would, to a significant extent, endanger human health or harm the environment. Given this explicit connection with human health considerations, it is not proposed to amend the legislation in the manner suggested.</p>

It is understood that the county council has engaged consultants to prepare plans and costings and work is at an advanced stage. It is expected that proposals will be submitted to my Department for consideration shortly.</p>

          <p eId="para_10625">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1300 and 1301 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_10626">The administration of the disabled persons and essential repairs grant schemes, including the processing of individual applications, is a matter for individual local authorities. The framework for the operation of the schemes is laid down in statutory regulations and, as far as practicable, is designed to give an appropriate degree of flexibility to local authorities. Local authorities were notified of their allocations for the payment of disabled persons and essential repairs grants on 5 June 2003. It is a matter for each local authority to decide on the level of funding to be provided for the disabled persons grant scheme in their areas from within the combined allocation provided. The allocation to Kildare County Council was €1.642 million. It is the responsibility of the authorities to fund the remaining one third from their own resources from amounts provided for that purpose in their annual estimates of expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_10627">Kildare County Council received a capital allocation of €1,642,000 for payment of disabled persons and essential repairs grants in 2003, which represents a significant increase over previous years. In 2001 and 2002, local authorities received combined capital allocations which included house purchase and improvement loans, disabled persons and essential repairs grants. The amounts allocated to Kildare County Council for these purposes were €1,269,738 in 2001 and €1 million in 2002. Authorities were requested to contact my Department if their allocation was either inadequate or surplus to their requirements to facilitate the re-allocation of funds and to obtain optimum effectiveness from the funding available. Applications for additional funding, including one from Kildare County Council, are now being considered in this context and a decision will issue as soon as possible to the authorities concerned.</p>

          <p eId="para_10704">EU Directive 2002/49/EC relating to the assessment and management of environmental noise defines a common approach to avoid, prevent or reduce on a prioritised basis the harmful effects, including annoyance, due to exposure to environmental noise. However, the directive does not apply to noise from, <i>inter alia,</i> domestic activities and noise created by neighbours but rather to noise from industrial activity and road, rail and air traffic. Under section 107 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 local authorities or the Environmental Protection Agency are empowered to require measures to be taken to prevent or limit noise. Under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 (Noise) Regulations 1994 any person may seek an order in the District Court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated. The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation. A public information leaflet outlining the legal avenues available to persons experiencing noise nuisance is available from my Department. There is no proposal to extend the existing controls on domestic noise at this time.</p>

          <p eId="para_10732">Part 17 of the Local Government Act 2001 sets out, <i>inter alia</i>, the procedures for the establishment of a town council in a town with a population of 7,500 or more. Under these provisions a proposal to establish a town council is, in the first instance, a matter for the local community. A decision on whether to proceed further with such a proposal is a matter for the elected members of the relevant county council, following a public consultation process. Accordingly, the Act allows such town elections to proceed as necessary, independently of the local elections cycle. I envisage that the relevant provisions of the Act will be commenced in the coming months.</p>

          <p eId="para_10814">My Department has overall responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008. It contains 100 actions, under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research, to be implemented by a range of Departments and agencies.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_1265">Six monthly progress reports on it are provided to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion. I will present the most recent of report at the next meeting of the Cabinet committee tomorrow. It is intended to submit a further progress report to the committee early next year. Significant progress is being made in implementing the 100 actions contained in the strategy. The Deputy should note the following: the number of methadone treatment places has increased significantly since the launch of the strategy. The number of places at the end of June, the latest date for which confirmed figures are available, was 6,704 exceeding the target of 6,500 set in the strategy. The equivalent figure at the end of 2000 was 5,032; most of the regional drugs task forces are up and running and meeting regularly. At present they are working on mapping out the patterns of  drug misuse in the area as well as identifying services already available in the area with a view to co-ordinating these existing services and addressing gaps in service provision; on 15 May the Department of Health and Children launched the first phase of a national awareness campaign. It featured television and radio advertising supported by an information brochure and website. All these are designed to promote greater awareness and communication about the drugs issue in Ireland. The first phase targeted the general population whereas subsequent phases will focus on specific groups such as parents and young people. The second phase is due to be rolled out mid-October and will be specifically targeted at parents; Revenue has launched a coastal watch programme and has implemented a number of measures to enhance drugs detection capability at points of entry; guidelines to assist schools in the development of a drugs policy have also been developed and were issued to all primary and post-primary schools in May 2002; the Department of Education and Science is now represented on all local drugs task forces and have recruited extra support staff to enable the delivery of substance misuse prevention programmes in all schools from the start of this academic year; and over 1,120 recovering drug misusers are now on special FÁS community employment.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1266">My Department also has responsibility for the work of 14 LDTFs. They were established in 1997 in the areas experiencing the worst levels of drug misuse.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1267">The Government has allocated or spent over €65 million to implement approximately 500 projects contained in both sets of plans of the task forces since 1997. In addition, over €11.6 million has been allocated to capital projects under the premises initiative, which is designed to meet the accommodation needs of community based drugs projects.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1268">Over €59 million has been allocated to support approximately 350 facility and services projects in LDTF areas and the four other urban centres under the young peoples facilities and services fund. The main aim of the fund is to attract at risk young people in disadvantaged areas into recreational facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse.</summary>

          <p eId="para_10836">The main objective of the scheme is to make up the difference between a person's means and needs.

          <p eId="para_10837">In the case of a homeless person who is supplied with emergency accommodation by the board the amount of basic allowance payable will be the full rate of basic SWA €124.80. If additional services are supplied, e.g. breakfast or meals, the amount of allowance payable will be reduced to take account of the level of additional service supplied in each case. The payment of €60 mentioned by the Deputy in relation to homeless people is not a standard rate. The net amount paid varies according to circumstances.</p>

The difference between these amounts and full rate SWA is the value ascribed to the facilities provided under the direct provision system.

          <p eId="para_10854">My Department is constantly seeking new ways of improving access to information on social welfare schemes and services for those with special needs, including deaf and hard of hearing citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_10855">Last April my Department published the information services strategy 2003-2006. It contains a commitment to meeting the information needs of all our customers including those with special needs.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_1281">My Department has already implemented a number of the recommendations referred to by the Deputy. They include: arrangements have been put in place to evaluate all our forms and leaflets and ensure that they meet the information requirements of all our customers, including those with special needs; the customer service training programme which was delivered to over 2,600 departmental staff included a module with specific material on deaf awareness; we also sup port and facilitate staff who wish to pursue sign language training and to date a number of staff have availed of it; and we have introduced a video technology initiative to help people with hearing difficulties access our services. This facility is based in the social welfare local office in Cork and operates in co-operation with the Cork Association for the Deaf and the National Association for the Deaf; my Department's website, which is fully compliant with international disability standards, has a link to the National Association for Deaf People (Ireland) and we also have an e-mail address,info@welfare.ie, for social welfare inquiries; the installation of counter loop systems is included as part of the planned upgrade of all of our local offices. Four offices, have so far been upgraded with the counter loop system; and a working group on customer service communications set up by the Department in August 2002 has made a number of recommendations aimed at improving access for people with hearing difficulties.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1282">To mark the European Year of People with Disabilities I approved funding towards the cost of a delegation of deaf people and two interpreters attending the World Deaf Conference in Canada this year. This conference covered presentations on literacy, education, human rights, language, culture and health. In addition, I have recently provided a grant of €40,000 to the Irish Deaf Society for research into poverty in the deaf community and I await the research findings with interest.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1283">Comhairle, which operates under the aegis of my Department, is committed to the delivery of fully accessible information, advice and advocacy services for all citizens. It continues to ensure that its information products and services are disability, poverty and equality proofed. Publications are currently available in a variety of formats and the production of information videos in Irish sign language is being pursued. Comhairle offices and the network of citizens information centres around the country have portable loop systems installed.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1284">I am satisfied that considerable progress has been made towards meeting the needs of deaf and hard of hearing citizens and every effort will continue to be made to put the recommendations for deaf access referred to into effect, where practicable.</summary>

          <p eId="para_10857">For claims to deserted wife's benefit made on or after 31 August 1992, the earnings limit for entitlement is currently set at £10,000 or €12,697.38 a year gross earnings. Where earnings  are in excess of this sum there may be an entitlement to a reduced rate of payment of the benefit, provided earnings do not exceed €17,776.33 a year gross.</p>
          <p eId="para_10858">The scheme was closed to new applicants in January 1997 on the introduction of the one parent family payment scheme. This means that deserted wives who have dependent children are treated in the same manner as all other lone parents with children. Lone parents are now encouraged to maximise their income from different sources. The means test for the current scheme provides for the exemption of earnings and maintenance payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_10859">With regard to employment, lone parents may earn up to €146.50 per week without affecting their payment. Earnings above this limit are assessed at 50%, up to a maximum of €293 per week. There are also transitional arrangements in place whereby a lone parent who exceeds the earnings threshold may retain 50% of his or her payment for a further 12 months. Lone parents are also eligible to avail of the full range of employment support schemes operated by my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_10860">There are no plans to change the earnings limits for persons still in receipt of deserted wives benefit.</p>

          <p eId="para_10866">The back to school clothing and footwear allowance provides assistance towards the cost of school clothing and footwear for children  attending primary and post-primary schools. The health boards administer the scheme on behalf of my Department. Neither I nor my Department has any function in deciding cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_10867">A person may qualify for payment of this allowance in the following ways: if he or she is in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment; is participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course; and where a child dependent allowance is being paid in respect of the child and the person has household income at or below a specified maximum level.</p>
          <p eId="para_10868">Under the scheme allowances of €80 are payable in respect of qualified children aged from two to 11 years and allowances of €150 are payable in respect of qualified children from 12 to 22 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_10869">The community employment scheme is an approved employment scheme for the purposes of the back to school clothing and footwear allowance. Accordingly, participants must have the same entitlement to the allowance as those participating in other schemes, subject to the same weekly income limit.</p>
          <p eId="para_10870">A lone parent on a community employment scheme may qualify under the standard means test that applies to all lone parents. Alternatively, a lone parent may qualify under the special arrangements for retention of secondary benefits which are available to lone parents and other participants in employment schemes, including community employment. These special arrangements are subject to a weekly income limit of €317.43 which applies equally to lone parents and all other participants in community employment and other employment schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_10871">Lone parents who do not qualify to retain the back to school clothing and footwear allowance on means grounds have incomes over the limit of €317.43 per week. This income limit is necessary to ensure that the available funds are targeted on those with the lowest incomes. Any changes to the current arrangements would have to be considered in a budgetary context.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_1288">Rent supplements are payable under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered by the health boards on behalf of my Department. The purpose of a rent supplement is to provide assistance towards the reasonable accommodation costs of eligible people living in private rented accommodation  who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1289">Under standard assessment rules rent supplements are calculated to ensure that eligible people, after the payment of rent, have an income equal to the rate of SWA appropriate to their family circumstances, less a minimum contribution of €12 which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. Up to €50 in respect of additional income from part-time employment or approved training courses is now disregarded in the means test thus ensuring that a person is better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1290">Supplementary welfare allowance is not normally payable to people who are engaged in full-time employment. Arrangements have been in place for a number of years which allow people to retain a portion of their rent supplement where they take up employment through approved schemes, subject to a weekly income limit of €317.43.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1291">Back to work allowance and family income supplement, in cases where one or both of these are in payment, are disregarded in the assessment of the €317.43 weekly income limit. PRSI and reasonable travelling expenses are also disregarded in the means test.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1292">Any changes in the qualification criteria for receipt of rent supplement would have to be considered in a budgetary context. In that regard, a rent supplement is a short-term income maintenance support and is not intended to address a person's long-term accommodation needs. Measures to improve the supply and affordability of social and affordable housing provide the best means of protecting and enhancing the housing position of people on low to middle incomes.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1293">In the case identified by the Deputy the South-Western Area Health Board was informed about the case identified by the Deputy. The board advised that the case has been reassessed and it has determined that a rent supplement may be paid.</summary>

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_1295">This matter concerns a husband and wife and  their entitlements to unemployment assistance and disability benefit, respectively. The wife was a dependant on her spouse's unemployment assistance claim when she submitted a claim to disability benefit in her own right. The disability benefit claim was received in my Department on 18 July 2003.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1296">She qualified for disability benefit at the maximum personal rate of €124.80 from 16 July 2003. As a direct consequence, her husband became entitled to a reduced rate of unemployment assistance from that date. Before payment of disability benefit could be made, it was necessary to establish if the person concerned wished to receive payment of disability benefit in her own right or remain as a dependant on her spouse's unemployment assistance claim.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1297">The person advised my Department on two occasions that her preferred option was to receive payment of disability benefit in her own right: there was a delay in processing this information. This delay is regretted. Payment of arrears was made on the 12 September and further payments will issue on receipt of medical evidence of incapacity.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1298">The entitlement of the husband to unemployment assistance was reviewed recently. As a result of this review a deciding officer assessed his weekly means at €12, from 12 July 2003, based on the letting value of his land. His entitlement to unemployment assistance is subject to the limitation on the overall amount payable where both of a couple has separate entitlements. The maximum weekly amount payable to the household in this case is €207.60. Accordingly, the maximum unemployment assistance payable to the husband is €82.80, that is, the difference between the maximum of €207.60 and the €124.80 already in payment to the wife.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1299">The fact that the means assessed against him were reduced to €12.00 in the recent review of his case does not impact on this payment, as he is already awarded the maximum amount payable to a person whose spouse is in receipt of the full rate of disability benefit. However, in the course of reviewing his entitlements, it has come to light that an underpayment of unemployment assistance occurred between April 1999 and July 2003. This is now being rectified and arrears or €2,224.54 which are due will issue shortly.</summary>

The effect of this increase is that a couple with two children, earning a joint income  of up to €24,150 can qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance. The same couple, if they had an income of €39,750, could still qualify for partial carer's allowance, the free schemes and the respite care grant.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1303">It is estimated that abolition of the means test could cost in the region of €150 million per annum. In view of the many supports required by carers, particularly community care and respite care, it is considered that abolition of the means test would not necessarily constitute the best use of the resources available for the support of carers. However, there is a commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government to expand the income limits for the carer's allowance so that all those on average industrial incomes can qualify. Progress towards this will continue to be considered in the budgetary context.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1304">With regard to the issue of providing support to the Irish Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus, my Department provides grants for the dissemination of information on social welfare entitlements and other social services. It is open to the Irish Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus or any other non-statutory agency to apply for such a grant under these criteria.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1305">In relation to future developments in the care area, I recently launched a comprehensive study on the future financing of long-term care, carried out by Mercer Human Resource Consultants on behalf of my Department. In order to make progress in the area of policy on long-term care, I now propose to embark on a consultation process on the financing of long-term care. This process will commence shortly and will take place over about a three month period.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1306">It is envisaged that the feedback from the consultation process will be the starting point for meeting the commitment in the partnership document Sustaining Progress to, "Establish a Working Group to examine the strategic policy, cost and service delivery issues associated with the care of older people". I would hope that this working group could be established early in 2004.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1307">Meanwhile, improvements in the carer's allowance scheme will be kept under review in a budgetary context. The development of the range of supports for carers will continue to be a priority for this Government and, building on the foundations now in place, we will continue to develop the types of services which recognise the value of the caring ethos and which provide real support and practical assistance to people who devote their time to improving the quality of life for others.</summary>

          <p eId="para_10955">A bilateral agreement on social security between Ireland and the United States of America has been in effect since 1 September 1993.</p>
          <p eId="para_10956">The main purpose of this agreement is to protect the social security pension rights of workers who have worked in Ireland and who have also worked or resided in the United States. There are currently 631 people in the USA, and 206 people in Ireland, who receive benefits under the provisions of the agreement. In addition, there are 178 people in receipt of pensions in the USA under the EU regulations or other bilateral agreements. The total number of claims awarded per pension category are given thereunder – appendix 1.</p>
          <p eId="para_10957">It is not possible to establish how many US citizens living in Ireland are in receipt of benefits apart from the bilateral agreement, as statistics are not kept with regard to the nationality of beneficiaries. I am satisfied that the overall operation of the agreement gives full effect to its purpose, and that the operational relationship between the US authorities and my Department works very well. Any occasional difficulties or delays in the implementation of the bilateral agreement are dealt with on a case-by-case basis, and periodic reviews of its operation ensure that these are kept to a minimum.</p>

          <p eId="para_10998">Rent supplements are payable under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered by the health boards on behalf of my Department. The purpose of a rent supplement is to provide assistance towards the reasonable accommodation costs of eligible people living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source. A rent supplement is an income maintenance support and is not intended to address a person's long-term accommodation needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_10999">In determining entitlement to rent supplement a health board must be satisfied that the applicant has a genuine accommodation need and that the property being rented is suitable to those needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_11000">It would not, in normal circumstances, be deemed appropriate for a person who ordinarily resides on their own to receive rent supplement in respect of a two or three bedroom house.</p>
          <p eId="para_11001">Changes in household composition can affect the supplement in payment. If the size of the household increases there may be a need for larger accommodation which in turn may lead to an increase in the amount of supplement payable. On the other hand, if the household numbers decrease the suitability of the accommodation may need to be reviewed. This could arise, for example, if grown up children move away from the family home to attend university elsewhere and leave just one adult remaining in a two or three bedroom house. In such a case the remaining tenant would not necessarily have to move to accommodation suitable for single occupancy but would be offered the alternative of seeking additional tenants for the accommodation to spread the rent liability and enable him/her to remain on in his/her existing accommodation. However, if the person is unwilling or unable to make such an arrangement it may well be that he/she would be requested to secure more appropriate accommodation in order to retain entitlement to rent supplement.</p>

          <p eId="para_11007">The back to work allowance scheme was reviewed last year in the light of economic and labour market changes and, in particular, of the drop in unemployment levels since the introduction of the allowance in 1993.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_1317">This review also took cognisance of the decline in take-up of the scheme and of an evaluation of the scheme by independent consultants who recommended restructuring of the scheme in the light of the transformed labour market situation, and the opportunities for people to get back into the labour market without the assistance of the scheme. The evaluation report recommended that the scheme be refocused on the longer-term unemployed, that the non-financial supports be  enhanced, and that the overall numbers on the scheme be reduced.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1318">Following on this review, the qualifying period for persons on unemployment benefit/assistance has been increased to five years with effect from 1 January 2003. Other social welfare qualifying payments are not affected by the change.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1319">PLANET – the network of area-based partnerships – recently submitted proposals with a view to lowering the current qualifying period for the self-employed strand of the back to work allowance scheme. I have had a detailed examination carried out by my officials in relation to the case studies submitted but it does not appear that the arguments warrant a change in the current arrangements. I will continue to monitor the scheme in light of the changes in place since January to ensure that it is operating effectively and that it is reaching those who need help the most.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_1320">A review of the national employment service is currently taking place. In addition, an inter-agency group has been conducting a review of all labour market programmes under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I believe it would be appropriate to await the outcome of these deliberations before any further adjustments to the scheme might be considered.</summary>

          <p eId="para_11009">The reply to the parliamentary question to which the Deputy refers outlines the means testing arrangements which apply where a landholder leases land or is otherwise in possession of land which is lying fallow or idle.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_1321">Income from the leasing of land is assessable as means for old age pension purposes, whether in practice the land is leased or is allowed to lie idle. There are no plans to introduce an additional allowance in the means test to encourage leasing. Any such change would have budget ary implications and would have to be considered in the context of other expenditure priorities.</summary>

          <p eId="para_11011">The Civil Registration Bill 2003, which was published on 17 July last, provides for re-organisation and modernisation of the system of registration of births, stillbirths, adoptions, marriages and deaths. The Bill further provides for the extension of the civil registration system to decrees of divorce and decrees of nullity of marriage granted by the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_11012">The system operating at present was established 150 years ago, and the registration procedures have remained largely unchanged, despite significant demographic changes and technological developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_11013">The main objectives of the Civil Registration Bill 2003 include: rationalisation of the procedures for registration of life events; assignment of responsibility for policy and standards of service to an tArd-Chláraitheoir; devolution of responsibility for management, control and administration of the Civil Registration Service at local level to health boards; and establishment of new registers of divorce and nullity of marriage.</p>
          <p eId="para_11014">Part 6 of the Bill provides for a number of reforms to the existing procedures for the notification and registration of marriages. Additional legislative proposals, including those relating to marriage venues, are being worked on at present, informed by recommendations contained in a series of discussion papers, published by the inter-departmental committee on the reform of marriage law and subsequent responses to these.</p>
          <p eId="para_11015">I hope shortly to be in a position to indicate when proposals will be brought forward in this regard.</p>
