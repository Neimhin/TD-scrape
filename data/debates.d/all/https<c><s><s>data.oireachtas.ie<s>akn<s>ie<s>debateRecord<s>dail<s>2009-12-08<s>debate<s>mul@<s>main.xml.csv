#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.The code of conduct for officeholders was drawn up by the Government pursuant to section 10(2) of the Standards in Public Office Act 2001, following consultation with the Standards in Public Office Commission, and was published in July 2003.Deputies will be aware that the Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill 2007 provides for changes to the ethics framework.  A review of the code will be carried out, in consultation with the Standards in Public Office Commission, after that Bill has been enacted.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1	The recent revelations about expenses incurred by Ministers have shocked and outraged the country.  I do not think any Minister set out deliberately to do something like this, or at least I hope not.Within the understanding of their responsibilities as Ministers, and the requirements of the Ethics in Public Office Act, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government spent €6,500 printing leaflets for delivery in his constituency, which cost a further €4,500.  There are in-house printing facilities here and party membership delivers the leaflets.  The Minister for Defence incurred a charge of €46,000 a couple of years ago delivering Fianna Fáil leaflets in his constituency, which the taxpayer paid for.  This is just not on, as the Taoiseach knows.In view of this continuing litany of expenses and charges, with €9,000 incurred by the Tánaiste to keep a limousine waiting at a hotel 1.5 km from a meeting in Switzerland, has the Taoiseach introduced changes that clearly require Ministers know in advance that these charges will be incurred so the taxpayer will not be continually outraged by the collation of such charges?  Has he introduced a minimum standard for officeholders when they go abroad above which, if they want to stay in a higher class facility, they pay the difference?  That way the public would understand that they are there to do their job on behalf of the country.  We must not have a continuous litany of gross excess in terms of the expenses incurred by the taxpayer.In view of the Ethics in Public Office Act, have there been changes on the instruction of the Taoiseach?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	2	The next set of questions deals with that issue.  This question relates to whether there are any changes envisaged in the code of conduct.  That code of conduct does not stand in isolation, it stands as part of a wider ethics framework established by the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995 and the Standards in Public Office Act 2001.  Section 10(7) of the Standards in Public Office Act binds officeholders to have regard to and be guided by the code.  The code cannot impose any new requirements that are not already set out in legislation; it mainly attempts to provide guidance at a level of detail that would be difficult to express in legislation.  I am not aware that any issue raised by Deputy Kenny has been brought to the attention of the Standards in Public Office Commission in any way or is in breach of the code of conduct.In the new economic circumstances in which we find ourselves, all Departments and agencies are required to be mindful of the costs of conducting business in every respect, both at home and abroad.  That is being done and various subsistence and travel allowances have been cut extensively and, rightly so, in present circumstances.  Obviously arrangements have been put in place to deal with that.  The important point to make regarding the code of conduct is that it does not stand in isolation, it is a more detailed code in respect of the statutory provisions laid down by the 1995 and 2001 Acts.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I understand the Department of Finance set out guidelines that apply in the case of Ministers who go abroad.  Are those guidelines published and are they available?  For example, if the Minister for Health and Children attends a conference in Italy, Spain or France, does she know in advance the arrangements made for her?  Obviously Ministers are very conscious of the requirement not to be seen or perceived to be outside normal guidelines.  Are those guidelines published by the Department of Finance?In respect of the Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill 2007, which I raised with the Taoiseach some weeks ago, the change was to increase the value of a gift from €650 to €2,000 for Ministers and persons serving in parliamentary office.  Given the changed circumstances that apply, does the Taoiseach consider a gift costing €2,000 for a Minister attending a function is excessive?  Does he consider it should be reduced to a more realistic level?The Standards in Public Office Commission has been seeking an opportunity to initiate an inquiry where it considers it is of public interest.  When the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance he refused that request.  He made the point, I think, that it could have serious consequences for those who become the subject of an inquiry.  I can understand that.  Persons who know their remit obviously would be vindicated in terms of any inquiry that might arise.  What is his view on it now as Taoiseach?  If a request were received again from the Standards in Public Office Commission to initiate an inquiry if it considered it was in the public interest, would it receive favourable consideration?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	4	These matters are dealt with in another set of questions with which we will deal later.  In any event, to be of assistance I will deal with any questions that arise.  In regard to the third supplementary on the issue of allowing the office to initiate an inquiry, I believe a balance has to be struck between a proper investigation where there is a potential breach of guidelines and the good reputation of Deputies, Senators or Ministers being upheld.  If there is a problem, a complaint should be made.  On foot of a complaint an investigation should take place.  If there is a problem in the public domain that the people feel is of a serious nature, presumably a complaint would be made by an affected or third party.  On that basis it would trigger an investigative mechanism.  I do not believe it is necessarily right that the investigator should be able to instigate an investigation at his or her own volition, with all the impact that would have, and find at the end that there was nothing at the back of it.  All the loss of reputation and distress caused to the person against whom the complaint was made would have been without foundation.  A balance has to be struck.  The legislation sets out that balance and that is where things stand.  Processes should be initiated on foot of complaints not on foot of someone deciding he or she wants to proceed with a process because of something out in the ether or because of something someone heard or said.  One should put it on paper, make a complaint, deal with it properly and let us have fairness all around.On the question of the amounts considered in the Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill, the initial amount of €650 was mentioned 14 years ago.  We are considering changing it for today's values and to set it for 14 years' hence as well.  It is always a question of judgment, of deciding what should be the threshold, taking into account the situation does not remain static and to avoid having to make further amendment two or three years hence.  It would need to be suitable over a longer period of time.  It is a question of a judgment call because it is not an exact science.  This is where the legislation currently stands as it is being considered.Departmental travel policies are based on guidelines from the Department of Finance and these are applicable to all staff.  The guidelines set out the policy regarding appropriate class of air travel, standard of hotels to be used and use of own transport.  The aim of the guidelines is to minimise official travel costs, achieve value for money for expenditure necessarily incurred consistent with the effective discharge of official duties.  This is the basis upon which these matters are dealt with.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	5	In his opening reply the Taoiseach said that codes of conduct for office-holders would be amended after the Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill has been enacted.  If this is the case we will have a long time to wait.  This Bill has been around for a long time.  The Taoiseach will recall this Bill was first announced in October 2006 by the then Tánaiste, Mr. Michael McDowell, when he announced on the steps of Government Buildings that new legislation would be introduced governing payments from private persons and gifts and the size of gifts and loans being made to office-holders.  He told us the Bill would be introduced as a matter of urgency.  The Bill was introduced in the Seanad and it completed its passage in the Seanad in July 2007 but we have seen neither sight nor light of it since then.  On a number of occasions I have asked the Taoiseach as to its whereabouts and when it would be brought into the House.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	6	The Deputy is broadening out his question.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I am not broadening it, I am responding to something that was specifically referred to in the Taoiseach's reply.  He told the House that the changes in the code of conduct would be brought in after the Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill is enacted.  I am pointing out to the Taoiseach that the enactment of the ethics Bill is a long-playing record at this stage.  That Bill was passed in the Seanad in July 2007.  On a number of occasions I have asked in the House for the reason it was not brought before the House and I have not received a satisfactory response.  Perhaps the Taoiseach might take the opportunity today to tell us when it will be brought before the House so that we can see when these changes in the codes of conduct might be likely to be made.In this context is the Taoiseach considering any change in the code of conduct as it might apply to State agencies?  There is a provision in the code of conduct that office-holders should not accept offers to meet the costs of travel or commercial accommodation from private citizens or enterprises.  There is also reference to discretion where the office-holder is the official guest of another government or body but there is no explicit reference to where the Minister might be entertained by a State agency and particularly by a State agency which is under the Minister's own remit.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	8	On the progress towards enactment of the Ethics in Public Office (Amendment) Bill, such inquiries are best directed to the Minister for Finance whose Department has responsibility for this area.  The Bill has completed all Stages in the Seanad.  The taking of the Bill in this House is a matter for the Whips who arrange the business of the House.  The House has been dealing with legislation on finance and other issues and this has taken priority over the Bill.  It is not a question of not proceeding with it but rather a question of the Whips arranging time for when they would like to take it.  It obviously will be the next session at the earliest.  There is no withdrawal of the legislation in that sense and, having completed All Stages in the Seanad, as Deputy Gilmore noted, it can be debated further in this House.  I take the point that the Bill has been on the Order Paper for a long time and we should try to complete it.Regarding further guidelines on ministerial expenses — the issue of hospitality from State agencies, etc. — arising from the February 2009 report of the Committee of Public Accounts on the FÁS organisation, the Department of Finance issued revised foreign travel policy guidelines in 2009.  These guidelines and the related amendments to the code of practice for the governance of State bodies took account of the recommendations on travel policy in the committee's report.  The Minister for Finance wrote to his colleagues, including me, asking that the same principles, as set out in the foreign travel guidelines 2009, be observed by Ministers, Ministers of State and other officeholders when travelling abroad on official business.The Department of Finance also noted the conclusion in the February report by the Committee of Public Accounts that FÁS should not have paid for airline tickets, for example, for civil servants or Ministers.  The general practice has been that expenses relating to representational duties by a Minister or other officeholder on behalf of a State body are paid and accounted for by the body in question.  In light of the committee's conclusions, this matter is under consideration by the Department of Finance and a final decision will be made in the context of a forthcoming second special report by the Comptroller and Auditor General on travel in the FÁS organisation and recommendations from the Committee of Public Accounts following its examination of the report.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I will take up the Taoiseach's invitation to ask the leader of the majority wing of the Government about the location of the ethics Bill.  In respect of the recommendations which arise from the report on FÁS, what are the practical, net implications of the recommendations and what specific changes are being made in the arrangements for travel and other entertainment by Ministers where this is organised by State agencies?  As the Taoiseach will recall, much of the controversy surrounding this area related to travel which was organised by State agencies, including FÁS, Horse Racing Ireland and the Irish Sports Council.  What are the changes being made to travel arrangements?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	10	The Deputy is anticipating the next group of questions which deal with travel.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I do not have before me the foreign travel policy guidelines 2009 which were issued by the Department of Finance.  It would be best to submit a question to the Department to obtain the detail directly.  The Government speaks as one on these issues.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive, together.The 2009 estimate for travel for my Department, including home and foreign travel, is €731,000.  Expenditure from January to the end of November 2009 for me and officials in my private office was €148,482.  In respect of Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, it was €15,014 and in respect of Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche, it was €6,907.  Total expenditure by my Department in the period in question in respect of foreign travel was €324,135.  I anticipate that we will achieve savings in this subhead by year end.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I know the Taoiseach keeps an eye on these matters in respect of other Ministers.  I note that, arising from a request under the Freedom of Information Act by a national newspaper, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, left out €26,000 of his foreign travel expenses.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	14	Questions relating to Departments should be directed to the relevant Department.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I am speaking to the Taoiseach of the country.  As the Ceann Comhairle knows, if a Minister requires a helicopter to fly down to Kerry or Waterford, as the case may be, authorisation normally comes from the Office of the Taoiseach.  In view of all the changed circumstances, I am sure the Taoiseach is cognisant of the need for an effective value-for-money spend.  On numerous occasions I listened to the Minister, Deputy Gormley, and his party colleagues referring to value for money and how expenses should be kept down.  However, I have outlined a case for the Taoiseach in which the said Minister left €26,000 out of expenses incurred by his Department in a freedom of information request.  He spent a further €3,000 of the Taoiseach's money on chauffeuring between terminals at Heathrow Airport and a further €3,600 for a UK trip in a bio-fueled car.  This was on top of €2,500 spent on the use of a VIP airport in the past 18 months.  I do not understand why he makes a big show of travelling over by ferry to Holyhead and then has a chauffeur-driven car to get from London to Holyhead.  Surely, there are car hire firms available in Holyhead if people wish to cut down on effective spend.The same applies in the case of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and a litany of things have been published in this regard as well.  I am sure the Taoiseach has issued instructions to his Ministers in Cabinet, in their interest, to be very careful in respect of doing their duty where the public purse is concerned.  No one wishes to see Ministers going around in rickshaws but there must be a level above which Ministers understand they should not be.  Whether this is done by people in other Departments, the Department of Finance or wherever, the Taoiseach should lay down the law for his Ministers.  I am sure they are more than willing not to have such odium hanging around politics.  Will the Taoiseach explain if he has issued instructions to Ministers and Ministers of State to be cognisant of this matter?  Does he keep an eye on these things from his office in Government Buildings?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	16	Yes.  In the last set of questions I dealt with the fact that there are revised travel guidelines in place for the purpose of ensuring that things are done as one would expect.  Not alone are facilities made available to the Government, but in certain circumstances they are made available to members of the Opposition where it is appropriate as well, and it is only right that this is the case.  I do not know where the matter goes beyond that, only to say that everyone is mindful of the need to maintain public confidence.  Ministers or office holders must go about their work in an appropriate way and be mindful of the expenditure that must be necessarily incurred, consistent with the effective discharge of official duties.As the Deputy will be aware, in many cases transport arrangements in these locations are not made by the Ministers themselves, but by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The Department has also been reminded of the need to recognise the circumstances in which the public purse is funding necessary expenditure in this area and it must be very mindful of all of this.  I do not believe there is any issue between anyone in the House.  This is an area of which we must be very mindful and careful and, at the same time, we must ensure that things are done appropriately and correctly.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I share the general sentiment.  Recently, the world read of a €9,000 charge for a chauffeur-driven limousine to be available to the Tánaiste to travel from a hotel to the conference centre——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	18	That is a matter for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	19	I wish simply to make a point arising from what the Taoiseach has said.  This is in everyone's interest.  I realise the Minister may have had to receive delegations or deputations or had bilateral meetings wherever she was staying.  However, her public servants would have been aware of the nature of the meetings she had to attend.  From that point of view, why was it necessary to have a limousine on hire all day and for half of the following day if it was only required for a few minutes by the Minister?  Surely a conventional taxi would be able to bring any Minister from an hotel to a conference centre.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	20	Deputy Kenny should submit a question to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I say that in the interests of the Taoiseach being able to demonstrate that his Ministers use the public purse effectively and get value.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	22	It must have been a stretch limousine.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	23	Practices existed in the past on how those issues were handled.  The question arises about their appropriateness at any time, but they are not part of the arrangements, given the current circumstances.  It is not the case that Ministers make those arrangements for themselves.  The arrangements are made, the Ministers go about their business and do their job.  The important thing is that it is done in a way that is cost-effective and correct.I note the record of the incumbent in that Department, and any of her predecessors, in terms of her mindfulness of the need to spend taxpayers' money carefully in those areas.  The record will show that she was mindful of that.  I said previously that other arrangements are no longer relevant or necessary and are not appropriate.  Those changes have been made in the revised travel arrangements that are now in place.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	24	The Taoiseach has said on a couple of occasions in reply both to this question and the previous question that new guidelines are now in place.  Will he tell the House what are the guidelines, for example, in respect of overnight accommodation?  Do the guidelines make it plain that the era of the €900 a night room is over and that accommodation has to be arranged on a more modest basis in terms of cost?In view of limousine travel, for example, do our embassies in various countries not have transport facilities attached to them and to ambassadors?  Is it not possible to make arrangements in order that those transport facilities might be used appropriately to ferry around visiting Ministers who are attending appropriate events?  Surely it is possible to obtain appropriate transport at a lot less cost than the €9,000 arrangement we heard about for the limousine that was on stand-by.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	25	Those arrangements were made by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Speaking for my Department, there is a policy based on guidelines laid down by the Department of Finance that is applicable to all staff.  It sets out the policy regarding appropriate class of air travel, standard of hotels to be used and use of own transport.  The aims of that policy are to minimise official travel costs and achieve value for money for expenditure necessarily incurred consistent with the effective discharge of official duties.In regard to the question about procurement arrangements for sourcing hotel accommodation, the central contract with travel booking services for Government officials includes provision for making hotel reservations.  That contract was awarded following a European Union-wide advertisement procurement process conducted under the lead of the Department of Finance earlier this year.Hotel bookings are centrally co-ordinated.  For example, in my Department, the finance unit ensures that the travel policy and Department's guidelines are complied with.  A person has responsibility for making bookings on the basis of a decision by the Department on the options put forward by the company that has the contract on behalf of the State.  Where Department officials book their own hotel accommodation they are required to adhere to the travel policy.  I agree with what was said.  All of those issues are being carefully considered.On the question of transport hire, again, it is the responsibility of the overseas missions of the Department of Foreign Affairs to recommend transport arrangements for visiting official delegations.  More appropriate arrangements are being put in place, rightly so, on the availability of car hire.  All of that is being done.  Sanction by my Department's officials is given if they are satisfied that best value for money is to be achieved.  The control and review mechanisms are in place because we have to learn from those lessons.

I asked a parliamentary question about this and was advised that the number of requests to bring a spouse or a partner had declined in the past number of years.  However, I was not able to get proper information on the number of occasions the Taoiseach or his Department refused permission for a Minister to bring his or her spouse or partner on a foreign trip.On how many occasions has the Taoiseach refused permission for somebody to bring his or her spouse?  What criteria are used to decide whether a Minister may or may not travel with a spouse?  In view of the civil partnership legislation going through the House, does the Taoiseach propose to extend the option for people to bring their spouse or partner to girlfriends, fiancees or civil partners?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	27	There may be an assumption behind the Deputy's questions which suggests that I receive many requests and he asked me how many I refused.

For example, there are occasions when Ministers accompany the President on foreign visits.  That would be an occasion when the spouse of a Minister would be authorised to travel.  It is where representational duties would require it.  It is done far more sparingly than perhaps the Deputy might think.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	33	The Economist intelligence unit undertook an independent benchmarking review to assess the comparative efficiency and effectiveness of Irish economic regulators.  That report was due to be published after six months and was due last September 12 months.  By the end of 2008, the cost of it stood at €408,000.  It was finally published in May 2009.  What was the final cost of the review?  On foot of that report, the Taoiseach established the annual regulatory forum in October.  What are the arrangements for that forum to work?  How will it be monitored and how does the Taoiseach see it producing valuable reports for Government to act on?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	34	The cost of that review of the economic regulatory environment was €108,900.  The forum was one of the recommendations of the report where, on an annual basis, it would interact with the relevant regulators to review how regulation was handled during the course of that year and any issues which arose from it.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	35	The Minister for Foreign Affairs was very anxious that the Pope would answer queries from the Department about the Murphy report on child abuse.  He was not so anxious to respond when almost €1 billion was illegally taken from elderly people in nursing homes.  He said it was not his responsibility.  Over the years there has been a raft of consultancy reports which have never been acted on.Turning to a slightly different question, I notice Deputy Ring has focused on €125,000 being spent on a report to count the number of frogs in the country on the eve of a frightening budget.  Was this matter discussed at Cabinet or did the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government hop it on the Cabinet table and nobody saw it?  How is it proposed that this consultancy report will get into every wetland field in the country to count the number of frogs?  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, has said it will take two years to complete this.

Does the Taoiseach consider the €125,000 cost for the report is justifiable, given that Deputies are inundated with requests for books from schools and children are being asked to bring toilet paper with them in the morning?  Is this the focus of the Green Party in Government?  Is the Minister hopping mad that this has been discovered?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	41	The Deputy asked a question on the economic regulatory environment which comes under my Department.  I explained that the cost was €108,900 and the recommendations of the consultancy report are being looked at and implemented.  The questions relating to the habitats directive and the National Parks and Wildlife Service perhaps should have been contemplated when the Government that brought in the legislation — on the Opposition's watch — made such obligations to deal with various biodiversity issues that arise.  It is important that the origin is put on the record.

Why is the Government paying large sums for reports on the regulatory environment?  What was involved?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	81	An independent review in line with the terms of Towards 2016 of the operation of regulatory impact analysis, RIA, was commissioned to assess the effectiveness of the RIA model across Departments.  The report was published in July 2008 and it is available on the better regulation website.  It indicates overall that good progress has been made in the implementation of RIA across Departments, with 74 produced between 2005 and February 2008.  The report also finds that supports made available to officials conducing RIAs are well regarded.  RIA training has resulted in a significant increase in analytical skill sets across the Civil Service.  These skills help to ensure that all impacts, including unintended ones, are assessed through the RIA process, resulting in better quality legislation.  The Government agreed to implement the recommendations in the report.The guidelines were revised as a result of the recommendations.  Training materials have also been updated to take account of recommendations arising from the review and an updated training course run in conjunction with the Civil Service training and development centre, CSTDC, is available to officials on an ongoing basis.  The better regulation unit has also made a number of other targeted presentations to officials outlining the changes to the RIA system resulting from the review and the unit is also working with the CSTDC to develop an on-line training solution.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	82	Overall clinical activity in our acute hospitals is ahead of target by 3.4% and this pattern is likely to continue until the end of the year.  When inpatient and day cases are combined, acute hospitals have treated 33,000 more patients to date in 2009 than during the same period in 2008.  Outpatient activity is also 3% ahead of target.Hospitals must deliver their services within budget and they are working intensively to ensure that they do so in 2009.  However, the HSE has indicated hospitals will meet the full level of service promised in the service plan for 2009 and, in a number of cases, that they will exceed this target.  Hospitals always scale back elective work towards the end of the year, especially in December.  This reflects the preference of most patients not to be in hospital during the holiday period.  The traditionally quieter time for elective work also gives hospitals an opportunity for refurbishment of wards, deep-cleaning and maintenance, while not disrupting services to patients.  However, emergency and acute services such as the accident and emergency department, critical care, acute surgery, acute medicine, dialysis and obstetrics remain fully operational.My priority is to ensure that all patients receive a quality service without delay.  I am pleased that average waiting times published last week by the National Treatment Purchase Fund show a reduction in the average waiting time to just 2.4 months for all procedures.  This contrasts with a situation where patients had to wait for between two and five years in some specialties a number of years ago.  The number of acute inpatient beds open at any time will depend on varying circumstances, but the HSE has delivered on the service promised in its service plan for 2009 and average waiting times for elective procedures have fallen demonstrably.  Hospitals are managing their budgets and levels of service well in this difficult economic situation.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	83	I hope the Minister is safe from the frog counting exercise, as she seems to have one in her throat.  The question was very straightforward; it asked for details on hospitals cutting back services ahead of Christmas to balance the books and the nature of those services.  The Minister made a statement on the matter, but she did not tell us the services that will be cut or the hospitals affected.The National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, figures of 2.4 months are much massaged.  At present, to get on the NTPF waiting list in Tallaght, one must be waiting for a year, and to get on an orthopaedic waiting list in Tallaght, one must wait two and half years to see an orthopaedic surgeon.  The Minister can massage the figures whatever way she wants but people are not fooled because they know how long they must wait for a service.Yesterday, when I was in Tallaght, I walked through the accident and emergency unit.  Every corridor was full of trolleys.  I know that last week in Beaumont Hospital almost 50 people were waiting on trolleys.  If the Minister does not mind, I would like her to give us a direct answer on what hospitals and services are being affected.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	84	When Deputy Reilly was in Tallaght yesterday, I do not know whether he met the incoming chief executive officer designate, Professor Conlon.  If he did, I am sure Professor Conlon made him aware of his plans, particularly, but not exclusively, with regard to orthopaedics.  Tallaght hospital has 11 orthopaedic surgeons, which is a large number by any standard for any hospital.  The waiting times to see one of them are unacceptably high and I have discussed this matter with Professor Conlon.  I have confidence that he will deal with the issue.I do not accept what the Deputy stated about the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  It has published figures for the first time in recent years and we have verifiable and accurate figures on waiting times which show that only 477 people wait more than 12 months for a procedure.  As far as I am concerned, that is 477 too many, but it has reduced and the number was 27,000 at one point.  One must acknowledge that there has been major success.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	85	They are massaging the figures.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	86	They are not massaging the figures.  They are accurate verifiable figures and I invite the Deputy to meet representatives of the National Treatment Purchase Fund or invite representatives to come before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children to discuss the significant progress that has been made.  At a meeting with the NTPF last week, I discussed whether a person should remain on a waiting list if he or she refuses an appointment for no good reason.  That happens in many instances.With regard to hospital activity, the key issue is that services are up on the service plan provision for 2009.  I agree there are pressure points and major financial pressures, but we cannot give more money to any of the hospitals and they have to live within their budgets.  This means hospitals must take whatever steps are necessary to live within that budget.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	87	I accept that hospitals must live within their budgets but I reiterate what I stated.  An employee of the Houses was told she would have to be on the waiting list at Tallaght hospital for one year before the NTPF would accept her.  That is a fact.  Another man, who is 53 and has a painful knee, is awaiting an orthopaedic outpatient appointment but cannot get one for two and a half years.  That is another irrefutable fact.  I will not go through all of the anecdotes but it is very disconcerting that the Minister——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	88	A question, Deputy.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	89	The obvious question is how can the Minister tell us that patients are not being affected detrimentally when this is the reality.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	90	I invite the Deputy to read the OECD publication today which shows the significant improvements we have made in Ireland in health, life expectancy and cancer treatment.  It is an independent analysis which shows that, over the past decade, life expectancy has increased faster in Ireland than in any other EU country.  Some of the cases the Deputy discussed had already been brought to my attention, which is why I discussed the matter with Professor Conlon.  It is not acceptable when there are 11 orthopaedic surgeons in one hospital that someone must wait two and a half years for an outpatient appointment.  It is not acceptable to me, to Professor Conlon or to the board of the hospital and the matter will be dealt with.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	91	The Deputy may be referring to recent media reports regarding an application before Sligo County Council to rezone land which would permit a planning application to be made in respect of a private health facility.  The reports state that such a facility may provide certain medical services, including oncology.  It is not clear whether the facility will ever be established but I want to make it clear that I have no intention of encouraging or supporting the provision of any services which cannot meet the required standards of safety and care.I am aware that a number of private health facilities have advertised various oncology services which they provide.  I contacted hospitals in the independent sector in 2007 urging them to take steps to ensure that their breast cancer services complied with the national standards for symptomatic breast disease.  I also brought the standards to the attention of private health insurance providers and the chief medical officer wrote to health insurers and the independent hospital sector again in October this year reminding them of their responsibilities in this regard.We have been preparing to work on legislative proposals for a mandatory licensing system to cover both public and private health care providers, based on explicit standards to be set by the Health Information and Quality Authority.  I intend to bring these proposals to Government next year.  This will ensure that all services, whether publicly or privately provided, meet the same high quality care standards for all patients.Under this national strategy for cancer control, the HSE has designated eight specialist cancer centres, each serving a minimum population of 500,000.  University Hospital Galway is the designated centre for Sligo.  Breast cancer diagnostic and surgical services were transferred from Sligo General Hospital to University Hospital Galway in August, but medical oncology services and outpatient radiation oncology clinics continue to be provided in Sligo.  Other than non-melanoma skin cancer and a limited volume of bowel cancer cases, the vast majority of other curative cancer surgeries have never been undertaken at Sligo and are routinely referred to one of the eight designated cancer centres.Irrespective of media reports regarding the possible development of other services, I believe that the concentration of breast cancer services into eight designated specialist centres is the only way to achieve the best results for our patients.  The application of national standards, and ultimately the mandatory licensing of public and private facilities, will provide the best way forward.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	92	Does the Minister think it is ironic, inadequate and possibly dangerous for private patients that private facilities are not regulated?  Does the Minister know how many private facilities in Ireland provide cancer services of any type, particularly in the context of the cancer control programme and the need for critical mass, triple assessment and multi-disciplinary teams?  How long will it take to introduce the legislation required?  The Minister mentioned next year but the private sector can do what it likes in the provision of health services without HIQA having any control whatsoever.  Does the Minister believe there is an urgent need to ensure that all patients have properly regulated health services?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	93	As the Deputy is aware, patient safety is a priority for me and that is why I established the patient safety commission.  All the reform taking place in acute hospitals is with a view to their meeting minimum standards for licensing in 2012 and 2013.  As I stated previously here and at committee meetings, if we had the legislation and pressed the green button in the morning, many of the services currently provided would not meet minimum standards and, therefore, are not licensable.  This is why there is such a momentum behind the reconfiguration of acute hospital services in particular.With regard to the provision of cancer services, the Blackrock Clinic in Dublin and Barringtons Hospital in Limerick have stopped providing surgery for breast cancer.  In the case of Barringtons Hospital, that was at my request.  The health insurance providers are taking this matter seriously and if they honour the symptomatic breast disease standards, I do not foresee anybody being foolish enough to put their money into a private facility of the type suggested in Sligo.  That is my honest opinion.  I do not believe that anyone would do so.  Other private facilities such as St. Vincent's Hospital and the Mater Hospital in Dublin are co-located private facilities and have the volumes required under the symptomatic breast disease standards.  The only other facility that I am aware provides breast cancer surgery is the Beacon Hospital in Dublin.

This is specifically with regard to cancer; I accept a broader issue arises.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	95	As I stated on previous occasions, I can only do so when we have a legislative way of doing so and we cannot do that in advance of having licensing, authorisation or accreditation.  Some of the misdiagnoses that have come to public attention occurred in both the public and private sectors, in services that are organised around extremely small volumes of patients and where the critical mass of specialist doctors, etc., does not exist.  Discussing matters with the independent hospitals and advising insurers to follow the guidelines is the most appropriate way to ensure we meet the patient safety standards.The Deputy's question relates to something that may never happen.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	97	The question relates to Sligo and I presume it arose on foot of Fintan O'Toole's article in respect of a meeting of Sligo County Council.  It is my view that people would be extremely foolish to invest resources in a facility which could not deal with the volume of patients required to qualify for licensing and to meet the relevant standards.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	98	The HSE sought expressions of interest in December 2007 and July 2008 for the provision of primary care centres for primary care teams.  Negotiations with interested parties proceeded in respect of 163 locations.  Letters of intent have issued in respect of approximately 80 of these locations.  Of those 80 locations, one centre has opened in Letterkenny, seven centres are due to open by the end of January 2010 at Kinnegad, Moate, Gorey, Waterford City, Carlow, Callan and Trim, respectively, and a further 37 are scheduled to open during 2010.  These 80 locations will provide accommodation for 105 primary care teams and approximately 350 general practitioners will provide services from them.The terms and conditions of the leasing arrangement stipulate that the HSE will sign a lease with a landlord only when GP involvement in providing services from the primary care teams accommodated in a centre has been agreed.  The HSE has indicated that negotiations may not be completed in all of the chosen locations due to planning issues, withdrawal of developers or banking or market conditions.  The HSE is also continuing to develop primary care centres through its Exchequer funded capital programme, with seven such centres opened in 2009 at Irishtown, Mark's Lane and Dundrum in Dublin, Strokestown in County Roscommon, Inis Mór and Clonbur in County Galway and Westbury in County Clare.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	99	We know the Minister has a large number of plans and that some of Professor Drumm's bonus was apparently based on having teams in place.  For the most part, these teams are virtual in nature.  In other words, they do not really exist.  A letter of intent is just that and it has no legal status or standing.  My question is very straightforward and seeks to discover the number of contracts that have been signed this year.  On each occasion we inquire about this matter we are informed that there are 90 centres.  Mr. Brian Gilroy of the HSE is on record as stating that there are 90 centres, some of which have two teams and some of which have three.  The fact is, however, that there are not 90 centres.  I would be grateful if the Minister would indicate the number of centres in respect of which contracts were signed in the past 11 months.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	100	The significance of primary care teams has nothing to do with buildings or new facilities, even though there are many of both.  These teams involve health care professionals working differently together around patients.  As stated previously, I recently met a health care nurse who has reduced, by half of one working day a week, the amount of time she spends seeking to make contact with colleagues dealing with the same patients as her.By September last, 165 teams were operational.  By the end of the year there will be some 210 teams in operation.  The Deputy's question relates to contracts in respect of new facilities and I informed him that negotiations with interested parties proceeded in respect of 163 locations.  These negotiations are at various stages.

These individuals have come to see me and they have probably also visited the Deputy.  Some arrangements have not been concluded but I am not in a position to inform the Deputy with regard to the different stages at which they stand.  I informed him that 80 centres will open next year and that 350 doctors will be involved in the teams located at these centres.  I believe the purpose of the Deputy's question was——
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	107	The purpose of my question is to elicit information on the number of contracts that have been signed.

How many contracts have been signed?  I do not want to know how many we aspire to sign, nor am I interested in the difficulties we face.  I merely wish to discover the number of contracts that have been signed in the past 11 months.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	110	Perhaps the Deputy does not understand the law.

I informed the Deputy that 80 centres will open next year.  Is he of the view that contracts were not signed in respect of these?
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	117	The Minister refused to answer the question.  That is fine.  The answer is approximately four or five contracts were signed.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	118	The development of child and adolescent mental health services is a priority for me and the Government.  Inpatient capacity has doubled since 2007.   Two new child and adolescent units opened in 2009, at St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview, and St. Stephen's Hospital, Cork.  This brings total inpatient capacity to 30.  Some time ago I appeared on "Prime Time" and outlined this point when asked about the Government's policy on child and adolescent beds.  I have not been invited back since to provide information on our commitment in this regard.Two 20-bed units are currently under construction at Bessboro, Cork, and Merlin Park, Galway.  I am advised that these beds will be commissioned in 2010.  The HSE mental health capital programme, which will be funded from the proceeds of the sales of the old psychiatric hospitals, will be also finalised shortly.  This will provide for further beds in the child and adolescent mental health service, in line with the recommendations in A Vision for Change.  The number currently available is 50, while A Vision for Change recommends 100.  The Government is intent on selling the assets to which I refer to ensure this area will be prioritised and targeted.I recognise the undesirability of admitting children to units providing care and treatment to adults.  In the absence of an alternatives, however, I must accept that such admissions are sometimes necessary in the best interests of the child.  The Mental Health Commission has issued a code of practice relating to the admission of children under the Mental Health Act 2001 which outlines the arrangements and facilities that should be put in place to ensure the protection and safety of such children.  The commission recently issued an addendum to this code of practice which seeks to ensure that by 1 December 2011, no child under 18 years will be admitted to an adult psychiatric unit.  I am of the view that this commitment will be honoured.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	119	I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  Do I infer from his remarks that it was completely inappropriate to place 247 children in adult psychiatric units?  The psychiatric profession has expressed concerns in respect of this matter for some time.  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State made a commitment with regard to this matter.  His predecessors in the Department made commitments in respect of four areas that were identified in A Vision for Change.  One of those areas is Limerick, to which the Minister of State did not refer in his reply.  The mid-west is in urgent need of facilities similar to those provided in Cork, Galway and Dublin.  Will the Minister of State comment on the information emanating from Temple Street Children's University Hospital to the effect that children as young as five years of age are attempting suicide and engaging in self-harm?
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	120	A fortnight ago I came before the Joint Committee on Health and Children and indicated that the Government would honour its commitment on the child and adolescent units that will contain 100 beds in all.  I also indicated on that day that I would return to the committee in February with clear and decisive commitments in respect of this matter.  I am not ignoring arguments to the effect that Limerick should be included in this regard.  I asked the committee for its indulgence until February on this matter.The Deputy will recognise that there has been a significant increase in the number of child and adolescent beds.  I accept, however, that this increase is not enough.  Neither I nor the Minister for Health and Children have ever pretended that half the required number is adequate.  The commitment to 100 beds remains in place.  The target in this regard was set when A Vision for Change first appeared and it is now being brought forward.I cannot comment specifically on reports that children as young as five years of age have attempted suicide.  The priority in the mental health area always has been the provision of early intervention.  That will be proven over the next few weeks and we will return to the matter in February.  The commitment was to ensure adequate child and adolescent mental health beds.  I appreciate the work of Deputy Neville and the Department will have proposals in February for dealing with mental health in the best way, with the added aim of ensuring that we reduce the number of suicides, specifically those of children and adolescents.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	121	The McCarthy report recommended that €50 million be removed from mental health services.  Does the Minister of State have views on this?  From some of his statements, it seems that he does not accept this.  Can he confirm this is correct?
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	122	Like Deputy Neville, I do not want to make a menu of the McCarthy report.  We cannot pick and choose.  I am satisfied with the commitment of the Minister, Deputy Harney, to mental health.  The McCarthy report made recommendations but I prefer to see the outcome of the budget before I comment on that.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	123	The HSE has provided the following information on the number of separated children or unaccompanied minors seeking asylum who have gone missing from the care of the HSE since 2007.  In 2007, 32 separated children went missing from the care of the HSE, in 2008 22 went missing, and up to October 2009 45 young people went missing from the care of the HSE.It is a matter of great concern to the Government, the HSE and the Garda Síochána that a number of separated children go missing after they enter the State.  Separated children going missing from care is not a phenomenon unique to Ireland.  In many cases children go missing very soon after arriving in the country.  The suspicion is that many of these children may have planned this with persons unknown prior to entering the country.  This may be done with the objective of reuniting with their families, who have already arrived in the State, or with the intention of relocating to other European countries where their families are located.The HSE has developed a strong working relationship with the Garda National Immigration Bureau with regard to missing children.  A joint national protocol is in place between the HSE and Garda Síochána for all children who go missing from care.  The protocol seeks to maximise inter-agency co-operation, to reduce the incidence of children going missing from care placements and to return missing children to safety as soon as possible.The implementation plan for the 2009 report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse contains a commitment that separated children will be accommodated in mainstream care instead of hostels by December 2010.  This move from hostel accommodation to residential and foster care should help to ensure that fewer children go missing.  The HSE has begun the process of phasing out the hostel arrangements.  Three hostels were closed recently, leaving four to be closed in 2010.  The introduction of the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, together with the work been undertaken by the anti-human trafficking unit in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform should help to ensure that the numbers going missing are reduced significantly and that these young people are cared for in a safe and secure environment.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	124	I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  How many children have gone missing from foster care?I questioned the Minister of State on this matter last February and he said the issue had attracted a high level of concentration from the Government and that while there has been a fall-off in the number of children disappearing in 2008, he was not going to become complacent about it.  If that is the case, how did we lose five children every single month for the first nine months of this year?  Is it not the case that we have lost twice as many children in the first nine months of this year as the whole of last year?In February, the Minister of State told us that 24-hour care was being provided to these children.  I draw attention to the report of the Ombudsman for Children, which pointed out that security guards provide care after 6 p.m.  The Ombudsman for Children stated that one of the children she dealt with in the report disappeared and did not make it onto the missing children website.  If that is the case, how is the Garda protocol operating when the child working directly with the Ombudsman for Children has evaporated?
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	125	It is an issue of serious concern that the figure has increased in 2009 after a very low figure in 2008.  For this reason we have included it in our implementation plan arising from the Ryan report.  In order to prevent this from happening we need to bring children seeking asylum into a position of equality with children in residential or foster care so that they are provided with the same services and the accommodation is properly registered and inspected.  This has not been the case until now.  Next year we hope to phase out the four hostels that remain providing services to children.  Through that level of equality, we can ensure that children coming to the attention of State agencies are dealt with at the earliest stages.  Children go missing very soon after coming to the attention of State agencies.  If they are in inappropriate accommodation one can be sure that inappropriate service will be provided.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	126	In February the Minister of State clapped himself on the back because the number had reduced last year.  He took credit in the House for that fact that only 22 children had gone missing.  Two in five children placed in care this year have disappeared from accommodation.  Will the Minister of State take responsibility for that?Only two of the three residential centre inspection reports were made available to me.  Will the third report be made available?  The Minister of State referred to proper accommodation being made available.  Does the Minister of State consider it acceptable that the HSE has a proposal to put new accommodation alongside existing asylum centres?  These have been seen as a focal point for traffickers.  Is it acceptable to locate them so close to asylum centres when this will make it easier for traffickers to access them?
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I completely reject the assertion that I clapped myself on the back earlier this year.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	130	I was only a Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children for half of the previous year.  I fail to see how I could be credited with positive development that occurred in the previous year.  The more serious issue raised by Deputy Naughten is the location of appropriate accommodation for children separated or seeking asylum.  The anti-human trafficking unit in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has a working group dealing with human trafficking, with representatives from the Garda Síochána, the HSE and NGOs.  I have committed to ensuring that the closing of hostels is accompanied by a forum representing the HSE, the Garda Síochána and the NGOs.  This process can draw on the knowledge of stakeholders and the experience of anyone who has something positive to contribute so the transition from inadequate accommodation to the fulfilment of the commitment to close hostels by the end of 2010 is done with the best interests of children at heart.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 37 and 47 together.  The recruitment of a new chief executive officer is a matter for the board of the HSE, as are the internal governance structures of the organisation.  However, I can confirm that certain changes are being introduced in the management structures of the HSE to enable it to better manage and deliver hospital and community services in a more integrated way and to strengthen the role of clinicians in the delivery of services.In October 2009 the chief executive officer announced that four regional directors of operations were being established.  They are accountable and responsible for the delivery of all health and social care services in the existing four geographical areas.  In addition, the national hospitals office and the primary, community and continuing care directorate were being replaced by an integrated services directorate with two national directors; one responsible for reconfiguration and the other for performance and financial management.The HSE is also in the process of appointing care leaders — one each for mental health services, disability services, children and family services and services for older people.  The appointees will set out operational plans and delivery targets for their areas of responsibility and will be the key link with the Department and external stakeholders.A new national director of quality and clinical care, Dr. Barry White, has been appointed.  His role is to strengthen clinical leadership, improve clinical performance and ensure care is delivered in a way that maximises quality while minimising expenditure.  This will involve the development and implementation of care pathways, protocols and standards for different disease programmes, particularly chronic diseases that have a high impact on the health system.  In addition, support functions such as ICT, procurement and estates have been amalgamated into a single directorate.  The posts which I have mentioned are being filled from within the existing complement of staff.The aim of the new management arrangements is to deliver excellent health outcomes for the population by driving the integration of hospital and community services, ensure more efficient use of resources, ensure clear lines of management accountability and support its strategy of shifting the balance of activity towards prevention and community-based care and away from hospital-based care.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	134	On 1 January next, the HSE will have existed for five years.  Everyone acknowledges that its layers of administration are top heavy.  Will some posts be taken out at that level?  When Professor Drumm took up his position, he brought in what has been described as a kitchen cabinet in addition to those already in the health boards.  Will the Minister streamline the governance of the HSE?At the Estimates meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children last week, the Minister told us she planned to reduce the numbers working in the HSE by 6,000 by removing 8,000 in some way or another and adding 2,000 for development of services.  Now that the talks with the unions have broken down, does the Minister still expect to achieve that reduction and, if so, how?  Will there be involuntary redundancies or has she had time to think about how she might achieve this?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	135	In response to the last question, the Minister for Finance will make announcements about public service numbers in the course of his budget speech tomorrow.  If the changes in the health service suggested last week, the five over seven, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. day, redeployment and flexibility can become the norm, as most people seem prepared to accept, they will have a major impact on the capacity to make things happen speedily——
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	136	It could have been achieved if the Government had reached an agreement last week.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	137	-----particularly as we seek to integrate community and hospital services in a more orderly fashion than ever before.  We want to move staff from providing the service in the hospital to providing it in the community and redeployment within a reasonable geographic radius provides that opportunity.  One if not two of Professor Drumm’s advisers have already left the HSE.  The contracts of employment of the remaining two will cease when Professor Drumm is no longer chief executive officer from next summer.  The board is advertising this week or shortly for a replacement.  The number at directorate or senior management level in the HSE will not change with the new arrangements.  There is scope to take people out.  There has been a significant interest in early retirement from the public sector, not least the health sector.  We had a supplementary budget last week partly because of the increase in those numbers.  A large proportion are from the management, administrative or support staff.  With the moratorium, those who retire at that level will not be replaced apart from in exceptional circumstances so, for example, one replaces the CEO.  Where there is scope for efficiencies, people will not be replaced in what is broadly called the front line services.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	138	The Minister said earlier last year that she would pursue redundancies, yet when she was asked about it at the end of last year, she said it was a matter for the Minister for Finance.  Today again, having told us last week that there would be redundancies, she has put it back into the lap of the Minister for Finance.  Who will take responsibility for the HSE?  What has changed that makes the Minister believe she can achieve redundancies?  In the past she has said that the unions were not co-operating and that there was very little uptake.  Will the new posts result in increased salaries or will they be the same or lower, given that everybody else is taking a cut?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	139	The Minister for Finance is responsible for the public service.  That is factually correct.  Of course we can reduce numbers within the HSE and I have said before, including last week, that the intention is to reduce the number by 8,000 but recruit back 2,000, making a net reduction of 6,000.  We want to recruit consultants, specialist nurses and health care therapists and other specialists that we require in the service.  A voluntary redundancy scheme for the public service was announced in last year's budget.  We did not implement it in the health sector because it cannot be applied without redeployment.  It would not be possible, for example, to have a large number leave from one hospital without being able to redeploy people from another.  At present, it is not possible to redeploy from one part of a hospital to another.  Any voluntary redundancy scheme must be accompanied by a redeployment scheme; otherwise, we would not achieve the savings envisaged and the voluntary redundancy scheme could be quite expensive.  The people who have retired are those who were close to retirement age.  That is why the number was higher this year.The Minister for Finance will enunciate pay policy in his budget speech tomorrow.  Any pay reductions that apply to Ministers, politicians and public servants will apply to posts within the HSE and the wider public service.

Following the breakdown of the talks, will it not be very difficult for the Minister to achieve what she wants to achieve with regard to streamlining the HSE?  Is it correct to say that only 16% of those who opted for early retirement were in the administrative or management grades?

One must include support staff too.It is a great disappointment because we were discussing last week everything that had been sought for the past five years and which is central to the transformation of our health service, including a longer working day, a five over seven working week, different rostering and particularly redeployment.  These are all central if we are to move from hospital-based services to community and primary care and to have the appropriate staff ratios and so on.  I hope we will be able to resume that agenda very quickly.  When everybody has had an opportunity to reflect and perhaps have a break because there were a lot of all night meetings over the past few weeks——

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	147	I will be responding in the context of the reports of the Dublin Archdiocese Commission of Investigation and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children.The report of the Dublin Archdiocese Commission of Investigation documents the litany of abuses perpetrated by clergy operating under the aegis of the Dublin Archdiocese.  The HSE is finalising its audits of other dioceses.  The purpose of the audits is to ensure that the HSE is fully aware of all cases of clerical child sex abuse known to the church, including the whereabouts of any alleged perpetrators.  Pending receipt of a report from the HSE on the results of these audits, the Government has reserved its position on the option of further diocesan investigations, along the lines of the Murphy commission.While the commission's report does not include specific recommendations on the rights of children, it is important, in light of the report, to establish whether any further actions are required to strengthen child protection policies and practices generally.The Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, which was established in November 2007, has produced two interim reports to date.  One deals with the exchange of so called soft information and the other with a proposal to give legal authority to create offences of absolute or strict liability in respect of sexual offences against, or in connection with, children.  The joint committee is now concentrating on family law issues arising in respect of proposed changes to the Constitution dealing with, among other things, the rights of children.  A draft final report is currently being considered by the committee and its deadline for reporting back to the Oireachtas is 16 December 2009.  The report will be submitted to Government for its consideration.  In the meantime, my office, in co-operation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has started work on preparing heads of a Bill to deal with the issue of soft information.A revised edition of the Children First guidelines will be published shortly by my office and will be promulgated throughout the public service.  Standardised processes for dealing with cases of child welfare and protection will be introduced by the HSE, along with a national child care information system.  This will help ensure that all information relating to an individual case is readily available to HSE professionals and that all contacts can be traced.I am committed to making whatever changes are necessary in legislation, policy or practice to provide the best possible protection for children.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	148	Has the Minister of State an idea when he might be ready to propose a referendum in regard to the rights of the child?  The Murphy report contained a suggestion that the HSE may not have strong enough powers in regard to child sexual abuse outside of the family.  Will the Minister of State comment on whether there is a need for further legislation in this regard?The Ryan report suggested that there was a need for an extra 270 social workers specifically in the area of child protection.  There is also information that more than 6,000 children at risk are not assigned to a social worker at present.  In addition, the Adoption Bill will require more social workers.  What action is the Government taking in regard to the shortage of social workers?
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	149	With regard to the referendum, the committee has until the end of next week to provide its consensus on wording to improve the position of children in the Constitution.  A decision on a date of a referendum will follow consideration of that report by the Government.HSE powers under section 3 of the Child Care Act are very clear in terms of abuse that might occur within a family.  Both the Ferns report and the Murphy commission report raised a doubt as to whether the HSE had powers in terms of extra-familial abuse, as the Deputy stated.  The Attorney General at the time of the Ferns report confirmed that the HSE powers under section 3 did contemplate extra-familial abuse.  Nonetheless, as the Murphy commission has raised it again, we will again clarify the point with the Attorney General.The question of the 270 social workers is a key part of the implementation plan.  There already have been appointments in 2009 and I am confident we will be able to meet the target.  The Deputy stated that 6,000 children do not have a social worker, which underlines the need, which is not disputed.  Where a reference is made to the HSE, all children are triaged and dealt with in terms of priority.The Adoption Bill contemplates the idea of accredited agencies that would carry out assessments in regard to suitability for adoption.  Because that can be done, it should free up social workers who are currently occupied with the issue of assessments.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	150	While I welcome the freer availability of social workers, I do not believe it goes far enough and we need more appointed.My main point is simple and it concerns an issue broader than that of health.  There are four Ministers across the Chamber.  Surely they realise the absolute necessity that the Garda would investigate all dioceses to check for the situation that pertains in the Archdiocese of Dublin.  We know well it is not limited to Dublin, nor was it limited to Ferns.  All dioceses need to be investigated by the Garda.  It is not a matter of focusing on the children, although, of course, that is important.  The perpetrators who inflicted this pain on the victims have to be brought to book, and the victims must be given the right of redress and the right to confront their predators.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	151	First, the perpetrators are brought to book through the criminal justice system, not through commissions of inquiry.  Commissions of inquiry are supposed to try to find out what went wrong in the past, who was responsible and——
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	152	I asked for a Garda inquiry.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	153	A Garda inquiry concerns criminal justice.  The Deputy asked whether all dioceses should be referred to the commission, if I am clear on his question.  The Deputy must remember the Dublin commission looked at only a sample of cases, so it was not an effort to try to bring perpetrators to book.  Rather, it was an exercise to try to find out what went wrong, who was responsible and what we can learn for the future.There is a limit in regard to including all of the dioceses in the commission of inquiry because we have learned so much through both the Ryan and Murphy reports, and we will learn more from the Cloyne report.  We have to remember there are also 140 congregations.  It has taken us a year to examine Cloyne thus far, and it may take us a little longer.  If we go through all of the dioceses and all of the congregations, for which some people are now calling, I doubt we will add much to our body of knowledge in regard to where we went wrong in the past.  We have learned much.  However, the Government, of course, reserves its position in regard to the HSE audits and what they will uncover about these dioceses.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	154	I am anxious to get more information on the social work issue.  Will the Minister explain how many extra social workers have been appointed this year?   At what stage does he expect to have appointed the extra 270 social workers that were recommended in the Ryan report?On the issue raised by Deputy Reilly and the specific matter of possible criminal investigations, what is the Minister of State's role, given his responsibility for children?  Does he have a responsibility in regard to that element or is this purely a matter for the DPP and the Garda?
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	155	On the second issue, it is a matter for the DPP and the Garda and I do not have a role in that regard.With regard to the social workers, while there have been 100 appointments this year, some of these are temporary staff who have been made permanent and some staff have taken retirement, so the net additional position is approximately 50.  Therefore, there is a further number to be gained and it is my ambition to achieve that by the end of next year.  However, resources obviously will be an issue and those matters will have to be resolved in terms of the ongoing Estimates and discussions with the Department of Finance.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	156	Members will recall the Monageer case, which involved a murder-suicide in Wexford in which two young children unfortunately died.  One of the key recommendations of the Monageer report was that a full-time, 24-7 crisis intervention service would be available.  It is available on a part-time basis at present.  Will the Minister of State revisit the question of full-time service?  His statement at the time was that the €12 million it would cost to save those lives was not available.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	157	I wish to be clear that while an out-of-hours service was the key recommendation, the conclusion of the report was that it would not have saved those lives.  We have to be clear about the context in which this recommendation was made.  Nevertheless, as a result of that, in June 2009, the HSE with the Garda began operating a protocol for a place of safety under section 12 of the Child Care Act, whereby a child who in previous times would have spent a night in a Garda station would now be placed with a fostering service until social work services were available.  This is working very well from the point of view of the Garda, the HSE and those children who have been referred to it.It is interesting to note the volume of children coming into this place of safety service is very low, which makes us wonder whether a full-scale out-of-hours service is necessary.  In any case, under the implementation plan, we have committed to doing two pilot areas, which will begin in 2010, in order to have an out-of-hours service outside of Dublin.  Those recommendations will be acted on.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	158	Approximately 77 million laboratory tests are undertaken annually across 44 public hospitals.  At present, the annual cost of this service is approximately €470 million.  The workload comprises both urgent and non-urgent tests, and a significant proportion of the activity originates in the primary care setting.An external review of laboratory services was conducted for the HSE by Teamwork Management Services in 2007.  The review highlighted limitations in the current organisation of laboratories which impact on quality, turnaround time and cost.  In light of the review, the HSE announced plans earlier this year to modernise laboratory services and to introduce significant efficiencies in the configuration and operation of these services.  The HSE has already had significant engagement with stakeholders in progressing this initiative.  Groups such as the faculty of pathology and the Medical Laboratory Scientists Association will have an ongoing input into the process.As part of this initiative, the HSE has recently commenced discussions with the National Development Finance Agency about the capital financing of a small number of dedicated "cold" laboratories to process the large volumes of routine patient tests currently undertaken in hospital laboratories.  This will include a robust analysis of the cold laboratory business model from a value for money perspective.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	159	Everyone supports the rationalisation of laboratory services.  The Minister used the words "cold" and "hot" to define routine versus emergency.  The issue is that there are plans to allow for international tendering so, once again, a company like Quest Diagnostics can take over laboratory services in this country and we end up with hundreds of medical laboratory scientists' jobs gone.  They have already seen the cervical screening activity removed.Invitation by letter has reduced the number of people attending for smears from 28,000 in August to 18,000 in September, as was anticipated, despite the denials on the other side of the table.  Could the Minister tell us if she intends to tender this work outside the country and how many jobs will be lost?  Does she believe this is a sensible use of Irish taxpayers' money in terms of retaining Irish jobs and a particular skill?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	160	The main issue is quality and cost.  The Deputy knows from the report that our turn-around time is bad, our quality is poor and our cost is enormous.  Clearly, from any perspective, that is not satisfactory.  The intention is to go to tender and there has been discussion with stakeholders.  One would hope that the public service would be successful in that tender but clearly it must compete on the basis of quality, turn-around time and cost.  That must be the future because if we waste €200 million on this service that could be used in areas where we have deficiencies, be that in the child protection area or the many other areas where there are deficiencies, no one could defend that.  Quest Diagnostics is in discussions about a public facility in Ireland with a view to putting facilities in place.On the cervical screening, there was huge take up, there were 250,000 smears taken last year, with the number up this year.  It is appropriate that we do it by way of letter so there are proper systems for recall.  Given we only started cervical screening in September 2008, it has been highly successful and we want to see it develop further during 2010.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	161	I understand the issue of the cold labs and the farming out of the work, possibly abroad, although I share Deputy Reilly's concern about the loss of jobs.  One of the problems when Quest Diagnostics got the contract for cervical cancer screening was that many of the Irish laboratories had been neglected in terms of building up what they needed to be able to carry out the tests.Can the Minister clarify if some of the cytology screening will be done in Ireland now that the two year contract has run out and is being renewed?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	162	Quest Diagnostics has announced its intention to establish a facility in Ireland and it is in active discussions with a public facility here.  The issue is one of quality, turn-around time and cost.  It is not appropriate, as everyone accepts, including the professional representatives and the College of Pathology, that there are 44 centres in Ireland.  There cannot be a quality-driven, quick turn-around, cost effective laboratory service in that scenario.  Everyone has signed up for rationalisation of that.The challenge for the public sector is to be able to compete with others, and I believe it has the capacity to do that in a tender.  The HSE is in active discussions with the national finance agency about a public private partnership model for the provision of this service which we hope to advance during 2010.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	164	Tomorrow, the Minister for Finance, on behalf of the Government, will read out his statement that will purportedly seek €4,000 million in reductions and cuts.  An element of that will deal with the Department of Social and Family Affairs.In a revealing programme last night on RTE television, it was estimated that social welfare fraud is running at 10%, leading one to believe the fraud is of the order of €2 billion per year, half of what the Minister for Finance is looking for in his overall cuts.  It appears as if the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs have been entirely incompetent in dealing with the scale of this robbery from the taxpayer's pocket.  Despite the litany of actions the Minister for Social and Family Affairs talks about having implemented, fraud remains on a vast scale.As Deputy Naughten pointed out this morning, 11 years ago it was intended to introduce a public services identity card.  Recommendations were made by him to transfer surplus officials from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food into the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report last year indicated that officers dealing with fraud are dealing with application forms for social welfare in the first instance.Can I ask the Taoiseach, given the range of categories that apply in the Department of Social and Family Affairs, having discussed this at Cabinet, where is this fraud taking place in the Department?  Where is the €2 billion in fraud being committed?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	165	There is no evidence whatsoever that welfare fraud costs the State €2 billion per year.  That figure arose in respect of certain high risk categories that were being investigated and a discrepancy of 10% was found.  It is not right to extrapolate from that figure that the total level of fraud in the Department of Social and Family Affairs is 10%.The level of fraud in most schemes is very low.  It is important to point out the vast majority of people entitled to social welfare are those who need it and are obtaining it lawfully.  There is ongoing vigilance, because of the need in these difficult economic times, to make sure that those who most require our help obtain it and to ensure that anyone who is defrauding the system is identified and dealt with.  That is why so much has been undertaken by the Minister and the Department to ensure fraud is kept to a minimum and eliminated where possible.There are 620 staff involved in fraud detection, including a special investigation unit.  People now collect money in person each week instead of having it sent to them, as was the case in the past.  Photo identification is required when collecting payments.  Across all schemes, 600,000 claims have been reviewed so far this year, including medical checks and certification to prove continued entitlement to child benefit.  Data matching with the Department and with external agencies has been achieved.  Inter-agency Border checks have been established.  Social welfare officials and Garda national immigration bureau have been put in place.  It is only fair to point out that all of that preventative work in terms of avoiding defrauding of the taxpayer and of social welfare recipients is in the interests of genuine social welfare recipients when, at a time of economic difficulty, we have to consider in what way we can maintain living standards vis-à-vis 2008 given the increased cost of living during the course of this year.  Obviously these are sensitive areas but I do not accept there is a complacency or that there is not an added determination in the Department of Social and Family Affairs because of the fact that we want to ensure that people who require assistance get it, that anyone who is seeking to cheat on that system is cheating against the taxpayer and those who require those payments.  In addition to these initiatives we will do everything possible to ensure fraud is not as prominent a feature of the system as, perhaps, the Deputy suggests.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	166	Last week I spoke to a young engineer who has been forced to sign on for social welfare.  I asked him how it is when one goes into the prefab.  He said it sucks away one's soul.  The way to tackle social welfare is by creating jobs and incentives for jobs which the Government has failed to do.  Tomorrow, the budget will be announced.  I listened to the senior official in the Department of Social and Family Affairs last evening talking about fraud of between 10% and 15% in some schemes.  The lower end of that scale at 10% on a €20 billion spend is €2 billion.  Even if it is not €2 billion — the Minister for Social and Family Affairs is shaking her head — it is €1.5 billion too many.  Of the 640 officials working in fraud area of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, many are part time.Tomorrow the Government will take money from carers, the disabled and genuine recipients of welfare who are on the bread line.  The only category the Taoiseach said would not be touched was pensioners.  In the area of social welfare, children do not commit fraud; pensioners, by and large, do not commit fraud; disabled persons and carers do not commit fraud.  Where is it going on?  The scams that were exposed last night indicate clearly the incompetence of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.  Some 11 years on we still have not arrived at a point where one can have a public service identity card.  We have a situation where the PPS numbers and the computers in her Department are still not talking to each other.  There are people who acquire and hire PPS numbers and claim jobseeker's allowance as exposed in that programme and fraud continues.  Tomorrow, in a draconian budget, because of Government incompetency, the Government will take away money from people who need it.  Everybody agrees that to cheat in social welfare is robbery out of the taxpayers' pockets where that takes place deliberately and knowingly.  The Government has failed to become serious about this issue.  In many cases it is only a question of making people reapply to find out where they are.

When will computer systems be fully linked-up and integrated so that persons hiring or acquiring, by whatever means, a PPS number and who claim jobseeker's allowance, are identified and punished in accordance with the law?  The man who said this "sucks away one's soul" deserves his chance at a job and nobody wants to see 10%, €2 billion, fraudulent activity within the Department of Social and Family Affairs continuing in perpetuity.

I have here seven documents which were signed off, as agreed, last Friday between the public service trade unions and the Government.  There is a document on the health service which contains 15 specific reforms, including a change to 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. rostering five days over days, significant savings on overtime premia, weekend working.  I have one for the education sector which provides for increased hours for those working in the education sector and a revision of teachers' contracts.  I have one for the local government service which includes reductions in the numbers of directors of service and directorates and arrangements whereby one local authority could provide services for another.  I have one for the Civil Service which gives management the right to redeploy staff across Departments.  I have two specific documents relating to redeployment and how it could be achieved, that it could take place within a 50 km radius, the number of sick leave days that would disqualify a person and quite specific details which would have provided the Government not only with the €1.3 million in savings, which it would achieve, but also much need reforms of the public service.The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance met the public service unions on Tuesday when the Taoiseach told them it was game on, so to speak, for this agreement and on that basis they called off their one-day strike. Discussions continued right through lunchtime on Friday and on Friday, the Cabinet decided to pull the plug——

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	192	That is completely at variance with the facts.  As the Deputy said, we met with the ICTU representatives on Tuesday morning.  A proposal was put to the Government which I said would be considered by Cabinet.  It was considered by Cabinet but unfortunately it did not meet the first requirement on the amount of savings that would be required.  We reserved our position with regard to it.  We notified the unions on that matter.  They wanted to see if they could develop the proposal further and I was agreeable to that request because it is important to continue discussions.  Some of the sectoral discussions took place right up to Friday morning.  Some excellent work has been done which provides for a common positive vision as to how we can proceed with transforming public services.  The immediate problem related to the fact that savings of the order of €1.3 billion would have been required, not only in 2010 but thereafter.  Unfortunately this was not possible to confirm with the detail that would be required beyond 2010.Issues were also raised with regard to the proposal for 12 days' unpaid leave.  The Deputy will recall that the portrayal of this proposal in the public domain during the course of Wednesday on the basis of the strike not proceeding on Thursday, met with a very strong public reaction and certainly made the task of agreement infinitely more difficult.  That question of unpaid leave was central to the consensus on the public sector trade unions side about offering pay reductions while maintaining pay rates.  They offered an extended period during which that leave would be taken.  However, the other problem, the second issue, related to uncertainty about how precisely the savings would be continued in 2012 and beyond.  I agree there are various transformation measures which can be significant and which would not have generated savings of the order of €1 billion but we would have to discuss again next year what steps might be taken to help reduce the pay bill.  It is unfortunate that an agreement was not possible which would command wide support especially in the context of other elements of the budget to be announced tomorrow and the three tests, which I set out on Wednesday morning last, were not met.I recognise the level of engagement entered into by all sides and that genuine efforts were made.  It was not possible to conclude an agreement, to the disappointment of many people, but the bottom line is there are strategic gains arising out of all those discussions in that there is an agreement, a realisation that savings of the order of €1.3 billion are required for 2010 and beyond and that there is a common positive vision about how we might transform public services in the future were we to be able to go back to those issues on another occasion.

The bottom line is not what the Taoiseach said but rather that he has a Minister for Finance who is now so anxious to get his hands on the Taoiseach's job that he was prepared to sink this ——

My view, and that of the Government, has always been that, having communicated that message to the public sector unions, they wished to continue to develop the proposal while recognising that the amount was not sufficient to meet the needs of Government, we would continue with those discussions in good faith——

The problem was that the public service unions had to come with a very restricted mandate which was not about being in a position to negotiate a pay cut so they proposed a deduction for 2010 and the requirement for the unpaid leave to come thereafter.  That was the reason the unpaid leave issue came up in the first place because the unions did not have the mandate with which to negotiate a permanent reduction in the public sector pay bill.  I understood that difficulty.I was prepared to continue to discuss it to see if there was a way forward which would meet with the requirements of the situation, would have found a deduction for 2010, one which was permanent thereafter, and would have dealt with the public reaction there was right across the board on the issue of unpaid leave.  Unpaid leave was an issue the unions could not de-link from the deduction proposal. While I understood the position from their point of view, as of Friday afternoon, it left the Government in a position where it was unable to state with sufficient certainty that it had the savings beyond 2010.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	249	I propose an amendment that the Dáil sit until 11.30 p.m.  I can explain the reasons later if the Ceann Comhairle wishes.  The Supplementary Estimates are too serious to pass within one hour.  At least 45 additional minutes should be provided to deal with this business.  A further 45 minutes should also be provided to debate the Communications Regulation (Premium Rate Services) Bill 2009.  For some extraordinary reason, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources intends to introduce what is practically an entirely new Bill on Report Stage which will deal with the provision of fibre cable.  While I support such provision in principle, this is not the way to go about it.  Rather than having two separate divisions on the Supplementary Estimates and Bill, I suggest the House sits until 11.30 p.m. to give 45 additional minutes to each item.

Last week, it was intimated the Bill would be taken next week.  Today, there is some talk around the place that there is a possibility or an intention on the part of the Government to have the legislation put through the House on Friday of this week.  I wish to establish from the Taoiseach exactly what the Government's intentions are with regard to the Bill.  I am sure by now the Government has clarified in its own mind when it will be brought before the House and what Stages will be put at various times.  This information should now be shared with us.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	252	I refer to the budget and the consequent legislation required.  Two tranches of legislation will be required, the Social Welfare Bill and legislation to deal with the public sector pay situation as a result of issues which arose last week.  It is the intention of the Government to come to the House with the Social Welfare Bill on Thursday this week, to take Second Stage on Thursday afternoon and evening and then deal with the subsequent Stages on Friday and to come next week with the Public Sector Pay Bill.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	253	This is new information provided to the House.  I asked the Taoiseach about the post-budget legislative arrangements the Government intends to make.  The Taoiseach is now telling us that there will be two very significant tranches of legislation.  The Social Welfare Bill is obviously intended to cut social welfare and the Government proposes to rush it.  We will have the budget on Wednesday.  The Taoiseach is now indicating he will introduce the Bill on Thursday afternoon and take all Stages by Friday evening.  This is not acceptable.  Apart from what he intends to do with the budget, this is an insult to the people, including the carers, the many people on disability, pensioners and people on social welfare payments.  It is not only a matter of what he plans to do in the budget but his attempt to do it in this way.  He is now saying there will be more legislation to deal with the pay issue.  I have raised with the Taoiseach several times——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	254	This matter can be raised on the Order of Business.  We must get a decision on a number of issues.

This is the point I have been making and it is not the first time I have raised this matter.  Since the Government has decided the budget will be introduced this week there is very limited time between budget day, tomorrow, and the recess for Christmas to debate the budget.  We are now told there will be two very controversial tranches of legislation which the Government intends to rush through the House.  In the case of the Social Welfare Bill it wants to have it done and dusted by this weekend.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	263	I have already proposed that we should allocate more time to discuss this and I propose an extension of 45 minutes.  There is a number of very important items to be discussed and it is unfair to expect this to be completed in the time allocated where there is only ten minutes per main spokesperson.Vote 30 deals with the Department Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  There is the question of payments to RTE, An Post and the broadcasting fund.  An amount was to be paid to RTE in 2000 as the balance of licence fees collected in 1999 under the old system were not met.  Vote 27 deals with the Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  There is a Supplementary Estimate in respect of Army pensions.  The note states that the gratuity and pension has been higher than anticipated at the time of the original Estimate and that the upward trend in the past four months is expected to continue to the end of the year.  This has serious implications for the Army.Vote 34 deals with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the temporary employment subsidy scheme.  The Department of Health and Children requires a Supplementary Estimate of €254 million.  A series of items are dealt with in it.The Vote of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform deals with the Garda Síochána Vote.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said many of the gardaí were hangers on at this stage.  The note states there is a 100% increase in the number of budgeted retirements for 2009.  It is a serious loss of experience and a brain drain from the force.  These matters cannot, and should not, be dealt with in a ten minute period.There is also the prisons Vote.  We heard a story today about a man in some distress being arrested because he did not have a dog licence and who spent a day in Mountjoy Prison.  This should not happen.  These matter should be discussed for a longer period of time and I suggest a 45 minute extension.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	264	I agree with Deputy Kenny that the amount of time being provided for these Estimates is far too short.  For that reason, the Labour Party is opposed to this proposal.  I am also opposed to it because of the completely unsatisfactory arrangements the Taoiseach has indicated for the taking of the Social Welfare Bill.  It would appear what is happening is that the Government is now so terrified of exposing any of the Government Deputies to their constituents over the weekend that it will try to get the Social Welfare Bill through before they go home for the weekend.  If the Taoiseach cannot carry his team for one difficult weekend, he will not have much chance of carrying them for another two years.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	265	The Supplementary Estimates were referred by the House on 24 November last to the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service and were dealt with by it.  All the discussion has taken place.  There are nine Supplementary Estimates — six of them are technical and three are substantive.  They have been discussed by the relevant select committee and  have been returned to the House for approval.  I do not see the reason we should have a further discussion because they were dealt with by the committee.Deputy Gilmore asked about what is emerging as a result of the budget requirements.  There will be two Bills — the Social Welfare Bill and the Bill on public sector pay.  We will have to deal with them in line with the time available in the House and we propose to take the Social Welfare Bill later this week.  The Deputy spoke about difficult decisions.  It is clear he does not believe that any difficult decisions should be taken on anything.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	266	The Taoiseach is well aware that although Votes are discussed at committee, it does not mean finality once it has dealt with them.  These are matters of public importance.  It is normal they return to the House for final approval.  From that point of view, the House should have an opportunity to discuss them for a longer period of time than is proposed by Government.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	272	I think the Ceann Comhairle was surprised that a vote was not called on the last proposal.  I could see that registering.  No. 13 is a case where the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is effectively bringing in a brand new Bill on Report Stage.  I accept the principle of the Bill, as has been outlined by Deputy Coveney on a number of occasions, but in this case, what is essentially another service unit or layer of bureaucracy is being included to deal with communications.What the Minister is doing in the use of ducting along national primary routes is correct in principle but this is not the way to go about it.  This Bill is supposedly about premium rate services for telephones and although it began as such it is ending up as a brand new Bill being introduced on Report Stage, which the Dáil will not even have an opportunity to discuss properly or amend if necessary.  For that reason I am opposed to the proposal.

The Minister has essentially lumped two separate Bills into one, and the second part of this Bill deals with an issue totally unconnected with the main Title.  The Minister did not have an amendment in time so Deputy Coveney and I submitted an amendment prepared by the Government.  It was rejected because it was not relevant to the Bill.

It is a clumsy, inadequate and undemocratic approach to preparing and making legislation, which is our primary duty, and because the Government has failed to live up to its responsibility, we must oppose this.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	284	This morning, I was circulated with a proposed Order of Business for Thursday and Friday.  Friday's business was supposed to include the Forestry (Amendment) Bill 2009, statements on a carbon budget and the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission (Amendment) Bill [Seanad] 2009.  Can I take it that is no longer valid in view of the statements made in respect of the social welfare Bill?The usual procedure in the House for years was that following the presentation of the budget by the Minister for Finance and contributions by Opposition spokespersons, the budget debate began the following day and lasted, at one time, for weeks but, in latter years, for a week or so.  Is that being changed?  What is the proposal to deal with Thursday's business?  Will it just be Leaders' speeches on the budget followed by the introduction of the social welfare Bill because the implications of this are serious?Arising from the statement of the Minister for Finance tomorrow, is it intended to introduce an emergency measures Bill to deal with a reduction in the public service bill?  If, tomorrow, the Minister for Finance indicates a reduction in public sector pay, I understand it will be necessary to introduce an emergency measures Bill.  If this is the case, when is it intended to take that Bill?It is now accepted by the Government that reform of the public service, or a more effective public service, is fundamental to moving the country forward and getting out of the economic difficulty we are in.  It is more than six years since I pointed out that if benchmarking were to be paid it should be contingent on efficiencies and achieving targets in the public sector.  That did not happen.  In view of the Government's acceptance of the fact that we must have public sector and service reform now, how is it proposed to present that in view of the collapse of the social partnership model as applied heretofore?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	285	Today, the Cabinet considered the legislative requirements in the aftermath of the budget.  As I stated earlier to Deputy Gilmore, two Bills will be required, namely, a social welfare Bill and a Bill on public sector pay.  The social welfare Bill will be taken this week and the public sector pay Bill will be taken next week.  We envisage a change to the Order of Business for that purpose.  The budget debate and financial resolutions will be taken on Wednesday as normal and will be resumed on Thursday.  We will then take the social welfare Bill and on Friday morning the carbon budget will be taken followed by the Remaining Stages of the social welfare Bill.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	286	What is the urgency in taking the social welfare Bill this week?  Second Stage of the Bill will be taken on Thursday and all Stages will conclude on Friday.  Is there a reason this is so?  The list published by the Chief Whip referred to the Bill dealing with social welfare increases but obviously that is not the case.  Does the urgency have something to do with the fact that, as Deputy Gilmore pointed out, the Government backbenchers appear to be terrified of having another week of this?  If that is not the case, is there a particular legislative reason it has to be taken on Thursday and Friday?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	287	The Government has two Bills to deal with before the Dáil rises and for that reason we have to proceed with them.  We will not have as much time after the budget debate as we did in previous times and we have to proceed with enacting legislation so that it takes effect as envisaged for 2010.  In recent years, social welfare Bills were taken after Private Members' time on the following Tuesday and completed by 7 p.m. on the following day.  This time, we want to deal with two Bills and the second arose because we were not able to find agreement on public service pay last Friday.  Instead of dealing with one Bill we must deal with two.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	288	I want to ask the Taoiseach more about the two Bills promised.  He stated we will have a social welfare Bill, Second Stage of which will be taken on Thursday and Remaining Stages to be taken on Friday.  In addition to taking Remaining Stages of the social welfare Bill on Friday we will also deal with the carbon budget, which presumably will include proposals on a carbon levy or tax.  When will the social welfare Bill be published?  I presume it will not be published until after the Budget Statement is made tomorrow.  The budget debate will effectively be truncated some time early on Thursday to allow for the social welfare Bill to be introduced.  Is the Taoiseach seriously stating that a social welfare Bill, which for the first time since the time of Ernest Blythe will introduce reductions in social welfare, will be published some time on Wednesday evening or night at the earliest, with Second Stage debated on Thursday and all Stages completed on Friday?  That is utterly unacceptable as a parliamentary procedure and is unnecessary.  The only reason this is being done is because the Taoiseach and the Government think the backbenchers will be too cowardly and wobbly to face their constituents on this issue over the weekend.  They are being corralled here this week and will be made vote for this before they go home at the weekend so they will be able to tell constituents that no matter what they say about social welfare their hands are tied.When will the Bill dealing with public sector pay be published?  Will that Bill have any proposals or measures on public sector pensions?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	289	In response to the first matter, it is a question of ensuring that we enact legislation this week and next because of the time available to us.  We have to proceed on that basis.  We have to ensure that we give legal effect to the budgetary decisions being taken tomorrow.On the question on the public sector pay Bill, I made the point that the issue relates to public sector pay and public sector pensions is a separate issue to be dealt with at another time.

If we take a social welfare Bill on Thursday I want to know when it will be published.  Will it be published on Wednesday evening after the budget or will it be published on Thursday morning?  Will we see it before the Minister comes in to propose it?  When will the Bill dealing with public sector pay be published?  I want a specific time for its publication because we have only a very short sitting arrangement.  As a matter of courtesy we should be told when the Bills will be published.  We also have precedent for a period of time to be given after a Bill is published for people to consider it.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	328	Final Dáil approval is being sought for a series of Supplementary Estimates proposing net additional voted expenditure of €291.207 million in 2009.  Nine of these Estimates were originally introduced into the House on 25 November.  A subsequent technical Supplementary Estimate for the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs was moved on  1 December.  All of these Supplementary Estimates have since been fully debated by the relevant committees.  The majority of this additional expenditure relates to the justice group and the Health Service Executive and arises primarily from the higher than expected number of Garda retirements and a shortfall in health levy receipts coupled with other pressures in the health area.Supplementary Estimates totalling €69.2 million have already been approved this year in respect of Vote 7 — superannuation and retired allowances — arising from additional costs associated with the incentivised scheme for early retirement; Vote 14 — the Director of Public Prosecution — for fees to counsel; and Vote 12 — the Secret Service.  As a result, total Supplementary Estimates for 2009 amount to some €360.407 million, or just over 0.76% of total net voted expenditure outlined in the Revised Estimates Volume for 2009.Each of the Departments requesting funding has, however, made efforts to achieve offsetting savings. In fact, the majority of the Supplementary Estimates before the House are technical in nature and do not involve additional moneys being transferred to Departments, but rather allow them to use these savings to balance pressures elsewhere in the Vote.  Where additional moneys are required, they arise from exceptional circumstances which were unforeseen at the time the original expenditure allocations were voted upon by the House.  While the members of the individual committees may already be aware of the reasons behind the Supplementary Estimates in their respective areas, I will take this opportunity to outline the proposed Supplementary Estimates to the House somewhat greater detail.My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, gave details of the Supplementary Estimate for Health to the Select Committee on Health and Children on 2 December last.  A net Supplementary Estimate of €254 million for Vote 40 — the Health Service Executive — is being provided to fund the 2009 costs of €55 million arising from the swine flu pandemic; €73 million for increased superannuation costs; €70 million for pressures on demand-led schemes and to meet the costs of hospital services; and a net shortfall in receipts of €83 million.  Notwithstanding the serious difficulties facing the public finances, the Government is committed to providing the necessary additional resources to prevent the spread of the H1N1 virus.There has been a higher than anticipated level of retirements this year due to a higher number than usual of employees with sufficient service retiring, even if they have not reached the compulsory retirement age.  Payments in respect of these retirements have to be met this year.The shortfall in receipts largely arises in respect of the health levy with a shortfall of €102 million, due to the unemployment trend.  This is partially offset an increase of €37 million in respect of UK migrants.An additional €25 million capital is also being provided to fund priority mental health projects.  The funding is to help meet costs incurred for the commencement of the modernisation of mental health infrastructure in line with A Vision For Change.The technical Supplementary Estimate in respect of the Vote 41 — Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs — is necessary to allow payments to take place under the new early childhood care and education scheme in this year's supplementary budget.  The scheme comes into effect on 1 January and will provide free preschool education for young children.As already indicated by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the main driver of the increase relating to the justice Vote group is Garda retirements, which are overrunning by some €35 million in the current year.  Vote 20 — Garda Síochána — had funding to cater for approximately 400 retirements, which was deemed realistic given that the number of gardaí who retired in 2008 was 258.  The actual number of gardaí who have retired to date is in the region of 800, or twice that estimated in the original allocation.  I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law reform, that the reason for this dramatic increase appears to relate mainly to personal financial circumstances.  Another contributing factor was the raising, in 2006, of the compulsory retirement age for members up to and including inspector rank from 57 to 60 years of age.  This is now beginning to have an impact.I reiterate what the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said in his address to the relevant committee.  While the amount sought in additional Exchequer funding is €15 million, the balance of the additional cost of these retirements is to be funded in this Supplementary Estimate through the use of surplus receipts and the reallocation of savings in other areas from within the justice group.The technical Supplementary Estimate required for the Vote 19 — Justice, Equality and Law Reform — in order to bring the €12 million in surplus receipts above the line to meet overruns in the demand-led areas of criminal legal aid, the Irish naturalisation and immigration service and asylum accommodation.The technical Supplementary Estimate is required for Vote 22, the Courts Service, to meet the increased day to day running costs of the Courts Service, including translation, interpretation and stenograph expenditure.  While the Supplementary Estimate will result in an additional €6.8 million in surplus receipts being brought above the line, only €3.8 million of these surplus receipts will be used to meet the overrun on the courts Vote.  The remaining €3 million is being used to offset in part the cost to the Exchequer of the increased level of Garda retirements.The Department of Defence requires a Supplementary Estimate of €7.2 million for Vote 37, Army pensions.  This amount is needed as the number of personnel leaving the Defence Forces and qualifying for a gratuity and pension is higher than had been anticipated when compiling the original Estimate.  This trend is expected to continue to the end of the year requiring this additional allocation.A shortfall of €1.3 million is projected for appropriations-in-aid.  This arises from a requirement to refund pension contributions over-deducted from post-2004 enlisted personnel.  Expected savings of €1.3 million will fund this shortfall.  Regarding the technical Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Agricultural, Fisheries and Food, the principal measure is in the area of on-farm investments and the allocation of an additional €70 million to meet commitments under the farm waste management scheme.  The additional funding is being provided from savings in the Vote and additional appropriations-in-aid.The technical Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is required to enable payments from the temporary employment support scheme subhead in 2010 as it is a new service.  For the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, a technical Supplementary Estimate provides an additional amount of €2.38 million arising from a reconciliation exercise in respect of the receipts from the television licence fee and grants-in-aid paid to RTE, which found an imbalance dating back to 2000.  Television licence fee receipts are legally ring-fenced for public service broadcasting.  This additional payment will be met from savings within the Vote.  The grant-in-aid nature of the subhead means that a technical Supplementary Estimate is required in line with procedures laid down under public finance procedures.An additional €500,000 is required as a result of an increase in receipts for the petroleum infrastructure programme fund arising from an amendment to a frontier exploration licence.  Each company holding a frontier exploration licence is required to pay an annual subscription to the petroleum infrastructure programme fund, which is directed at funding offshore exploration related research.  These subscriptions are received in the Vote of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources as appropriations-in-aid and paid to the petroleum infrastructure programme fund from subhead E1.  Under the amended terms of the frontier exploration licence, the Department has secured an additional €7.5 million over four years for the petroleum infrastructure programme fund, of which €500,000 is payable in 2009.  A technical Supplementary Estimate is required in 2009 to facilitate the payment out of these additional funds to the petroleum infrastructure programme fund.The Department of Community Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, under Vote 27, requested sanction for the virement of savings on certain subheads to meet a projected overspend of €1.3 million on the advanced Irish language skills subhead.  As the projected additional expenditure would increase the original allocation in the subhead by approximately 137%, it is deemed prudent to proceed by way of a technical Supplementary Estimate.  Savings that emerged under the rural social scheme, €1 million, and the Ciste na Gaeilge allocation, €300,000, are being used to fund the required additional amount of €1.3 million.While Departments use savings achieved elsewhere to offset expenditure overruns where possible, the circumstances leading to the Supplementary Estimates before the House today could not have been foreseen during the framing of the 2009 expenditure allocations.  They are necessary for the continued smooth running of public services and when coupled with savings on other Votes there should be no overall addition to total net voted expenditure outlined in the Revised Estimates volume for 2009.  I commend the Supplementary Estimates to the House.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	329	I propose to share time with Deputy Michael Ring.This is the eve of the most significant budget in the short history of the country.  We are debating Estimates, some of which are revenue neutral, across a range of Departments.  The Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O'Dea, referred to a number of issues including Vote 30, dealing with the underpayment of €2.4 million to RTE in respect of licence fee receipts.  The Minister described this as a reconciliation exercise but it seems to have taken nine years.  My colleagues, including the Fine Gael spokesperson on this area, Deputy Simon Coveney, raised this matter at the Oireachtas committee meeting.  Why did it take nine years for this reconciliation exercise to take place?  This is listed as a debtor in the RTE accounts but the Exchequer accounts are done on a cash receipts and cash payments basis and this will have an impact of €2.4 million, affecting other areas of expenditure this year.  If there was a dispute with RTE about licence fees in respect of social welfare recipients, why did it take this length of time and why did we not pay this sum when we could afford it?  The Minister should clarify this.The Minister made reference to Votes 19, 20 and 22.  Vote 20 was altered to cater for approximately 400 retirements from the Garda Síochána.  That figure has now doubled to 800.  In the constituency the Minister shares with me, Limerick East, the number of inspectors has dropped from 11 in June of this year to five or six by the end of this month.  This is a major issue because it is important to retain people with a wealth of knowledge about fighting crime.  This applies throughout Ireland but I refer to Limerick because I am a Deputy for that constituency and the Minister has great knowledge about this and has spoken about the area.  What does the Government intend to do to ensure that we do not lose more front line staff, particularly in policing and the Department of Defence?The same group of Votes refers to a surplus of €12 million and relocating budgets to meet overruns in the demand-led areas of criminal legal aid and asylum accommodation.  Comparing the current year to last year, some €50,000 more is spent every day this year on asylum-seeker accommodation, on top of €40,000 per day more in respect of 2008.  What measures does the Minister propose to reduce the cost of asylum-seeker accommodation?  Leave to remain applications take up to seven years to process.  Fine Gael proposed a range of measures to deal with this issue and I ask the Minister to refer to them.The temporary employment subsidy scheme under Vote 34 was announced in the last budget.  It has not been successful and has not worked for employers who wanted to retain employees.  It was extremely restrictive because it applied only to export-led businesses.  I welcome the new scheme for which applications must be made by 23 December because it relaxes the criteria, but I am worried that it does not meet the requirements.  We, in Fine Gael, have put forward two schemes, a workshare scheme under which we would pay two thirds of any wages that employees would lose by working reduced hours, to ensure that employers can keep them in place, and an internship programme under which people could combine academic work with work experience.The various committees have discussed these Estimates at length.  Why did the reconciliation leading to the €2.4 million payment to RTE take nine years?  Why was it not paid during the good times rather than putting extreme pressure on other areas of expenditure in the current climate?  What plans are in place to ensure that we do not lose front line people at the rate we are losing them from the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces?  How does the Government expect the second phase of the temporary employment subsidy scheme to work?  Does it think that extending it beyond the export area will work?  We must ensure that when budgets are brought in, targets are reached.  How can the ordinary man understand why the €2.4 million settlement of the dispute between RTE and the Departments of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and Social and Family Affairs, for payments dating back to 1999, is being made now when every euro is needed in the economy?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	330	The savings of €1.29 million in the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs was taken out earlier in the year.  There was an embargo on people who came off the rural social scheme and were not let on but then were at the end of the year, which is fair enough.  That saved over €1 million which was used for the commitment to the Irish language, to put courses in place in the King's Inns and the Higher Education Authority.  It was also saved by not paying the Christmas bonus to people on the rural social scheme, which is outrageous.  People were depending on that funding this year but will not get it.What will happen at Templemore where I am told there are no new recruits although many people have retired this year?  In a few years' time we will have the problem we had a few years ago when the numbers were down.  Gardaí will be taken out of rural areas and put into the cities and rural areas will suffer again.  That worries me.  I hope the embargo on recruitment to the Garda will be lifted immediately.  We should at least keep recruits going into Templemore.  Not to have them is bad policy because we will need gardaí and people will continue to retire.  We will certainly need these recruits.  I hope the Government will make a decision to bring recruits into Templemore.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	331	People will not pay much attention to these Estimates in the context of what they fear will happen to them tomorrow.  It is interesting to consider the content of some of the Estimates, particularly for health which is one of the bigger ones, a large part of which covers changes because people are retiring early.  Is it true that most of those retiring are in the nursing grades and that only 16% are administrators, of whom everyone agrees there are far too many between the Department and the HSE?  Herein lies the problem.  We all agree, across the House, that front line services provided by nurses, doctors, teachers and gardaí are important to sustaining society and our public services.  These Estimates, however, show that these are the types of people who are leaving in large numbers because they feel extremely demoralised and fear what the future will bring if they stay on, and because their employer behaved with an unbelievable degree of incompetence in the recent negotiations.I am aware that in the run-up to the one-day strike there was a degree of intemperate media coverage which sought to make scapegoats of staff working in public services as though they were the enemy of every small businessman, enterprise and private sector worker in the country.  The Fianna Fáil backbenchers listened most to these attacks because many of them are the proprietors of small and medium-sized businesses and would naturally have that point of view, which is extremely hostile to the public service.  It is a pretty cheap shot to make public enemy number one not of the bankers and developers who ruined the economy, and those who fostered the climate of greed, but of the doctor, teacher, nurse, garda and the serving soldier, each of whom is being treated as something to be cleansed from our society.The private sector, like the public sector, has its good and bad points.  Nothing is ever as black and white as Fianna Fáil would like to portray it.  These Estimates show that the consequence of the budgetary decisions taken last year in the various emergency budgets and measures have resulted in a massive outflow of people from the public services.  It was also clear in the negotiations which failed last week that there was another large squad of people in each Department waiting to take up a similar position.  The mechanism which the public service unions had arrived at to find a bridging mechanism for 2010 with permanent savings through transformation thereafter would not have been like the fudge on benchmarking two.In 2000, public sector wages cost approximately €9 billion.  By this year they were up to €20 billion, largely because in a construction-driven boom while Charlie McCreevy was receiving lots of taxes he said, "When I have it I spend it".  Money was thrown around to anybody with his or her hand out, which drove the housing and property bubble, all of which has collapsed disastrously.While it may have seemed like a fabulous victory for the Lenihan wing, the neo-conservative view in Fianna Fáil, I suspect it will be a pyrrhic one because it is well worth fighting for the goal of a unified, efficient, reformed public service.What has been highlighted already is that, for example, in most Garda stations and Garda districts throughout the country, the most important, senior gardaí have retired not just in ordinary numbers or in double the ordinary numbers, but to a degree that has to be extremely worrying for anyone who represents a constituency like mine or like the Minister, Deputy Willie O'Dea's, where organised serious criminality among dedicated, professional groups of criminals and paramilitaries is a fact of life.What I fear is that the Government, as an employer, will now get the worst of all worlds from what has happened with the breakdown of negotiations.  Senior, required staff in front line positions are now heavily incentivised, from a morale point of view alone, to leave and just say: "I have had enough.  I am not going to deal with the fallout from this."  The consequences of this is to go down the MacSharry road with regard to what happened to our health services in 1987.  Leaving party politics out of it, everybody knows that while the MacSharry changes in 1987 achieved some good outcomes, they were a total disaster for the health services.  In fact, they continue to this day to be at the core of some of the problems in the health services, resulting in the crazy stuff last year where the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, offered consultants €240,000-plus a year on a consultant contract.  Of course, most older consultants have jumped at this because they can now retire relatively quickly on a highly enhanced pension that somebody who has worked in the ordinary Civil Service for many years could only ever dream about.  It has not quite brought them up to the level of judges but close to it.It is difficult, in reading these Estimates, not to feel that this is a Government in its twilight months.  All is chaos.  Norms in regard to negotiation have been disregarded.  Negotiation is always difficult and tough, and requires a lot of patience.  We are historically in a post-Bertie Ahern era.  He was perhaps too generous in negotiation, but he had the money to be generous and he decided to throw the money at it.  That was a tactic and, for him, politically and for getting Fianna Fáil election results, it worked.  That era is over.  Our economy is pretty close to broke.  The crazy part of what was done by the Government last week is that all of the parties in this House had agreed that the public pay bill needed to be cut, but that it could be done by agreement.  Amazingly, from time to time, people in Fianna Fáil have spoken about Tallaght-style strategies.  Here was a Tallaght-style strategy on offer, stating that if this could be done by negotiation, that was the way to do it.I recalled in this House two weeks ago the two key points in the Northern talks — nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, and then we all jump together.  Last week, we were on course for that kind of achievement.  Now, it lines in ruins around us and I do not think it can be renegotiated until there is a change of Government because the Government is now bankrupt in terms of being able to deliver change.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	332	I welcome the opportunity to address the Estimates of receipts and expenditures.  I do so more in hope than expectation because, unfortunately, the poor old Department of Finance has an atrocious record in terms of getting it right.  It has got it wrong for some considerable time.  In the good old days, it grossly underestimated the receipts and the opposite is the case since the downturn came.  While I admit it is a major challenge for anybody to forecast accurately, to continuously to get it as wrong as the Department has done is some achievement.I note the National Pensions Reserve Fund remains under some pressure.  Of course, €7 billion of funding was wasted in recapitalising AIB and Bank of Ireland.  This was a huge waste.  The money went into the banks to recapitalise them and the expectation we all had was that the banks would begin creating a revenue stream for SMEs, with which Members from all sides of the House agreed.  However, we are all hearing stories of viable businesses going to the wall because they simply cannot get enough funding to keep them turning over.  The banks have not freed up credit.  It would have been much better if the €7 billion, or at least a portion of it, had been put into a jobs stimulus package.  We would have had more value from that than from what has happened.Every Government measure seems to have depressed receipts.  The increase in VAT in the budget of October 2008, which I accept was relatively small in that it increased from 21% to 21.5%, had a massive psychological influence in that people began going North in significant numbers.  It is not just a coincidence that it is around this time that the exodus to the North commenced really seriously.  I hope the Minister will adopt at least one of the measures we put forward in our pre-budget submission, namely, a decrease in excise on alcohol for the Christmas period.  We hear figures today that some 48% of all off sales of alcohol consumed in this State are purchased in the North, which is scandalous.  If the Minister reduces the level of excise on alcohol for the Christmas period, I have little doubt that it will massively enhance the Exchequer take here.Alcohol is one of the key factors in people choosing to go North.  To give one example, on Sunday last a football club was doing a bag-packing process in Sainsburys in Newry.  One of the members of the club told me that three friends in their 20s from County Tipperary came through, saying they had heard of the prices in the North and decided to check them out.  The first man had STG£490 worth of alcohol in his trolley, the second had over STG£500 worth and the third had approximately STG£380 worth.  They had nothing else but alcohol — no other goods, sweets or confectionary of any kind.  The men said the reason they had bought this amount was that when they arrived, they texted home to their friends to tell them deals were available and they were asked to get them whatever they could get.Alcohol is one of the main motivating factors for people going North.  I hope the Government takes the opportunity tomorrow, in the budget speech, to announce that it will reduce excise.  It is not just about supermarkets, off licences or businesses along the Border corridor.  It is right down as far as Clare and Cork, and the example I have given is a midlands county.  We need to do something to stop the haemorrhage of business on one of the anchor products — alcohol.  I am not encouraging the use of alcohol by any means.  I am simply observing that we need to deal with this issue as alcohol is going to be consumed in any case, which we all know.  It is just a matter of dealing with it.  I hope that opportunity will be taken tomorrow.What I would like to see in any event — the Minister will not be surprised at this — is harmonisation of taxes across the island, which would stop the seesaw effect we get, for example, in regard to diesel and petrol, which people come here from the North to purchase.  There is no doubt the Border counties on the Southern side are enjoying something of a benefit in that regard.  I hope we can get a position of stability so that this seesawing does not happen.  It has closed all the Northern filling stations, but it is not that long since most of the Southern ones were closed.I note that capital gains tax and capital acquisition tax are expected to fall.  I have advocated in the Sinn Féin pre-budget submission that we increase the rate of capital gains tax from 20% to 40%.  These are wealth taxes — they are not productive taxes —  so there is no reason that we could not increase them from 25%, the current rate of capital acquisition tax.

Deputy Willie Penrose tried to raise the issue of the hospital in Mullingar under Standing Order 32.  I sympathise with him and his constituents because Louth County Hospital is about to lose all of its acute medical services to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, a hospital that does not have the capacity for those services.  This proposal will leave a catchment area with a population of more than 100,000 people without acute medical services, accident and emergency cover or intensive care services.  It is completely unacceptable.If we look at the Adjournment debate matters and matters raised under Standing Order 32, we can see how Members are continually pleading for school upgrades in most constituencies.  It is most unfortunate that the Government has not taken the opportunity to invest some funds from the National Pensions Reserve Fund in a school building programme.  That would kick-start the construction sector, get apprentices and tradesmen back off the dole and would give our children the opportunity to be educated in schools that are fit for purpose instead of in draughty, damp prefabs.  It is unacceptable that opportunity is not being taken.I hope that the Government collectively has listened to some of the voices on this side of the House because there is a cohesiveness on education and health.  Provision should be made to give the people of the State those services.  We cannot talk about a knowledge economy while failing to address these problems.  When there is no adequate IT provision in schools, we will not develop a knowledge economy any time soon.  If the Government is serious about this, it is time to deal with those issues and I hope it will do that.Unfortunately, there will probably be a further rise in unemployment, particularly among the under 23s.  There is not enough provision in the education system or jobs for them.  What will they do?  In many cases, unfortunately, they will be sent back to the emigration boat, a scenario from the 1980s.  That is regrettable, given we have had almost a decade of significant income streams to the Exchequer.   They were not used for proper, sustainable infrastructure, but spent willy-nilly so it is no wonder that we are in this difficulty.

Unfortunately, the figure has reached 800.  It is important to retain people who have knowledge but Garda promotions are still taking place and senior posts are being sanctioned and filled.  My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has made specific proposals that he has sent to the Department of Finance and I expect he will get a positive response.The position is the same for the Army.  I have received sanction for 50 promotions as a first instalment recently and those will be expanded on.  I have also been given permission to start to recruit to keep the numbers at about 10,000.

They are exercising their right to seek a judicial review.  The numbers have not increased but those who are there are spending longer in accommodation while pursuing their legal rights.Deputy O'Donnell said the temporary employment subsidy scheme is very restrictive and I agree.  There are two factors — the scheme must be flexible enough to work and it must be done within the terms of state aid rules.  We hope the new scheme will operate as intended.Deputy O'Donnell also mentioned the importance of reaching our target.  As I said, what we are providing for here, in total and including the earlier €69 million, is 0.75% of total net voted expenditure.  I can recall budgets in this House where Ministers came in for Supplementary Estimates on the eve of the budget that exceeded that amount.In the light of gardaí retiring, Deputy Ring made the point that it is important that gardaí are not moved from rural areas into cities.  I could not agree more; I am very conscious of this.  We have a phenomenon in my part of the country, and I am sure it is the same elsewhere, where people come out from cities and commit horrendous crimes against the rural population.Deputy Morgan made a suggestion about excise duty.  The Deputy will forgive me for not announcing parts of the budget in advance but he does not have long to wait to find out if his suggestion has been taken up.Deputy Morgan also asked about increasing capital gains tax from 20% to 40%.  I have news for the Deputy — it is no longer 20%.  We increased it to 25% and the returns have dropped catastrophically.  That trend would continue if we increased it to 40%.Deputy Burton asked about the identity of retirees from the Department of Health and Children.  I will have to get her the information on the different grades and the extent to which front line staff and administrative staff are involved.Deputy Burton's interpretation of what happened last week is totally and absolutely at variance with the facts.  I find it surprising to say the least.  I was in the House last week when the original deal with the unions was mooted and the biggest cries of protest came from the Labour Party.  Even when that deal has broken down and we are gone in the opposite direction, it is still protesting so we cannot win.Deputy Burton also referred to victory for the Lenihan wing of Fianna Fáil.  I am not aware there is any wings in Fianna Fáil.  I am aware though that whenever the Labour Party happens to be in office there are two wings, one on the backbenches and the other on the Front Bench.During the past year, the environment in which we operate has changed.  At a time when we are experiencing such severe economic and fiscal challenges, it is even more important that our public services are organised and delivered in the most efficient and cost-effective way possible.I commend the Supplementary Estimates to the House.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	354	I move:That, pursuant to Standing Order 172, Standing Order 127 is modified to permit an instruction to the committee to which the Communications Regulation (Premium Rate Services) Bill 2009 may be recommitted in respect of certain amendments, that it has the power to make provision in the Bill in relation to amending the Communications Regulation Act 2002, by amending section 52, section 53, section 55, section 56, section 60 in Part V of the Communications Regulation Act 2002 and any consequential amendments to any other sections in the Communications Regulation Act 2002 in order—to extend the provision to grant consent and set conditions for consent in section 53 of the Communications Regulation Act 2002 to the NRA, for all national roads; with local authorities retaining the consent-giving authority for local and regional roads;to update the provisions in relation to the consent procedure set out in section 53;to provide for the NRA to make a scheme to charge for the use by network operators of ducts on national roads provided by an authority;to amend the provisions concerning emergency roadworks;to amend the provisions in relation to cost apportionment for electronic communications infrastructure relocation due to road improvements;to provide for specific conditions in legislation that may be set by an authority, without prejudice to any other conditions they may also set;to update the provisions in dealing with regulations and policy directions to road authorities;to update the provisions on service of notices;to update definitions;to make any consequential amendments needed to take into account the changes above.The amendment I am introducing to this Bill relates to Part V of the Communications (Regulation Communications (Regulation) Act 2002.  Part V of that Act provides for local authorities to grant consent to telecom operators to open public roads for the establishment of underground communications infrastructure.  Under the 2002 Act, local authorities were the sole consent-giving authority in this regard for local, regional, national roads and motorways.The main purpose of this amendment is to designate the NRA as the consent-giving authority for national roads, which include motorways.  This is to facilitate the National Roads Authority making available its ducting on national roads, including motorways, to facilitate the roll-out of high speed fibre networks to the regions.  Much of the text in the amendment is very similar to the text of Part V of the Communications (Regulation) Act 2002.  Many of the textual amendments are to extend references to "an authority" to include the NRA as well as the local authorities.  This amendment also aims to balance the needs of telecom operators while also ensuring the safe operation of the road network.I will now set out the key changes that are being proposed.  First, the provision to grant consent and set conditions for consent in the 2002 Act is to be extended to the NRA for all national roads.  Local authorities will remain the consent-giving authority for local and regional roads.  Second, the proposed amendment will provide for the NRA to make a scheme whereby it can impose charges for the use by network operators of ducts on national roads provided by an authority.  This will be subject to the approval of the Minister of Transport following consultation with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Third, under the Communications (Regulation) Act 2002, consent is not required for emergency roadworks but a network operator is required to notify the authority as soon as practicable in advance of the commencement of the emergency roadworks.  The proposed amendment deems consent to be granted for emergency road works.  This is to facilitate rapid response by network operators to fix faults.  The amendment retains the current requirement for advance notification to the authority by the network operator but, unlike the existing 2002 Act, also allows conditions to be imposed by an authority during the progress and after the emergency roadworks.  This is to ensure that such roadworks are carried out having regard to the safety of all road users and that the road in question is not left in disrepair after the works are completed.Fourth, section 55 of the Communications (Regulation) 2002 Act deals with cost apportionment for relocating electronic communications infrastructure due to road improvements.  The 2002 Act provides that, where a road authority undertakes roadworks, it pays to a network operator all reasonable costs incurred by the operator in relocating its infrastructure.  It is proposed that this provision will be retained.However, it is intended to include a provision that the NRA will not incur any costs relating to the relocation of network operators' telecoms equipment in ducts on national roads that have been provided and made available by an authority.  Finally, it is proposed to provide for specific conditions in legislation that may be set by the local authority or the NRA without prejudice to any other conditions they may also set.  The specified conditions include any losses and liabilities that the road authority incurs from a third party, which are caused by any act undertaken by the network operator, can be passed on to network operators; in cases where ducting assets on national roads are provided, and made available, by an authority, to a network operator, the authority will not be liable to that network operator for any loss or damage howsoever caused to the electronic communications infrastructure unless it was caused by gross negligence or wilful neglect on the part of the authority; and the authority will be allowed have representatives present during works to supervise compliance.While there are other consequential minor textual amendments included, the changes I have outlined are the most significant.  I believe that these changes will greatly streamline the process for getting access to ducting running along national roads and motorways for telcos.  The proposed changes seek to strike a balance between the need to encourage and facilitate greater investment in broadband roll-out with the need to ensure that our road network is managed and operated in a manner that ensures the highest possible safety standards for all users.

My understanding is that we are debating the motion essentially to recommit this section of the legislation to committee so that we can discuss its contents.The Minister will be aware that although the parties opposite him are anxious to facilitate this legislation, we are far from happy about the way it is being brought forward.  Having said that, I want to use this opportunity to make some comments on the long amendment which, essentially, is a new piece of legislation that the Minister and his Department have chosen to add to what was the Communications Regulation (Premium Rate Services) Bill but is now becoming much more than that.I thank the officials in the Department for taking the time to brief me today, but, let us be clear, this is not the ideal way to do business.  My concern, for what it is worth, is that there is no opportunity for me to amend the new Bill because we are recommitting it to Committee Stage so that we can debate the amendment and there is no facility for the Opposition parties to amend the new Bill or the amendment, as is the case.  That is a problem because we are not doing our job, and we are not allowed do our job.  We put down an amendment on Committee Stage but we have not had an opportunity to amend what the Minister has tabled, which is a different amendment from the one rejected on Committee Stage because it was not seen as consistent with the legislation.The actual legislative process whereby the Minister and his Department puts legislation together and asks people like me and Deputy McManus to look at it, give our observations and make amendments as appropriate is not happening and cannot happen unless I am misreading something.  I do not see how we can do it between what is now a recommittal to Committee Stage and what will be Report Stage later because there is insufficient time to do that.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify that position for us but that is my reading of it.In terms of the substance of what the Minister is proposing, it is a significant improvement on what we have at present.  It is totally unsatisfactory that the NRA has ducting along all its motorways and much of its national roads so that it cannot allow access to roll-out fibre for broadband purposes across the country.The Minister's amendment changes the Bill significantly.  Instead of telcos, telephone companies, having to deal with local authorities when wishing to access road infrastructure or to dig up roads in order to install ducting for laying fibre, they will now deal with the NRA.  This is a welcome provision.  For a backbone piece of fibre infrastructure to be laid between Cork and Dublin, it would in the past have been necessary to deal with all the local authorities along the way and now there will be only one authority, the NRA.  I understand this legislation is to make a one-stop-shop available to telcos which will help streamline State-owned infrastructure in the laying of fibre or accessing ducting or sharing infrastructure and so on.  However, we do not know how the one-stop-shop will work.I ask the Minister to outline how long it will take to put the one-stop-shop concept into action.  We still do not know what it will look like, what its powers will be or whether it will just be an office along the lines of a citizens' information office where telcos can access information about the ducting regarding its location, ownership and management and contact names.  It could be that the one-stop-shop will do this work for them, but we do not know how that will work.  The House is passing legislation to allow the NRA to make its ducting available at a cost to telcos and we are asking it to take responsibility for the national roads network when negotiating with the telcos.  The absence of information sums up the unco-ordinated approach towards the roll-out of fibre in particular.I am pleased that the Minister plans to introduce a charging mechanism.  This Bill will allow the NRA for the first time to charge for the use of its ducting.  This is necessary but I would like to see much more co-ordination between all the State-owned ducting in the charge of the NRA as well as elsewhere so that when a privately-owned telco comes to Ireland or wants to expand its infrastructure, it is not forced to deal with a multiple of different State companies and agencies as is the case at present.  The NRA is yet another agency to add to that number.  It will allow for some progress on ducting on the roads network but it still adds to the myriad of different agencies with which telcos must deal.The Minister has dealt with the issue of emergency road works in a sensible manner.  On the question of who pays for the relocation costs associated with roadworks and the moving of ducting or fibre, the Minister has got the balance right.  However, when NRA-owned ducting is being rented for the purpose of laying fibre to a telco and if the ducting needs to be moved to accommodate roadworks, then the NRA should be obliged to cover the extra cost of moving that fibre as well as the moving of the infrastructure.  This is one area where the Minister should consider an amendment when the Bill goes to the Seanad.I will not vote against this new legislation because I recognise the need to ensure that infrastructure being paid for by taxpayers can be accessed by telcos and can improve the broadband backbone infrastructure in Ireland.  This is being facilitated in this Bill and is to be welcomed.I appeal to the Minister to get his one-stop-shop concept up and running.  We need to see how it will work.  This process should not be delayed further.  The Fine Gael approach is different from that of the Minister.  Under our approach, all State-owned broadband infrastructure would be under the ownership and management of one new State company which would market the asset.  There would be a web of infrastructure to facilitate the roll-out of fibre and other forms of broadband in a more co-ordinated way than is the case at present.  The Minister's alternative proposal is the concept of the one-stop-shop which is a less desirable approach, but it is better than what we have at present.If the NRA is to be involved in the broadband infrastructure area, then the one-stop-shop should be put in place to help it.  I question if the NRA has telco expertise and I suggest it has none.  I will return to this subject on Report Stage.  I understand the Minister will not be present for Report Stage this evening and that this is unavoidable.  However, I ask him to move ahead with his co-ordinating body which he has christened the one-stop-shop so that we can make life a lot easier for the companies wishing to spend money in Ireland by rolling out broadband infrastructure.

However, Deputy Coveney was the first speaker and he was given the copy so I regret that Deputy McManus did not receive a copy.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	359	I have just received a copy now.  I appreciate that Deputy Coveney would need to have a copy.  It is not good enough that Members have to come begging for copies of a Minister's speech.  I do not wish to labour the point but when the Minister is making his contribution, we should have a copy of what he is saying.  It is a reference for us and is useful, and it leads to a better debate.  This is so obvious that I am embarrassed to even mention it.  It really raises questions about how this Bill has been managed.We were dealing with a Bill to cover the ground relating to premium rate services and difficulties encountered with standards not being applied in that sector.  This is the subject matter of the Bill.  Regtel was to be abolished and amalgamated with ComReg and this was the focus of our attention.  In reply to a parliamentary question last week, the Minister made the point very clearly that he did not intend to introduce any amendment on Committee Stage but rather on Report Stage and relating to a matter that had absolutely nothing to do with premium rate services.  The Opposition supports the principle of the amendment but, as Deputy Coveney has pointed out, we do not have an opportunity to amend or put forward amendments to what the Minister is proposing.  We tried to be helpful by putting forward a Government-framed amendment on Committee Stage but it was ruled out of order as not being relevant to the Bill.  At least there is logic in that ruling, but this highlights the illogical approach taken by the Minister and it is very unsatisfactory.  It adds salt to the wound when, as Members, we are trying to catch up and do credit to the Bill and the changes in it, but we cannot have a copy of the Minister's speech.  I hope I have made my point.We want to see this type of development where the National Roads Authority will take on responsibility for enabling telcos to access ducts.  It makes sense to deal with one authority when a national primary route travels through several counties.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	360	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."I wish to share time with Deputies James Reilly and Fergus O'Dowd.I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording an opportunity in Private Members' time to move the Second Reading of this Bill, the purpose of which is to give the Comptroller and Auditor General the power to audit the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA.  The legislation is necessary in light of the exposure of bad practice, lack of corporate governance and financial impropriety which has taken place in the authority for much too long.  The important task of regeneration cannot be endangered by reckless financial management of a planning and development authority of the State.The Dublin Docklands Development Authority was established as a State body with a commercial remit.  It is interesting that the commercial aspect of its remit appears to have become secondary to the intrigue and bad practice that have taken place in recent years.Seven o'clock on the night before the most brutal budget in the history of the State is not a great time to register the full scandal of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  I am sure those who managed the authority into disgrace and insolvency are relying on that fact, hoping that it will be forgotten about as the nation tries to cope with the more personal pain tomorrow's budget will inflict.  I assure the House that, as Fine Gael Party spokesman on the environment, the people responsible for the activities and bad management that have taken in the Dublin Docklands Development Authority will be brought to book.  I will not allow them to hide behind circumstances, conceal their malfeasance behind complexity or take refuge behind the good work the authority has done in the area of social regeneration, education and community development.What my colleague, Deputy Leo Varadkar, revealed in respect of FÁS was monumental irresponsibility and spending without objective.  The indications are that a similar approach was taken in the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  Management in FÁS was so focused on its supposed entitlement to first class global travel that it failed to pay attention to the failure of the agency to deliver on its mandate.  What we see in the Dublin Docklands Development Authority is arguably worse.  A dream was destroyed as the property development arm of the authority went out of control.  This dream was to take a chunk of derelict Dublin, revive and reinterpret it and turn it into a world class riverside amenity and business district which would attract people back into the city and create employment, educational possibilities and a new skyline for the city.  The dream turned into a nightmare as it was sacrificed to the irrational greed of a few developers and financiers who regarded the Dublin Docklands Development Authority as the ultimate soft touch, which it proved to be.Depending on one's point of view, the best or worst example of how the Dublin Docklands Development Authority went completely off the rails was its involvement in the Irish Glass Bottle site in the Poolbeg Peninsula.  The authority entered a partnership with two private property developers, Mr. Bernard McNamara and Mr. Derek Quinlan, to form a joint venture company to purchase the Irish Glass Bottle site.  We have learned from documents I sourced using the Freedom of Information Act that in October 2006 the chief executive of the DDDA informed his board that Mr. Bernard McNamara was about to make a bid for the Irish Glass Bottle site in Poolbeg.  Mr. McNamara said he would be happy to accept the DDDA as joint venture partner.  Why would he not be happy given that it was the local planning authority of the area?  This version of events is disputed in the courts by Mr. McNamara who alleges that Mr. Paul Moloney, the then chief executive of the authority, approached him.  Why would Mr. Moloney make such an approach?  The only conclusion I can reach is that he did so at the suggestion of members of the board who had a vested interest in the matter or because he wanted to play with the big boys and did not want to be left out during a period when many people were making gains from the Celtic tiger.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	362	I am stating the facts as they occurred.  I will, however, take account of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's remark.The difference between the purchase of the glass bottle site and previous cases in which the Dublin Docklands Development Authority bought property is that other private developers planned to purchase the site.  As the local planning authority, why would the DDDA want to enter a joint venture with a property development company at the height of the Celtic tiger?  This key question has not been properly answered.  When she appeared before the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government last week, the new chairperson of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, Professor Niamh Brennan, could not give a satisfactory explanation as to the objectives or reasons that would propel the authority to become involved in this project at a time when property values were high and many people were interested in getting involved in property.  I hope the Minister will indicate that he plans to provide an answer to this key question.The Irish Glass Bottle site was sold by tender in October 2006.  The site was bought for €412 million or €17.2 million per acre, a phenomenal price which broke previous records.  An additional sum of between €50 million and €90 million was set aside for remedial work, including demolition and decontamination.  Board meeting minutes acquired by the Fine Gael Party show the former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Dick Roche, signed off on increasing the authority's borrowing limit to facilitate the deal and sanctioned the acquisition of shares in the joint venture company.  It is interesting that last week Professor Brennan was a little unsure about the role of the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Finance in signing off on these matters.Many questions remain to be answered about the Government's role in this disastrous deal.  I ask the Minister to assure the House that he is anxious to resolve these matters and that he will be up front on what has occurred and what he proposes to do about it.  I expect him to support this legislation as, rather than providing an opportunity to delay decisions, it will enable the House to ensure another quango is subject to legitimate accountability in response to recent revelations that a State body with a commercial remit has suffered massive losses and a massive shortfall in the moneys accruing to it.The value of the Irish Glass Bottle site has declined from €412 million to €50 million.  Even using the questionable valuation of longer economic value applied by the National Asset Management Agency, the site is still only valued at €62.5 million.  The use of NAMA valuations for properties held by the State is a practice with which I disagree.  Will this methodology be used to value local authority lands, IDA Ireland property and other State properties for the annual reports which will come before the House?  The Government must provide clarity on whether State agencies can value property based on its long-term economic value rather than current market value.  The Minister has strong views on this matter and must assert himself.It is obvious that the decision to get involved with private property developers using Anglo Irish Bank finance to purchase a greatly overpriced site has backfired spectacularly.  The Dublin Docklands Development Authority has posted an operating loss of €27.1 million for 2008 with a final deficit of €213 million as a result of massive write-downs on its property.  How did the DDDA get into such a position?  Was it a soft touch for developers?  It was certainly a soft touch for the boys in Anglo Irish Bank, the most prestigious financial club in town.  The bank populated the board of the authority and ran it as if it was the riverside branch of its operations and a part of its personal fiefdom.  The authority became the playground of Anglo Irish Bank personnel.  Those appointed to the DDDA board had to be the right people for the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and Anglo Irish Bank.Fianna Fáil populated the board of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority with Anglo Irish Bank officials for years.  It was chaired by Mr. Lar Bradshaw, who served for a ten-year term until May 2007.  He was replaced by Mr. Donal O'Connor, formally managing partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers.  Mr. O'Connor resigned when he was appointed to the chair of Anglo Irish Bank in December 2008.  Mr. O'Connor's predecessor as chairman, Mr. Seánie FitzPatrick, was also a board member of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority from 2002.  The board did not follow best practice rules for conflict of interest and we have established as much.  Far from it.  The Anglo Irish Bank board members took part in the special board meeting at which final approval of the purchase of the Irish Glass Bottle site was debated.  They gave full blessing to a deal that used their bank's finance to purchase land that broke all price records.  However, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority insisted there was no conflict of interest.  The chief executive must have known this would become an issue because other board members were still concerned about a perception of conflict of interest and we have the minutes to show this.The role of Anglo Irish Bank in the Dublin Docklands Development Authority corrupted its original goal.  Anything the Anglo Irish Bank boys wanted was theirs and it was as simple as that.  They sought the Dublin Docklands Development Authority as a partner in a vast development and this is no surprise because of its planning function.  The discussions surrounding the purchase of the site were between the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, Anglo Irish Bank, Mr. McNamara and Mr. Quinlan on the basis of the density of housing and commercial development on the site.  It was up to them to decide on that.  A State body put most of its time, expertise and money at the disposal of Anglo Irish Bank.  When the Anglo boys said "Jump", the only question put was "How high?".  The end result was gross, outrageous overspending and bad and doubtful debts which have contributed to a deficit of almost €213 million in the overall accounts.The new chairperson of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, Professor Niamh Brennan, was understating the situation somewhat when she remarked during the recent meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that Anglo Irish Bank carried out very extensive work with developers and, as a result, its relationship with developers led to the authority having a pro-developer position.  She further remarked that the association between Anglo Irish Bank and the Dublin Docklands Development Authority has not served the authority well.  She was perfectly correct.  It is obvious that having Anglo Irish Bank officials involved in approving questionable investment decisions by the authority using Anglo Irish Bank financing was a completely unacceptable situation.  The end result is a sense of community betrayal and baffling questions for the public as it watched the cranes cease to move over the half-built headquarters and as it absorbed the news that the U2 tower was never going to materialise.As early last December, the authority examined all its programmes to establish how much could be cut because of the activities of the executive and the board of the authority.  All community programmes on education, social housing and integration were considered for a budget cut.  No one called for responsibility to be taken by those already on the board who made these decisions.  No one in the organisation was approached for the purposes of retrieving some of the money for the irresponsible actions and decisions made.  The only people to suffer will be the little people, those who required the benefits for which the organisation was established such as employment, education, community development and social housing facilitates.  Funding for all such programmes was cut.  The chairperson has now informed us that all discretionary expenditure is being cut and that it will have to move back to the old premises.  I can only image how shell-shocked the local residents of the docklands are as a result.  The question to which we must get an answer is simple: what the hell has been going on in Dublin Docklands Development Authority?I understand the Minister and Professor Brennan have commissioned two reports, which is welcome.  I trust they will produce some clarity about the financial dealings and the corporate governance issues.  The Anglo Irish Bank personnel who were intricately involved with the authority have been playing charades throughout the years.  It was a case of Lanigan's Ball and "I step in, you step out again".  Any time a decision was to be made by the board that involved favouring one of the Anglo Irish Bank boys' pet customers, they received preferential treatment.The Dublin Docklands Development Authority boys played dumb.  They were as dumb as trees and as thick as planks.  A perfect example is the case of Becbay, a consortium the Dublin Docklands Development Authority management was central in forming and it now owns somewhat greater than one quarter of the stake.  One might question why such people as Mr. Bernard McNamara and Mr. Derek Quinlan would need the Dublin Docklands Development Authority as a partner.  It was not simply for planning issues.  The authority had no track record in such partnerships.  It was easy fodder for the developers who gained a partner which provided an inside track on planning matters and the State.Recently, it has been brought to our attention that the Dublin Docklands Development Authority provided a €43 million soft loan to Becbay to develop the Irish Glass Bottle site.  It was an interest free, long-term and unsecured loan.  We would all be delighted to have access to such facilities whether for personal or corporate uses.  However, this is an example of a situation in which there was no regulation.  There was no transparency or accountability and everything was out of control.  That is why we seek the introduction of this legislation as soon as possible.  This Fine Gael Bill should be agreed as soon as possible to get to grips with matters of accountability and such that probing by the Comptroller and Auditor General will get to the root of why certain decisions were made, how they were made and what was behind those decisions in respect of a small number of individuals and which has, ultimately, led to the taxpayer being ripped off.Even before the stripes fell off the Celtic tiger, it was not easy to secure such a loan from anyone to do anything.  The DDDA loan was subordinated to the loans of the secured lenders to Becbay, with the result that the authority was assuming a greater risk in lending to the firm than the bankers to the project.  What great people those on the board of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority were.  They took an even greater risk than the banks which, as we are aware, took many risks at the time.It is no wonder people are outraged at the decisions taken by the management on the issues sanctioned by the board.  However, from the picture I have painted this evening, it is possible to see there is good reason that key individuals and players at board and senior executive level were in cahoots to ensure that they were part of the action.  The €43 million has now been written off, according to notes to the accounts of the authority published recently.  The authority also guaranteed €29 million of Becbay's bank borrowings, plus a 26% share of any interest on its loans, for the full term of those loans, representing another albatross around the neck of the taxpayer who will, ultimately, have to pick up the tab through the Minister.As the stripes were peeling off the Celtic tiger, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority was so eager to get involved with Quinlan and McNamara and it willingly subordinated its money to the loans made by the banks to the same project.At a time when anybody with two brain cells could see that the so-called soft landing, to which the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen, often referred, would come sooner rather than later, the chief executive officer of the DDDA effectively informed Mr. Quinlan and Mr. McNamara that they could count on the authority for €43 million, not to worry about paying it back, to take their time in doing so, that there was no hurry and not to even consider paying interest.It remains for the Minister to make several decisions tomorrow.  A good deal of money has been wasted by irresponsible behaviour despite the purpose of the authority to work for the people that the Minister, everyone else in the House and I try to represent and help.  The last thing we seek is for the people who made these decisions to get away scot free, as has happened on many occasions in the past.  The board members throughout the years, some of whom I have referred to tonight, should be brought before the relevant organisations and accountable structures, even if it involves the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, to account for their stewardship and for the irresponsible decision making carried out in our name.The Dublin Docklands Development Authority approach was like a mad version of the housekeeper in "Father Ted", who used to say "Ah, go on, go on, go on".  However, they will not pay it back.

There will be a situation in which the Dublin Docklands Development Authority and its debts will be written off and will go down the tubes.  It will be a very sad day for anyone in the Houses of the Oireachtas to have to report this for an organisation established with the noble objectives of reviving and regenerating an area of the city that needed it.  All we have witnessed is the big boys with their vested interests getting away scot free with taxpayers' money.  I call on the Minister to change this and to give a solemn commitment to the House that this will not take place.  The Dublin Docklands Development Authority was so attractive to developers because, apart from the soft loans available, it had access to planning permission.There is, of course, the small matter of €5.5 million of expenditure on lawyers by the DDDA.  I note a significant increase in legal expenses in recent years in the accounts, especially from 2005 onwards.  The reasons for that have never been explained.  Perhaps the Minister can explain the legal and other expenses that have accrued into massive amounts that shot up exponentially in recent years to a far greater extent than should have been the case.  There must be a reason for that.  In addition, litigation must be taking place behind the scenes that has not been held to account by this House.  That expenditure resulted from people going to court who did not get planning permission or promises of securement fulfilled.I understand Mr. McNamara is going to court tomorrow to resume his case against the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  The Davy nominees are going to court with Mr. McNamara.  I have come to the conclusion that it is a case either of thieves falling out with each other over the manner in which the docklands area was ravaged, with the taxpayer picking up the tab, or there are genuine reasons for people going to court in order to get their legitimate agreements enforced.  This issue smells.  As I described it last week, it is a financial septic tank at this stage.  Unfortunately, the players are bringing the entire area of financial probity into disrepute.  I do not wish the Minister to be part of that.Davy's is suing Mr. McNamara because of the guarantees that were given by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  Anglo Irish Bank and AIB provided the bulk of the funding for the Irish Glass Bottle site.  Anglo Irish Bank, whose board members included Mr. FitzPatrick and Mr. Bradshaw, was on the board of the authority until April 2007.  The former CEO was always pointing out that the Dublin Docklands Development Authority was no charge on the taxpayer.  That was what we thought until we received the 2008 annual report, which was presented last week, and we learned of a €27 million black hole in the accounts.  Let us be in no doubt, every cent of that money will be a cost to the State and to the taxpayer.  I want people to be held to account.It is also interesting that the majority of debt from the State body is owed to another State body, Anglo Irish Bank, which will soon transfer the bad debts onto another State body, the National Asset Management Agency.  That has been the legacy of poor governance, especially under Fianna Fáil, a circle of bad debt all owned by the Government and paid off by the taxpayer.Let us park all that bad news for a moment and move on to other news.  One of the best bits of news was the appointment of Professor Brennan as chairman of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  I support her appointment fully.  As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, I had the opportunity, along with other committee members, to question her for more than two hours on her stewardship of the authority to date.  She should be given every support by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department, whose officials were asleep at the wheel, as the Department was represented on the board of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  The Minister should be inquiring whether the officials were doing something to bring those matters to the attention of the Minister of the day, and if they were being overruled.  I do not believe any official of the Department or of this House would sit on a board where those questionable decisions were being made without bringing the reports to the attention of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government of the day.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate whether they were being overruled.Professor Brennan has given us an opportunity to look behind the scenes on some of the issues that are questionable.  I wish to refer to the U2 tower.  An architectural competition was held and it was won by a company called BCDH, composed of talented young architects.  When Mr. Maloney took over as CEO of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, he also took over the U2 tower project as his own.  He hired his old friends from Dublin City Council within a matter of weeks.  He visited London on a number of occasions to view comparable towers.  He went to the market for a firm of contractors to build the U2 tower.  Significantly, the procurement document he crafted stated that when they were putting in their bid, the contractors could, if they wanted, come up with a new design, their own design, for the tower.  How much of an inside track did Mr. Seán Mulryan have with the former CEO when his company, Geranger Limited, won the contract?I also wish to know the sequence of actions the CEO took to redress the situation for the young architects who had legitimately won the contest, and why it ended up in arbitration, costing the Dublin Docklands Development Authority money as well.  Who were the Davy stockbrokers that were nominated shareholders on the Irish Glass Bottle site?  Professor Brennan could not answer the question the other day, but I would like the Minister to give an assurance that none of the board members of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority was involved as shareholders, stakeholders or property owners of the Irish Glass Bottle site or any other site without declaring an interest.Those are the issues that confront the Oireachtas tonight and tomorrow when we will vote on the Bill.  It is for that reason that Fine Gael is proposing an amendment to the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act to provide improved auditing and greater accountability in terms of the manner in which that site has been hammered into the ground.  I hope the Minister has been listening carefully and that he will be able to reassure me on how those issues were dealt with and that he is prepared to do something about it.

He was correct to say that the aspirations behind the setting up of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority were noble.  The same is true in terms of fast-tracking the planning process and attempting to ensure that land which hitherto was undeveloped would be developed in a proper manner and that people who won contracts to build fabulous buildings on those sites or adjoining them would provide jobs, interest and lots of good things.  The only thing missing in the formula was accountability, which goes to the heart of the Bill.What Deputy Hogan outlined is that the heart of that organisation and other organisations set up by the State on a semi-State basis must be accountable to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That means they must come before the Committee of Public Accounts and be questioned.  It is certain that this process will take place and once it does not happen, as it did not in this case — it never will unless our Bill is passed — we will never get true accountability no matter what Professor Brennan does.  If the strong arm of the law of the State in examining and considering the affairs of companies such as the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, namely, the Comptroller and Auditor General, is not part of the State or semi-State process, it is doomed to failure and to create waste.I am appalled at the waste of money and the litany of abuse and possibly corruption that seems to be at the heart of what Deputy Hogan has outlined.  I accept and acknowledge that the Minister will take the matter seriously, but he has to take it seriously enough.  It is not good enough to say "Yes", he has to say what he will do about it, when he will act to tackle the Dublin Docklands Development Authority and other bodies such as CIE, a large quango that gets a subsidy of €323 million per annum to run its organisation.  When CIE refused to give members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport a copy of an audited report that identified serious abuses in a section of its organisation——

The Minister is a member of the Government and I refer to holding him accountable in that context.  CIE will not reveal the full facts about the report.  It has refused to give the report to me and others.  To date, it has not provided the Minister with the report either.  We are trying to make CIE accountable.  The intention of the Bill is to make the Dublin Docklands Development Authority accountable, but we need to make other quangos, such as CIE, accountable as well.  That is not to say there are not fabulous, good people working in such bodies; of course there are, but there are significant abuses which have been uncovered by CIE's own auditors which it will not allow us to see.In terms of port authorities, the Minister could do worse than ask his colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, to consider the second largest port in the country, the Shannon Foynes Port Company and the issues that arose in that regard.  The best site in Foynes, 16.6 acres of land, was sold in 2002 to a company for a little more than €2 million.  What was wrong with that?  There was a hell of a lot wrong with it because there was no public auction for the land, no tendering process and no administrative powers were given to the chief executive at that time to carry out those inquiries, investigations or procedures with that company.  The company which bought the site, which was sold by the taxpayer for €2 million, paid more than €12 million for it three years later.  There are records of its interest in that site in 2004 and yet the port company did not hold a public tendering process.  A report by Deloitte points out that serious and significant issues arise from that.  Some people in Foynes believe there was corruption at the heart of what happened there and it is unacceptable to them.Also in Foynes, an arrangement was made——

The Dublin Docklands Development Authority (Amendment) Bill 2009 provides for accountability in the docklands area and for what is going on in a company which is run by the State and paid for by the taxpayer but which is not accountable to the Comptroller and Auditor General.An employee of the port company in Foynes accepted a tender from himself and his good wife for more than €100,000 for a boat which nobody wanted.  It was amazing what went on there.  We want an inquiry into that.  The people are fed up with all this abuse.  We want the Garda to carry out an inquiry and if it needs to go into the DDDA as well, that is where it should be.At the heart of the political system are quangos which are not accountable to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  In the absence of accountability in cases like those about which we are talking, one has significant and unacceptable abuses.  I hope the principle of this Bill will apply to other companies such as Foynes and other harbour authorities which are not accountable to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We need to take a much more investigative and proactive approach to what is going on and to how taxpayers' money is being wasted in a disgraceful, shameful and unaccountable manner.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	370	The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has always shown great interest in the management of waste.  This is about waste.  Deputies O'Dowd and Hogan spoke about the aspirations of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority to develop the docklands area and to have the dual objective of promoting balanced community development through the use of sponsorships, social support, etc.  What is the DDDA now?  It is an extraordinary quango for the golden circle.  Names have been mentioned and they will be mentioned again because they keep turning up.For a long time in this country, there has been a sense of the elite, the untouchables and the inside track and this problem with which we are faced confirms that.  A site bought for €412 million may now be worth €50 million which is a loss of more than €300 million.  That is extraordinary, in particular on the night before one of the most hard-hitting budgets the country will ever have had, or may ever have, to endure.  This afternoon the Taoiseach said there was not 10%, or €2 billion, fraud in our social welfare system.  He said everyone one this side of the House would accuse everyone on social welfare of being fraudulent.  Nothing could be further from the truth but we all know there is abuse.  A programme on television last night showed that quite clearly.  The level of that abuse will be very difficult to assess unless there is clarity surrounding PPS numbers.  Until we have clarity, there will be difficulties in that area.  That has been due for 11 years but nothing has happened.  However, I do not want to digress down that road.I wish to talk about the Dublin Docklands Development Authority and the cosy relationships between people on the board of that authority, the board of Anglo Irish Bank and well known developers.  As has been pointed out, any developer would give his or her right arm to be in the same room as the people who give out planning permissions.  It was a nonsensical arrangement and there were so many conflicts of interest that it beggared belief.  It is worth mentioning again that Mr. Bradshaw and Mr. FitzPatrick resigned from Anglo Irish Bank in December 2008 as they both had joint loans which had been transferred to Irish Nationwide Building Society at year end so as not to appear on the bank's published accounts.This country is in a state of stasis and crisis.  People have lost faith.  This Government has managed, through its inept leadership, to turn the public sector against the private sector and to create situations on television where public and private workers are fighting with each other.  That is not the way this country was before and it is not the sort of leadership we need.  We need a leadership which unites us in our difficulties and helps us face them together.The ordinary worker on €15,000 per year was hit with a pension levy of 1% and yet a man who destroyed his own bank and the banking system of the country walks off somewhere to play golf on €500,000 per year.  These are the sorts of issues that cause social unrest.  If they are not addressed and if we do not put in place proper regulation and proper legislation, which is what this Bill attempts to do, then I fear for the future of this country.  The ordinary man or woman on the street is no longer prepared to put up with this.  They will take the pain if they know we will all share in the gain at the other end and if we all share the pain together.  However, this episode shows us this is not the case.  It is one rule for the ordinary citizen and it is another one for the elite, the golden circle and the well connected cronies of mainly Fianna Fáil.CIE was mentioned and I refer to the HSE and all the waste which occurs there.  Five years ago, were premises in Lusk purchased by the HSE for €1.7 million but it lies boarded up because somebody did not do his or her homework and realise it would not get fire safety certificates.  How much has that cost?  What could we have had for that money?  Let us make it real for people.When people hear about hundreds of millions of euro, they think it is Monopoly money and that it is a disgrace.  However, it is money which could have paid for the cervical cancer vaccine for children and could have started the colorectal cancer screening service.  That alone could have saved 400 lives per year.  It could have built the cystic fibrosis unit in St. Vincent's Hospital for which we have fought so hard and so long.  It could have put in place the psychiatric unit in Beaumont Hospital for which planning was received in 2004 and which has been put on the back burner again because of private co-location, which the Minister, Deputy Gormley, opposed when on this side of the House and which he is now allowing to happen.  Some 23 women in one ward and 23 men in another with 2 ft. between their beds share a bank of three toilets and two showers.One year ago I raised the issue of an unemployment exchange for people who were facing their first Christmas unemployed and who are now facing their second Christmas unemployed.  There is still no exchange in Balbriggan and Swords which are proper and fit premises.  Balbriggan is the eighth worst area for unemployment in the country with an increase of 282% on last year.   We could have had a secondary schools in Lusk and various other places.The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is being afforded an opportunity by Deputy Hogan and Fine Gael to put in place legislation which will tackle all quangos, not only this one.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is the regulator which stands head and shoulders above all others in this country in its ability to do the right thing by the public and seek out waste.  It does so without fear or favour.  I commend the Bill to the House.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	371	The Bill that Deputy Hogan now proposes, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority (Amendment) Bill 2009, has a number of objectives.  They are to bring the authority within the audit remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General; to allow the Comptroller and Auditor General undertake special reports into the authority's operations; and to require its CEO to come before the Committee of Public Accounts to report on the authority's accounts or on any special report undertaken by the Comptroller and Auditor General.The Dublin Docklands Development Authority, like all State bodies, must apply the highest standards of corporate governance and financial management and must be accountable to the appropriate oversight authority on these matters.  There is no disagreement between me and Deputy Hogan on that basic principle.  However, we may disagree on whether the Comptroller and Auditor General is the most appropriate oversight authority and, if so, the timing of any decision to bring the authority within the audit remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General.I have stated as  recently as 24 November in response to questions raised by the Deputy in the House that I will keep the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General in auditing the authority under review.  I am not yet ready, for reasons which I will outline, to take a final decision on this matter.  I cannot accept the provisions of the Bill at this stage.The 1997 Act establishing the Dublin Docklands Development Authority sets out the basis on which the authority is to be funded, including arrangements for it to raise borrowings and the mechanisms by which it is to manage its financial affairs, including how its accounts are to be audited.  The authority's accounts are subject to a full and detailed audit by its independent external auditors, KPMG.  In accordance with the requirements of the Act, the annual report and accounts of the authority are laid before each House of the Oireachtas.The State's code of corporate governance, which was most recently updated this year, sets out the governance arrangements that should be applied by the authority in the conduct of its business.  It deals with matters such as the avoidance of conflict of interest, adherence to proper procurement practices, participation in joint ventures and acquisition of shares by a State body, the preparation of corporate and strategic plans, and the appropriate reporting arrangement for annual reports and accounts.A somewhat unique approach in the docklands and a key element of its success has been the collaborative and partnership arrangement that exists through its advisory council.  The authority is structured in such a way that ensures that public consultation is ingrained in its operation through the 25-member representative council and various consultative fora.  The members of the council come from a range of different backgrounds and political parties.  The council adopts the master plan for the authority, which is the blueprint for how the authority determines priorities and plans its business.  This working model is now regarded as best practice in both a national and international context.The final piece of the existing oversight arrangements is the facility for the Oireachtas, through the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to question the authority on its financial position and other relevant issues.  I was somewhat surprised to find that one week after the Deputy led the questioning of the dockland authority's chair and acting CEO before the Oireachtas joint committee for over three hours, we now have a Bill before the House proposing to transfer responsibility for Oireachtas oversight of the authority from the Deputy's committee to the Committee of Public Accounts.

The committee should be commended on its questioning, which is extremely important.  I will elaborate on that later.Any useful discussion of the performance of the authority has to benchmark what it has achieved when compared to the role assigned to it by its founding legislation.  The authority was established in 1997 to secure the social and economic regeneration of the docklands area.  In general terms, the authority is a commercial semi-State body, financed entirely from its own resources, which are generated through the acquisition, development and sale of property in the docklands area.Since 1997, the authority has delivered substantially on its statutory duty to regenerate the Dublin docklands area.  Over the past ten years, it has completed a wide range of projects and initiatives addressing education, employment, community development and housing.  The area has been transformed into a vibrant, sustainable and integrated community at the heart of our capital city.  The docklands project is valued not just nationally but is recognised as one of only a small number of best practice models for inner-city regeneration across Europe and beyond.Nobody can dispute the physical transformation that has taken place in docklands.  Projects such as the IFSC, the O2, Grand Canal Square, the Liebskind Theatre, the National Conference Centre and the Sean O’Casey and Samuel Beckett bridges all demonstrate the scale and quality of the transformation in the docklands.  Today we see the opening of the Luas extension through the docklands from Connolly Station to the O2.  That is a remarkable achievement in a short space of time.Since its inception in 1997, the authority has generally been self-financing and has maintained a healthy financial position while undertaking new property acquisitions and investing in and facilitating key infrastructure in the docklands.  Over the past year or two, however, the collapse in international financial and property markets has created serious financial challenges for the authority.  The resulting impairment in the value of its property interests and the slowdown in commercial activity have had very serious consequences for the authority's financial standing.  The year 2008 saw accumulated losses of €213 million for the year, including a loss on operations of €27 million, and very significant write-downs on its property assets, including its investment in the Irish Glass Bottle site in Ringsend.These impairment losses are based on valuations of the authority's property portfolio.  The authority acknowledges that these valuations are extremely prudent and are based on the extreme market realities that prevail at present, accepted as being the most difficult trading environment for many years.  The net result of these devaluations has been a reduction in the authority's own net assets from €177 million in 2007 to €26 million in 2008.I understand that the chair of the authority outlined to the Oireachtas committee last Tuesday how the authority has responded aggressively and urgently to its financial position.  Measures include all overheads being carefully monitored and reduced where possible; discretionary spending being cut significantly; and staff numbers being reduced significantly as fixed-term contracts expire.  The authority's operating deficit has already narrowed significantly during the current year and the chair expects the deficit will be reduced from its 2008 level of €27 million to less than €10 million by the end of 2009.  This process of recovery is expected to continue next year and the authority is aiming to return to a break-even position in 2011 on its operating costs.The political and public concern regarding the financial position of the authority, as well as concerns about its property investments and standards of corporate governance, are understandable.  I am very concerned about the decisions it took in recent years which left it exposed financially and cast a cloud over its reputation.  The authority took its eye off its fundamental objective, the social regeneration of the docklands area.Much excellent work has been done in this area over the past ten years.  More than 3,000 new residential units have been approved, including over 800 social and affordable housing units.  Almost €16 million has been spent on social regeneration.  The authority's education programmes in the docklands have been an outstanding success.  The percentage of docklanders leaving school before the age of 12 has fallen from 35% to 13%; those leaving before age 15 have fallen from 65% to 30%; the numbers of locals sitting the leaving certificate have risen from 10% to 60%; and those participating in third-level education has risen from 1% to 10%.  The future focus of the authority, while not losing sight of its economic role, must be on its key regeneration functions.The work of the DDDA can only continue if it adopts an open and transparent approach to how it conducts its business.  It must restore the confidence of its key stakeholders — the local communities in the docklands, those who work there and the public.  My appointment of Professor Niamh Brennan as chairman of the authority in March this year was aimed at bringing her reputation and expertise in corporate governance to bear in setting the authority on the right path again.  I am grateful to her for her leadership of the organisation in the most difficult period in its short history.Deputy Hogan raised concerns about corporate governance in the authority and he pursued this matter vigorously at a meeting of the Oireachtas joint committee last week.  The Deputy is correct to pose these questions.  Professor Brennan dealt openly last week with what she termed the "systematic conflict of interest which occurred at the docklands authority in the middle years of this decade".  I requested her some time back to undertake a comprehensive review of corporate governance within the authority and two reports examining its finance operations and its planning functions were subsequently commissioned by the authority.  Professor Brennan indicated to the committee last week that the reports will be to the same exacting standards as any similar report undertaken by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The reports will leave no stone unturned.  I am anxious to get to the truth and I hope we can do that.  I agree with the chairman's statement to the committee last week.  I expect both reports to be finalised shortly.  Once I have received and considered them, I will quickly consult the Government on the necessary set of responses.Even at this stage, the authority has implemented several procedural changes aimed at improving corporate governance.  These include reducing the expenditure limit requiring board approval; preparation of a central procedures manual for the authority; the introduction of more formal strategic and corporate planning processes on an annual basis by the end of 2009, as required by the revised code of practice for State bodies — this will supplement the authority's master plan, which is required under its parent Act and which was updated in 2008; a review by the internal auditors of the authority's risk management framework, with areas of weakness remedied; and revised procedures for the section 25 fast-track planning powers, including in regard to public consultation.  The authority is also considering other measures to improve reporting arrangements with my Department.Under the 1997 Act, the Oireachtas has entrusted my office and the office of the Minister for Finance with the task of ensuring that the DDDA operates in accordance with its statutory mandate.  The principal legislation governing the functions of the Comptroller and Auditor General is the 1993 Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act.  This Act details the accounts audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The main such accounts are the Appropriation Accounts of Departments and Government offices; the finance accounts; the accounts of revenue collections; and the accounts of the non-commercial semi-State bodies listed in Schedule 1 of the Act.  As a general rule, the legislation establishing non-commercial State bodies specifies that the Comptroller and Auditor General should audit the accounts of these bodies.  Commercial State bodies, on the other hand, are generally audited by private commercial auditors rather than by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This reflects the independent commercial role of these bodies and also the fact that, in general, these bodies are funded by their own resources and borrowings rather than by grants from the Exchequer.The Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993 specifically prohibits the Comptroller and Auditor General from exercising his role in regard to the commercial State bodies listed in Schedule 2 of the Act, which includes the Custom House Docks Development Authority, the DDDA's predecessor.  The Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, Deputy Bernard Allen, wrote to my Department as well as to the Minister of Finance in June this year, requesting that the authority be brought within the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This request followed a previous request from the Oireachtas joint committee to the Comptroller and Auditor General in May, asking him to examine and prepare a report on the authority's annual report and accounts for the past five years.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's response stated the authority did not fall within its remit, as the DDDA Act specifically provided that the authority can appoint its own auditors, subject to the approval of the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Finance, and his power of inspection only applies to bodies that receive at least 50% of their funds from the Exchequer.Having considered the matter, I replied to the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts in September, pointing out the current arrangements whereby I am required, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, under section 43 of the DDDA Act to approve the appointment of independent auditors to sign off on the authority's annual accounts and that I did not intend to change the existing arrangements.  Under these arrangements, it is open to the joint committee to have staff of the authority appear before it, thereby affording the Oireachtas an opportunity to question them on the authority's accounts and activities.  This facility has been availed of twice in the past year, with representatives of the DDDA appearing before the committee in February and again last week.  I am not opposed to the idea of a more formal role for the Comptroller and Auditor General, in principle, and I will keep the need for future involvement on the part of the Comptroller and Auditor General under review.  However, a role for the Comptroller and Auditor General needs to be considered as part of an overall strategic response to the corporate governance reviews, which are nearing finalisation.The authority has been instrumental in transforming the docklands and improving the lives and aspirations of docklanders.  Despite its financial difficulties during 2008, the authority continued to progress most of its social development, leisure, tourism and culture initiatives.  The imminent completion of the convention centre, the Grand Canal theatre, the Samuel Beckett bridge and the Luas to the Point village will bring more positive news to the docklands area in the near future.  The recent completion and opening of the O2 arena has given the area a welcome lift.  Apart from being a top class entertainment venue, the O2 will provide more than 600 jobs during its 150 to 200 annual events.  Considerable progress has been made on Dublin’s convention centre at Spencer Dock.  This world class centre, which is due to open in next September includes a 2,000 seat auditorium and will extend to more than 440,000 sq m.  Following the completion of the centre, Dublin will be in a position to compete in the international convention market.  The unique and distinctive Samuel Beckett bridge, which will link Macken Street on the south side with Guild Street on the north side, will open this week.  Work on the Luas red line extension from Connolly Station to the O2 is complete and trams began operations today.While restructuring is necessary for the authority to refocus on delivery of short-term key goals in a difficult operating environment, it also aims to maintain a core skills base within the organisation to ensure that the authority is well positioned to take advantage of future opportunities.  The DDDA has brought significant benefits to the Dublin docklands.  It has ground to make up in repairing its finances and its reputation.  I look forward to receiving the corporate governance reports from the chairman and I will act decisively in response to them.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	383	I wish to share time with Deputy Ó Snodaigh.The Labour Party supports the Bill, which is intended to amend the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993 to permit the Comptroller and Auditor General to carry out inspections of the DDDA under that Act.  It is proposed to amend sections 8 and 9 of the 1993 Act and this is feasible.  If the Fine Gael proposal is not acceptable, I am sure a similar Bill can be agreed by the Oireachtas or introduced by the Government.  One could fit the Dublin Docklands Development Authority into the various provisions of section 8 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993.  It certainly seems to be a runner.  Section 8 refers to inspection for the purpose of determining whether and to what extent moneys are received by certain bodies from the Government.  One of the matters mentioned by the chairwoman of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, Professor Niamh Brennan, when she came before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government was that if the banks were to call in the guarantee for the Irish Glass Bottle site of approximately €35 million, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority would need Government assistance and that is relevant.  The Schedule of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993 lists the various bodies audited and it would seem appropriate that the Dublin Docklands Development Authority would be included.I appreciate what the Minister stated about the investigations he commissioned.  I understand they are being carried out by the board of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  I was not at the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government attended by the chairwoman of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority but I have read the report.  She stated that the reviews which are about to be published would be of the standard of the Comptroller and Auditor General but the issue is that they are not independent and do not have the openness and transparency that an inspection by the Comptroller and Auditor General would have.The issues that arose since the publication of the annual report and the presentation made by Professor Niamh Brennan last week are about the transparency with which the Dublin Docklands Development Authority did its business.  Incidents occurred where it seems apparent that members of the board had conflicts of interest when decisions were made.  At the committee meeting, the chairwoman stated: "People have asked questions about the objectivity of the authority and about its integrity.  Some of these questions have been raised arising from systematic conflicts of interest within the authority and in particular with regard to its association with Anglo Irish Bank."In that light, the issue is to do with the independence of the authority and whether its procedures were transparent.  Conflicts of interest were involved and great problems have arisen out of that.  The Minister needs an independent investigation into this and the Bill provides a way of doing so.  It will help clear the air and be helpful to the board if the Comptroller and Auditor General carries out an inspection.  There is much regard for the reports carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General; we all have much faith in them and they are accountable to the Dáil and the Seanad.  It would benefit the Dublin Docklands Development Authority in terms of restoring public confidence to have that inspection take place in a legal, open and transparent way that is accountable to the Dáil and Seanad, in a way that the investigations that have been carried out and are yet to be published are not.If we did what the Fine Gael Bill proposes and have the Comptroller and Auditor General carry out an inspection of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, the investigation and its report could inform not only how we deal with the Dublin Docklands Development Authority but how we deal with similar authorities that will be established in the future and how local authorities carry out or promote development in particular areas.  Many of the issues raised with the Dublin Docklands Development Authority have much wider application.Based on the information given to the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, it seems that the Dublin Docklands Development Authority got into development as an exercise in gambling and speculation.  Development should be about developing communities, including retail, residential and all aspects of development.  It should not be about financial speculation.  It seems that in recent years the Dublin Docklands Development Authority gambled and lost.  The chairwoman stated that in 2008 the Dublin Docklands Development Authority made operating losses of €27 million in comparison with a surplus of €3.7 million the previous year.  When the losses came they were major.  Assets were written down by €186 million, and including a 26% investment in the Irish Glass Bottle site through a private company consolidates the deficit at €213 million.  This year, there are net assets of €26 million compared with net assets of €177 million the previous year.  The chairwoman told the committee that in the consolidated balance sheet the net liabilities were €48.5 million compared to net assets the previous year of €177 million.This is similar to the rest of the economy and the Government's decision to guarantee the banks and establish NAMA is related.  It is all part of the picture.  Even some of the people involved in the collapse of the banks are involved.  Seán FitzPatrick was on the board of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority and on the board of Anglo Irish Bank.  I understand that people so lost sight of the fact that conflicts of interest should not be allowed to arise in these matters that when he was on the board he invited two different chairmen of the board onto the board of Anglo Irish Bank.  That seems totally inappropriate and obviously gives rise to conflicts of interest.The Minister stated there were good projects and he spoke about some of them.  Social regeneration and education projects were part of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority development but why did social regeneration and education have to be based on developer-led planning?  Why did they have to be tied up with the making of money by developers and speculative planning?  This is the case not only with Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  In recent years, the outlook that the way to create a park was to allow a developer build hundreds of apartments, the way to create affordable housing was to allow a developer make a huge profit and the way to create a school building was to allow a developer build thousands of houses became the philosophy of how we do things.  Schools, social regeneration and the provision of parks should not be a matter of development; they should be the responsibility of the State.  Most of these should not be part of the free-marketeerism that operates in the private sector.The issues raised with regard to the development by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority are ones we need to examine in terms of our overall outlook on planning.  From that point of view, what Fine Gael proposes in the Bill will be helpful.  A report by the Comptroller and Auditor General would have much more credibility than the reports due to be published and I do not in any way question the credibility of those reports.  I am stating that the Comptroller and Auditor General is provided for under legislation and is accountable to the Dáil and the Seanad.  People trust the Comptroller and Auditor General's inspections and reports, many of which have been very good and have brought to light important matters.  If a similar inspection regime were put in place in respect of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, it would be a worthwhile exercise.If we proceed along our current course, with the reports relating to the two reviews that have been carried out being published and decisions subsequently being taken, there is a major possibility that matters will return to the way they were previously.  When she came before the relevant committee, the chairman of the authority referred to the problem of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority being pro-developer, which is welcome.  However, she also stated that the desire is to return the authority to a break-even situation.  What will happen then?  Is it envisaged that there will be a return to the speculator or developer-driven model the authority was operating until now?  Government policy in respect of establishing NAMA appears to indicate that the latter could happen.  That approach is both unrealistic and a mistake.We must take stock with regard to how we plan development in the future.  When I contributed to the debate on the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009 last week, the Minister unfortunately was obliged to leave.  I requested that there be a moratorium on rezonings until we take stock in respect of the situation relating to flooding.  I do not believe the fact that development has taken place on flood plains is the sole reason for the flooding that has occurred.  The position is much more complex.  There are many different factors involved in flooding.I am of the view that too much development has taken place too quickly.  It is the accumulation of development which gives rise to flooding.  It is difficult to build anywhere without there being some possibility that a flood risk will be created.  The possibility that climate change might exacerbate the risk of flooding in the future is relevant to Dublin, which is near the coast, and the docklands area.Flooding is not the only reason that we should take stock of our planning and rezoning systems, which have failed us.  Instead of planning communities and asking what would be the best way to proceed — even in instances where people had the best intentions — we have been picking out areas, rezoning them and making certain individuals very rich.  That is how it has worked.  Many other issues arise out of such a system.  I refer here to financial speculation, the hoarding of land by developers, the concentration of large tracts of land in the possession of a few developers and corruption.I am of the view that the Minister is introducing reforms in respect of planning.  However, perhaps the planning system should be completely overhauled.  Other countries do not appear to have the problems that obtain in Ireland.  Perhaps the Minister should introduce a Green Paper in respect of planning.  If he did so, we could play catch-up in respect of our infrastructure and take stock of the situation.One of the issues relating to the Dublin docklands area relates to the viability of a shopping centre.  That is not the only location where difficulties exist in this regard.  Issues have arisen with regard to the viability of many retail outlets.  One tends to see the same shops and shopping centres in every town.  These are usually massive developments which, despite the fact that they are privately owned, have become our public spaces.  One can be thrown out of such places and I recently had experience of that during the second referendum campaign in respect of the Lisbon treaty.  On the occasion in question, I was ejected from a shopping centre for handing out leaflets——

It is a particularly welcome measure in light of the debacle relating to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  When it was first came into being, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority was creative, positive, forward-thinking and had the support of many in the community.  Those people thought that when the authority was first established it would encourage sustainable development, attract investment to their area and substantially change that area for the better.Anyone who remembers the state of the docklands prior to the recent developments will understand why an impoverished community would reach out and believe that there was hope for it.  Much has happened in the area that is to be welcomed.  However, most of this was tied to the speculative development which has not only destroyed our banking system, but brought the economy to its knees.  That was not the intention and it was not why people engaged with the authority and gave it their support.  The shenanigans and corruption which have been alleged and proven in respect of some of the scheming and manoeuvring of this authority are scandalous.  What occurred was downright dishonest.One need only consider the scandal relating to the site previously occupied by the Irish Glass Bottle Company in Ringsend.  A ridiculous amount of money was spent on purchasing that site.  It is scandalous that the Dublin Docklands Development Authority was involved in this transaction and exposed the taxpayer to the speculative property market when everyone was saying that the latter was about to slow down or collapse.  I am of the view that the dishonesty relating to this matter, which has led to the virtual bankruptcy of the authority, will emerge in time.  What occurred in respect of the Ringsend site has led to funding for social and local programmes being discontinued.  In addition, the docklands area is now littered with empty buildings, half-constructed buildings and derelict sites on which a sod has never been turned.  The fiasco is a prime example of how business is conducted in this State.  When discussing this Bill it is uncanny that we have the backdrop of NAMA, which is aimed at rescuing banks and protecting developers.  The demise of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority is quite apt in this context.  I wish I could say we have learned our lessons but I am not sure.The Bill before us goes some way to rescue the authority.  It might put it on the path originally intended.  We have had other authorities in the city which, by the way they were established, managed to bypass the normal planning laws.  It was believed that this was the way forward for the greater good of a local area.  I refer to the Digital Hub in my constituency, which is a victim of the property crash.  Many of its plans and many of the plans through which the Government and its backers sold the idea to the local area are now in tatters.  They were put on hold for the long term.  We do not see cranes building up the Digital Hub as promised despite the fact that many factories seek to locate there.  Even in these recessionary times they seek office space in the hub.  The companies contracted to build received land in return and are legally obliged to have these plans delivered by a set date.  That will not happen.What is the situation with the Dublin Docklands Development Authority?  It was given special planning powers that were used irresponsibly, allowed many developers to slip through planning and allowed them to waive the requirement for 20% social and affordable housing that was an obligation elsewhere.  Developers were granted planning permission by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, with the obligation to provide 20% of social affordable housing, but applied for an extension to the planning permission to make them exempt.  This scandal must be examined.  If this Bill is accepted, the Comptroller and Auditor General can investigate this to ensure the taxpayer is getting value for money and that nothing untoward will happen again.  I believe it has happened.Some of those appointed to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority had to resign very quickly because of involvement in tax schemes and tax shelters, even though they were later said to have broken no law and to have acted in good faith.  The fact that these people were chosen to sit on an authority speaks volumes.  That so many on the authority seemed to be under the influence of Anglo Irish Bank, with many on the bank's board, shows the backhanders and scandal that have yet to emerge in respect of all that was wrong and evil in Anglo Irish Bank.  We have not seen half of it yet.  If this Government is not willing to fully expose it, I hope a future Government will have the documentation to prove the extent of corruption at that level in our banking system.Work remains to be done in the docklands area and other areas of the city.  Major rejuvenation and regeneration is desperately needed in the docklands area.  I hope that when we come out the other end of this economic crisis, we will see those areas targeted primarily for social and economic rejuvenation.  Economic rejuvenation of these areas should be focused on the local people, those who were left behind by the Celtic tiger.  Whatever happens should be planned properly, sustainable and not dependent on developers and the false money they were spending on the likes of the Irish Glass Bottle site, Jurys Hotel and other so-called prime development sites on which ridiculous figures were spent.Hopefully, although I doubt it, we will hear the Minister of Finance explain tomorrow how he plans to regenerate areas of Dublin's inner city and inner city areas in other parts of the State.  Perhaps he will tell us how he plans to rejuvenate the economy and provide a stimulus package that has been provided in other countries.  It is working in other countries, or at least helping to get them out of the recession.  I have seen a lack of understanding by the Government of the need to get this economy working.  In order to do so, one must employ people.  Time and time again in the past year and a half, we have seen a concentration on cutting pay and cutting social welfare rather than planning to invest and planning to rebuild the economy.I welcome this Bill and I hope the Minister can accept its intent.  Perhaps he can go beyond it, by ensuring that whatever authority we have in the future is properly reflective of the society in that area.  The Dublin Docklands Development Authority never fully reflected the north inner city or the south inner city area.  It never reflected the normal people, their wishes or their demands for the future.  It did not reflect their dreams but it should have.  If it had, we might have had something more sustainable and something that could remain intact so that we could see building and other work happening in the docklands area.  Given its location and its access to the city and the sea, there is major potential for tourism.  However, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority concentrated on ensuring that more and more apartments were built and that more office space was built even though the demand did not exist.  It was clear to anyone involved in city planning that there was an oversupply of apartments and an oversupply of office space yet no one called a halt, not even the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.We need sustainable planning and we must ensure that whatever happens in the future is properly planned, sustainable and that social housing is provided equivalent to the level of need in the area.  There should be enterprise units available at low cost to local residents.  There should be a proper transport plan and the Irish language should be recognised.  The Dublin Docklands Development Authority never seemed to recognise the Irish language.  Any of the signs erected in the area, including one that referred to An Droichead Seán Ó Cathasaigh, were in English only.  I urge the Minister to adopt this Bill.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	390	It is important when we change legislation, even in this rather cackhanded way, that we do so to make sure that any process we establish is as efficient as possible.  I have some concerns about the Minister's amendment.  Deputy Coveney and I tabled a similar amendment but this one is complicated, I suspect unnecessarily so because there are two Departments involved, the Departments of Transport and of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  At various points in the amendment there are references to consultation between the Departments on guidelines and a scheme of charges but these are on top of a fairly complex system for someone trying to access ducting in roads other than national primary or major routes because the local authority still has a role there.This leads to a one-stop-shop, whatever that is.  It has not been defined but there is a need to provide a one-stop-shop to ensure that all these systems are streamlined and the process can be expedited.  I am concerned that the Minister mentioned this only at the end of his speech where there is a reference with no explanation.  In response to a parliamentary question that I put to the Minister on 25 November last he described a process that made my blood run cold.  The Minister has a responsibility to set up a one-stop-shop, to make sure that we can develop the broadband infrastructure that we desperately need, particularly in a time of recession.He has the power to do that but does not seem to have the inclination to do it, although he certainly could do it if he chose.  Instead, he started his reply by talking about the complex process.  It is not that complex.  Using ducts in the road is not exactly rocket science.  He then referred to the first stage, which is internal engagement with relevant State bodies, the next stage is a review of State-owned networks determining routes, etc.  I do not know why that has to take time because it seems odd that the data is not easily accessible.The Minister will then set up an implementation task force.  That was when my temperature went down to zero.  To put icing on the cake he will consult what alternative options telcos might suggest.  Either he is going to do this or he is not.  This tortuous process begs the question of whether the Minister is willing to make a decision.  He said that sometime in 2010 he expects the one-stop-shop to be set up, although it is undefined and undescribed.This may be a cheap shot but we must be wary because under an earlier Minister, this Department intended to introduce a fisheries Bill to rationalise the fisheries boards.  In 2005 the relevant elections were deferred and this year we have been asked to defer them again, for the fifth time.  I have no doubt that the Minister in 2005 said the new system would happen in a year, if people would vote his way.  I hope this Minister will prove me wrong.  I do not have confidence in the Minister if he uses this circuitous, tortuous route of using an implementation task force, consultation and alternative options.  Where will that lead us?The National Competitiveness Council has just published a document making the point that so many of our exports now depend on the IT sector that we need an enabling measure in the form of a one-stop-shop.  The report argues too that State involvement is necessary to establish a next generation network.  That raises the question of whether we can afford to leave it to the market.  The Eircom experience surely tells us that we cannot.  It was a disaster that destroyed our chance of taking a leading role and developing our chance of becoming competitive.  I recall the then Minister, I think it was Deputy Dermot Ahern, saying that Ireland would be at the forefront of the IT revolution, etc.  The way in which Eircom was privatised and the loss of management of the network and its infrastructure has left a big hole in our chance of developing broadband and a next generation network.  We must study that broad picture.This issue is a small part of the big picture but it seems that even with the support of the Opposition, which the Minister has, he should consider simplifying this at every opportunity.  The more complicated it becomes, the more open to challenge in court.  A small example of this is that the authorities can have a representative present when a duct is being opened.  That makes sense, even if the NRA is the authority.  The person who should be present is the area engineer working for the county council because that person will be available.  This Bill does not make clear whether, if an issue went to court it could be argued that the person was not a representative of the NRA, and that could lead to difficulties.  It is a minor point but it raises issues about the unnecessary complexity of this amendment.

Deputy McManus is right to say that this involves two Departments and two agencies and getting agreement between them can be a complicated process.  It is sometimes not as easy or as quick as one would want but one is better to do it and get it right.  I said on Second Stage that this was the most appropriate mechanism for making legislative change to improve the level of access to ducting across the State.  That objective set me on course to use this Bill.We had to recommit the Bill to Committee Stage to introduce this amendment because of a ruling from the Bills Office on Committee Stage, which was its right and under its remit to make.  The level of ducting available to us, particularly in State infrastructure, puts us at an advantage.  It is right for us to use such State services.  This is not a situation where one just leaves it completely to the market to see what level of broadband accrues.  There is a strategic interest in the State having an optimal and internationally competitive network.  We have to use whatever mechanisms we have within the European market and other proper legal arrangements.

That is why we are putting it into this Bill and trying to get it through the Dáil and into action.  There are other areas in terms of broadband access in schools, the rural broadband scheme and the national broadband scheme where, similarly, the market is not able to deliver and we are willing to act.The evolution or development of the one-stop-shop will have to be done on the basis of what is actually happening on the ground and how we can most effectively deliver backhaul broadband infrastructure.  The evolution of this is along the lines of, first, determining what we have and, then, determining common and easy access to it.  As Deputy Coveney said, the NRA is not a telecoms company so it is right for us to assist the NRA or any other agency, be it the RPA, the canals company, CIE, Bord Gáis or a range of different State infrastructure companies.  A one-stop-shop provides the capability of having a common regulated approach which makes it easy not only for the telecoms and Internet service companies, but also for the infrastructure company itself.

The mapping out which we have done of the State infrastructure which could have access to such infrastructure was an important first step.  This Bill is an important further step and it will continue to evolve in conjunction with advice from ComReg and ascertaining what the market is doing at the same time to make sure we get the fastest, most widespread deployment of fibre across this network.  How far that goes will to a certain extent evolve depending on the market.  If we have a failure in the market, one would pursue at a much more fundamental level the use of State assets and their integration to provide an alternative solution.  That is something where an alternative approach——

One complements it with the work one is doing in the one-stop-shop and the provision of State infrastructure.A crucial first step is that one gets the basic infrastructure and access right, and this is what we are legislating for in the Bill.  I welcome the comments from both Deputies opposite in that the broad provisions here in terms of the charging arrangements, the notification arrangements and what one does in the event of having to move ducting and do repairs, from what I have heard them say, are broadly along the right lines.  It will have to work out in reality, however, and the sooner we get the Bill passed and this amendment approved, the sooner we can get on with the business of actually delivering that fibre infrastructure.

In page 3, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:"PART 1PRELIMINARY AND GENERAL1.—(1) This Act may be cited as the Communications Regulation (Premium Rate Services and Electronic Communications Infrastructure) Act 2009.(2) The Principal Act, the Act of 2007 and this Act may be cited together as the Communications Regulation Acts 2002 to 2009 and shall be read together as one.".Amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, 7, 9, 35, 37, 40 and 41 are technical amendments which have been made by the Parliamentary Counsel consequential to amendment No. 38 to change the Short Title of the Bill, to split the Bill into three Parts and to re-arrange certain sections of the Bill.  As I have already covered the substantive issues in regard to amendment No. 38 during the motion to recommit, I do not propose to repeat them.  I will, however, provide a short summary.Amendment No. 38 amends Part V of the Communications (Regulation) Act 2002.  The main purpose of this amendment is to designate the National Roads Authority as the consent-giving authority for national roads, which includes motorways.  This is to facilitate the NRA making available its ducting on national roads, including motorways, to facilitate the roll-out of high-speed fibre networks to the regions.The proposed changes seek to strike a balance between the need to encourage and facilitate greater investment in broadband roll-out with the need to ensure that our road network is managed and operated in a manner that ensures the highest possible safety standards for all users.  As I have proposed my own amendment, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 39 submitted by Deputy Coveney and Deputy McManus.As I said, amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, 7, 9, 35, 37, 40 and 41 are largely technical amendments which have been made by the Parliamentary Counsel consequential to amendment No. 38.  I am happy to facilitate the Deputies.  I imagine the substantive discussion will be on amendment No. 38 rather than on the technical measures.

In page 3, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:"2.—In this Act "Principal Act" means Communications Regulation Act 2002.".
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	408	To deal with the group of amendments as a whole, it is not necessary for me to discuss amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, 7, 9, 35, 37, 39, 40 or 41.  The issue is amendment No. 38 because all the other amendments are as a consequence of that amendment.On the whole, amendment No. 38 makes some sense and I am supportive of it.  The one area where the Minister may consider amending it somewhat is in regard to relocation costs and roadworks.  My understanding from the briefing earlier and from reading the amendment is that if a telco has laid fibre in a duct, or put a ducting in place itself and laid fibre, and if the NRA needs to put roadworks in place to either move the road or move the duct, then the NRA will make the appropriate financial compensation for the cost of actually reinstating that ducting as well as laying the fibre.  In the instance where the NRA is effectively charging the telecommunications company for laying fibre in its own duct, if the NRA needs to move that duct for whatever reason, such as roadworks, and as a result the telecommunications company is inconvenienced and must move its ducting, the cost of putting the new duct in place must be borne by the NRA.  At present there is no financial liability for the cost of relaying the fibre.  We may have got the balance wrong and I ask the Minister to look at it.  If someone is paying a rental fee for the use of an NRA duct and the NRA needs to shift that duct, and as a result forces a telecommunications company to take up the fibre and relay it in the new duct, when it is laid, the cost should be borne by the NRA so telecommunications companies can have some certainty that when they lay duct there will be some permanence and if there is to be a change, the cost will be borne by the landlord from whom they are renting the space.  That may not be possible but it seems to be a sensible approach.  If someone rents space and is forced to relocate, the cost of relocation is normally borne by the landlord if the landlord is forcing the change.My genuine concern is to make it as attractive as possible for private sector telecommunications companies to use State-owned ducting infrastructure, particularly NRA infrastructure, which is a valuable resource that is not being used at the moment.  I do not want a situation whereby people feel they do not want to lay fibre in NRA-owned ducts because there may be a plan to shift the road or widen it in the near future and the cost of that may be prohibitive.  If someone has a contract with e-Net to use us a fibre in a metropolitan area network and the MAN must be moved, is the cost of relocation and reconnection borne by e-Net?  I suspect it is.  I do not see why the same rationale does not apply for NRA ducting as it would for ducting owned by a private sector interest.

Does that mean there is no reference to any principal Act anywhere in the Bill?  If there is, there should be an explanation of what that Act is.  Why did the Minister need to insert amendment No. 38 even though Deputy Coveney and I had already made the same changes in amendment No. 39?  Perhaps there were legal aspects, the whole process has been mysterious at every level.I agree with Deputy Coveney, there are issues related to compensation.  The new section 53(6)(b) states the authority shall not be liable to the network operator for any loss or damage caused to the infrastructure, which is the property of the network operator, except where such loss or damage caused by the wilful act or gross negligence of the authority.  Authorities do not engage in wilful acts and gross negligence sounds extreme.  If there were a court case, a sharp lawyer could argue on behalf of the NRA that an act was not grossly negligent, even if it was negligent.  No life may have been lost.  How does one measure these things?  What is gross and what is not?  If any negligence is proven against an authority, there must be some sort of settlement made.  We are talking about vital infrastructure that costs money.  I am concerned about the use of the term “gross negligence”.  “Wilful” act will not be a common experience but it is very hard to define gross negligence even though one can imagine someone in a digger being negligent and causing a fair amount of damage but not being grossly negligent.The arrangements that have been cobbled together with the Minister for Transport, because he wants his place in the sun, are unnecessarily complicated.  What happens if one or other does not comply?  There is a consultation period not exceeding 21 days between the two Departments.  What happens if the consultation period exceeds 21 days?  Is it taken that the Department can proceed without getting any feedback?  Is there a penalty?The Minister for Transport may draw up guidelines after consultation.  The Minister for Transport has no interest in communications, and he certainly has no responsibility for them.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has a lot of responsibility and an interest in making sure this works but the guidelines are being drawn up by the Department of Transport.  We want a clear line of authority in terms of devising the safeguards and protections that must be in place.  How could such an elaborate system be considered to be the best way forward?We must see this come into operation quickly, with telecommunications companies able to access a resource they will pay for.  It is a revenue gathering exercise but it must be done quickly and in a way that is not unduly bureaucratic.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	410	I support the points made by Deputy McManus.  I am reading the list of amendments, some of which relate to the role of the NRA versus the role of a local authority.  For national roads, a telecommunications company should apply to the NRA if it wants to dig up the road or use an existing duct.  If it is a regional or local road it has to go through the local authority and there is a procedure in place.We are legislating for the NRA to charge for the use of ducting on national roads.  That is fine.  Is there any legal provision in this legislation to allow a local authority to charge for the use of local authority owned ducting or is it the same as applies to the NRA?  If, for example, a company such as BT wants to roll out fibre to homes and wants to use ducting on a national road from Dublin, it deals with the NRA.  If it then goes off the national road onto a regional local road that is the responsibility of Kildare County Council or some other local authority.  Is there ducting infrastructure along local or regional roads that is the responsibility of local authorities?  If not there should be in the future because when building roads, ducting should be put in place when it is appropriate. Can local authorities charge for the use of ducting infrastructure so people do not have to put in new ducting if there is an existing facility?  Hopefully at some time in the future we will open access to Eircom ducting through regulation.  If there is local authority-owned ducting, as there should be in some parts of the country, does this legislation allow local authorities to put deals in place with telecommunications companies when they need to use ducting along local roads?  If so, did the Minister look at giving the NRA the capacity to deal with telecommunications companies for local and regional roads as well as national roads, where appropriate, in consultation with local authorities?
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	411	I could not find the actual section from which I was reading earlier.  As I read it, a telecommunications company would not be able to get compensation if something goes wrong on an NRA national primary route if permission had been granted prior to this by a local authority.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify because there are instances where, for example, in my constituency, Eircom got permission from the local authority to go under the national primary route.  In that instance it was the local authority that gave permission.  If something is done by the NRA at some future date, does that mean the telecommunications company does not get any compensation?The other point, which I raised previously, is that I would be concerned that the NRA can have a representative present.  I doubt if the NRA will be able to react quickly if there is a road opening or whatever and works have to be done.  However, the area engineer working for the NRA or representing the NRA could be present and it would, at least, speed up that particular element in the whole process.  Can an area engineer working for a local authority be classified as a representative of the authority who gives the permission?  If that were so it would make things a little more streamlined.

Deputy Coveney's main point, which is a valid one for consideration, is the issue about cost allocation in the event of having to move ducting.  The key distinction — he has not understood the provisions and that is understandable — is that the NRA will carry the cost of moving the ducting——
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	413	Yes.

The cost allocation for the telecommunications company relates to the fibre cable or the other equipment that is actually using that duct.  The cost should in all instances be very modest.  One is looking at a re-threading of fibre through——
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	415	I made that distinction but if it is that modest why does the NRA not take the full cost?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	416	It is because there is a recognition that it would make sense for the people doing the technical, telecommunications company-based work, to cover the cost and also that there would be a modest cost for Eircom in terms of using alternative ducting where civil engineering works are involved in trying to do the work itself.  The main cost is on the civil engineering side.  The private sector, the telecommunications company, would carry the cost of the threading of fibre through or the relocation of switching equipment or other equipment.Deputy McManus made a number of different points.  In regard to amendment No. 7, amendment No. 2 effectively relocates the definition of the "Principal Act".  It is catered for within amendment No. 2.  I am informed that the term "gross negligence" is a legal term and there is fairly clear definition of it within the law.  Therefore, I understand that wording is there because it is quite a specific term that the courts apply on a regular basis across a range of different areas.To answer a question on the reason this is complicated legislatively and why it was amendment No. 38 from myself rather than either of the amendments from Deputy Coveney or Deputy McManus that was approved, Standing Orders provide that it is only possible for a Minister to put forward an amendment on Report Stage in this way.  The Deputies opposite were facilitating the attempt to get it in on Committee Stage where it was possible but I understand that under Standing Orders, that is not possible on Report Stage.  That is why it was in the form of my own amendment No. 38 rather than in any alternative form.In regard to local authorities, they do have the ability to provide access and to charge.  Our cities and towns are full of ducting, much of which runs under roads.  There is a mechanism for the local authorities to manage that and to charge.  It can only include administrative charges; they are not operating as telecommunications companies.  However, there is a measure where such access is provided for.I will now deal with the last point raised by Deputy McManus on compensation for telecommunications companies in the event of the NRA doing something that would cause them major business disruption and so on.  That is where the term "gross negligence" would apply.   If through gross negligence on the NRA's part, a loss was accruing to the telecommunications company, compensation would apply.On the issue of having a National Roads Authority representative present or the nature of the consent, the nature of the process, notification and so on, this will have to operate when we start working it on a pragmatic basis.  We must have good protocols that protect the NRA or give it reassurance that it will not have major traffic jams every time one has to work on a repair fault on, say, the M50.  One does not want to block the whole M50, so good protocols are needed around how such work is carried out.  First and foremost, one has to ensure it is safe.  There is a fundamental difference between having a repair truck out on a motorway where people are travelling at 120 km/h, and having it on a local road where they are travelling at 40 km/h or 50 km/h.  There is a real need for protocols and procedures that would apply in terms of people working.  The telecommunications companies will have to show they are capable of delivering on such standards because of the safety concerns involved in working on the motorway network and the consequences of traffic chaos if we do not get it right on the major roads on our network.I said earlier that sometimes it is difficult to get agreement across Departments and various different agencies.  That is true in the case of any administrative system but the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is probably more keen than anybody else to see the ducting being used.  He was the former Minister in this particular portfolio and was a keen advocate of us using our State infrastructure.  The NRA had been given very clear instructions.  It sees the economic benefit to the State of us using this ducting.  I do not believe there will be a difficulty in setting up those protocols but that is what we have to do once the legislation is in place.  This is done by regulations rather than in primary legislation.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	417	How will ducting owned by local authorities be dealt with in legislation?  For instance, if a network operator who is rolling out ducting and dealing with the NRA then moves to a regional road for which a local authority has responsibility, will the existing legislation apply in terms of digging up the road, putting the ducting in place?  There are plenty of ducks in Cork at the moment but are there any publicly owned ducts, owned by local authorities and does this legislation facilitate access to them?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	418	I was a councillor on Dublin City Council in the late 1990s.  From memory I think the local authority set up such a collaborative system as it was tired of private operators digging up the streets one after the other.  I recall when many of the bus lanes were being implemented that ducting was installed at that time.  This is done on an open access basis.  Those arrangements are made on a local authority basis.  The local authorities realise now that economic development and progress in their own areas requires good broadband connectivity and therefore it is a matter for telcos to negotiate with a local authority.  They will have to do a deal with each local authority in turn but by and large, if a telco is prepared to provide fibre access into an area this can only be good for economic development in a local area across a range of activities.  Most local authorities are aware of the benefits of this infrastructure and will facilitate a flexible approach with network operators.  Existing legislation provides for this and this provision will weave in with it.

My point is that it is only a matter of time before fibre is rolled out to homes.  Either this Minister or another Minister will do it.  In my view this is the way Ireland will go in the future.  It is crucial that not only do we allow open access to publicly-owned ducting on national roads and ducting available elsewhere in State ownership but we must also facilitate the roll-out of fibre into local and regional roads, into housing estates and ultimately into houses.  The only way this can be achieved is either to access Eircom ducting through regulation, build our own new ducting or in some cases, use some of the State-owned ducting.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	423	I have a similar vision regarding the provision of fibre to homes although this will be more difficult in rural areas but this is what we are heading towards.  It is equally available on either national or local roads, either via the National Roads Authority or each local authority.  The provisions are similar.  The charges are not commercially based so that local authorities will not become telcos, as it were; it is for them and the National Roads Authority to provide access to existing State ducting to cover the administrative charges.  This legislation deals with both local authorities and the National Roads Authority in a similar manner, depending on the road the telcos are looking to use.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	431	I move amendment No. 6:
In page 3, line 29, to delete "(other than a broadcasting service)".This is an area where the Minister could make an improvement rather than just changing the name of a Minister in the line of a Bill and calling it an improvement.  It seems the Minister has made some effort in amendment No. 11 to deal with the issue that I raised but it does not deal with the issue.  The amendment proposes to delete "other than a broadcasting service".  It removes the exclusion of broadcasting services from the Bill.My concern is regarding a broadcasting development known as an "infomercial".  A programme which is essentially a money-making scheme for a premium rate service provider is broadcast and the broadcaster benefits from the programme making money.  This has been the subject of many complaints and criticisms in this country.  Even under the change provided for by the Minister, a broadcaster who colludes with a premium rate service provider to scam the public will not come under the remit of this Bill which is very specific and deals with offences of this type.  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland will deal with the errant broadcaster.  The Minister has stated eloquently many times that the broadcasting authority deals with quality of programming whereas this Bill is about ensuring people comply with the law and if not they will be punished.  It is hoped that with the improvements put forward by the Opposition, people will receive their refunds.  In this instance the Minister is saying that where a premium rate service provider is engaged in this kind of infomercial activity with a broadcaster, the premium rate service provider will be subject to the Bill but the broadcaster will still be off the hook.  A Sunday newspaper recently reported that this programme had been the subject of many complaints and that the broadcaster in question argued there were only 12 complaints in total which was regarded as normal.  This is grossly irresponsible.  The example I cited relates to a person who paid €370 to a service which is essentially a scam.  Callers cannot get through, the questions are impossible to answer and the premium rate service provider is able to coin it.  Moreover, the broadcaster enjoys a cut.If we fail to address this activity in legislation, it will grow.  It is fine for the Minister to isolate the premium rate service provider — I am delighted he had done so — but he is letting the broadcaster off the hook.  Collusion between broadcasters and service providers will make a great deal of money for both parties.  The matter must be addressed in the Bill.  It cannot be dealt with in the Broadcasting Act as the role of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland is clear.The Minister indicated initially that these matters would be addressed in the regulatory structure.  Later, he stated the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland would have responsibility for broadcasters, while ComReg would have responsibility for errant premium rate service providers.  This is a crazy system for the poor, unfortunate person who tries to have €370 or some other large sum returned as it allows the broadcaster to blame the service provider and vice versa.  This approach is unsustainable in terms of consumer protection.Under amendment No. 8 the proposed structure, under which the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and ComReg would operate as parallel regulators, would be replaced with a single, efficient and effective regulator.  The regulators could learn from each other and pool resources, as required.  An bord snip nua and Colm McCarthy have stated unequivocally that this type of approach needs to be taken.  It should at least be facilitated, as is proposed in amendment No. 8.  I am not forcing the Minister to accept that this must be done.The Minister has been astonishingly weak in countering the argument in favour of convergence between the two regulators.  The relevant technologies are rapidly converging and it is self-evident that the two regulators must work together to ensure the regulatory structures meet the needs of broadcasting and telecommunications.  The world is changing rapidly and technologies are developing at unbelievable speed.The needs of the consumer did not feature in the Bill until Opposition Deputies started to work on it.  Customers must be at the heart of the legislation.  That the issue of refunds did not feature until Opposition parties tabled amendments is indicative of a mindset which must be eliminated.  The legislation is not solely about managing but also protecting people who are vulnerable.  The vulnerable account for a disproportionately high number of those who avail of premium rate services.Broadcasting is a powerful medium and when late night television programmes are clearly money making rackets, it is essential to deal with both parties, the service provider and broadcaster.  The legislation deals with only one half of a contract involving these two parties.  It is clear, even taking into account the change the Minister proposes, that he is focusing solely on the former and ignoring the latter.  Amendment No. 6, by removing the reference to "broadcasting service", would enable us to address this omission because the broadcaster would also be in the tent, as it were.

I was concerned by the letters I received and the number of complaints being made about these types of services.  This concern has been confirmed by the type of programming to which Deputy McManus referred.  Late one night I watched a programme which promised a major prize of €700 or €800 to viewers who could move two matches and form a new number.  This sounded good and I telephoned with an answer.  I was asked a simple question, namely, whether Dublin was the capital of Ireland and I answered "Yes".  Someone with a lovely voice then informed me that while I had done very well, I would not go through on that occasion.

When I answered "Irish" I was told I had done brilliantly but had just missed out.  This happened 15 times in a row and each call cost €1.50.

I then decided to stop calling the service but my efforts cost me €50.  Deputy McManus is correct that this is a scam by any other name.  The reason we have regulatory systems in place is to protect members of the public from these sharp commercial practices.I do not propose to discuss specific details because the job of legislators is to allow other people to make adjudications on the matter.  If a broadcaster is involved in the contractual arrangements or runs a premium rate service, it is subject to ComReg's regulation of premium rate services because it is a party to the licence and service.  In such cases of a contractual connection, the broadcaster is, therefore, subject to regulation.  In other cases where a programme is not contractually connected to a broadcaster, ComReg's role relates solely to the premium rate service provider.This raises a further aspect, namely, wider broadcasting policy and the quality and nature of programming, an issue that must be addressed by the broadcasting regulator.  We have well defined mechanisms to allow us to pursue what are considered to be inappropriate cases.  We must allow the regulators to do this work, provide refunds and make changes to licences, as they see fit.I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 6 or 8.  Amendment No. 10 is largely technical in nature, while amendment No. 11 is an attempt, following the debate on Committee Stage, to reflect the need for clarity and define the respective roles of the broadcasting service and premium rate service provider.  This distinction will be clearly available to ComReg and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland which will have an interest in this type of programme.  We need to pass the legislation to allow the regulators to protect members of the public in a manner they see fit and appropriate.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	437	The Minister stated the broadcaster will come under the regulatory structure to be established under the legislation.  I do not see any such reference in the Bill, although I welcome his amendment No. 10 as it at least goes part of the road.  The amendment states: "Where a specified premium rate service is advertised or promoted by means of a broadcasting service, it is the function of the Commission to ensure that the premium rate service provider, whose specified premium rate service is advertised or promoted, complies with the conditions attached to the licence in respect of that premium rate service."  If, however, a service provider colludes with a broadcaster, only the service provider gets caught and the broadcaster, which has benefited from the scam, may blithely decide, six months later, to engage in this activity with another service provider to see how long they can last before being caught.  I expect it would be difficult to prove a case in court.The provisions do not refer to the broadcaster.  This activity cannot take place without the collusion of a broadcaster.  I am sorry I did not keep a recent newspaper article about a particular broadcaster which had argued that only 12 complaints had been made about a programme.  The suggestion was that seemed to be a small number of complaints.  However, if each of those 12 people have been scammed, it is a serious activity for one of our broadcasters to be engaged in.  The amendment is welcome and I appreciate the Minister's efforts.  I am fascinated that he took the trouble to test the matter himself and good on him for so doing.  Nevertheless, it does not deal with the broadcaster, which is a very powerful element in all of this because it is the vehicle that transmits the programme and it is the body people trust.  If it was simply a scam in some other form, we would not be as gullible, if that is the correct term.  However, the programme is broadcast on television and we tend to trust what comes to us from television.  In this case, the broadcaster would get off scot free.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	442	I presume I have two minutes or whatever is the allocated time permitted.  I recognise the Minister has at least acknowledged the conversation we held on Committee Stage by tabling amendment No. 11.  Since the last discussion, I tried the late night service on TV3.  Let us be upfront about the broadcaster to which we refer.  Even if I had switched to high-definition television, I do not believe I would have spotted the difference, which was the name of the game I played that night.  We were asked to pick the odd one out in what appeared to be a very simple game, but, in fact, it was almost unwinnable.It reminded me of the time I worked as a student in Ocean City, Maryland.  Essentially, I worked on a three-card trick gameshow which ripped off gullible Americans who believed they could trust the Irish guy.  At the time, they could not.  This is the same idea.  It attracts viewers because one thinks one is spending a small amount of money.  One fails the first time and tries again because it is only a small amount.  Before one knows it, one has tried many times with a small amount and all of a sudden it becomes a large amount of money.  This attracts young people because each effort costs only a small amount.  The presenters are rather talented, persuasive and attractive.The point Deputy McManus has made more eloquently than I is that whether the broadcaster has hired a premium rate service provider to facilitate the telecommunications application that allows people to telephone in, be charged and participate in a competitive gameshow or the broadcaster decides to provide the service in-house, there is an onus on the broadcaster and we must ensure that it has a responsibility in legislation towards the provision of that service.  This is the point we are making.  It is somewhat missing the point to state that we should leave the broadcaster out of it because it simply provides the platform and promotion for the premium rate service provider, essentially, to scam people and to suggest ComReg should pursue the premium rate service provider because it provides the technology to do so.  There should be a stick such that if a broadcaster knowingly facilitates unacceptable behaviour with regard to premium rate services, it should be liable and subject to an investigation from ComReg.  I am not satisfied this is covered in the legislation and I do not understand why the Minister has rejected amendment No. 6.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	444	The legislation specifically states "other than a broadcasting service".  Deputy McManus appears to know why.  I accept the point that at times we must distinguish between the telecommunications provider or the premium rate service provider and the broadcasting platform or broadcaster.  At times, the broadcaster may be both entities.  In such cases, ComReg should be able to investigate the broadcaster.  However, if it does not comprise both entities, the broadcaster has a case to answer.  In my view, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland is not equipped to investigate and this is the problem.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	445	When I stated that I know, I mean that I suspect the reason this is not done is because of the two silos, that is, ComReg and the BAI, Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  The Minister wants no leakage whatsoever such that ComReg would investigate a broadcaster.  If this is the case, it is a very myopic view.  If a broadcaster is scamming in this way and is party to the scam, then it must be in the frame.  Otherwise, this will lead to various let outs and the premium rate service provider could blame the broadcaster because it could claim to be out of the loop.  It is very important that there is a unified approach dealing with all parties involved.  Finally, I suggest these two boys should get to bed earlier.

I recall working in a bar in New Orleans.  An identical scam was in operation across the road from it, which I watched day after day.  People went in, were ripped off and came out again.  It is interesting to hear of the Deputy's similar experiences.If the broadcaster is in a contractual arrangement with the premium rate service provider, then it is a service provider according to the terms of amendment No. 11 and, in such instances, it would be subject to ComReg.  However, if it were not, and there will be such instances, it would be a matter for the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to regulate whether something is within its broadcasting code of practice, a matter with which the Department is also involved separately.  There are mechanisms by which the authority regulates this aspect.  This is an appropriate division because one is a commercial, telecommunications premium rate service and must be regulated by ComReg because it has real expertise in that area.  The other is a broadcasting standards issue which the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland regulates.  This is not a silo approach, it is a clear differentiation.  We have been through this debate several times.  It is clear to me this Bill provides the mechanism for us to protect the consumer against premium rate scams and that is our primary intention.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	449	Section 1 clearly states:"premium rate service" means a service having all of the following characteristics:(a) it consists in the provision of the contents of communications (other than a broadcasting service) . . .One cannot state a broadcaster is a premium rate service provider because, under the definition of a premium rate service provider, a broadcaster is excluded.

The Minister has specifically excluded broadcasting.  Let us suppose a broadcaster does a deal with a premium rate service provider.  If the authority goes after the premium rate service provider, the broadcaster gets off the hook.  The first thing it would argue is that it is not in the arrangement.  It could argue that it is not a premium rate service provider because of the specific provision in the Bill.  There is an ill-logic there, if such a word exists.  This is not the case and it is remiss of the Minister to state that it is the case.  It is not.  The definition of a premium rate service provider excludes broadcasting such that a broadcaster cannot be a premium rate service provider.  However, it can do a deal with such a service provider to scam the public.

Why are we specifically saying broadcasters are excluded from something if they are only going to be under investigation if they are providing a premium rate service under contract with a premium rate service provider?  If that is the interpretation of the Bill then why do we have to state "other than a broadcasting service"?  I do not understand why that is necessary.  There is no need for the ambiguity.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	482	I do not think the Minister is correct in his interpretation because if one considers lines 10, 11 and 12 on page 4, it is stated that what is termed a "premium rate service licence" means "a licence authorising a premium rate service provider to provide a premium".  In other words, a premium rate service provider has to have a licence according to section 4, which is at the bottom of page 5.  The reference by the Minister to the definition of a "premium rate service provider" under paragraph (c) is someone who has applied for a licence to do that.  A broadcaster will not have done that, so it does not come under that definition.  That is why broadcasters take on a hired gun who has gone to the trouble of getting a licence, as broadcasters do not get the licence themselves.

In page 7, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:"(11) The Commission may give a direction to a network operator that is necessary or expedient for the performance of the functions of the Commission, and the network operator shall comply with the direction.".These various amendments deal with greater powers for the commission.  Amendment No. 14 inserts the power to give relevant directions to network operators to deal with matters such as the refusal of network operators to inform their customers about a stop command.  That issue has been the source of some complaint where people text in the word "stop" and nothing happens.  The relationship of the network operator in terms of ensuring the customer is not being ripped off is dealt with by the amendments.I am not sure whether I raised this issue on Committee Stage but it is worth itemising now.  In amendment No. 16, I suggest that a small number of services might not need to be licensed and perhaps should not be licensed, and should be exempt, for example, an emergency helpline.  I refer to a rape crisis centre, a Garda helpline or a women's refuge.  That kind of service perhaps should not be included in the formal licensing structure and requirements.  The commission could have the power to exempt services on the grounds of public good or public service.The issue arises also of the network operator.  It does not seem to me that there are sufficient teeth in terms of the role of the network operator, for example, to withhold payments or to have an active part in stamping out activity that is undesirable.  The commission may direct a network operator to cease to carry the premium rate service concerned.  That is an immediate and quick way to end some kind of activity that is illegal and is taking advantage of people, and is the source of a scam or rip-off.  If the network operator can be included in the frame in terms of what the commission can do and the powers the commission has, that would be an effective way to deal with such rip-offs.

There is a need to balance the power of the commission to regulate with the rights of the person being regulated.  The Bill, as drafted, strikes that balance.  There is certainty as to what is expected of the service provider once it is licensed to provide a service.  The proposed amendment would remove that certainty.  If the commission wishes to add additional conditions to a licence, it may do so under regulations made by it under section 5.

In page 7, line 32, to delete "may" and substitute "shall".This amendment is proposed following the debate on Second Stage and suggestions from Deputies Coveney and McManus that it be pursued.  It will ensure regulations under section 5 will be made by ComReg.  Although I am satisfied with the existing section, it strengthens it.  ComReg is required to make such regulations in order to discharge its functions under the Bill.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	501	I move amendment No. 16:
In page 7, line 34, after "section 4,” to insert the following:"or the class or type of premium rate services which do not require to be so licenced".I made the point already that there may be some exemptions that do not need to be fully licensed.  I imagine it is a very small sector, such as emergency lines and so on.  I made the point at the wrong stage in this debate, so I will not repeat it.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	502	The proposed amendment is not accepted.  In drafting the Bill, consideration was given to allow ComReg to make an order exempting certain classes of premium rate services from the requirement to be licensed.  In order to provide for exemptions from this requirement, the legislation would have to be clear as to the type of service that would be exempted.In discussions with the Attorney General's office, the advice was that from a legislative perspective, it would be preferable to empower ComReg to specify by regulation which services require to be licensed and the current provision in the Bill was suggested on that basis.  This approach will also provide certainty to existing and intended premium rate service providers as to the types of premium rate services for which they will require a licence and will reduce the regulatory burden on the sector.As the regulator of the sector, ComReg will be in touch with developments in the sector through its association with other regulators and its ongoing engagement with the industry.  It will, therefore, be in a position to foresee any new developments which may lead to new types of premium rate services being offered to the public and will have the knowledge and experience to specify in regulations the type of services that need to be licensed.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	511	I move amendment No. 17:
In page 7, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following:"(2) It shall be a condition of a licence under section 4 that—(a) the premium rate service provider shall ensure that any service of an ongoing nature may be readily terminated by the user at any time, and in the case of a service provided by SMS, the user may terminate the service at any time by sending “stop” in reply to any SMS received,(b) where a premium rate service provider fails to comply with paragraph (a) in any particular case, he or she shall refund the user in accordance with and subject to regulations under subsection (1) and shall pay the user compensation in accordance with and subject to such regulations.”.This goes back to this issue of the "stop".  The subject of many complaints was that people found they were being billed for a service which they were not aware would cost them much or which they did not even know they had taken up.  It must be easy for a user to opt out of the service and there must be real sanctions if the service provider does not stop the service on demand.On Committee Stage, the Minister said what we proposed was a bit too prescriptive.  I have altered the amendment somewhat to try to allow for that and to allow that all actions would be in accordance with regulations.  However, it is a particular issue that needs to be specified in the Bill because it is raised so often.  Regtel's experience was that this was a feature in the number of complaints and queries it received.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	512	The proposed amendment is not accepted.  Largely along the lines we stated in the debate on Committee Stage, it would not be appropriate to set out the terms and conditions of a licence in primary legislation.  Again, the advice from the Attorney General's office is that the type of detail the Deputy's amendment, even as amended, proposes is more appropriate for inclusion in secondary legislation.  To specify such detail in the Bill is not appropriate or desirable.The terms and conditions of a licence may vary over time and different terms and conditions will apply to different classes and types of premium rate services.  The terms and conditions of a licence, including any requirements in regard to refunds, will be set out in regulations made by ComReg under section 5.  The amendment introduced on Committee Stage provides for this.It was also pointed out on Committee Stage that the current code of practice under which Regtel may require refunds where there has been a breach of the code will still apply until a new code has been drawn up by ComReg to replace it.  The major difference between the current and the proposed regimes is that under the provisions of this Bill, compliance with the code of practice will be a condition of a licence and thus enforceable under law whereas the current code of practice is not enforceable as it has no standing in law.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	513	Amendment No. 20 provides for a power to direct the service provider to remedy a situation which means other people will not be affected.  However, I am not clear that it will ensure the person who has been hard done by will be compensated and that the issue will be addressed.  There seems to be this concentration on the system rather than on the individual.  Since the Minister will not accept my amendment, will he explain how the Bill will ensure that a person who has been taken advantage of will be compensated while the operator is remedying its activity?

At an early stage, we introduced an amendment to section 5 to ensure the conditions of a licence should include the basis and circumstances in which a refund may be used to end users.  In response to the concerns expressed by Deputies McManus and Coveney on Committee Stage and following further consultation with the Attorney General's office, I propose amendment No. 21 in order to remove any doubt that the remedy of any non-compliance with, or breach of, a condition of a licence shall require a refund of charges to any end user of premium rate services concerned with the non-compliance or the breach.  On Committee Stage Deputy McManus tabled a similar amendment to this section to ensure refunds and I am happy to introduce amendment No. 21 to cover that issue.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	515	That is fine.

In page 9, line 3, to delete "in case of repeated non-compliance, or" and substitute "for reasons stated in the notification, or".Following consideration of the points made by Deputy Coveney on Second Stage, the amendment has been agreed with the Parliamentary Counsel.  It will enable ComReg to stipulate a shorter period than one month within which the service provider must remedy a breach of a condition for reasons other than for repeated non-compliance.  The amendment strengthens this provision and I am happy to include it at this stage.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	519	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important matter for the Adjournment tonight.  It is very important for the people of Westmeath, whom I represent.  I am forced to speak here again because of the disgraceful, arrogant and dismissive actions of the HSE regarding the disproportionate cutbacks being foisted on the regional hospital in Mullingar.  These caused the accident and emergency department to close for a number of days last weekend due to the unsafe levels of overcrowding which arose as patients waited to be treated.  The upshot of this decision, which was reluctantly taken and motivated by the safety and well-being of patients, was that people requiring urgent treatment had to be brought to other hospitals in the region.I raised the plight of this important and centrally-located hospital in Mullingar in the Dáil on 12 November.  I pointed out that, in light of the fact that 41 acute beds — or 20% of the total acute beds complement of the hospital — were to be closed, the outcome we witnessed at the weekend was inevitable.  Like all hospitals across the country, one might anticipate some reduction in acute beds because of savings being sought.  Mullingar is not any different.  Nevertheless, the 20% reduction of the total acute beds complement at Mullingar hospital was excessive and clearly disproportionate.  It had the potential to render the hospital potentially unsafe for acute admissions over the winter.It is reported that the number of people lying on trolleys has escalated dramatically over the past two years.  At one stage last Thursday, 22 patients were waiting to be admitted, with all trolleys in use.  That is normal, as 15 to 25 patients could be there at various times.  The union representatives involved, who were putting the patient interests first, indicated that the accident and emergency department at Mullingar was unable to cope with the level of overcrowding; this will get worse as we progress into the depths of winter, when the number of acute admissions significantly increase.The level of overcrowding last weekend did not arise from an unusual peak or a surge in activity.  What will happen when there is a significant spike in the level of activity in admissions?  The whole system will creak and break down unless immediate action is taken to reopen most of the recently closed beds at the hospital.Lest anybody be misled, plenty of beds are available.  Four wards are closed and worse still, a new ward of 26 beds in the west wing of the new part of the hospital remains closed.  What sort of a system of management allows such a scandalous state of affairs to exist?  It is outrageous behaviour on behalf of the HSE and the Government, along with the HSE, is treating the citizens of Longford and Westmeath as second-class citizens.I have lost all faith in the HSE.  Mullingar is one of the most efficient hospitals in the country from a case mix perspective and is in the top three of the 52 hospitals in this country on a continuous basis.  What thanks does it get only to be left with an ongoing deficiency in bed numbers which seriously impacts on the emergency capacity?  Furthermore, the hospital is down approximately 35 nurses over the past 12 months due to non-replacements and retirements.  In whole-time equivalent terms, it is well below the average staffing levels in Irish hospitals.The people of Longford and Westmeath, whom I represent, feel this is part of an ongoing strategy to cripple and downgrade the status of a top-performing hospital.  In light of recent events, it is hard to quibble with that assessment.  As I have said before, the Government has failed the people of Longford and Westmeath in the delivery of health services.  There is a significant gap between the many promises made on the electoral stump and the reality which has been delivered.I call upon HSE management, whom I understand met consultants and other personnel at Mullingar hospital this evening, to tackle this serious and pressing problem with extreme urgency.  The Government and the HSE think nothing of riding roughshod over the people of Longford and Westmeath.  Let me retort on their behalf — the Government and HSE will not get away with it.On 30 November 2009, I communicated with the HSE, asking that the 26 beds in the west wing be opened and staffed so as to alleviate difficulties.  It was a positive proposal to reduce the impact of the loss of these acute beds.  I did not even get the courtesy of a reply, so need I say more?

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	521	I am glad the Minister of State is here as he is decent.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	522	I thank the Deputy.  I will be taking this matter on the Minister's behalf.  The HSE accepts that there was a problem in the emergency department at Mullingar hospital on Thursday last week.  However, since then all patients in the emergency department were either admitted or discharged within the target of six hours set by the HSE this year.The hospital's budget for 2009 is in excess of €64 million, increased from €54.8 million in 2006.  As Deputy Penrose rightly points out, the hospital has been recognised as being one of the most efficient in the country in the context of the annual case mix adjustment.  Last year, the hospital was the highest in the country with a positive case mix adjustment of €1.977 million.  It should be noted that inpatient activity at Mullingar to the end of September was 0.2% ahead of last year, whereas day case activity was up by 6.2% year on year.  There have been 24,636 emergency attendances to the end of September this year, a reduction of 5.7% on the same period last year.Mullingar hospital, in common with all other agencies, is required to manage its services within the approved allocation and to run its services within the approved employment ceiling.  It is envisaged that the hospital will break even this year and will be within its employment ceiling by end of year.  There are no plans to increase the number of nurses employed in the hospital.  At the end of October, there were 289.5 whole-time equivalents on the nursing staff, an increase of one whole-time equivalent on the same month last year.In November, patients were transferred from old accommodation in Mullingar hospital to state-of-the-art accommodation in the newly upgraded wards at the hospital.  The new wards are a major improvement in terms of standard of care that can be afforded to patients.  Under the new arrangements, the number of inpatient beds has been reduced from 220 to 199, and the number of day beds has increased by 13 from 11 to 24.  In addition, there are five extra observation beds.These changes are very much in line with international practice, which aims to encourage a greater emphasis on the practice of day care medicine.  This is a well-established part of the HSE's transformation programme and it will lead to an increase in the overall number of patients treated in the hospital in 2010.  The adjustment in beds taking place will help to improve the position, thus making the hospital even more effective in providing care and treatment in the future.The revised bed complement in place as a result of the move to the new hospital has been fully endorsed by the consultant surgeons and consultant obstetricians at the hospital.  In addition, many discussions led by the clinical director have taken place with all relevant consultant staff at the hospital to increase the throughput of surgical and gynaecology work at the hospital.  The provision of additional day ward beds as detailed will facilitate this increase in workload.The hospital is arranging to carry out a bed utilisation study with a view to establishing that all beds within the hospital are being utilised to maximum effect and that all admission and discharge processes are being fully and effectively managed.  It is important to note that the current usage of day beds in Mullingar hospital is still behind the international norms for such bed utilisation.As previously noted, there has also been an increase in the number of observation unit beds from six to 11.  These beds are strategically located next to the emergency department to cater for the overflow of patients from that department, which can occur from time to time.  The hospital also intends to increase the throughput of patients through the medical assessment unit, which will also alleviate pressure in the emergency department.  I am confident that the hospital will continue to provide the best possible quality of care for all its patients.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	523	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise the issue.  As the Minister of State knows, the proposal to have Milltown sewerage scheme included for sanction by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government was originally included in a bundle of four schemes for Milltown, Claregalway, Craughwell and Carraroe.  It was probably one of the saddest days ever when four schemes like this were put together because it was obviously too big a bundle and there was no possibility of the four schemes proceeding together.I was very glad to hear that Milltown and Claregalway would proceed as two schemes, as they are most important.  Claregalway is in west Galway and Deputies from there have been making the case for that village.  However, I know more about Milltown because it is in north Galway in my constituency.  It is located on the N17 north of Tuam and it is one of the tidiest villages in the county.  It is appalling that it has taken 20 years to even get the scheme on a list for submission to the Department.  If sanction cannot be obtained for a sewerage scheme in the village, it will be difficult to cater for further development there.  A temporary sewerage scheme is in place on one estate in the village.  Milltown is on the River Clare, which flows into the River Corrib and, therefore, pollution is a serious threat.It is heartening, however, that sites are available for the sewerage schemes in both Claregalway and Milltown.  The local GAA club has made a site available in Milltown and the Planning and Development Acts has been availed of for both schemes.  There is no reason, therefore, that they should not proceed together.  Many building contractors would be glad of the opportunity to proceed with the schemes while maintaining the economies of scale required.  However, the lesson is there is no need to bundle schemes in large packages.  It might be better to proceed with one scheme, as happened in most cases in the pasts.  It is not good to bundle schemes but Galway County Council has submitted the schemes for Milltown and Claregalway as a bundle and they are on the Department's list.  I hope the Minister for State will have news that they will proceed together.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	524	Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta as an deis an scéal seo a shoiléiriú.My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, cannot be present and he asked me to take this matter on his behalf.  The Milltown and Claregalway sewerage schemes are both included for funding in the Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009.  When this programme was published in 2007, it was envisaged that Milltown and Claregalway would be advanced as part of a four-scheme bundle, which would also include the Craughwell and Carraroe schemes.  The preliminary reports for Claregalway and Milltown were approved by the Department in 2003 and 2004, respectively.  The contract documentation for these schemes was submitted to the Department for approval in 2008.  However, at that stage, the component relating to the collection networks was not accompanied by the certificate of completion of planning necessary for the examination of the contract documentation by the Department.  When the contract documentation was submitted for Milltown and Claregalway, Galway County Council also submitted a proposal to unbundle these schemes from the Craughwell and Carraroe schemes.  The Department is considering this proposal in the context of the examination of the contract documents.The Department works in close co-operation with Galway County Council in the progression of all the schemes in the county.  The schemes for Milltown and Claregalway are among the 50 major water and sewerage schemes included in current investment programme for County Galway.  The priority to be accorded to individual schemes is a matter, in the first instance, for Galway County Council.Last July, local authorities were asked to submit an assessment of needs for water and sewerage services in their areas to the Department by 23 October.  The Department is examining these assessments, which will form a key input to the development of the 2010 to 2012 water services investment programme.  In conducting their assessments, local authorities were asked to prioritise schemes and contracts for progression over the coming years based on key environmental and economic criteria.  The 2010 to 2012 programme will be a three-year rolling plan for the provision of major water supply and wastewater infrastructure.Strategic environmental and economic objectives have provided the rationale for investment in water services infrastructure since 2000.  With the changed economic climate, and the completion of the first cycle of river basin management plans by local authorities in the near future, there is a greater need than ever to focus on these key priorities.  The 2010 to 2012 programme will do this by prioritising projects that target public health and environmental compliance issues, support economic and employment growth, and offer best value for money.  The Department expects to publish the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012 early next year.  I assure the Deputy that the Department will work closely with Galway County Council to advance priority schemes identified in the programme.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	525	The recent floods that hit Cork city and county were the worst I have experienced.  Unlike serious flooding in the past, this was caused by a combination of heavy rainfall and, in particular, the opening of the dam at Inniscarra.  Before getting to the key questions that need to be answered, I would like to pay tribute to the emergency services of all the statutory bodies who were involved in providing relief to the people of Cork.  Those who at times question the effectiveness of public services should recognise the importance of the work they did immediately before and after the flooding.  Cork City Council front line staff provided relief for victims in homes and businesses.  The Garda, the Army and the HSE were also heavily involved.  I would also like to pay tribute to the staff of the parks and roads departments.  They provided relief for those whose water was cut off for more than a week, including myself.Last night Mr. Joe Gavin, Cork city manager, presented a report to the city councillors, which revealed that three warnings issued by the ESB in the 12 hours before the city began to flood significantly underestimated the volume of water the company would release through its dam in Inniscarra.  The report states the ESB delivered three warnings to the council on 19 November at 11.30 a.m., 5 p.m. and 10.10 p.m.  The final warning, which was sent less than an hour before the city began to flood, said discharge levels would increase up to 450 cubic metres per second.  The city then experienced what has been described by one victim as "a mini-tsunami" causing millions of euro worth of damage throughout the city and also putting lives at risk.  The report also states that, at a meeting at 4 p.m. the following day, the ESB revealed that in the hours after its final warning it had been forced to increase the discharge of water through the Inniscarra dam to 535 cubic metres per second but the company, significantly, said it was fully satisfied with its role in the management of the floods and with the adequacy of warnings to the local authorities.In raising this issue on the Adjournment, I believe that nothing short of a public inquiry into the flooding in Cork will satisfy the victims of the floods.  In the time available, I cannot deal with the issues of the quay walls or the availability of relief funding for victims whose homes and businesses were destroyed but I support the speedy implementation of relief schemes.  What has happened has happened with all its tragic consequences for many people but we must apply ourselves to ensure such a catastrophe never happens again.Many questions remain about the effectiveness of the warning system and the plans to protect the city from similar events in the future.  Why were businesses and homeowners not given an effective advance warning that would have allowed them to protect their property?  What prompted the ESB to make the decision to release the huge volume of water from the Inniscarra dam?  Did the ESB release water from the dam in the weeks and months before the flooding to minimise the effects of heavy rainfall?  Was the structural integrity of the dam under threat?  How much funding will be needed to reinforce the city's quay walls?  Is there a need to examine how development on flood plains played a part in exacerbating the severity of the floods?  What can be done in the long term to protect the city's water supply from being hit by flooding again?A journalist in the Cork Evening Echo, Mr. Ronan Bagnall, set out these questions in a recent issue of the newspaper and he quoted an ESB spokesman who said that it would vigorously defend its management of the unprecedented flood of the River Lee in a forthcoming review.  That review must be a fully transparent public inquiry into the events leading up to the flood.  As this is the only format that will satisfy the victims of the flood, it must be done in a totally open manner.  An internal review involving the agencies and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will not be sufficient.  The principles of transparency and accountability must be upheld.  In his reply I hope the Minister of State will accede to the request for a full public inquiry and not a half-hearted review.  All of the facts must come out.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	526	The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, has asked local authorities, including Cork City Council, for reports on the effects of the recent flooding in their areas and an assessment of the measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of such flooding in the future.  The Deputy will appreciate that the Minister does not have responsibility for the activities of the Electricity Supply Board and he awaits the report from Cork City Council which I am sure will cover the recent events relating to the release of water by the ESB.Primary responsibility for flood risk management rests with the Office of Public Works, which has the lead agency role for devising and implementing measures, including flood relief schemes, to deal with flooding in Ireland.  With regard to measures to be taken against future flood risks in the Cork city area, the OPW commissioned the river Lee catchment flood risk assessment and management study, in conjunction with Cork County Council and Cork City Council in 2006, as the pilot study for the national flood risk assessment management programme.  The objective of the study is to identify and map existing and potential future flood risk areas in the river Lee catchment, through detailed hydrological and hydraulic modelling and flood-mapping.  Once the flood risk has been quantified and mapped throughout the catchment, with particular focus on developed areas, or areas under potential development pressure, a catchment flood risk management plan is developed, which includes a prioritised set of actions, measures and works to manage the flood risk in the catchment.In light of the recent flood events of November 2009 and the subsequent need to study the new data, the timeframe for completion has been extended to allow for a review of the risks and proposed options.  Once this review is complete, the flood risk management plan and associated strategic environmental assessment will be published by the OPW, along with the flood maps, for formal public consultation early in the new year.  After all relevant comments from this consultation have been addressed in the catchment flood risk management plan, the study will be complete and the recommendations will be put forward for implementation on a phased basis.When the various reports and the above mentioned study are complete, the position will be much clearer for all the parties concerned.  Separately, the national director of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management has been asked to carry out a review of the operational procedures of the framework for major emergency management during the flooding event.The Minister would like to thank the city and county council staff, together with the Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces and voluntary bodies, for all the work they undertook during the recent flooding event.  Although the major emergency response procedures operated well, the Minister is, of course, very conscious of the distress and disturbance that individuals and their families continue to experience as a result of the flooding.

This is totally unsatisfactory.  The ESB must be held accountable and the Minister of State has stated that the Minister has no responsibility for the ESB.  Somebody must have responsibility.

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	528	I will share a moment of my time with Deputy John Browne.I request that Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and his Government colleagues to ensure that malt and malting barley production is retained in Ireland as a condition of any proposed sale of Greencore Malt to a foreign food company.  We are all concerned at reports in the media in recent weeks of the sale of Greencore Malt.  A number of approaches have been received by Greencore plc.  I understand a French company, Soufflet, visited Ireland more than a week ago to inspect the various facilities of Greencore Malt as part of this process.Approximately 1,500 Irish farmers grow 130,000 tonnes of malting barley each year and this has been the case for generations with an excellent tradition in many counties, including Laois, Kildare, Carlow and Wexford.  It is a valuable premium crop and I am concerned that if this does not continue those farmers would grow feed barley, leading to an excess of feed barley production in the country, with a knock-on effect on prices.  There is a malting plant in Athy and depots in Stradbally and Emo in County Laois and I am concerned at reports that they may close early in the new year.  I also understand there are four depots in Wexford.Greencore Malt was formed at the beginning of 2000 with the integration of three Greencore-owned malting companies, namely, Minch Malt in Ireland, Belgomalt in Belgium, and Pauls Malt in the UK.  The company has 500,000 tonnes of malting barley in the three countries and the proposed purchaser, Soufflet, already has 1.5 million tonnes of malting barley.  If it succeeds in this takeover it will be the biggest malt processor in Europe and perhaps the world.I also want to highlight the fact that there is a very strong Guinness link through the Smithwicks brand to this malting barley and Guinness trades on its Irishness.  It is essential that Irish malting barley continues to supply Guinness.  If this link is broken it could have a knock-on effect for the Guinness operation in Ireland.  I sincerely hope this does not happen.Here we go again with Greencore.  It closed the Irish sugar industry and thousands of farmers, employees and excellent plants in Carlow and Mallow were thrown to the wind with no benefit to the Irish consumer.  Greencore is nothing but an asset-stripping company.  It is like a pack of vultures and it is at it here again.  That is why I call on the Minister and his colleagues to refer any proposed purchase of Greencore Malt to the EU competition authorities.  The purchase by Soufflet would create a new company that would have too much dominance and may abuse it in due course.  It would be the biggest malting processor in Europe if it succeeds.Will the Minister call in the chief executive of Greencore and demand guarantees on the continued growing of malting barley and the continuation of malting in Ireland if Greencore decides to sell Greencore Malt and it is approved by the EU.  I am very concerned about the future of farmers in this regard.

Wexford, Carlow, Kilkenny and Laois have been to the forefront in growing malting barley through the generations.  It is recognised that they produce the best malting barley in Europe and they have consistently done so.  I am concerned that Greencore does not have a commitment to ensure that malting barley will continue to be grown here.  To lose this valuable product would devastate the farming sector in the south east.  There would also be a loss of jobs in the depots in County Wexford, including the Minch depot in Enniscorthy and three others.We already lost the beet industry, which was a major loss to farmers in the south east and it would devastate them completely if we lost the malting barley industry.  Despite the fact that Greencore is a commercially independent company I expect the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department to ensure that in any sale it would protect the livelihoods of our malting barley growers and ensure that malting barley growing and malt production would continue in this country for many years to come.As Deputy Fleming indicated, Guinness and malting barley production go hand in hand in Ireland.  It would be a major blow to the economy if a company from France purchases Greencore Malt and closes down production here.  There is a genuine fear among farmers in the south east that this will happen.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure that it does not happen and also that the livelihoods of farmers involved in growing malting barley will be protected.

This association was formalised in 1971 when my Department and Guinness agreed to share the operating costs of the programme.  The programme ceased in 2002, due mainly to Guinness withdrawing from it.A number of other significant developments also took place in the brewing industry in Ireland at that time: first, Guinness was subsumed into a new operating company, Diageo, and decided to cease buying malting barley from growers and instead purchase finished malt from malting companies; and, second, the Greencore Malting Group was formed at the beginning of 2000 following the integration of the three Greencore-owned malting companies, namely, Pauls Malt in the UK, Minch Malt in Ireland and Belgomalt in Belgium.These changes facilitated the introduction of a new operating relationship and cost structure programme between the Department and the malting industry whereby maltsters identified the varieties for entry into official trials and became involved in replicating the trials; and the Department continued official trialling of the varieties and submitted samples from the trials as well as issuing the appropriate results and reports.  The industry paid an annual cost to the Department for this service.While this arrangement has worked well from an operational point of view, the number of malting barley varieties being trialled has decreased significantly in the past decade.  There has been an increased focus and discussion between maltsters — particularly Greencore, which is the main purchaser of malting barley in Ireland — and growers' representatives with regard to the prices being paid.  The issue of prices paid for malting barley in Ireland is a matter for growers and malting companies.I am aware of recent press coverage suggesting that Greencore may be exiting the malting industry by selling off its operation.  While my Department, particularly in light of its involvement in the trialling, will be monitoring developments, the issue of the sale of the company by Greencore is a commercial matter for those involved and I cannot become involved in any formal way in that regard.  However, I will discuss the matter with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, in order to discover what action might be taken.

It is essential that we prioritise patient safety and quality and that we organise and manage services accordingly.  The priority is to provide safe services as close as possible to where people live.In the past, Roscommon County Hospital and Portiuncula Hospital operated independently.  Advances in clinical care and ever-increasing levels of specialisation mean that this model of care faces important practical difficulties which must be addressed.  The difficulties faced by Roscommon and Portiuncula in maintaining surgical services independently, and the need for closer co-operation between them, were highlighted by the former Comhairle na nOspidéal in March, 2006.The best way of retaining and of developing services at Roscommon County and Portiuncula Hospitals is for these hospitals to work closely together and for both to co-ordinate their activities with University College Hospital, Galway.The Health Service Executive (HSE) concluded a review of surgical and anaesthetic services at Roscommon County and Portiuncula Hospitals in mid-2008.  In light of this review, the Executive is proceeding with the re-configuration of the surgical and anaesthetic departments of the two hospitals into a Joint Department of Surgery and Anaesthesia.  As part of this plan a joint clinical director was appointed this year and joint consultant appointments are being progressed that involve sessional commitments at Roscommon County Hospital and at Portiuncula Hospital.  In total, there will be five consultant surgeons serving the two hospitals.  A new consultant surgeon post was recently filled.  A replacement consultant surgeon post is in the process of being filled.In addition, two consultant physicians with sessional commitments at Roscommon, Portiuncula and Galway University Hospital have been recruited and are expected take up their posts in the early part of 2010.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	535	I am assured by the HSE that Community Welfare Service staff, throughout the country, have been providing huge support to families every day since the flooding occurred.   Community Welfare Service staff continue to work tirelessly on the ground in locations where flooding took place.  Additional clinics have been arranged and emergency financial and other assistance has been made available to households including emergency accommodation.  The Humanitarian Assistance Scheme is being set up to provide means-tested financial support to people who have suffered damages to their homes.  An initial sum of €10 million has been set aside by the Government for this purpose.  The scheme is being administered by the Community Welfare Service of the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.The level of payment available under the aid scheme to any qualified individual will depend on the severity of the damage to that person's home and the extent of the loss experienced as well as household income and general family circumstances.  HSE West in Galway and Galway County Council have begun to contact people whose homes have been affected by the flooding in the county to establish their needs e.g. furniture, clothing and medicine.  People who are experiencing hardship due to the unprecedented flooding in County Galway in recent days are encouraged to phone their local Community Welfare Officer in their local Health Centre and an appointment will be arranged as quickly as possible. There is no need to wait to see a CWO at a public clinic.The HSE in Galway has set up a Counselling Helpline to assist people who have been affected by the stress of the recent flooding in Co. Galway. This Helpline is staffed by psychology and social work professionals.  In addition, a separate HSE Information Line, telephone number 1800 283 036, has been established to advise people on the practical services that are available to assist them following the flooding in their particular county.

The brief was to consider the current provision of adult critical care services in the public health system and to provide advice on the appropriate model and configuration of critical care provision.  It was also asked to advise on related matters such as appropriate governance arrangements, HR, work practice, clinical audit and training issues, as well as supporting provisions such as transport and infrastructure.The Prospectus Team included four international advisors, together with two critical care experts nominated by the Intensive Care Society.  Their work included site visits to each of 37 hospitals with Critical Care facilities, a 30-day survey and audit of critical care activity in each hospital, stakeholder consultation and a review of best international practice.The HSE has recently received the final report and is examining it at present.  This is a significant piece of work, which will inform decisions about the future provision and organisation of this key element of the acute hospital system. A date for publication of the report has not been decided as yet.

As part of its work the Group addressed issues raised by the Irish National Audit of Stroke Care 2008 including the organisation of stroke services, the development of stroke units, the provision of thrombolysis, as well as models for rehabilitation and discharge planning.  The Report of the Policy Group is being finalised at present.In parallel my Department and the Health Service Executive are developing an Implementation Plan.  This will include a  Stroke Programme. The aim of this programme will be to prevent stroke and to deliver high quality care to patients with stroke in order to reduce the number of deaths and the number of patients with severe disability.Both of these reports will be brought to Government shortly with a view to publication.

I also made a commitment to the group to establishing a full statutory investigation should this review so recommend it.The Terms of Reference for this review, which I announced on 29 October 2009, are as follows:To examine and recommend to the Minister for Health and Children:(a) Whether a further investigation into the procedures and practices operating at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital  Drogheda during the period 1964 to 1995 to protect patients from sexual abuse while undergoing treatment or care at the hospital and to deal with allegations of sexual abuse against Mr Michael Shine, would be likely to provide additional information or insights which would be of significant public benefit in helping to improve present best practice guidelines and policies (including the Children First Guidelines), which apply to the treatment of patients in hospital for the purpose of protecting such patients from being sexually abused.(b)  The examination and recommendation should have regard to:1. The report of the Independent Review Group (1996);2. Current guidelines and policy concerning the treatment of patients in hospital, including the Children First Guidelines and relevant rules of professional conduct and medical ethics;3. The views of groups or individuals representing complainants including the group Dignity 4 Patients;4. The need to avoid prejudicing ongoing civil or criminal proceedings or investigations.I am satisfied that these terms of reference allow the review to give support groups, including Dignity 4 Patients, and of course all concerned groups and individuals, an opportunity to engage with the process, present their views, be heard in full and have those views taken into account in the outcome of the review.I hope to be in a position to confirm who will be the independent person undertaking the review very shortly.

Final figures for 2009 have yet to be compiled by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre of the HSE.   The increase in the number of new diagnoses in recent years has arisen largely due to the increase in population over that time and the inward flow of immigrants from areas of high endemic HIV.  Figures for 2008 and the increase in the first two quarters of 2009 also showed a particular increase in the number of diagnoses among men who have sex with men.HIV prevention requires a multi-sectoral approach involving statutory and voluntary agencies as well as people living with HIV.  This approach has been promoted through the National AIDS Strategy Committee.  The implementation of Relationships and Sexuality Education in schools as part of the national curriculum is a basic component of the prevention strategy.  The health and education sectors work in partnership with NGOs to support schools in the delivery of this curriculum in a manner that aims to meet the needs of young people, with more specifically designed programmes for young people most at risk.  Ongoing investment is also made by the health sector in delivering safer sex messages to the broader youth population through direct advertising and marketing campaigns in places of entertainment etc.  These campaigns have become a key part of the sexual health promotion infrastructure in Ireland and over the past 15 years have continued to reinforce the core message of condom use and early testing.The  National AIDS Strategy Committee's HIV and AIDSEducation and Prevention Plan 2008-2012  was launched last year to provide a roadmap for HIV and AIDS Education and Prevention.  It presents six key areas for action among seven population groups at particular risk of HIV infection.  The plan was developed by the Education and Prevention sub-committee of the National AIDS Strategy Committee and was informed by research conducted by NUI Galway and by the findings of the Irish Study of Sexual Health and Relationships.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	543	There are approximately 3.2 million outpatient attendances a year at public hospital outpatient departments (OPDs).  I am determined to improve access to OPD services, which represent one of the key points of access to the acute hospital system.  This is reflected in the HSE's National Outpatient Department Service Improvement Programme, the principal aims of which are to:Increase the number of new patients seenReduce waiting times for patientsReduce the number of patients who do not attend for their scheduled appointments (DNAs) andEnsure that all patients are seen within 30 minutes of their appointment time.The programme is currently focusing on increasing new attendances, concentrating initially on the specialties of dermatology, orthopaedics and otolaryngology.  Individual hospitals have identified and implemented initiatives to reduce waiting-times and to improve new attendance numbers, such as additional patient slots and clinics (including evening clinics); partial booking systems; centralised referral and booking systems; discharge policy initiatives; and reducing the frequency of return visits.  Work is also being undertaken to validate waiting lists to ensure that they reflect only patients actually waiting to be seen.The Service Improvement Programme includes work to enable comprehensive out-patient waiting list data for all hospitals to be collated and analysed on a standardised national basis.  At present, however, the HSE is not in a position to provide the specific information sought by the Deputy.The findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General in his 2008 Report were, I believe, reflective of the fact that, until recently, this significant area of acute hospital activity had not been the subject of an integrated national approach.  The Comptroller's report acknowledged the work being undertaken under the HSE's Service Improvement Programme and the considerable advances already made in relation to the cataloguing of outpatient waiting lists and the reporting of waiting-times.The HSE has indicated that there were almost 4,000 additional new attendances in dermatology, otolaryngology and orthopaedics in the period January to September 2009 compared to the same period in 2008, bringing the number of new attendances in these specialties for the period to over 128,000.OPD performance is one of a number of acute hospital service priorities which, from 2010, will be the subject of a system of specific performance management arrangements in order to support the achievement of targets for access to services.

However, 328 or 34.7% were waiting between one and three months and 35 or 3.7% were waiting more than three months.Figures provided by the HSE for 29 November last show that numbers waiting longer than the target time for urgent colonoscopy were down significantly to 151 or 18.4% of urgent referrals, of whom one patient is waiting longer than three months. The HSE has advised that action is being taken to bring the total number waiting longer than one month to zero by mid-December.A performance indicator covering this issue will be included in the HSE's 2010 Service Plan, with formal monthly reporting on performance.I understand that the HSE is separately compiling details of waiting times for routine colonoscopy examinations.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	548	I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 67 together.I am aware of the potential shortage of General Practitioners (GPs) highlighted in the recent ESRI Report and the June 2009 FÁS Report.There is currently one model of GP Training in Ireland, which is provided by the Irish College of General Practitioners (ICGP).  This is a four year model, with 2 years based in hospital rotations and 2 years on an approved GP training programme.  At present, there are 120 GP training places per year.The Health Service Executive (HSE) has been working on an ongoing basis to address the deficit in the number of new general practitioners entering the Irish health service each year.  This work, to date, has focused on a proposal to the ICGP to substantially increase the intake of GP trainees from July 2010 onwards. This proposed increase is being considered in the context of the re-organisation of GP training structures and resources to reflect the regional organisation of the HSE.  This proposal is part of ongoing discussions between the Executive and the ICGP.The HSE is also in discussion with the Irish College of General Practitioners to identify a mechanism of up-skilling long term locums or assistants who are not eligible for GMS contracts because they have not undertaken/passed the Membership of the Irish College of General Practitioners (MICGP) examination and have not obtained membership of the College through the award of a Certificate of Satisfactory Completion of Training (CSCT) from the Medical Council.  An alternative model of training has been discussed to enable them to access the specialist register and thus become eligible to take on GMS posts.Other measures to address the GP manpower issue include:A list of GMS GP posts has been advertised centrally on the HSE Website.A recruitment drive is being undertaken in the UK and EU countries to attract qualified GPs to Ireland.The HSE is encouraging GP assistantships and partnerships in relation to upcoming retirements.The HSE is issuing new GMS panels in regions urgently requiring additional GPs.Some restrictions on entry to the GMS Scheme have been removed.The retirement provisions for GPs holding contracts under the GMS and other schemes have been extended.The HSE is continuing to develop Primary Care Teams and Primary Care Centres so that GPs applying for posts are attracted to high quality, well supported posts in suitable premises.  To date, 145 Primary Care Teams have been established.  These are centred on multidisciplinary team working, which reduces the need for GPs to carry out duties which are more appropriate for other team members and ensures that patient care is provided on a combined team-based approach.I am confident that these measures will have a positive impact on any potential shortage in GP numbers.  However, I will continue to liaise with the HSE, the training bodies and relevant organisations to ensure that appropriate measures are implemented to deal with any threat to the numbers of GPs.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	549	CervicalCheck commenced on 1 September 2008.  Under the Programme women aged 25-44 will be screened every 3 years and women aged 45-60 will be screened every 5 years.  For the first year CervicalCheck operated on an open access system of screening to ensure that the initial expected interest from women could be effectively accommodated.  It was always intended that CervicalCheck would move to population-based organised screening in line with best international practice. Accordingly, on completion of its first year in operation in September 2009, the Programme changed to an organised call, re-call system of invitation. This change will ensure that an effective and efficient population approach to screening that maximises target population coverage is maintained.CervicalCheck has proven very successful during its first year of operation with unprecedented numbers of women attending for screening.  CervicalCheck has a national register of women aged 25 to 60.  Over each screening round, all eligible women aged 25 to 60 will be invited for screening. The system will ensure that the delivery of population screening is spread evenly over the three to five year screening cycle.The criteria for eligibility under the Programme are clearly set out on the CervicalCheck website.  Any woman who has not had a smear test in the last three years can fast-track into the Programme simply by registering online, by completing and returning a form by Freepost, or by calling CervicalCheck on Freephone1800 45 45 55 to request an invitation.  Currently the average waiting time for such an invitation is three weeks.  Certain women are eligible for a free smear test without a CervicalCheck invitation letter.  These include women aged over 60 who have never had a smear test and women of any age post colposcopy.  CervicalCheck will process a woman's smear test without a letter of invitation, if it is the opinion of her smeartaker that she is at risk of not responding to a CervicalCheck invitation letter, or unlikely to avail of the fast track opt-in facility that is available to her.Since the introduction of the call-recall system around 30,000 fast-track opt-in letters have been issued in addition to over 95,000 randomly generated invitation letters.

The Commission further recommended that the licensing system should be implemented on a phased basis, starting with acute hospitals and other facilities based on analysis of potential risk to patient safety.   These recommendations were accepted by Government in January, 2009.  In line with the recommendations, my Department is now developing legislative proposals for a mandatory licensing system to cover both public and private healthcare providers, based on explicit standards to be set by the Health Information and Quality Authority.   I intend to bring such proposals to Government next year.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	551	My Department and the HSE have implemented a number of reforms to reduce the cost of medicines.Under the terms of the current agreements between the HSE and pharmaceutical manufacturers which govern the supply terms, conditions and prices of medicines supplied under the GMS and other community drug schemes, price cuts of 35% are applied to all off-patent proprietary products for which generic alternatives are available on the Irish market. A report published by the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics in May 2009 estimated that approximately €250 million will be saved due to off-patent price cuts, up to September 2010, when the agreements come up for renewal.Since September 2006 a larger basket of reference countries has been used for determining the prices of new products accepted for reimbursement under the State drugs schemes. The current agreements also permit price adjustments to reflect price changes in the reference countries.This year I reduced the wholesale mark-up payable on medicines from 17.66% to 10% and reduced the retail mark-up payable under certain schemes from 50% to 20%. Savings from the measures have been estimated at €55 million for 2009 and €133 million on a full year basis.My Department and the HSE support the increased use of generics where this is appropriate. All options for containing pharmaceutical expenditure, including generic substitution by pharmacists, the promotion of more cost-effective prescribing by GPs, and the greater use of quality prescribing indicators are under consideration. It is my intention to introduce a system of reference pricing combined with generic substitution. My Department and the HSE are examining options to progress this initiative, which has the best potential to promote the usage of cheaper generic or off-patent medicines and provide further savings from reductions in prices.  I expect to see significant progress on this next year, including the identification and implementation of legislative and administrative changes needed to give it effect.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	552	I propose to take Questions Nos. 65, 91 and 93 together.The health insurance levy is part of the interim scheme provided for under the Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  This interim scheme consists of two distinct elements:(i) age-related tax credit provided at source to private health insurers in respect of persons over the age of 50 who hold private health insurance policies. This aims to secure a health  policy objective of achieving inter-generational solidarity in terms of assisting  individuals to meet their health insurance costs on the basis of age, and(ii) a levy charged on private health insurance companies for each insured person in order to fund the age related tax relief so that the scheme remains cost neutral to the Exchequer.I would like to stress that the levy is placed on private health insurance providers for each insured individual, and not on individuals themselves.  It is a matter for the insurers to decide whether or how much of the levy they pass on to their customers.  Insurers with a disproportionate share of older people will be net beneficiaries. Insurers with mostly younger customers will also have some older customers and receive tax credits in respect of those customers also.This interim scheme will be in place for a three year period commencing on 1 Jan 2009 and, for cashflow reasons, running into 2012.  Officials in my Department along with the Health Insurance Authority are now working on a new scheme of risk equalisation to replace the interim scheme.As Minister for Health and Children, I have no role to play in the setting of prices by any of the private health insurance providers. This is a commercial decision for the insurer concerned.  Health insurance prices can be affected by a range of economic considerations including the costs of health care services and other costs and may also reflect the age profile of the customers in any insurer's customer base.  The interim scheme is not designed to prohibit price changes, in either direction, and could not be designed to do so.  Rather, the scheme's purpose is to counter commercial incentives for insurers to focus on younger age groups, and to underpin the principle of community rating, so that insured older persons are less likely to face higher increases and/or product segmentation due to their age.The Government's clear policy objective is that health insurance should remain affordable to a large number of people, particularly to older and sicker people.  To this end, community rating must be the cornerstone of the Irish health insurance market.  The viability of the system relies on the effective operation of solidarity between different generations through which the young subsidise the healthcare costs of the elderly and are subsidised in their turn by the following generation.  Health insurance should not be risk-rated for increasing age, medical status or claims history.Sustaining community rating requires a legally and financially robust system of risk equalisation to ensure cross-subsidisation across the entire market, not just within each company's cohort of customers or among the holders of each health insurance contract.  As I mentioned, work is now underway to replace the temporary levy and tax relief arrangement with such a robust system of risk equalisation.

This includes additional staffing (24.17WTE) that transferred into my Department during the year as a result of the transfer of youth affairs responsibilities from the Department of Education and Science, other functions from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the dissolution of the National Council on Ageing and Older People and the Women's Health Council under the rationalisation of agencies programme.  Even allowing for these increases, the overall number of people employed has fallen by 39.23 WTEs since January 2009.Staffing levels in my Department over the coming years will be decided in consultation with the Department of Finance and taking account of the report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes.  Account will also be taken of the outcome of the review of my Department under the Organisational Review Programme (ORP), which is being carried out under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach.  The ORP Report on the review of my Department is expected shortly.

However, the Government decided on 4 December last that the overall proposals put forward by the Public Service Committee did not provide an acceptable alternative to pay cuts. According, the Government were unable to agree to the terms they had proposed and they are now proceeding to implement their plan to reduce the public service pay and pensions bill by €1.3bn next year compared with 2009.

The duration of the programme will be determined by the uptake rates within the targeted groups.To date over 1.3 million doses of vaccine have been distributed to general practitioners, Mass Vaccination Clinics and Hospitals.Those initially targeted by the HSE are those aged 6 months to under 65 years with medical conditions that place them at increased risk of developing influenza, healthcare workers, children aged 5 months to 18 years and those aged 65 years and over.The School Vaccination Programme commenced on 30th November 2009 initially targeting larger schools. The School Vaccination Programme will continue into early 2010.The Influenza Like Illness (ILI) rates have continued to fall over recent weeks now standing at 93.6 per 100,000.  The numbers of confirmed H1N1 cases who were hospitalised and admitted to ICU are also decreasing.Enhanced surveillance and infection control measures are in place to ensure that patients in hospital do not contract H1N1.

The most recent figures provided to my Department by the HSE reflect the position as at 1st November 2009.  These figures show that there were 1,461,207 medical card holders and 95,905 GP visit card holders on that date.  Since the start of 2009, the number of persons with a medical card or GP visit card has increased by 109,087 and 10,359 respectively.

Having considered the matter in some detail the Commission decided against conducting such an Inquiry under the Human Rights Commission Act, 2000.The Commission recommended that I review a previous decision not to establish an external review of the practice.  Significant efforts had been made previously by the Department's Chief Medical Officer, via the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and through international contacts, to source a suitable reviewer.  Progress was made in identifying and sourcing a suitable candidate who later became unavailable due to work commitments.  However, the Survivors of Symphysiotomy, another patient support group, subsequently expressed reservations over the choice of reviewer.  Thereafter it did not prove possible to source an independent expert.  My Department remains in correspondence with the Commission in relation to the matter and will give priority consideration to the letter from the Joint Committee in that context.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	558	The Renewed Programme for Government re-affirms the Government's commitment to the current co-location programme.Preferred bidders have been selected for six co-located projects at Beaumont, Cork University, Limerick Regional, St. James's, Sligo and Waterford Regional Hospitals. Project agreements have been signed for the Beaumont, Cork, Limerick and St James's projects. Planning permission has been granted in respect of the first three projects. A planning application has been made for the St James's project.Two further projects at Connolly and Tallaght Hospitals are at earlier stages of the procurement process.The HSE has estimated that, from the start of building, the overall construction and commissioning period for the projects will be about 28 to 36 months.The co-location programme is a complex public procurement process.  It is a matter for each successful bidder to arrange its finance under the terms of the relevant Project Agreement.  It is certainly the case that the funding environment has changed significantly and this has affected both the public and private sectors.  The co-location initiative, like other major projects, has to deal with this situation.  The HSE is continuing to work with the successful bidders to provide whatever assistance it can to help them advance the projects.The Finance Act 2009 provides that the schemes of capital allowances for private hospitals and certain other health facilities will be terminated on 31 December 2009, subject to transitional arrangements for projects already in development. Where planning permission is required, the qualifying condition for a termination date beyond 31 December 2009 is that a valid application for full planning permission be submitted on or before that date and be acknowledged by the relevant planning authority. In such cases, the termination date in the case of qualifying hospitals is 31 December 2013.Provided that a hospital project conforms to the requirements of these transitional arrangements, and otherwise satisfies the general requirements of the scheme of capital allowances, the tax relief will apply.  This includes co-location projects should they wish to arrange their financing on the basis of the capital allowances scheme. The value of the tax relief in each case will depend on the level of qualifying capital expenditure incurred.  No tax expenditure has been incurred so far and none will be incurred until construction is completed and services are opened.

When the Government has agreed on the budget allocation for the HSE, it will then be a matter for the Health Service Executive to decide the allocations to individual agencies following on from the Government's budgetary decisions. Until such time as the HSE is notified of its budget, it is not is a position to say what resources will be provided to Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin for 2010.Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin (OLCHC) is addressing the challenge of delivering a high quality service to its patients, while remaining within budget.  The hospital is committed to providing the full level of services that it promised in its 2009 Service Plan.OLCHC is the National Centre for Paediatric Cardiology & Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.  The demand for paediatric cardiac surgery has increased due to increased birth rate and the success rates for children who then require further staged surgery.  OLCHC is carrying out significantly more cardiac operations than 3 years ago. Clinical need or timing for surgery is determined by evidence based best medical practice and the optimal timing for surgery is decided by the multidisciplinary team at the weekly Joint Cardiac Conference at the hospital. In light of the issues attached to the Cardiac Programme, it has been protected from the theatre closures put in place by the hospital for breakeven purposes.The HSE have worked with the Paediatric Critical Care Network (PCCN) to address the issue of the need for additional paediatric intensive care beds.  A new build that will include the replacement of 13 paediatric intensive care beds and an additional 4 beds, providing a total of 17 beds, has been agreed as a new development at Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin.  A Design Team has been appointed and work is well underway on this development.  It is anticipated that the new development will be completed within an eighteen month programme and is therefore scheduled to be opened in 2011.  Provision is also being considered for potential future expansion to provide 5 additional ICU beds, subject to approval.  If this phase was to be implemented it would then bring the total number of ICU beds at OLCHC to 30.On an interim basis to address the current waiting list for paediatric cardiac patients, the HSE are in discussions with OLCHC and an initiative will commence shortly in relation to this list.  It is intended to manage the Cardiology waiting lists in the same way as the waiting lists for patients with scoliosis were managed with OLCHC earlier this year.

The Government is committed to reducing the general government deficit as part of its strategy for economic recovery which will require a reduction in the level of public spending over the coming years.  The HSE's estimate will be set in this context and the Executive will be required to operate within tight spending parameters, while meeting the objective of maintaining population health and access to services.Following the Budget, the HSE will submit its National Service Plan 2010 for my approval under the Health Act 2004.  The Plan will set out the type and volume of services to be provided by the Executive and once approved, will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in line with Section 31(13) of the Act.  The HSE will be required to operate within the limits of its Voted allocation in delivering at a minimum, the levels of service which are provided for in the Plan.  During 2010, the HSE will provide me with detailed information related to service activity levels by way of monthly Performance Monitoring Reports against the Plan.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	564	Health Care Associated Infections (HCAIs) continue to be a challenge for healthcare systems worldwide.  Ireland is not unique in this regard and tackling HCAIs here continues to be a priority for the government and for the Health Service Executive (HSE).In March 2007, the HSE launched a National Infection Control Action Plan.  An Infection Control Steering Group is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the plan.  Over the period of the Plan the HSE aims to reduce HCAIs by 20%, MRSA infection by 30% and antibiotic consumption by 20%.A National Surveillance system was established by the HSE's Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) to collect data and provide information to monitor HCAIs in our health system.  The number of MRSA bloodstream infections across the public and private hospital sector for the past three years are — 588 cases in 2006, 536 cases in 2007 and 435 cases in 2008.  This shows a significant decrease of over 25% between 2006 and 2008.  The data is collated on a quarterly basis and for the first six months of 2009 the number of MRSA bloodstream infections was 191, a reduction of over 20% from the first six months of 2008 when cases numbered 241.Up until May 2008, Clostridium difficile  was not a notifiable disease and, as a result, it was difficult to quantify the extent of infection in the healthcare system.  Since May 2008, all cases are required to be notified to the relevant Department of Public Health.  These are reported on a weekly basis and the number of cases reported nationally from May to December 2008 was 1,624 and from January to 14th November was 1,733.  These figures which are within the range of 40 — 60 cases per week are consistent with the results of the last Prevalence Survey of HCAIs in acute hospitals in Ireland, Northern Ireland, England and Wales for 2006.In order to introduce measures to aid in the reduction of antibiotic prescribing, education campaigns for healthcare staff and the general public around the prudent use of antibiotics commenced last year.  The HSE launched a three week awareness campaign in November 2008 to highlight the importance of using antibiotics properly.  This coincided with the first European Antibiotic Awareness Day.  This year's Awareness Day on 18th November last built on last year's successful public education campaign.  Data on antibiotic consumption collected by the HPSC shows a welcome decrease in antibiotic consumption in 2008 for the first time since 2000.Earlier this year, new environmental guidelines to inform infection control policy in all new builds and refurbishments were published by the HSE.HIQA, since its establishment in 2007, has also taken significant steps in this area.  A core function of the Authority is to set standards on safety and quality of health services and to monitor enforcement of those standards in an open and transparent way.  In 2007, HIQA developed National Hygiene Standards and commenced a programme of audit against these Standards.  The Authority undertook a comprehensive inspection and review of hygiene in our acute public hospitals in 2007 and again in 2008.  This included unannounced visits by inspection teams.  The reports, which were published, represent a thorough assessment of how hygiene services are provided and managed in HSE-funded acute care hospitals.  HIQA noted that the standard of front-line services which was already very high in 2007 had been maintained in 2008 and that corporate governance was significantly improved.In May 2009, HIQA published its National Standards for the Prevention and Control of Health Care Associated Infections to provide an overall framework for health and social care providers to prevent or minimise the occurrence of HCAIs.  These Standards include all key areas of importance in the control of HCAIs namely governance, hygiene, microbiological services, antimicrobial resistance and surveillance systems as well as relevant aspects of the design of facilities.  Six months has been allowed for the development by the HSE of a self-assessment tool, gap analysis and implementation plan before HIQA commences its initial review.  The HSE has already made significant progress on this work and is in consultation with HIQA on the implementation of the Standards.I am satisfied that significant steps are being taken to reduce the rates of HCAIs generally and to treat them promptly when they occur.

In this regard, the Agency is working on a wide range of actions that include:A public awareness campaign which I launched in July 2009 entitled "Don't be manipulated" which highlights the existence of disingenuous agencies and promotes the availability of free, non-judgemental state-funded crisis pregnancy services;continuous promotion through the "Positive Options" campaign of the availability of free, non-judgemental and confidential state-funded crisis pregnancy counselling services;redevelopment of the "Positive Options" website to highlight the actions of disingenuous agencies and to give guidance on how to deal with same;prominent advertising of "Positive Options" and consumer tips in the Golden Pages, including the regional directories, under "Pregnancy Testing and Counselling" and "Family Planning" sections.  The use of a common logo for all state funded counselling services in current editions of the Directories;funding of resources which provide clear objective information on the adoption process.  The Agency provides information on adoption in manuals used in the training of bona-fide crisis pregnancy counsellors;expansion of crisis pregnancy counselling services nationally by over 50% since the Agency was established in 2001;guidance for crisis pregnancy counselling services in responding to third party complaints they may receive about "disingenuous" counselling services;standardised training and up-skilling for counsellors in state-funded crisis pregnancy counselling services.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	567	I understand the Deputy's question relates to the fees associated with the system of registering and inspecting nursing homes which commenced on 1 July, 2009.  The Health Act, 2007 Act provides for the following fees:Applications for registration or renewal of registration under Section 48.  This section states that the applicant shall include with the application the prescribed application fee.An annual fee payable by the registered provider under Section 99A fee for variation or removal of any conditions of the registration under Section 52.  A registered provider making an application under this section must include the fee with their application.The fees therefore are payable by the registered provider, or to be included by the applicant when applying for registration.I would point out that it is a matter for the registered provider to determine the price charged for services.  However the Deputy may be aware that article 28 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009 states that"(1) The registered provider shall agree a contract with the resident within one month of the admission of that resident to the designated centre.(2) Such contract shall deal with the care and welfare of the resident in the designated centre and shall include details of the services to be provided for that resident and the fees to be charged."Therefore, only those fees, including any agreed increases, set out in the contract should be charged by the registered provider to the resident.The Deputy will be aware that the new Nursing Homes Support Scheme came into operation on the 27th October 2009.  Under the scheme, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) negotiates prices for long-term residential care with private nursing home owners on behalf of the State.  The NTPF has accepted that the fees associated with the registration and inspection of nursing homes could be included as part of the reasonable day to day running costs associated with the provision of long-term residential care services and therefore can factor into these negotiations.

This legislation is a priority for the Government.  The Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, in conjunction with the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform, is currently preparing Draft Heads of a Bill for consideration by the Government.At a cross departmental level, it has been agreed that a single statutory agency should have responsibility for the management of all information, hard and soft, on child abuse in this jurisdiction.The Heads of Bill on Soft Information that will be presented to Government for approval will include a proposal that the Garda Vetting Unit, based in Thurles, will be put on a statutory basis and that this statutory body would have responsibility for the management of all soft and hard information.  What is envisaged is an agency led by the Garda with the HSE and any other relevant body working alongside them, similar in structure to the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) which has Garda, Revenue Commissioners and Social and Family Affairs co-located together under Garda leadership.

Ensuring patient safety is of paramount importance, so that people can have confidence in the services and that the best possible patient outcomes can be achieved.The HSE commissioned Horwath Consulting Ireland, in association with Teamwork Management Services, to carry out a review of acute hospital services in the HSE South, based on the principle of securing sustainable and clinically safe acute hospital services.  Professor John Higgins was appointed as Director of Reconfiguration of Acute Services, Cork and Kerry Region, in March 2009. The Teamwork report was launched publicly on 9 June 2009 and a Reconfiguration Forum was established to assist Professor Higgins and the HSE in the reconfiguration process.The Teamwork report proposed a single health care system for Cork and Kerry, with a new regional governance structure for hospitals and community to encompass the relationship between the health care system and the third level educational sector — UCC and Cork and Tralee ITs.  A key principle of the report is that, while no hospital in the region will close, all hospitals will fundamentally change the services delivered to their communities and how those services are delivered, as part of the region-wide delivery of health care.Because of the specific demographic and geographic challenges in Kerry, the report recommended that Kerry General Hospital retain current acute services within the regional structure.  In addition, the report of the Reconfiguration Subgroup on Emergency Services, published on 18 November, has recommended further development of Kerry General Hospital's twenty four hour emergency service, within a structured relationship with the regional emergency service network and including major trauma assistance from Cork University Hospital.Professor Higgins and his team will continue to work with clinicians and management to develop a new plan for the delivery of services in Cork and Kerry.

Ireland is not unique in this regard and tackling HCAIs here, including Clostridium difficile, continues to be a priority for the government and for the HSE.  National Guidelines for the Surveillance, Management and Control of C. difficile-associated disease continue to be implemented on an ongoing basis in both Our Lady of Lourdes and Our Lady’s Hospitals so as to minimise the impact of any outbreak of the disease on patients, staff and the general public.Emergency infection control procedures and practices were put in place as soon as the outbreak in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital was reported on the 28th of October.  These included an Outbreak Committee, convened in accordance with the national guidelines; increased restrictions on the use of certain antibiotics, laxatives and other drugs in line with expert advice and three wards in the hospital were identified and used to implement stringent isolation and control measures.  The above measures including decontamination of all clinical areas also took place in Our Lady's Hospital Navan after the announcement of the outbreak there on 13th November.During the peak of the outbreak, certain services at both hospitals were suspended and urgent cases were referred to other hospitals in the region and to the three North Dublin Hospitals.As the epidemiological curve related to the C. Difficile outbreak in both hospitals has tailed off these services have resumed since 2nd of December.  However, the following temporary changes remain in place: until the refurbishment of the orthopaedic service at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital is finalised in mid-late January 2010, hip fracture surgery for the over-65s will be carried out in Our Lady’s Hospital, Navan and no elective orthopaedic work will be carried out in Navan until hip fracture surgery resumes in Our Lady of Lourdes.Additional hygiene protection measures taken during the outbreak at both hospitals remain in force, being cognisant of the H1N1 Influenza (Swine Flu) threat.  Members of the public have been asked to only attend the Emergency Department at the Hospitals in the case of a genuine emergency and to contact their GP or out-of-hours services in the first instance.  Visiting restrictions as per National Hospital Guidelines will remain in place in all hospitals in Louth and Meath in an effort to protect patients and staff and prevent further spread of infection.I am satisfied that the C. difficile outbreak was managed appropriately.  The potential for similar situations in other regions cannot be ruled out but I am satisfied that significant steps are being taken to reduce the rate of HCAIs generally and to treat them promptly when they occur.

This Expert Group has been asked to examine how the existing system of resource allocation within the Irish public health service can be improved to support better the aims of the health reform programme.  I have asked this Group to recommend the best ways to achieve this within the level of resources available to health and, in the light of its work, to take a view on the most appropriate financing mechanism for the Irish health service.  The Group has been asked to report to me and the Minister for Finance by April 2010 and has not been asked to make an interim report.As part of its current deliberations the Expert Group sought submissions from the public and relevant interested groups/parties on the issues within its remit. Submissions from health sector unions were amongst the sixty one submissions received by the Group.  I would expect the Group to take account of all aspects of the health reform programme including the type of changes in service delivery which informed the discussions last week with health service trade unions.

The integration of Youth Affairs Unit into my Office is  providing continuity of service and operational experience as well as opening up greater opportunities for a more integrated, cohesive and effective approach to addressing the needs of children and young people.This integration has given my Office the opportunity to take a more comprehensive strategic view of the full breadth of work with young people in Ireland.  A review of the constituent units of my Office that will inform the development of strategic and coordinated polices for youth related services has commenced.With regard to the Youth Work Act, 2001, Section 1 provides for sections of the Act to be commenced at different stages. Sections 2-7, 17 and 18 have been commenced to date.The National Youth Work Advisory Committee has been reviewing the implementation of the Act.  I will consider the Committee's recommendations in the context of the role of my Office, its policies and strategies, while having due regard to developments to date.Work has also continued in 2009 in supporting the recommendations of the National Youth Work Development Plan including the areas of child protection, ongoing financial support for local youth clubs and groups, support for the North/South Education and Training Standards Committee for youth work and the finalisation of a Quality Standards Framework for the youth work sector.

When completed, the HSE Capital Plan will be submitted for my approval with the agreement of the Minister for Finance.  Details on the projects being progressed, including new starts from 2010, will be available when the plan is approved.A number of capital project proposals for agencies under the aegis of my Department are currently under consideration.  Details will be available when approvals are in place.The capital allocation within the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs will continue to support its ongoing programme of capital investment in the area of child care and young people's facilities and services.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	574	Under the General Medical Services (GMS) contract, either capitation or fee-per-item, the general practitioner (GP) undertakes to provide all proper and necessary treatment of a kind generally undertaken by a GP to these patients.Accordingly, under these contracts a GP should not demand or accept any payment or consideration for services provided by him/her, including blood tests, where they are indicated as part of a recognised treatment of an ongoing medical condition of a patient.I am aware that some GPs charge for the transport of patients' blood samples to the hospital as this is not covered under the GMS Scheme.  However, the option of attending the public hospital directly for phlebotomy services is always available to GMS clients.If the HSE is made aware of specific cases where GMS patients are being inappropriately charged by GP contractors, it will arrange to have such cases investigated as appropriate.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	575	The Implementation Plan for the recommendations of the Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse was accepted by Government and published in July 2009.  One of the key recommendations of the Implementation Plan is that an additional 270 additional social workers be recruited by the HSE between 2009 and 2011.As part of the overall approved employment control ceiling for 2009, my Department has provided written confirmation to the HSE that the general moratorium on recruitment, promotion and the payment of acting up allowances does not apply to specific designated grades, including social worker grades. This moratorium exemption provides for vacancies in existing posts in these grades to continue to be filled.  New social workers posts may also be created, up to a specified limit of 270, provided that the HSE is satisfied in each case that there is no scope to redeploy an equivalent post from the hospital sector to the primary and community care sector.  This moratorium exemption provides for an increase in the number of such posts, in line with Government policy, in order to meet the requirements of integrated care delivery and primary care needs particularly in respect of children at risk, the elderly and those with disabilities.A further key action of the Plan which is currently being implemented is the conversion of temporary social work posts to a permanent basis to address issues of continuity of care and staff retention within the child welfare and protection services.  The need to recruit further additional social workers beyond this cohort will be considered in the light of progress made in delivering necessary reforms in the child welfare and protection service.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	576	The Transformation Programme for the North East region has been informed by the 2006 Teamwork Report to the Health Service Executive (HSE) which demonstrated that the service configuration in the region was unsustainable.  A series of focused and necessary service changes are being implemented across the region.  This Programme is about the reshaping and integration of community and hospital services so individual members of the public will have access to better quality safe services, which they can have confidence in.  The majority of that care can and should be provided locally including in the community or at home wherever practical.A series of focused service changes are planned for the region. The Transformation Programme is reconfiguring services by moving acute and complex care from 5 hospital sites (Cavan, Monaghan, Drogheda, Dundalk and Navan) to 2 (Cavan for Cavan/Monaghan and Drogheda for Drogheda/Dundalk/Navan) and to ensure that services in the region are organised to optimise patient safety.  Acute medical care transferred from Monaghan General Hospital to Cavan General Hospital on the 22nd July 2009 and the immediate focus of the Transformation Programme is now on the Louth Meath services.The HSE has always given a clear commitment that as health services in the region are developed, existing services will remain in place until they are replaced with higher quality, safer or more appropriate services and this remains the case.  The service improvements, which will take place in the coming months include:A new Emergency Department (ED) at Our Lady of Lourdes HospitalA Medical Assessment Unit (MAU) at Our Lady of Lourdes HospitalAn enhanced ambulance serviceA proposed date for the transfer of acute medical care from the Louth County Hospital has not yet been determined and will be subject to a number of services being in place, but will occur on a phased basis.Finally, I must emphasise that the changes proposed by the HSE are fully supported by me for reasons of patient safety.  The HSE will work with all stakeholders to bring about the improvements in a carefully planned way that puts patients first.In that regard I met with Louth Hospital — Save Our Hospital Services Committee, with the HSE and emphasised these objectives.  I understand the Clinical Directors and Senior management from HSE concerned will shortly meet with the forum set up by the Save Our Hospital Services Committee to reassure all concerned of the significant advantages that will accrue from this process and the care that is being taken in its implementation.

In fact as recently as Friday 4th December my Department raised the issue with the Commission at the Trade Policy Meeting.Negotiations for a free trade agreement are pursued in the context of an overall Association Agreement, which will govern all aspects of relations, including political dialogue and cooperation as well as trade, between the EU and Colombia. This Agreement is part of an EU strategy to support the Colombian Government as it tries to combat significant terrorist activity and to influence it in a manner that also results in greater respect for human rights. Ireland supports that strategy.As the EU is a single customs union with a single trade policy, it is the European Commission that negotiates for all Member States in talks for trade agreements.

In addition, the CEBs deliver a range of non-financial supports to improve management capability development within micro-enterprises designed to help new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow. Priority is given to projects in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors.  It is considered inappropriate to support other areas such as retail enterprises, personal services (e.g. hairdressers, gardeners, etc), professional services (accountants, solicitors, etc), construction, as it is considered that these enterprises generally give rise to unacceptable deadweight (where projects would have proceeded anyway) and/or displacement (where the projects simply displace business from other players in the market) concerns.In order to more fully explore the range of options that may be available to them the company are advised to contact their local CEB to discuss their business needs with the relevant staff of the Board.  Contact details for individual CEBs can be found by accessing the following website: www.enterpriseboards.ie.

They are rarely used nowadays. In this regard the Mid-West task Force is an exception which was set up to respond to a situation where in addition to a large number of job losses at Dell in Limerick there were also very significant difficulties for a large number of sub-suppliers in the region, which incorporates several local authority areas.In recent years, other structures are increasingly used as an alternative to Task Forces.  This typically involves the County Development Board as a co-ordinating mechanism and includes representation from State agencies such as IDA, Enterprise Ireland, FÁS and the County Enterprise Boards, as well as any relevant Local Authority. Stakeholders at local level are also involved in this process. Such structures are now available in all regions on a permanent basis and are usually considered to be in a position to address issues at least as effectively as a temporary Task Force.

FÁS provides vocational training for the unemployed and new entrants to the labour market through specific skills training and traineeships. FÁS also provides training for those in employment through apprenticeships and in-company training.People with disabilities may be supported while in employment by FÁS through the following programmes:The Wage Subsidy Scheme, which was launched in September 2005, provides financial incentives to employers, outside the public sector, to employ people with disabilities who work more than 20 hours per week.  The subsidies are structured under three strands and the employer can benefit from one, or all, simultaneously. Disabled employees who meet qualifying conditions are also able to avail of the Back to Work Allowance that is available through the Department of Social and Family Affairs.The Supported Employment Programme is an open labour market initiative providing people with disabilities with supports to help them access the open labour market. It is implemented by sponsor organisations on behalf of FÁS who employ Job Coaches to provide a range of supports tailored to the individual needs of a jobseeker.  The ultimate outcome is that the employee becomes independent of Job Coach support.Under its funding for Disability Supports and Awareness services, FÁS also operates a series of private sector employment supports to assist people with disabilities to access and progress in employment. It also includes supports for employers. Programmes under this heading include: Workplace Equipment Adaptation Grant; Job Interview/Personal Reader Grant; Employee Retention Grant; and Disability Awareness Training Grant.  Further details on the above programmes and supports are available on the FÁS website www.fas.ie

Enterprise Ireland has prepared a new recovery strategy to assist its clients. This strategy refocuses Enterprise Ireland's efforts in strengthening and sustaining companies of strategic importance through a range of initiatives focused on the needs of their client base. Enterprise Ireland's supports to businesses include:The Enterprise Stabilisation Fund. The fund supplies direct financial support to internationally trading enterprises that are investing in cost reduction or other measures to gain sales in overseas markets.The Employment Subsidy Scheme has been introduced to support the maintenance of vulnerable jobs and prevent people from being made redundant in this challenging national and global economic environment.As part of a sustained, co-ordinated, integrated approach to jobsearch, training, education and work placement supports, I have doubled the provision of training and work experience places managed by FÁS to over 130,000. I have also increased the referral capacity of FÁS Employment Services from the Department of Social and Family Affairs to 147,00 persons in 2009.  The Government has therefore enacted a broad range of measures to support companies and individuals in these difficult economic times and we will continue to do so in the future.

While this is placing considerable pressure on case processing timeframes, I am encouraged by the fact that so far this year there has been no major worsening of the average waiting times.  I will be keeping the matter under review and will take further action if possible within the constraints which exist in relation to resources.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	604	My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy payments on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees and, statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.  I can confirm that my Department received a statutory lump sum application for the individual concerned on the 7th April, 2009 claiming inability to pay on behalf of the employer.In this case, as in all cases where the employer claims inability to pay the employee(s) statutory redundancy, the Department requires the employer to provide sufficient proof to substantiate the claim. This includes providing the latest set of audited accounts for the company as well as certification from the company's Accountant or Solicitor attesting to the fact that the employer has insufficient assets to pay the redundancy entitlements.  Providing this documentation is submitted and is in order, the Department pays the employee(s) directly from the Social Insurance Fund.If the supporting information required from the employer is not provided to my Department, the employee is advised by the Department to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) against the employer to seek a determination establishing the employee's right and entitlement to redundancy.  That is the advice given by my Department in this case which I understand was acted upon by the individual who currently awaits a hearing of the EAT.  If a positive determination is given by the EAT, this allows the Department to make payment to the employee concerned very soon thereafter.I understand however that in relation to the area concerned in the case of this individual, there is currently a 42 week waiting period for hearings.  Given this backlog of cases pending, it is estimated that a hearing in this case should take place in April 2010.The Employment Appeals Tribunal is an independent, quasi-judicial body under the aegis of my Department.  Secretarial and administrative support is provided by Departmental staff.  I understand that the number of claims to the Tribunal up to November 2009, compared with the same period last year, has doubled.

It is my further understanding that such stations could only operate by virtue of special conditions attached to a licence granted to a proposed operator. In order to operate, petrol stations are required to have a licence. Licences for privately-operated petrol stations are issued by Local (and Harbour) Authorities.Because my Department does not issue licences for petrol dispensing outlets, it has not developed any guidelines relating to the control of petrol dispensing outlets attended or unattended. Moreover, I am advised that neither my Department nor the Health and Safety Authority has issued such guidelines under the Dangerous Substances Acts — the Acts do not provide for the issuance of guidelines.Consideration of the potential impact of unattended petrol stations involves a variety of codes — not just occupational health and safety. Indeed, it is a moot point as to whether the Health and Safety Authority, whose remit is occupational health and safety would have a role in relation to enterprises which, by definition, do not have workers present.  The other codes involved in an assessment of the impacts of unattended petrol stations would include fire services, planning, dangerous substances, the emission of Volatile Organic Compounds, general environmental impacts, etc.As I indicated in an earlier response, a number of fire officers and members of the staff of the Health and Safety Authority did consider some of the issues relating to unattended petrol stations and the conditions that might be expected to apply to their operation.  I am informed that the outcome of their deliberations was conveyed by the Health and Safety Authority to the National Directorate on Fire and Emergency Management of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.

The legislation will outline a procedure for the publication of all vacancies likely to occur, invite applications from the general public and from the responses create a panel of suitable persons for consideration of appointment.  The legislation will also specify numbers of persons to be appointed by a Minister and will facilitate the appropriate Oireachtas Committees to make nominations to the panel.Work on this issue is taking place in the context of implementing the recommendations contained in the report of the task force on the public service, transforming public services report.  The task force made a series of recommendations in relation to State agencies, including the development of models of performance and governance frameworks.Individual Ministers have already sponsored changes in their sectoral areas of responsibility.  In this regard, the Deputy will be aware of the innovative measures for board appointments to public broadcasting corporations which were sponsored by Minister Ryan in the recently enacted Broadcasting Act.

I am taking steps to ensure that work on the extension of the Civil Service provisions is advanced in each sector.  This work will include consultations with the appropriate stakeholders.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	614	The Finance (No.2) Act 2008 confirmed the introduction of an air travel tax from 30 March 2009.  However, I took account of concerns raised by the regional airports particularly those on the western seaboard.  The lower rate of €2 applies to departures from any Irish airport where the destination is 300 km or less from Dublin airport.  This means that all Irish departures to locations such as Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow are subject to the €2 rate.Ireland is not unique in regard to applying a tax on air travel.  Other countries within the EU apply similar taxes such as the UK and France, as do Australia and New Zealand.  The rates for the Irish air travel tax are not unreasonable both for shorter and longer journeys, when compared to rates in other countries.It should be recognised that tourists are only subject to the tax on their return journey.  The additional €10 or €2 in the context of a much larger purchasing decision involving travel, hotel expenditures etc. should have only a limited effect on tourist numbers.  The Government appreciates the airline industry continues to go through a difficult period.  However, this difficult trading period arises primarily from weak world economic activity.It should be noted that at present the decline in air travel is an international phenomenon and as a result aviation services are contracting on a global basis.  In the case of Ireland the decline in passenger numbers through our airports are broadly in line with our international counterparts.  This downward trend is evident for periods prior to the introduction of the air travel tax.  Furthermore, passenger numbers for other modes of transport have also experienced broadly similar declines.  This is not a desirable situation, but it is clear that the air travel tax is not the substantive cause for the decline in passenger numbers.We currently face significant financial challenges and the air travel tax is an important revenue raising measure.  The Government has tried to be as fair as possible in looking at areas for additional tax revenues.  It is also worth noting that fuel used by commercial airlines is completely exempt from tax, so it's a sector that already has considerable preferential treatment.

Maintenance may be subject to certain planning and environmental legislative provisions.  It is generally exempt from planning permission unless the activity is to be carried out in a site designated under legislation, e.g., the EU Birds and Habitats Directives, in which case the applicable legislation or EU Directives may introduce restrictions.  Where maintenance is required by statue, a specified standard of maintenance is generally imposed.Works involving altering the profile of a watercourse are subject to a variety of provisions under arterial drainage, planning and environmental legislation.  Applicable legislation may include the Arterial Drainage Acts, where works are proposed by the Commissioners of Public Works, the Planning Acts, the National Monuments Acts and a wide variety of EU Directives.  Many of these legislative instruments and directives are applied based on the scale of proposed works, the environmental sensitivity of the area in which works are proposed and the likely consequences of such works.In relation to licensing of drainage activities, the competent authorities are generally the National Parks and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Fisheries Boards under the aegis of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, and the Environmental Protection Agency.  Specific types of activity require a formal license, while, in others, there is a legislative obligation to consult, which includes obtaining agreement from the competent authority.Compliance with the relevant body of legislation is normally integrated into the process of undertaking works.  The cost and time involved in this element of the process varies significantly from case to case depending on the quality and amount of scientific data already available and whether detailed surveys and investigations are required.  They can be quite significant at times.

The review will be undertaken by suitably qualified and experienced consultants with the Office of Public Works funding the project and managing the review.  A steering group, involving the relevant stakeholders, will participate in the review process.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	617	I propose to take Questions Nos. 158 to 160, inclusive, together.I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that traders in any EU member state who sell goods at the zero rate of VAT to trade in another EU member state have legal obligations in relation to verifying the VAT numbers of the purchasers.  This may be done through the EU Internet website to which they have free access.  Otherwise, such traders leave themselves open to being held liable for the VAT on the goods if the number is invalid.  Traders also have obligations in relation to justifying the application of the zero rate of VAT, that is, the goods must have left the state in question and are not simply re-sold in that state.  Traders are also advised of their obligation to confirm that the purchaser of the goods is, in fact, the holder of the VAT registration number quoted at the time of supply.  The purchaser of goods under these intra-Community transactions is then legally obliged to account for and pay over the VAT due on the goods at the rate of VAT applicable to the goods in the member date of that purchaser.  Thus, for example, traders in the State who purchase goods from Northern Ireland traders must account for and pay over to the Revenue Commissioners the Irish VAT due on those goods.The EU VAT directives provide that any VAT-registered trader who exports goods to a VAT-registered person in another Member State must complete a VIES Statement detailing all the VAT-registered customers in other member states to whom he/she has supplied goods in respect of which that customer is liable for payment of the VAT due.  The VIES statements form the basis of tax compliance programmes in Member States.  Council Directive 2008/8/EC (amending Directive 2006/112/EC) provides for the more frequent filing of VIES statements and provides that traders may submit statements on a quarterly or monthly.  The increased frequency of filing of VIES statements will further counter instances of potential evasion of VAT.In the case of cross-Border transactions between the UK and this State, checking the validity of VAT registration numbers, and indeed other tax compliance information, with their counterparts in Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in the UK, and in Northern Ireland in particular, is part of the checks carried out by Revenue officers during audits and assurance checks where risk or suspicions arise.  These checks are carried out using the EU VAT Mutual Assistance Programme, which has been designed specifically to tackle cross-border VAT fraud.  This programme allows for exchanges of information between EU member states in relation to VAT matters, and it also allows the presence of officials from one member state in another member state while inquiries are being carried out.  These are VAT anti-fraud measures and Ireland plays a full role in the exchange of information with all other Member EU States, including the UK, with whom we have a very good working relationship.Checks of the control procedures in place between the State and Northern Ireland form part of the work programmes of Revenue's Investigations and Prosecutions Division and the Revenue Regions.  Revenue continues to liaise, as appropriate, with the competent authorities in Northern Ireland, under the EU Mutual Assistance programme.  Revenue is currently engaged in a number of ongoing cross-border investigations involving the zero VAT rating of goods.  If the Deputy has specific facts in relation to businesses evading VAT, whether in the area of cross border transactions or otherwise, the Revenue Commissioners would be grateful to receive such information.  The Deputy can be assured that Revenue will assess and act on the information as appropriate.Finally, in so far as a carbon tax is concerned, the Deputy will appreciate that it is the usual practice for the Minister for Finance not to speculate or comment in advance of the Budget on what it will contain and I do not propose to deviate from that practice.On considering the introduction of a new tax or indeed an increase in current taxes a wide variety of factors are taken into consideration including the impact on cross-border trade.When new taxes are being introduced there are always practical issues in relation to implementation that require consideration. In that regard, as is normal practice, my officials in conjunction with the Office of Revenue Commissioners and other relevant Departments will, if the need arises engage with those sectors involved in the implementation of the carbon tax to minimise, in so far as it is reasonably possible, practical difficulties.

The copies of Appendix 1 of the Revised Estimates for the Public Services in each of the years 2007 to 2009, set out below, give a breakdown by Department of subheads which were part-funded by the surplus from the National Lottery.The total outturn for all part-funded subheads in 2007 was €444m, of which €230m was funded from the National Lottery surplus. The total outturn for all part-funded subheads in 2008 was €472m, of which €265m was funded from the National Lottery surplus. The total allocation for all part funded subheads in 2009 is €419m, of which €275m is profiled to be surrendered from the National Lottery surplus.Community projects are supported by the Department of Community, Rural & Gaeltacht Affairs via its "Grants for Community and Voluntary Programmes" and "Local and Community Development Programmes" subheads, which are both part-funded by the surplus from the National Lottery. The level of expenditure under these two subheads was €101m in 2007 and €103m in 2008, of which €53m (2007) and €58m (2008) came from the National Lottery surplus. The Revised Estimates for Public Services for 2009 shows that the profile for the present year for these two subheads is a total expenditure of €90m, involving €58m of funding from the Lottery surplus.2005 Provisional Outturn2006 EstimateVote/SubheadCurrentCapitalTotalCurrentCapitalTotal€000€000€000€000€000€000

The figures are estimates from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2007 adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends for the year 2010. They are therefore provisional and likely to be revised.

With regard to the current academic year, 2009/2010, a total of 33 staff are being supported to pursue academic courses.The Department's Post-Entry Education Scheme is actively promoted and supported to ensure that staff have the necessary skills and expertise to enable the Department to meet its strategic business objectives and to encourage a continuous learning culture in the Department. Financial support is given to staff pursuing academic courses which reflect the particular skills and qualifications required primarily within the Department, including economics, policy analysis and finance.

The OPW understands that an application will be made by Limerick County Council under this scheme for funding for works to address the flood problems at Castleconnell and Montpelier.

Limerick as an emergency response measure, following consultation with an inter-agency group set up by Clare Council to co-ordinate the response to flooding in the region.  The work was carried out by OPW's own workforce.  Given the extreme urgency involved, the full cost of the works has not yet been established.If it is decided by the Council that the embankment should remain in place for the longer term, some realignment of it away from residential property, and some landscaping and path restoration works, may be required.  Tidal valves might also need to be installed to surface water outfalls.  These works, if required, would be undertaken in 2010.

The estate was not flooded during the recent heavy flooding in the Shannon area.  The Office of Public Works understands that the estate has not yet been taken in charge by the Local Authority involved, Clare County Council.  In the circumstances, OPW has no plans to carry out flood mitigation works at the estate at present.  However, the OPW will continue to monitor the situation, in conjunction with the Council.

Consequently, decisions which relate to the normal business of the bank are a matter for the Board of Anglo, and the Board is responsible for making such decisions in the best commercial interests of the Bank.The bank has advised me that the asset sale referred to by the Deputy is being considered in the best overall commercial interests of the bank, and that the process being followed in the transaction is appropriate to the structure of the bank's asset holding, which involves a number of parties. The bank has confirmed that its approach in considering the sale is in line with legal and regulatory requirements for such transactions.As with all financial institutions, Anglo's dealings with its customers are subject to the normal provisions on client confidentiality, and it would therefore not be appropriate for me to comment in any greater detail on the client relationship referred to by the Deputy.

These derivatives are typically interest rate swaps or equivalent instruments designed to hedge interest rate payments and the notional value refers to the underlying assets to which the derivatives are related — the details are set out in Table 3, page 9 of the draft NAMA Business Plan published in October.  These derivatives are an integral part of the loan portfolio and are not additional to this amount.The management of these financial derivative instruments is an operational matter for NAMA. I understand however, that it is anticipated that in most cases the management of these derivatives will be undertaken by the originating financial institutions as an integral part of the loan management process which will be overseen by NAMA.

The OPW were, therefore, in a position to submit the report to the National Parks and Wildlife Service sooner than had been anticipated in that reply.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	628	The position is that the income levy applies to all emoluments of an employment, including anything treated as a taxable benefit-in-kind. Income levy is applied to aggregate income before granting relief in respect of losses, capital allowances or pension contributions. In this regard an individual's personal contributions to a personal retirement savings account (PRSA), personal pension contribution, additional voluntary contribution or a retirement annuity contribution is disregarded for the purposes of determining the income levy that an individual must pay.In addition, an employer contribution to a personal retirement savings account (PRSA) is chargeable to income tax in the hands of the employee as a benefit-in-kind under section 118 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  As the income levy treatment follows the income tax treatment, the employer's contribution to the personal retirement savings account will also be subject to the income levy.Section 778 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, provides that an employer contribution made to an approved retirement benefit scheme or a statutory scheme is not treated as a benefit-in-kind for income tax purposes. Again, as the income levy treatment follows the income levy treatment, any employer's contribution to such schemes will not be subject to income levy.I should point out that it is a longstanding practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment in advance of the Budget on any tax or expenditure matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions.

However, inadvertently, additional claims of €122.47, which were submitted on the 9th of September, were not dealt with.  These claims have now been processed and refunds will issue shortly. The Revenue Commissioners wish to apologise for any inconvenience caused by this delay.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	630	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that expenditure on the provision of flood-proof doors for a business premises would be regarded as capital expenditure on the provision of a fixed asset and not as an expense incurred in the day-to-day running of a business. While many revenue-type (i.e. non-capital) expenses are generally deductible for tax purposes, capital expenses are only deductible in certain circumstances.Capital expenses, known as capital allowances, are given, firstly, in respect of items that would be regarded as ‘plant or machinery' and secondly, in respect of expenditure incurred on a particular type of building. As a door would typically not be regarded as an item of plant or machinery but rather as part of a building, expenditure on the provision of a flood-proof door would only qualify for capital allowances if it formed part of a qualifying building. Not all buildings that are used for business purposes qualify for capital allowances. Some examples of the more common qualifying buildings are factories, hotels and crèches. However, capital allowances are not available in respect of expenditure on buildings such as shops, showrooms and offices.  I have no plans at this time to change the current arrangements.

On this basis the information requested in relation to income earners earning over €100,000 by reference to income quartiles is set out in the tables. To assemble the figures by income quartile, the total number of income earners with earnings over €100,000 on the income tax record for 2007 was broken down into 4 equal groups in each sector and distributed over 4 income ranges in ascending order of income. The figures for amount of tax, median tax, mean tax and the standard deviation were then established for each quartile group as appropriate.NumbersAmount of TaxMean TaxMedian TaxStandard Deviation€€€€Quartile 17,879190,760,13424,21122,5575,092Quartile 27,878225,561,16628,63227,4975,423Quartile 37,880284,727,03536,13335,9696,634Quartile 47,879565,662,92169,40757,06462,44931,5161,266,711,25639,59632,64736,251NumbersAmount of TaxMean TaxMedian TaxStandard Deviation€€€€Quartile 13,81986,087,42422,54221,2864,303Quartile 23,82098,109,49025,68324,7764,102Quartile 33,820118,368,19730.98630,2194,748Quartile 43,819176,791,48746,29342,16827,25215,278479,356,59831,37628,57516,833NumbersAmount of TaxMean TaxMedian TaxStandard Deviation€€€€Quartile 117,700369,272,12620,86321,7057,604Quartile 217,700501,563,12328,33729,78310,017Quartile 317,701764,733,09043,20344,82716,364Quartile 417,6992,376,641,828134,28191,851259,50670,8004,012,210,16756,67034,133137,888A married couple that has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.

Charitable organisations providing childcare facilities exclusively for charitable purposes and otherwise than for private profit are excluded from liability for commercial rates.  However, the Act maintains the long-standing position that commercial facilities, including all private childcare facilities operating for profit such as play schools, pre-schools, crèches and Montessori schools, are liable for rates.I have no plans to provide for special treatment of private childcare facilities under the Valuation Act which provides that all buildings used for commercial enterprises are valued in a fair and equitable manner.

It is policy to review all pre Budget submissions as part of the budgetary process. I would draw to the Deputy's attention that it is the usual practice for the Minister for Finance not to speculate or comment in advance of the Budget on what it will contain and I do not propose to deviate from that practice.

This move is in line with best international practice.  It will ensure that an effective and efficient approach to cervical screening is maintained and that the essential target uptake of 80 per cent is achieved. In particular, the call-recall system allows CervicalCheck to target women in low-uptake cohorts for participation in screening.In addition to the call-recall system, there is a fast-track opt-in facility for any woman aged 25 to 60 who has not had a smear test in three years or more. Such women can opt-in online, by phone or by post. Over 30,000 letters of invitation have been issued in response to opt-in requests since September. The current waiting time for such an invitation is three weeks.  There are additional exemptions to invitation-only screening, including women over the age of 60 who have never had a smear test and women (regardless of age) undergoing colposcopy treatment follow-up.  Women who have already availed of a CervicalCheck smear test are now part of an appropriate and organised screening cycle and will be automatically advised by the Programme when their next smear test is due.

Staff assignments in the Department take account of all relevant factors, of which academic or other qualifications form only one part.  Other relevant considerations include previous experience, the need to broaden experience, particular aptitudes, and the demands arising at any given time across the Department.
#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	645	The cost of long-term nursing home care in Baltinglass District Hospital is €1,640 per week and this, therefore, is the cap on the cost per patient under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.Individuals who receive State support under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme will  contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and 5% of the value of any assets in excess of the asset disregard per annum towards their long-term nursing home care costs. The asset disregard is €36,000 for an individual and €72,000 for a couple. The HSE will pay the balance of the cost of care.Where a person's assets include land and property, the 5% contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected at a later date. This is an optional element of the scheme called the Nursing Home Loan. This loan will become repayable after the person's death or if the person sells/transfers their property (if this occurs before their death).A person's principal residence will only be included in the financial assessment for the first 3 years of their time in care. This is known as the 15% or ‘three year' cap.  It means that a person will pay the 5% contribution based on their principal residence for a maximum of three years regardless of the time they spend in nursing home care.  After 3 years, even if a person is still getting long-term nursing home care, they will not pay any further contribution based on the principal residence. This ‘three year' cap applies regardless of whether a person chooses to opt for the loan or not.  In the case of a couple, where one partner remains in the home while the other enters a nursing home, the contribution based on assets is 2.5% per annum and the contribution based on the principal residence is capped at 7.5%.The scheme also encompasses the following important safeguards:Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care.Applicants will keep a personal allowance of 20% of their income or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.If there is a spouse/partner remaining at home, he/she will be left with 50% of the couple's income or the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.The first €36,000 of the applicant's assets, or €72,000 in the case of a couple, will not be counted at all in the financial assessment.If there is a partner or certain dependants living in the principal residence, the repayment of contributions may be further deferred for their lifetime.

The Adoption Board were contacted immediately upon receipt of the draft report. The Adoption Board's role in registering adoption societies, including the mediation agency in question, make it the appropriate body to consider the issues raised. The matters under consideration in relation to the agency, along with the wider issue of adoptions from Vietnam are currently being considered in the context of the ISS, and the earlier MoLISA, reports.

The new legislation, which incorporates the provisions of the Hague Convention, is designed to provide a framework to ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed and that all adoptions are effected in the best interests of the child.  Future intercountry adoption arrangements will be governed by the terms of the Adoption Bill 2009 when enacted.  The issue of transitional measures for prospective parents who are at a definable stage in the adoption process when the Bill is enacted and who wish to continue to adopt a child from a non-Hague, non-bilateral country, is being examined.  Prospective adoptive parents have waited a long time and it is my intention to be as flexible as possible in relation to applicants.I recently received the UNICEF report ‘ Adoption from Vietnam: Problems and Challenges’ carried out by the International Social Service (ISS). I discussed the findings of the report yesterday with a number of groups representing persons wishing to adopt from Vietnam. I indicated that the report will be considered by Government and that a decision will be made in the near future with regard to future adoptions from Vietnam.

To support the engagement of young people in the arts in Ireland, the Youth Affairs Unit of my Office grant-aids a number of initiatives including the National Youth Arts Programme (NYAP) which it co-funds with the Arts Council and which is delivered by the National Youth Council of Ireland.  In 2009, the Youth Affairs Unit provided €69,278 to core work of the Programme.  A further one-off grant of €10,000 was also provided in 2009 to the NYAP towards the cost of running an Artist in Residency Programme.In addition, the Youth Affairs Unit provides annual grant-in-aid to the National Association for Youth Drama (NAYD) and the Young Irish Film Makers (YIFM) under its Youth Service Grant Scheme.  The NAYD is the development organisation for youth theatre and youth drama in Ireland which supports youth drama in practice. An amount of €131,702 was provided to the organisation in 2009.  With regard to the YIFM, €75,600 was provided in 2009 to help it provide access to, and participation in, film making for young people.  With regard to funding for 2010, this will be considered in light of the finances available to the Youth Affairs Unit.

#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	655	The HSE's Guidelines on the Standardised Implementation of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, which have been approved by the Minister for Health and Children, state that, subject to overall resources, new entrants to nursing homes will have their financial support paid either from the date that the application was made or from date of admission to the nursing home, whichever is the later. It is not, therefore, the case that applicants will only qualify from date of determination.It is acknowledged that, in the initial months following the introduction of the scheme, the HSE will have to deal with a huge volume of applications from both existing residents and new entrants. However, this should not impact negatively on existing residents due to the safeguards provided within the primary legislation. The legislation provides that applicants to the scheme who were in nursing home care on the date the scheme commenced (27th October 2009) shall have their State support backdated to that date. New entrants shall have their support paid in accordance with the HSE's Guidelines, as outlined above.The HSE has indicated that the expected timelines for processing applications under the new Nursing Homes Support Scheme and making a determination regarding financial support will vary according to individual circumstances and complexities.  However, on average, the following timelines are estimated (assuming that the submitted application is fully and correctly completed): Straightforward State Support Application, 1-2 weeks; Straightforward Nursing Home Loan Application, 3-4 weeks.

#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	660	Under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme, individuals will contribute up to 80% of their assessable income and 5% of the value of any assets in excess of the asset disregard per annum towards their long-term nursing home care costs.  The asset disregard is €36,000 for an individual and €72,000 for a couple.  The HSE will pay the balance of the cost of care.Where a person's assets include land and property, the 5% contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected at a later date.  This is an optional element of the scheme called the Nursing Home Loan.  This loan will become repayable after the person's death or if the person sells/transfers their property (if this occurs before their death).A person's principal residence will only be included in the financial assessment for the first 3 years of their time in care.  This is known as the 15% or ‘three year' cap.  It means that a person will pay the 5% contribution based on their principal residence for a maximum of three years regardless of the time they spend in nursing home care.  After 3 years, even if a person is still getting long-term nursing home care, they will not pay any further contribution based on the principal residence.  This ‘three year' cap applies regardless of whether a person chooses to opt for the loan or not.In the case of a couple, where one partner remains in the home while the other enters a nursing home, the contribution based on assets is 2.5% per annum and the contribution based on the principal residence is capped at 7.5%.The scheme also encompasses the following important safeguards:Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care.Applicants will keep a personal allowance of 20% of their income or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.If there is a spouse/partner remaining at home, he/she will be left with 50% of the couple's income or the maximum rate of the State Pension (non-Contributory), whichever is the greater.The first €36,000 of the applicant's assets, or €72,000 in the case of a couple, will not be counted at all in the financial assessment.If there is a partner or certain dependants living in the principal residence, the repayment of contributions may be further deferred for their lifetime.Under the legislation, any income or assets transferred within the five years prior to applying for the scheme are taken into account in the financial assessment.  This is not a new concept; the same measure was in place under the subvention scheme.This provision does not affect a person's right to sell assets for full market value. Rather it is intended to prevent people from depriving themselves of assets for the purposes of the financial assessment.However, the legislation also includes a provision, which only applies to items transferred prior to the 9th October 2008 (i.e. the date of publication of the Bill), that enables people to appeal the inclusion of transferred income/assets in the financial assessment.  The applicant may apply to have transferred income/assets excluded from the financial assessment on the basis that their inclusion would cause undue financial hardship to themselves, their spouse/partner or their child under the age of 21.  Finally, the Information Booklet on the scheme can be downloaded from the HSE's website at:http://www.hse.ie/eng/services/Find_a_Service/Older_People_Services/nhss/nhss.html.

My Department issued a circular (8/2009) on 15 May 2009 to HSE and voluntary hospitals to give effect to this measure.The scheme did not apply to grades exempted from the moratorium on recruitment and promotions under the 2009 Employment Control Framework for the Public Health Sector, in order to meet the requirements of integrated health care delivery and, in particular, to address needs in the community in respect of care of the elderly and people with disabilities.Members of all other grades who meet the eligibility criteria had access to this scheme provided the grades/staff groups concerned cooperate with the requirements in relation to redeployment, mobility, skill mix and flexibility which are outlined in the employment control framework: this is designed to allow individuals to avail of this scheme while still protecting services.  Because staff who avail of the scheme will not be replaced (save in very exceptional cases), employers must pay particular attention, when considering applications, to the scope that exists within the organisation for reorganising and restructuring work in order to minimise the impact on essential service delivery.  Staff cooperation and flexibility in that regard was essential.My Department was informed that the health service trade unions  issued a directive instructing their members not to cooperate with redeployment and reassignment requests from management.  The unions have stated their opposition to the moratorium on recruitment and promotions as set out in 2009 Employment Control Framework for the Public Health Sector, referred to above.  This instruction from the unions severely restricts the ability of management to organise/restructure work practice and contravenes the qualification criteria for these schemes.  As a result, the HSE suspended all three schemes in June but continued to accept applications, up to the closing date of 23 October 2009.

However, the Executive has flexibility to administer such services as appropriate in certain cases for those approaching this cohort.  The continuation of existing services, such as Acute Hospital, Disability Services or Mental Health provision, for those approaching the Older Person's programme, is a matter for the HSE taking account of  issues such as eligibility, individual needs, professional opinion, and service options.  The Deputy will appreciate that the health service has, by its nature, to be administered along broad operational lines.  Every effort is made to meet the needs of the individual from the appropriate service source.In relation to eligibility legislation, there is currently no provision within the current eligibility framework (with the exception of Child Health Services under Section 66 of the Health Act 1970 which provides for a health examination and treatment services for children of primary school going age) which seeks to differentiate between different care groups on the basis of age.  Eligibility for health services in Ireland is subject only to being ordinarily resident in the State.  There are two categories of eligibility for public health services.  These are Category I (Medical Card holders) and Category II (the remainder of the population).  To qualify for Category I eligibility a person is required to undergo a means test.  The remainder of the population will have Category II eligibility subject only to the ordinary residence criterion.  Accordingly, there are no plans to instruct the HSE as proposed by the Deputy.

#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	690	I propose to take Questions Nos. 240 and 244 together.The Department of Health and Children does not collect information on children identified with Autism and Asperger's on a national or international basis.  Information pertaining to diagnosis is specifically excluded from the National Intellectual Disability Database as the database is not designed as a medical epidemiological tool.  Accordingly the database does not record the incidence of Autism or any other disability.In 2004, the Department of Health and Children, through the Health Research Board, approved expenditure of €5 million on autism research to help improve international understanding of the genetic causes of autism.  This €5 million is the Irish contribution to a new major international research initiative called the Autism Genome Project which will receive a total investment of €12 million from a variety of international organisations over three years.  The other co-funders in the international consortium include Autism Speaks (US), the British Medical Research Council (MRC), Southwest Autism Research and Resource Centre (SARRC), and the Hilibrand Foundation.  This unique combination of international, public and private partners funding a consortium of clinicians and scientists is a new and welcome departure in the field of autism research.  The Health Research Board has informed my Department that this funding was awarded as follows:€2.8 million: Professor Michael Gill, Department of Psychiatry, Trinity College, Dublin€2.2 million: Professor Andrew Green, Director National Centre for Medical Genetics, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin (affiliated to UCD).This figure represents the largest tranche of funding to be awarded by any of the four funders within the international consortium.  The Irish researchers are at the forefront in unravelling the genetic determinants of autism and related disorders.  They are using novel state of the art genetic sequencing technology to analyse DNA samples taken from autistic patients to identify candidate genetic markers for autism.  They will collaborate with their international colleagues to then link these genetic markers with clinical outcomes.  This unique international research effort will greatly improve not only our understanding of the causes of autism, but its diagnosis and treatment.With regard to the remaining matters raised by the Deputy, these relate to the management and delivery of health and personal services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act, 2004.  Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have these matters investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	692	A fundamental part of Government policy for hospital services is the delivery of high standards of patient care, ensuring that patient safety is paramount and that the best possible patient outcomes are achieved.  The Deputy will be aware that the HSE has commissioned a number of reviews in relation to how acute hospital services should be organised in particular regions.  These reviews have highlighted the need for changes to be made in the provision and organisation of acute hospital  services in the regions concerned.  The programme also involves developing smaller hospitals to provide a much greater proportion of less complex care, underlining the fact that smaller hospitals can be reconfigured to provide important services in their local communities.  Working to ensure patient safety and the best possible outcomes for patients is essential to the delivery of services at every hospital, whatever the range or complexity of services provided at that hospital.An important step forward in implementing Government policy on safety and quality of health services was the establishment of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) in 2007.  A core function of HIQA is to set standards on safety and quality of health services and to monitor enforcement of those standards in an open and transparent way.  HIQA has already developed national quality standards in areas such as Symptomatic Breast Disease Standards, National Hygiene Standards and National Standards for Infection Prevention and Control.  HIQA has also commenced work on the development of National Quality Standards for acute hospitals in the public sector.  As part of the implementation of the Report of the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance, approved by Government in January 2009, my Department is now developing legislative proposals for a mandatory licensing system to cover both public and private hospitals, based on the standards being prepared by HIQA.

The Report can be found on the Registry's website www.ncri.ie. It provides detailed geographical information on the distribution of all the common cancers in Ireland. It also examines the role of a range of risk factors, including smoking, diet, poverty and environment, in determining the geographical variations found.For most cancers, the Report found that there is significant geographical variation in risk based on residence and that the variations are, in the main, different for different cancers. Most cancers showed a relationship (either positive or negative) to area deprivation scores. More densely populated areas consistently had a higher risk of cancer than those that were sparsely populated. The risk of almost all cancers analysed was higher in areas with the highest proportion of elderly people living on their own. The report concludes that, by reducing exposure to risk factors such as tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking, obesity, diet and sexual behaviour, cancer incidence in Ireland and the disparities described in this report could be greatly reduced.The Registry was set up in 1991 by statute and is wholly funded by the Department of Health and Children. The overall direction of the Registry is the responsibility of the National Cancer Registry Board. The Registry has been collecting comprehensive cancer information for the whole population of the Republic of Ireland since 1994. The information it collects is used in research into the causes of cancer, in education and information programmes, and in the planning of a national cancer strategy to deliver the best cancer care to the whole population.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	698	Services at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, National Children's Hospital Tallaght and the Children's University Hospital Temple Street will transfer to the new National Paediatric Hospital.  Pending completion of the project, the HSE will continue to finance the provision and development of services at each of the transferring hospitals.The way to provide the best possible paediatric tertiary care most effectively involves the creation of one single national paediatric hospital, alongside a major teaching hospital, bringing together all the medical and nursing expertise for complex conditions.  The concept of bringing together all three present services is widely accepted.The Children's Health First Report commissioned by the Health Service Executive indicated that the population and projected demands in this country can support only one world class tertiary paediatric hospital. It recommended that the hospital should be in Dublin and should, ideally, be located with a leading adult academic hospital in order to optimize the outcomes for children.  Following detailed consideration, it was decided that the most appropriate location for the new National Paediatric Hospital is at the Mater Hospital.I am aware that concerns have been expressed in the past by some members of staff and families of patients and others who currently access Our Lady's Children's Hospital and the National Children's Hospital at Tallaght.  However, I welcome the recent decision by the Hospital to participate fully in the development of the project and to nominate representatives to the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board.The development of the National Paediatric Hospital is a priority project for the Government. The project is proceeding as planned and is being overseen by the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board which was established in May, 2007. The HSE is working closely with the Board in progressing the project, which is scheduled for completion and commissioning in 2014.The real challenge in paediatrics is to maximise the efficient use of all our healthcare capacity both in Dublin and across the country.  Crumlin, Temple Street and Tallaght paediatric services need to be increasingly working in a co-ordinated, shared and efficient fashion to prepare for the eventual coming together of the three institutions into one national paediatric hospital.  The HSE is actively pursuing ways in which services across the three hospitals can best be co-ordinated, to avoid unnecessary duplication and to achieve savings that can be put back into patient care.

The decision is based on expert advice and is designed to ensure that radiation oncology is integrated with all other aspects of cancer care, including surgery and medical oncology.  This is in line with best international practice.  The Board of St. Luke's Hospital and its Executive Management Team are fully committed to supporting the Government's decision in relation to the development of radiation oncology and a Transition Team has been established to oversee developments.No decisions have yet been taken in relation to the future use of the site and facilities at St. Luke's.  However, I am anxious to ensure that these resources are utilised in the best interest of the health services. I understand that the Friends of St. Luke's are preparing a report on possible future uses of the site and facilities and I hope to receive a copy of this report shortly.It is important to note that the complete transfer of services from St. Luke's Hospital to new facilities at St. James's Hospital and Beaumont Hospital is not due to take place for a number of years. A partial transfer will occur in the last quarter of 2010.  In the meantime, additional linear accelerators were commissioned at St. Luke's last year in order to provide much needed interim capacity pending the roll out of the National Plan for Radiation Oncology.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	700	The national average number of acute hospital beds available in public hospitals in 2007, the latest year for which verified data has been compiled by the HSE, was 13,688. This includes both in patient beds and day places.  The national average number of acute hospital beds available in public hospitals in 2002 was 12,497.  This shows an increase over the five year period of over 1100.  No detailed breakdown of medical and surgical beds is available.While neither the Minister for Health and Children nor the HSE has responsibility for the operation and management of private hospitals, from recent enquiries made by my Department of the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation (IBEC) I understand that in private hospitals which are members of IBEC there are currently approximately 2,300 inpatient beds and 450 day beds.

The initial selection of works to be funded from these grants is also a matter for the local authority.When road grants for regional and local roads are allocated each year, my Department does not hold back a reserve allocation at central level to deal with weather contingencies.  Such an arrangement would mean a reduction across all local authorities in the road grant allocations made to them at the beginning of each year. The allocations made to local authorities are inclusive of a weather risk factor.  Local authorities are expressly advised that they should set aside contingency sums from their overall regional and local roads resources to finance necessary weather related works.  That stipulation is contained clearly in the circular letter which is sent to each local authority with the yearly road grant allocations.My Department would also be prepared to consider, sympathetically, any request from local authorities to adjust their multi-annual restoration programmes, or revise their specific grant applications, in order to facilitate works now required as a result of the recent exceptional flooding.Local authorities are still assessing the extent of flood damage in their regions, and, I expect that it will take some time before all the authorities concerned can quantify the damage sustained to their regional and local road networks and cost the repairs.The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot, at this time, indicate what funding might be either needed or available to address damage caused to the regional and local road network by recent flooding.  My officials are keeping in contact with local authorities affected by flooding.  The current difficulties being faced by those authorities are being monitored and will be taken into account in the 2010 regional and local road grant allocations, to the extent that resources will allow.

That service is known as "The Patton Flyer".  That offer did not include certain of the stops sought by the applicants in respect of their proposed service, as these stops were already being served by a previously licensed bus service being operated by Aircoach that connects the locations in question with Dublin Airport.The Patton Flyer operators lodged an appeal in February 2009 against the terms of the offer made by my Department and also sought to add additional stops to the proposed service.  The appeal was considered and a licence offer was made in May 2009, which again excluded those stops which conflicted with the licensed Aircoach service.  The Patton Flyer operators wrote to the Department on 19 June 2009 rejecting the licence offer.Notwithstanding the fact that the operators of the Patton Flyer service have rejected an offer for the grant of a licence, they continue to operate an unlicensed service.  The Patton Flyer service is not licensed, Dublin Airport Authority have been made aware of this as have the Gardaí Síochána.

These helicopters are available on a 24 hour 365 day basis for emergency response on any part of the coastline.  The Irish Coast Guard is presently in a tender process to renew the current helicopter contract, which will expire in 2010.  There are no plans at present to re-organise or re-configure the current Search and Rescue helicopter service, pending the outcome of the tender process.The Coast Guard also manages and operates 3 co-ordination/communication centres at Dublin, Malin Head and Valentia.  These centres are being developed. Dublin will be completed mid 2010, and it is intended to commence refurbishment of one of the other centres later next year.  The Coast Guard also manages local volunteer rescue units, providing coastal search and cliff rescue.  It is planned to rationalise these units over time.

The status of the persons concerned remains largely as set out in that Reply. However, in the interim, an application for Subsidiary Protection was made on behalf of the second named person by her legal representative and lodged under cover letter dated 23 March 2009. In response to this application, a letter issued on 9 June 2009 advising that the person concerned was not automatically entitled to apply for Subsidiary Protection. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the applicant was advised that she could seek the exercise of Ministerial discretion pursuant to Regulation 4 (2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 by making further representations identifying any new facts or circumstances which demonstrated a change of position from that at the time the Deportation Order was made on 5 August 2004. Representations were received on 23 July 2009 and are currently being considered.The persons concerned have continued to meet their presentation requirements with the Gardaí. The first named person is due to present himself again at Anglesea Street Garda Station, County Cork on 14 December 2009. The second named person is due to present herself again at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) on 6 January 2010.The enforcement of the Deportation Orders remains an operational matter for the GNIB.

Local Garda management is aware of a number of incidents of anti-social behaviour in the area.A member of the local Community Policing Unit is allocated to this area.  An active Neighbourhood Watch Scheme is in place, and Gardaí are in regular contact with residents.The area is subject to regular patrols by uniform and plain clothes personnel, including the Community Policing Unit, the Garda Mountain Bike Unit and the District Detective and Drug Units, supplemented as required by the Divisional Crime Task Force and Traffic Corps personnel.  Persons and vehicles are regularly stopped and searched in the area, and persons have been interviewed and cautioned in relation to incidents in the area.Current policing plans in the area are designed to address issues of crime and public order offences, including the prevention of public order offences, the prevention of crime including crimes of violence against persons and property and the maintenance of an environment conducive to the improvement of quality of life of residents.  This strategy is central to the delivery of the policing service to the area in question.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	727	I propose to take Questions Nos. 282 and 285 together.The Papal Nuncio called to Iveagh House at my request this morning to discuss the report of the Dublin Archdiocese Commission of Investigation and the cooperation of the Nuncio and the Holy See with the Commission.Neither I, nor my predecessor, received any communication prior to the publication of the Commission's report regarding a refusal or failure of the Nuncio or the Vatican to cooperate with the Murphy Commission.The only correspondence my Department received in relation to the Commission prior to the publication of its report related to a diplomatic note dated 1 March 2007 addressed to our Embassy to the Holy See from the Vatican Secretariat of State. This note referred to an inquiry addressed to a department of the Roman Curia by Commission, which the Secretariat of State understood to be a body established under the authority of the Government of Ireland through the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The note asked that the Embassy remind the appropriate authorities that such requests should be addressed to the Holy See through proper diplomatic channels, in accordance with international laws and customs.This diplomatic note was passed by my Department to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which in turn forwarded it to the Commission.Later in March 2007, the Vatican authorities approached our Ambassador to the Holy See, reminding the Embassy of the note of 1 March and enquiring whether it would be possible for the Embassy to indicate to the Commission, through the appropriate authority in Dublin, that the Holy See had responded through diplomatic channels to their communication so as to avoid any impression on the part of the Commission's part that its correspondence had been ignored. Following confirmation from Dublin that a copy of the Vatican's diplomatic note had been passed to the Commission, the Embassy sent a diplomatic note to the Secretariat of State on 26 April 2007 confirming this fact.In the meantime, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform wrote to the Chairperson of the Commission informing her that the Vatican had sought confirmation that the Commission had received its diplomatic note.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	728	I propose to take Questions Nos. 283 and 284 together.Finding a solution for our undocumented citizens in the US continues to be a high priority of this Government. We are also committed to developing our bilateral migration arrangements with the United States, through the establishment of a reciprocal two year renewable visa scheme known as the E3 visa.In discussions with US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton, during her visit to Ireland in October, I stressed that the Government was continuing to pursue a three pronged strategy to address migratory flows between Ireland and the US. This strategy involves seeking a solution for the undocumented Irish, the establishment of an E3 visa and the continued expansion of the working holiday programme, which was concluded last year. In response to these issues, Secretary of State Clinton indicated that immigration reform may be addressed in early 2010, following the passage of healthcare legislation.On my visit to Washington and New York on 14-17 October, I held extensive discussions on the prospect for progress on immigration reform with significant number of key Democrats and Republicans in Congress. These included the Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Patrick Leahy, Senator John McCain, Senator Lindsey Graham, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Senator Chris Dodd, Senator Bob Casey, Senator Paul Kirk, the Chair of the House Sub Committee on Immigration, Zoe Lofgren and the members of the House of Representatives Friends of Ireland Group.There was considerable support expressed at these meetings for efforts to find a solution for the undocumented and for the E3 visa initiative. I received some indications that a comprehensive immigration bill which would address the concerns of the undocumented could be introduced in Congress in Spring 2010, but I was also advised that such a timetable could be influenced by ongoing debate on health care reform and the fact that 2010 will be an election year in the US.In New York, I also had a very useful meeting with the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, who continue to lobby for the undocumented Irish, with the assistance of former Congressman Bruce Morrison. During my visit, I was pleased to announce a further grant of $50,000 to ILIR. This brings to $285,000, the total amount of funding allocated by the Government to ILIR since 2006.In addition to these recent contacts, a Congressional Delegation, led by Congressman Richard Neal, Chair of the Friends of Ireland, visited Ireland from 27 June to 5 July this year. During this visit, I hosted the delegation for a dinner in Cork and they also met with the Tánaiste and the Ceann Comhairle in Dublin. Comprehensive immigration reform and the importance of finding a solution for the undocumented Irish featured strongly during our discussions.Question No. 285 answered with Question No. 282.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	729	The Global Irish Economic Forum was convened by the Government with two broad objectives: to explore how the Irish at home and abroad and those with a strong interest in Ireland could work together and contribute to our overall efforts at economic recovery; and to examine ways in which Ireland and its global community could develop a more strategic relationship with each other, particularly in the economic sector.  The forum was marked by huge enthusiasm among the participants, who widely regarded the event as a very significant success. The discussions held on a range of mainly economic issues over the weekend were marked by expressions of considerable optimism about the future of Ireland, despite the present economic difficulties.  The Government has moved quickly to take forward the work begun at Farmleigh . At its meeting on 13 October, the Government considered a comprehensive report prepared by my Department and the Irish Management Institute.  The full report, which contains a detailed list of the main themes and specific proposals to emerge, is available on www.dfa.ie and www.globalirishforum.ie.  The Government has also established a new interdepartmental committee, chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Taoiseach, to consider the proposals and monitor progress across Departments.  The committee has already begun its work and will report to the Government early in the new year.  The post-forum process will complement the work already under way across many of the areas discussed at Farmleigh, including through the Innovation Task Force and the implementation of Building Ireland’s Smart Economy.One outcome of particular significance is the emergence of an invaluable network of highly successful business figures across the globe who now feel that they have a stake in delivering renewed economic growth in Ireland.  My Department is actively working towards the establishment of a new global Irish network made up of those invited to Farmleigh and other leading business figures in our global community. This network will give greater strategic focus to our economic and cultural promotional work abroad.  One of the main themes to emerge from the attendees was the importance of Irish culture to the image of this country abroad and in particular.  I was therefore pleased to announce on 7 December that funding of €2.3 million is being provided by my Department for a new landmark Irish Arts Centre in New York as a key outcome of the forum.  Other ideas which are being actively progressed include: the establishment of an Irish innovation centre in Silicon Valley; the Gateway Ireland portal, which would serve as a key on-line focus for promoting Ireland abroad and engaging with our global community; and expanded educational exchange and scholarship programmes to increase engagement with younger generations. I am aware that a number of other Departments are also taking forward initiatives suggested at Farmleigh.  I am similarly encouraged by the fact that significant work has already been undertaken by participants themselves on a number of projects that are more suitably advanced by the private sector.  In planning the forum, overall costs were kept to a minimum.  Participants paid for their own air fares and travel costs and the accommodation provided by the Department was deliberately chosen at hotels close to the venue and at a very competitive price.  Current figures indicate that the costs incurred come to approximately €326,000.  I believe the forum represents real value for money: it marked a new level of engagement with the most successful members of our diaspora and provided an invaluable opportunity for the Government, opposition and Irish business leaders to exchange ideas and build relationships with a large number of leading CEOs from key markets.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	730	EU relations with Colombia are conducted in the framework of regional relations between the EU and the Andean Community comprising Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.  In 2007, negotiations aimed at concluding a comprehensive Association Agreement between the EU and the Andean Community were formally launched.  This agreement will cover all facets of relations between the EU and these countries, including political dialogue, co-operation and trade. In addition, a multiparty free trade agreement is being negotiated between the EU and two member states of the Andean Community — Colombia and Peru — within the overall framework of the Association Agreement.  The negotiations are being carried out by the Commission on the basis of a mandate from the Council.  The negotiation of a Free Trade Agreement with Colombia is part of an EU strategy to support and encourage the Colombian Government as it tries to restore the authority of the State after decades of violent civil conflict.  By engaging with Colombia in this way, the EU strongly believes it can influence the Government in a manner that also results in greater respect for human rights.  Ireland fully supports that strategy.  We recognise that the promotion of peace and stability in Colombia requires a comprehensive, multi-strand strategy which tackles simultaneously the various social and economic elements underlying the conflict.  Our approach and that of the European Union is to engage with the Colombian Government as it emerges from decades of terrorism and to influence that process in a manner that strengthens the Government's commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms.I am aware of and share the deep concern that has been expressed about the way trade union activists, human rights defenders and journalists have been treated in Colombia.  Ireland, along with its EU partners, monitors the human rights situation in Colombia and raises issues including such human rights abuses with the Colombian Government through the ongoing EU-Colombia dialogue on human rights and in regular contacts at political level.  Last month, during a visit to Colombia to present credentials, Ireland's ambassador to Mexico raised these issues at meetings with the Colombian Minister for Foreign Affairs and with senior officials in the Foreign Ministry.  The ambassador emphasised the importance that Ireland attaches to the protection of human rights defenders and trade unions leaders and explained the considerable attention that their plight has attracted in Ireland.  The Foreign Minister confirmed that this is a priority issue for Colombia and that every effort was being made to address the position in the context of a difficult security situation.  In the course of his visit the Ambassador also met representatives of Irish NGOs to hear at first hand about their concerns about human rights and their views on the negotiations on the Free Trade Agreement.  Along with other EU partners, Ireland will continue to input to the European Commission negotiators to ensure a balanced outcome to the negotiations on the Free Trade Agreement with Colombia, one which gives due prominence to the protection of human rights.  In addition, I will be in contact with the EU Trade Commissioner to underline our interest in an effective human rights clause being included in the agreement.

Course fees that were fully or partially refunded can be broadly divided into the following categories — courses on subjects related specifically to the area of work of the staff member such as management training, accounting, health and safety, IT and Irish courses to assist in providing a service through Irish, as well as specific courses undertaken by staff in specialised areas of the National Museum, National Library and the National Archives; courses on subjects relevant to the work of the Department but with a wider application across the Civil Service such as Policy Analysis and Corporate Governance; and courses aimed at self-development, including interview skills.  Refunds were approved in accordance with the Department's policy on training and development.  Academic qualifications are one of the many factors that are taken into consideration when assigning staff to specific duties within the Department.

Statistics are not yet available to measure the performance of the sector in 2009.  Indications in Fáilte Ireland's tourism barometer survey in September suggest, however, that the sector is performing slightly better than other types of accommodation in what is proving to be a very difficult year for the tourism industry as a whole.  The issue of deductibility for tax is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.

The grantee subsequently informed the Department in a letter dated 12 October 2005 that it could not draw down the grant due to the proposed relocation of the grantee's playing facilities to a new site and that it intended to reapply for funding under a future round of the Programme.  Accordingly, the 2004 allocation is not available to be drawn down by the grantee.  While the club in question made a further application under the 2008 Programme, the application did not comply with the terms and conditions of the Programme as the club did not have adequate title to the proposed facility at the time of application.  It is open to the club to apply to the Department for funding under any future round the Sports Capital Programme if it has a suitable project.

It also funds Volunteer Centres Ireland (VCI), the umbrella body responsible for developing best practice within the network.  VCI and its member centres encourage all community and voluntary organisations that work with volunteers to have in place a suitable volunteer policy.  The development of a volunteer policy is an integral part of the management training currently provided by Volunteer Centres to organisations engaging volunteers.  There are a number of charters on volunteering available within the community and voluntary sector.  One such charter is the "Charter for Effective Volunteering", developed by Volunteering Ireland, which is widely used in the sector.  It is important that each individual community and voluntary organisation adapts a charter to suit the particular needs of its organisation and its overall context.

As the exact nature of the monopoly to which the Deputy refers is not clear, I will be happy to investigate the matter further if the Deputy wishes to provide me with further details.With regard to the modifications referred to by the Deputy, I am advised that the works required will be completed as soon as possible, having regard to ensuring that there is minimal disruption to service users.  My Department will continue to seek completion of the works at the earliest possible date.The subsidy provided to the company concerned is designed both to guarantee the provision of services which would not otherwise be economical to provide and to reduce costs for island communities.

I am currently considering the recommendations made to me by the Review Team.  These recommendations include the matters raised by the Deputy in respect of extension of the Programme and the need to improve coverage and awareness of the Scheme.  The Scheme is currently focused on the security needs of older people and it is not envisaged that this would be extended to people with disabilities or other health related concerns where support would, I believe, more appropriately be addressed by the Health Service Executive.  I have already informed the House of my intention to bring in revised arrangement for the Scheme in early 2010 and these will include the matter of improved information for local organisations.I have re-opened the existing Scheme until such time as revised arrangements are in place.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	748	The Government recognises the devastation suffered by people in many areas of the country as a result of the recent floods.Community Welfare Service staff throughout the country have been providing huge support to families every day since this flooding occurred. They have already provided emergency financial and other assistance to households affected by the flooding to cover items such as clothing, food, bedding, heating, hire of dehumidifiers and emergency accommodation needs. Community Welfare Officers have made over 1,000 initial emergency payments to people in areas impacted by flooding; the average payments being made at this stage are €350. Officers will continue to make these payments as long as there is a requirement to do so.In addition to this, a Humanitarian Assistance Scheme has been set up to provide means-tested financial support to people who have suffered damages to their homes. An initial sum of €10million has been set aside by the Government for this purpose.As the flood waters abate and people assess the full extent of the damage to their homes, qualified households can claim for essential household items such as carpets, flooring, furniture and white goods. Assistance is available for structural repairs to homes not covered by household insurance. Costs of medical treatment and supplies may also be considered in determining assistance where medical cover is not already in place i.e. private health insurance or medical card.The level of payment available under the aid scheme to any qualified individual will depend on the severity of the damage to that person's home and the extent of the loss experienced as well as household income and general family circumstances.The scheme provides hardship alleviation as opposed to full compensation. As on previous occasions, commercial or business losses are not covered by the scheme nor are losses which are covered by household insurance. Humanitarian assistance is not an alternative to insurance in cases where household insurance was available on a reasonable basis. However, where insurance cover is not available because of previous flooding claims, a person may claim humanitarian assistance. Assistance does not cover damage to private rented accommodation or local authority accommodation, though humanitarian assistance may be considered in the case of a tenant's personal belongings.Applications under the scheme are being means tested to ensure that available assistance is prioritised for those who are most vulnerable.In addition to the means test, other factors will also be considered by the Community Welfare Service in assessing individual applications, including:Whether the applicant is or was homeless as a result of the flooding.Age profile of family members i.e. babies, young children or elderly persons.Availability of support from the wider family; andThe special needs that people may have as a result of illness or disability.People seeking assistance should contact their local Community Welfare Office.  Further information and applications forms in relation to the Humanitarian Assistance Scheme are available from the Community Welfare Service in the affected areas and from the Department's website (www.welfare.ie ) and the HSE's website (www.hse.ie).The Department and the Community Welfare Service of the HSE are both working with the Emergency Response Coordination Committee and the various statutory and other agencies working in this area, to ensure that the humanitarian assistance scheme will go towards alleviating the hardship which many hundreds of families have had to endure.

The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.Under the relevant legislative provisions, the Department's relationship is with the tenant; the tenant makes the application for rent supplement and payment is made to the tenant.  Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs.Legislation does however provide for the making of a rent supplement payment to another person on behalf of the recipient, at the tenant's request and with the consent of the HSE.  Almost 20,000 (21%) rent supplement payments are made to a person other than the rent supplemented tenant, for example to a relative, a landlord or landlord's agent.It is open to the landlord to bring to the attention of the HSE any instance where a tenant is receiving rent supplement but is not paying their rent. Where a Community Welfare Officer becomes aware that a person receiving rent supplement is not using that supplement to meet housing costs, payment of the supplement is suspended and the matter investigated.  Any overpayment of rent supplement incurred in circumstances of this kind may be recoverable from the tenant.Where a landlord has a grievance in relation to the non-payment of rent by a tenant, s/he may apply to the Private Residential Tenancies Board to have the dispute resolved through the board's dispute resolution process.

She applied for an exceptional needs payment in respect of mortgage payments from January to June 2009.  The Executive refused an exceptional needs payment as there were no arrears outstanding on the mortgage at the time of the application.An Appeals Officer of the Executive has advised that it has received an appeal from the person concerned but no decision has been made on the appeal to date.  The person concerned will be contacted when the decision has been made on her appeal.

It is paid at a standard weekly rate equivalent to the maximum rate of the relevant social welfare payment that qualifies the applicant for participation in the scheme.  It essentially replaces their existing social welfare income and, in addition, an annual €500 cost of education allowance is payable.  Also, participants may continue to receive any secondary benefits to which they have been entitled.The second level option of the back to education allowance covers full-time second level courses of study at a recognised second level institute of education.  Non-progression does not refer to specific course categories.  To qualify for the back to education, an applicant must be progressing in education by reference to the national framework of qualifications.  An applicant who wishes to pursue a course leading to a qualification at an equivalent or lower level than the qualification already held is not eligible for the back to education allowance.However, this condition can be waived in certain circumstances.  Factors taken into account would include the length of time since obtaining the first qualification, efforts to get employment with the qualification already held and periods of unemployment since obtaining first qualification.  The main consideration in such cases is that the proposed further qualification will substantially enhance the person's employment prospects.In order to qualify for participation in the second level option, an applicant must be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for 3 months immediately prior to commencing the course.  In the case of illness benefit, the qualifying period is two years.  Periods spent on other relevant social welfare payments can count towards the two year qualifying period provided that at least 50% of the period was spent on illness benefit.  People who are awarded statutory redundancy can access the scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.An applicant must be at least 21 years of age prior to commencing an approved course of study.  However, recipients of illness and disability related payments can qualify at 18 years of age, as can lone parents and recipients of jobseekers' payments who have been out of formal education for at least 2 years.The back to education allowance has an important role to play in enhancing the employability skills of jobseekers.  The conditionality of the scheme will continue to be monitored in the context of the objectives of the scheme and changes in the economic climate.

In view of the scale of the current floods the Government has set up a Humanitarian Assistance Scheme to provide means-tested financial support to people who have suffered damages to their homes from the current flooding. An initial sum of €10 million has been set aside by the Government for this purpose.The scheme will provide hardship alleviation as opposed to full compensation. As on previous occasions, commercial or business losses will not be covered by the scheme n or will losses which are covered by household insurance. Neither will it cover damage to private rented accommodation or local authority accommodation, though humanitarian assistance may be considered in the case of a tenant's personal belongings. Applications under the scheme will be means tested to ensure that available assistance will be prioritised for those who are most vulnerable.The humanitarian assistance scheme offers emergency payments for clothing, food, bedding, heating, hire of dehumidifiers and emergency accommodation needs, replacement of essential household items such as carpets, flooring, furniture and white goods and assistance for structural repairs to homes.The objective is to address the hardship being experienced in the areas currently affected, because of the widespread impact of the floods in so many areas of the country, it was not the Government's intention to re-open earlier cases of flooding and I do not consider that it would be appropriate to do so.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	754	The social welfare pension rights of those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties are protected by the homemaker's scheme which was introduced in and took effect from 1994.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  However, the scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension as the standard qualifying conditions must be satisfied.  These require a person to enter insurance 10 years before pension age, pay a minimum of 260 contributions at the correct rate, and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age.  The requirement for paid contributions will increase from 260 to 520 from 2012.There is also a number of other ways in which pension entitlements can be protected.  People who qualify for payments such as carer's allowance or carer's benefit, subject to certain conditions, may qualify for credited contributions for the period they are receiving the payment.  From June 2006, the number of hours a person can engage in employment, self employment, education or training outside the home and still be eligible for carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant was increased from 10 to 15 hours per week.  This means that where a carer remains in employment he or she will continue to pay the appropriate social insurance contribution.  Also, any person, including a carer, may pay voluntary contributions once they satisfy certain qualifying conditions.The operation of the homemaker's scheme was reviewed in the context of the Green Paper on Pensions, with particular regard being paid to the operative date of the scheme and the use of credits for pension purposes rather than the current system of disregards.  Any changes to the scheme will be addressed as part of the national pensions framework which will be published in the near future.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	757	The Department operates two schemes to assist people on social welfare who wish to become self-employed; namely the Short Term Enterprise Allowance (STEA) and the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance (BTWEA).  The short term enterprise allowance, introduced from 1 May 2009, provides immediate access to support where people who have lost their jobs and qualify for Jobseekers' Benefit wish to set up a business.  Payment under the scheme is at the same rate and for the same duration as their entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit.The Back to Work Enterprise Allowance is designed to provide a monetary incentive for people who are dependant on social welfare payments to develop a business while allowing them to retain a reducing proportion of their qualifying social welfare payment, plus secondary benefits, over two years; 100% in year 1 and 75% in year 2.  In the case of jobseekers, the qualifying period required for access to the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance is 12 months, provided a person has an underlying entitlement to Jobseeker's Allowance.  Under both schemes, those taking up self-employment must first have their self-employment project approved as viable and sustainable.  In partnership areas this will be done by the partnership company.  In non-partnership areas it will be done by the Department's local facilitator.  Approval normally involves an interview with the applicant to assess the viability of the proposed project, to provide advice on funding or on "Start Your Own Business" courses and other relevant aspects.The Department provides further support to people who qualify for the short-term enterprise allowance (STEA) or the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance through the technical assistance and training scheme (TATS) under which a participant may qualify for a grant up to a maximum of €1,000 towards certain business start-up expenses.  These include training (in areas such as book-keeping/accounts, preparation of business plans, marketing, literacy and computer training) and the purchase of small items of equipment.  It is administered through the Department's facilitator network based in social welfare local offices.  Part of the facilitator service is the provision of detailed information on the supports available from the Department to people who are planning to start their own business.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	758	The Child Benefit scheme has, in recent years, experienced significant expansion in the volume of claims received, the rates of payment and the diversity of the customer base.  The annual cost in 2008 was approx. €2.46 billion and the payment issues now for children of some 190 nationalities living in Ireland.  Against this background, the control policy for the child benefit scheme has been reviewed to ensure that controls against fraud and abuse of the scheme continue to be effective and relevant.  As a result of the review, enhanced and updated control measures have been devised.  These include the issue, on a quarterly basis, of certificates to selected groups of customers for completion and return to the Department to confirm that they continue to satisfy the conditions for receipt of Child Benefit.  In the case of non-Irish national recipients who are resident in Ireland with their children, certification that the children continue to reside here is required — the proof of such residence can be provided via details of the school or college their child attends or, if the child is not of school-going age, details of the doctor or crèche they attend.  This information is used to verify that the children are resident in Ireland, and for no other purpose.In the case of EU nationals who are working in Ireland but who have qualified children living in another EU state, certification by their employer of continuing employment is requested.  This review process has initially focused on higher-risk categories of customer and will be expanded to include other customer groups in the future.  Customers selected for the reviews have to date been selected largely from non-Irish nationals in receipt of Child Benefit, both those with children resident in Ireland and those working here whose children are resident outside of Ireland.In 2008 a total of 87,850 reviews were completed.  In 2009 a total of 178,410 residency reviews and 70,772 employment reviews have been undertaken.  The cost is an estimated €1 per transaction — including a postage-paid envelope for the customer's reply.  Savings in 2008 arising from the issue of the certificates were just under €27m.  In 2009 to date, savings are €56m and are expected to be in the region of €60m by the end of the year.  The Joint Committee on Social & Family Affairs Welfare Fraud report in September 2009 welcomed the introduction of the revised and more frequent residency and employment certification and was encouraged by the savings made so far as a result of these changes.

It should be noted that these estimates are calculated with reference to macro economic projections by the Department of Finance for each Budget and therefore the circumstances underpinning the calculations can vary considerably from year to year.  Current estimates indicate that the abolition of the €127 PRSI free allowance for Class A contributors would yield some €350 million additional contribution income in a full year.

I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that, on receipt of appeal, it is registered and, in accordance with statutory procedures, the appeal is then forwarded to the Local Office or line section involved to give the Deciding Officer an opportunity to comment on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant and to forward the relevant papers pertaining to the case.At this stage the Deciding Officer has an opportunity to review the decision in favour of the appellant in the light of new facts or evidence that may be produced by the appellant in the grounds of appeal.  In cases where the Deciding Officer does not revise the original decision, the papers — comprising the case papers, the appellant's grounds of appeal and the Deciding Officer's rebuttal of these grounds — are assigned to an Appeals Officer who may decide the case summarily, usually where the facts of a case are not in dispute and there is sufficient documentary evidence, or s/he may decide that the case should be dealt with by way of an oral hearing.There are four ways an appeal may be disposed of — a revised decision by a Deciding Officer; a summary decision by an Appeals Officer, a decision by an Appeals Officer following an oral hearing or the appeal may be withdrawn.

Since then, however, five Appeals Officers have retired and I am advised that the filling of these vacancies are dealt with as a matter of urgency as they arise.  The matter of assigning additional Appeals Officers is kept under constant review but any consideration of extra assignments must be taken in the context of overall government policy on civil service numbers.I am also assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that he is keeping current processes under continuous review with a view to achieving a more effective throughput of appeals.  In that regard, since the beginning of the year, appeals are being rigorously vetted with a view to increasing the number of cases which can be determined by way of summary decision as opposed to holding an oral hearing.  As a result, the number of oral hearings as a proportion of all appeals has fallen from 60% in 2008 to 58% to date this year.   In addition, a number of administrative measures have been taken so as to further simplify, streamline and improve the appeals process.   As a result of these measures, the number of appeals finalised so far this year has increased by 13% from 13,928 in the period 1/1/08 to 30/11/08 to 15,753 in the period 1/1/09 to 30/11/09.While improving processing times and introducing efficiencies remains a major objective of the Social Welfare Appeals Office, it is necessary at all times, given the quasi-judicial nature of the appeals process, to ensure that progress in this regard is achieved in a manner which is not in conflict with due process in terms of the rights of appellants and adherence to the requirements of natural justice.

The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social assistance schemes and child benefit with effect from 1st May 2004. The five factors considered in determining habitual residence are: length and continuity of residence; length and purpose of any absence from the State; the nature and pattern of the person's employment; future intentions; and centre of interest (e.g. family, home, connections).Statistical data on the Live Register is compiled and published by the Central Statistics Office. This data is sourced from information collected on the nationality of claimants when they first sign on the Live Register.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	769	Under Spanish legislation it is a condition for receipt of child benefit that the child is resident in Spain. The payments are also means tested. There are similar residency provisions in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 which, amongst other things, defines a qualified child for Irish child benefit purposes as one who is "ordinarily resident in the State".In general, child benefits are family benefits for the purposes of regulation EC 1408/71, which is designed to coordinate the social security entitlements of employed and self-employed persons moving within the European Community. Article 73 of this Regulation provides that "an employed or self-employed person subject to the legislation of a Member State shall be entitled, in respect of the members of his family who are residing in another Member State, to the family benefits provided for by the legislation of the former State, as if they were residing in that State."This Regulation has direct effect and so overrides the residency conditions in domestic legislation for those covered by the Regulation. It is understood that, with the exception of some one-off payments made on the birth of third and subsequent children, Spanish family benefits are fully covered by EC Regulation 1408/71. Accordingly, as with Irish child benefit, residency conditions cannot be applied in respect of non-resident children where their parents or guardians come within the terms of the EC Regulation in question.

This form pursuant to Section 8 of the Data Protection Act, 1988, authorises the Garda Síochána to furnish to the Defence Forces either, a statement that there are no convictions recorded against a candidate, or a statement of convictions, as the case may be. In the case of candidates under 18 years of age, his/her parent or guardian is required to complete the Consent Form.The Garda Síochána Vetting System is a function of the Department of Justice.  Vetting procedures are processed through the Garda Central Vetting Unit, in Thurles, Co. Tipperary. These procedures were reviewed and revised in 2007.

The UN reimburses some of the costs of participation through a daily payment in respect of troops and wet lease payments in respect of agreed equipment.  Reimbursement by the UN for troop and equipment costs for the MINURCAT mission is estimated at €8.6m for a twelve month period.  As such, net of UN reimbursements, the annual additional cost to the Defence Vote of participation in MINURCAT is €7.6m approx (net of UN).Should the Government decide to withdraw from Chad upon the expiration of Ireland's  initial commitment to MINURCAT mission on 14  March 2010, the costs of repatriation of troops and equipment from the now UN-led mission would be met by the UN.  Withdrawal from MINURCAT would result in a net saving to the Defence Vote of approximately €8.0m per annum.

The Central Council of the Society (as provided for in the Order) controls and manages the affairs of the organisation.  Therefore, I have no responsibility for the day to day running of the Society.The Society has vast experience and a proven record of handling the aftermath of disasters and disbursing monetary relief to victims and I have no doubt that this expertise will be brought to bear in the best possible way on this occasion.  Their plans and structures are highly developed and well tested.  Such plans and structures will be tailored to meet the specific requirements of the current flooding crisis.  It should be noted that the funds to be administered in this instance are funds raised on foot of a public appeal by the Society and are not Government funds and therefore I do not exercise any discretion over the manner in which they may be distributed.The Society has previously administered flood schemes on behalf of the Government and it did so with acknowledged efficiency, effectiveness and minimal bureaucracy.  In recent years, the Irish Red Cross Society has also administered many millions in overseas aid and donations as well as sophisticated bilateral and multilateral aid programmes.  Its reputation in these areas is considerable. Having regard to this fact I have no reason to doubt that the Society can administer its own flood scheme in a similar fashion.

The detailed administration of the schemes, and the certification that projects comply with the terms and conditions of the funding schemes, are the responsibility of the local authority. Approved housing bodies are responsible for the proper management of dwellings provided under the terms of the funding schemes and for compliance with all relevant statutory requirements.In February 2009, I announced my intention to review the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 under which the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) operates. The purpose of this review is to consider whether the Act best supports the PRTB's key functions and whether legislative amendments would support either the achievement of additional operational efficiencies by the PRTB in the delivery of those functions or the broader good working of the private rented sector. I recently announced the preliminary results of this review, details of which are available on my Department's website, www.environ.ie.The review recommends, inter alia, the inclusion within the remit of the Residential Tenancies Act of those segments of the voluntary and co-operative housing sector that most closely parallel the current remit of the Act. While a range of issues still remain to be considered, I intend to initiate a comprehensive piece of amending legislation to give effect to the outcome of the review within the next 12 months.

There are no plans to abolish the claw-back arrangements for owners of homes already purchased under the existing affordable housing schemes.Provision has been made in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 for the introduction of new Affordable Dwelling purchase arrangements to replace existing affordable housing schemes.  Under these, the purchase transaction will be largely unchanged from the affordable purchaser's perspective. However, instead of units being sold at a discounted price, with the value of the discount being subject to a reducing clawback, the State will take an equity stake in affordable units sold. The purchaser will have the option of either buying out the remaining equity in steps or at the end of a fixed period.This new provision has not yet been commenced and I am keeping the timing of its commencement under review having regard to the evolution of the housing market generally. Until the new arrangements are formally commenced, the existing clawback arrangements will continue to apply in relation to the purchase of affordable housing.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	788	The 2002 National Spatial Strategy (NSS) set out a number of population scenarios to 2020 based on different growth trends to assist regional and planning authorities in achieving a better balance of social, economic and physical development across the country and in building critical mass in the Gateways and Hubs to act as drivers of growth for their hinterlands and wider regions.The 2004 Regional Planning Guidelines (RPGs), which are currently being reviewed by regional authorities for adoption of new, updated RPGs in 2010, translate the NSS objectives into concrete actions at regional and local level.  The Planning and Development Act requires that the RPGs must address, inter alia, projected population trends and in this context the 2004 RPGs, having regard to the population scenarios set out in the NSS, proposed population distributions for key urban centres in the respective regions in order to guide development within the overall regional and national strategic policy framework.Building on the detailed regional data gathered in the 2006 Census, my Department published national population projections to 2021 in February 2007.  In light of the changed economic climate and the likely impact of reduced immigration, rising unemployment and a more constrained financial situation on demographic trends, my Department reviewed and updated these national projections in January 2009 and included regional population targets for the years 2010, 2016 and 2022.In October 2009, my Department published Gateway and Hub population targets derived from the updated national and regional population targets.  It is a matter for each Regional Authority together with the constituent City and County Councils to determine population targets for county towns, other smaller towns, villages and rural areas, within their respective regional targets.Regional authorities are now required to incorporate these targets and settlement guidance into the forthcoming Regional Planning Guidelines, and the new Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009 will require that development plan core strategies use these regional targets in defining future demand and priorities, thus providing for closer alignment between national, regional and local plans.

Infrastructure projects are generally advanced by private sector service providers or by local authorities, including by way of a public private partnership.It is a matter for the promoters of such projects to seek and obtain the necessary regulatory approvals i.e. planning permission and a waste licence. In carrying out their functions, planning authorities, including An Bord Pleanála, and the EPA in regard to waste licensing, act independently of the Minister.Government policy in relation to waste management is grounded in the internationally recognised hierarchy of waste options. The most favoured option is waste prevention, followed by minimisation, reuse, recycling, recovery and the least favoured option of disposal to landfill. This commitment to the waste hierarchy has added significance in the context of the requirements of the EU Landfill Directive to divert waste from landfill. Meeting this obligation will entail doubling the level of diversion from landfill by 2010 and further increases in diversion in subsequent years.The Programme for Government agreed in 2007 included a number of objectives relating to waste management, among them a commitment to carry out an international review of waste management plans, practices and procedures and to act on the conclusions.  An important milestone was reached recently with the delivery of the report of consultants engaged to carry out a study to underpin the conclusion of the review. This report is the launching pad for putting in place the policies that we now need to mark a new departure in our approach to waste management. I intend to develop new legislation and a new policy statement on waste management to give effect to recommendations in the report, which I shall bring to Government as soon as possible in 2010.  This will set a policy context which will ensure that waste management services are delivered by the public and private sectors in an environmentally progressive and cost efficient manner.As I have previously indicated, in terms of the capacity of the proposed Poolbeg facility, it is my understanding that the quantities of residual waste currently being collected by the Dublin local authorities may not be sufficient to meet the volumetric contractual commitment which forms part of the public private partnership agreement between Dublin City Council and its private partner. We have recently seen further increases in recycling rates in Dublin, with a corresponding drop in residual waste volumes.  In addition, the implementation of the recommendations of the review consultants' report would have the effect of further reducing the volumes of residual waste generated and driving more waste towards recycling.In these circumstances I have decided that the most appropriate course of action is to appoint an authorised person under section 224 of the Local Government Act 2001 to conduct a review of the parameters of the Poolbeg project. It remains open to Dublin City Council to engage with my Department to discuss any adjustment to the project which might be necessary to bring it into line with the emerging reality of the waste market and waste policy generally.

The OPW have produced a website  to provide useful information to planning authorities, a number of bodies or organisations and the public for the purpose of land-use zoning, development control, planning of infrastructure, identification of properties at risk, and flood warning, and to raise the general awareness amongst the public of the risk to property and possibly life.As regards measures to be taken against future flood risks in the Cork City area, I am informed by the OPW that the Lee Catchment Flood Risk Assessment & Management (CFRAM) Study was commissioned by that Office in conjunction with Cork County Council and Cork City Council in 2006 as the pilot study for the National FRAM Programme. The objective of the Study is to identify and map existing and potential future flood risk areas in the Lee catchment, through detailed hydrological / hydraulic modelling and flood-mapping.  This flood risk assessment also accounts for the likely impacts of land-use change, urban development and climate change on flood risk. Once the flood risk has been quantified and mapped throughout the catchment (with particular focus on developed areas, or areas under potential development pressure), a Catchment Flood Risk Management Plan (CFRMP) is developed, which includes a prioritised set of actions, measures and works to manage the flood risk in the catchment.In light of the recent flood events of November 2009 and the subsequent need to study the new data, the timeframe for completion has been extended to allow for a review of the risks and proposed options. Once this review is complete, the Flood Risk Management Plan (and associated Strategic Environmental Assessment) will be published by OPW, along with the flood maps, for formal public consultation early in the new year.  After all relevant comments from this consultation have been addressed in the Catchment Flood Risk Management Plan, the study will be complete and the recommendations will be put forward for implementation on a phased basis.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	795	I propose to take Questions Nos. 365 and 366 together.Last week, I published the finalised Guidelines for Planning Authorities on the Planning System and Flood Risk Management which are aimed at ensuring a more consistent, rigorous and systematic approach to flood risk identification, assessment and management within the planning system.  These guidelines provide, inter alia, that development in areas at risk of flooding, particularly flood plains, should be avoided unless there are wider sustainability grounds that justify appropriate development and where the risk can be reduced or managed to an acceptable level.There are three types or levels of flood zones defined for the purposes of the Guidelines within which the likelihood of flooding is in a particular range, namely, high, moderate or low probability of flooding and these will be a key tool in flood risk management within the planning process as well as in flood warning and emergency planning.  Most types of development would be considered inappropriate in the high probability flood zone where the probability of flooding from rivers and the sea is highest (i.e. greater than a 1%, or 1 in 100, chance for river flooding or 0.5%, or 1 in 200, probability for coastal flooding).  The Guidelines state that development in this zone must be avoided and/or only considered in exceptional circumstances.These statutory guidelines, when taken together with the legislative measures in the planning code, provide a sound basis for planning authorities to identify, assess and take appropriate steps to manage flood risk in a sustainable manner within their area.  I will continue to assess development and local area plans to monitor implementation of these principles at local level to ensure that future development takes account of these policies.The question of whether any legal liability could accrue to a planning authority in respect of the granting of a planning permission in any particular case is a legal matter.

The projected ongoing annual cost of administering the scheme is €20,000. It is important to note that a significant element of the total cost was incurred in the development of the loan processing model which applies to the Home Choice Loan but which has also now been used in the development of revised systems for processing and credit checking of normal local authority house purchase loan applications under other schemes such as affordable housing and shared ownership. In addition, it is expected that ongoing administrative costs will be met from normal lending margins.Over 1,400 prospective purchasers have formally registered interest on the dedicated Home Choice loan website and, to date, 44 applications have been made. Of these 27 have been declined, 4 have been approved with 2 loans now drawn down, 3 applications have been withdrawn, and a decision is pending in respect of 10 applications where further information has been sought from the applicant.The scheme is operated by four local authorities acting on a regional basis, with administrative support from a Central Processing Unit in the Affordable Homes Partnership.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	798	Waste management services have traditionally been provided at a local level, with individual arrangements being locally determined and tailored to local circumstances.  The present legal framework reflects this. In accordance with section 52 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, the determination of waste management charges, and any associated waiver scheme, is a matter for the relevant local authority, where it acts as the service provider. Similarly, where a private operator provides the collection service, it is a matter for that operator to determine charges.  Generally speaking, waiver schemes do not operate in respect of privately supplied collection services.My Department understands that previous legal advice obtained by a local authority suggests that in an area which is serviced by the private sector the local authority may not provide a waiver in respect of charges for a service which is not directly provided by the local authority. However, a local authority does have discretion itself to provide a waste collection service, including a waiver of some or all of the charges which it may determine, or to procure competitively for a service provider to collect waste on its behalf.

My Department has written to all authorities in the areas affected by flooding to ascertain the damage ensuing from the severe flooding, including damage to water services infrastructure.   This assessment will aid consideration of any capital works required in the short-term and any issues which arise more generally for water services investment.With regard to the combined O'Brien's Bridge, O'Callaghan's Mills, Bodyke, Flagmount and Cratloe sewerage scheme referred to, as outlined in reply to Question No. 78 of 17 September 2009, this scheme is included for funding in my Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009.Local authorities were asked in July to submit an assessment of needs for water and sewerage services to my Department by 23 October 2009.  These assessments, which are currently under examination in my Department, will form a key input to the development of the 2010 to 2012 Water Services Investment Programme, which it is anticipated will be published in early 2010.Further consideration of the Preliminary Report for this scheme, and of the additional information received in September 2009, will be subject to the outcome of the Department's examination of the assessment of needs received from Clare County Council.

The detailed administration of the schemes, including the certification that projects comply with the terms and conditions of the funding schemes and the payment of capital grants in respect of approved housing projects, are the responsibility of the local authority.My Department's Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) provides funding of up to 100% of the approved cost of projects which provide accommodation for persons with special housing needs such as the elderly, the homeless or persons with an intellectual or physical disability. Funding is recouped to the local authority by my Department on foot of certified payment claims based on the expenditure incurred by the relevant housing body on approved projects.In the case of family-type accommodation provided by approved housing bodies under my Department's Capital Loan and Subsidy Scheme (CLSS), funding of up to 100% of the approved cost is made available by way of loan finance provided by the Housing Finance Agency (HFA). Capital funding may be drawn down from the HFA by the relevant authority and recouped to the approved housing body according as work progresses on projects. Loan charges arising in respect of the funding provided to approved housing bodies under the CLSS are recouped to local authorities at regular intervals by my Department.

There is no provision set down in the legislation regarding the timing of when councillors may or may not form opinions on particular issues, nor would such a provision be appropriate.  Accordingly, there are no grounds for my intervention on this basis.Discussions are taking place between my Department and Sligo Borough Council regarding aspects of the recently adopted Sligo and Environs Development Plan, in particular around the strategic and cohesive development of the Sligo Gateway and the enabling of the regeneration of Cranmore.  I am hopeful that these discussions will result in agreement on a shared vision for the future development of the Gateway and its environs.Measures to give effect to the provisions in the Sligo and Environs development plan in relation to pedestrianisation would fall to be pursued under the Road Traffic Acts and Regulations thereunder.

The new framework will become law when it is published in the Official Journal, which is expected on 18 December 2009, following which, Member States will have 18 months to transpose the framework into national law.One of the provisions in the revised framework concerns restrictions on access to and use of services and applications through electronic communications networks, including internet access.  Under this provision, Member States may only impose restrictions on such access subject to adequate procedural safeguards in conformity with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and with general principles of Community law, including effective judicial protection and due process.In adopting this provision, the Council and Parliament have sought to strike a balance between the rights and freedoms of persons to access material and information on the Internet and the rights of copyright holders to protection from illegal downloading of their material.  The issue of illegal downloading of copyrighted material comes under the provisions of copyright legislation, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.

Studies undertaken by ComReg indicate that the majority of Irish people are content with existing broadband speeds and the value for money of their Internet service.My Department is currently considering additional statistical initiatives including a survey of broadband speeds experienced by end users in Ireland.  This latter proposal will be developed in a manner consistent with a wider EU study, proposed by the EU Commission, to provide useful comparability on the quality of the broadband service experienced by end users in different regions and markets. I expect these studies will commence in 2010.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	811	Under the European Communities (Energy Performance of Buildings) Regulations 2006, the technical, environmental and economic feasibility of alternative energy systems for new buildings with a total useful floor area over 1,000 m2 must be considered at the design stage.  These systems include biomass boilers and Combined Heat & Power (CHP) systems. The Building Regulations 2008, Technical Guidance Document, Part L (Conservation of Fuel and Energy — Buildings other than Dwellings), requires consideration to be given to the use of renewable energy, e.g. solar water heating, and to heat recovery from other processes, where applicable.  In compliance with the 2006 and 2008 Regulations, it is the policy of the Office of Public Works (OPW) to conduct a feasibility study on the utilisation of renewable energy technologies in all new buildings over 1,000 m2 as part of the design process.The OPW has installed a number of biomass boiler systems and Solar Panel systems in both new and existing buildings where it has been shown to be both technically and economically feasible.  This practice will continue in the future.The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has recently prioritised work through the statutory Building Regulations Advisory Board to establish realisable targets for reductions in primary energy and CO2 emissions for buildings in all sectors of the economy, not least civic buildings, with a view to upgrading the requirements in Part L (Conservation of Fuel and Energy) of the Building Regulations in 2010.  The work programme currently under way will inform the development of a programme for continuous improvement in Part L requirements in coming years with a view to achieving a Carbon Neutral building standard for buildings other than dwellings, including civic buildings, by 2016.The Government is committed to ensuring that the public sector leads the way on energy efficiency with a mandatory programme of efficiency measures, including the sole use of energy efficient lighting and heating in offices, schools, hospitals and other public buildings to produce 33% energy savings by 2020.I published the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan in May of this year setting out the actions being taken by Government to achieve 20% energy efficiency savings right across the economy by 2020, including the more ambitious target of 33% for the public sector.  Given the challenge presented by the national target and more importantly, the opportunities for considerable savings in energy costs and emissions reductions, it is important that the public sector fulfils an exemplar role.As part of the mechanisms for delivery of the National Action Plan, Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) has been tasked with coordinating public sector actions and with monitoring and recording the energy and CO2 savings achieved.In 2009, SEI launched a €6 million programme that offers grant assistance to the business and public sectors.  The programme allows important cost-cutting energy efficiency measures to be installed at significantly reduced cost to businesses across the country.  Over 80 projects are currently underway under the programme.  As a result of the work carried out, annual savings are expected to be approximately €2.6 million, alongside 12kt CO2 reductions.A dedicated support programme has also been established by SEI offering free energy management training, advice and support to businesses and public sector bodies that are willing to show a commitment to becoming more energy efficient.  The Public Sector Energy Efficiency Programme is designed as the main delivery mechanism for coordinating and encouraging energy efficiency actions by our public sector bodies.  It is providing free energy assessments of up to 400 public buildings in 2009.  It is also providing professional advice on energy management and energy efficiency improvement measures and aims to train 150 public sector building managers this year.  SEI is also developing best practice guidance materials and facilitating specialist workshops on matters such as public street lighting, water services, and ICT.Regulations are currently being finalised in my Department that will include new energy efficient public procurement rules and these will be in place in the coming months.  These new rules will require public bodies to purchase or lease only plant and equipment across a diverse range of technologies that are listed on SEI's database of highly energy efficient products.  This database was developed as part of the Accelerated Capital Allowance (ACA) Scheme for energy efficient technologies.  The ACA Scheme allows businesses to make the right economic decisions that will support ongoing savings whilst increasing cash-flow in the year of purchase.  Companies can now write off the full capital cost of energy efficient equipment in the year of purchase.  The ACA scheme currently covers equipment accounting for at least 60% of the energy used by industry in Ireland.SEI is also tasked in these regulations with producing general guidelines on energy efficient procurement and these will be progressed in conjunction with the new OPW National Public Procurement Office.Next year will also see the design and introduction of a new Programme which will involve the promotion of both existing and innovative energy services by energy companies in Ireland.  This Programme will significantly reduce energy costs and related greenhouse gas emissions in homes, businesses and the public sector across the country whilst creating employment and developing a market for energy services in Ireland.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	822	The table below shows the number of Early Retirement Scheme applications received from Waterford and the number paid for each year since 2004.  (In cases where applications were incomplete when they were submitted, payment did not begin until the deficiencies were corrected.)ERS2 Applications receivedERS2 Applications paidERS3 Applications ReceivedERS3 Applications Paid20041072005131320061410200776220088820094Total37371414A total of 51 applications were received from Waterford for the years 2004 to 2008. All of these applicants are currently in payment.  The Early Retirement Scheme (ERS3) 2007 was suspended for new applications with effect from 15 October 2008.  However it became apparent that there were a certain number of farmers who had their preparations to apply for the Scheme completed or close to completion at that point.  Consequently, I took the decision to re-open the Scheme temporarily on 23 September 2009 with limited additional funding with a view to accepting as many as possible of the applications that fell into this category.  My Department received a further 175 applications up to the closing date of 30 October 2009, of which 6 were from applicants in Waterford.  All of these applications are currently being examined, but none have been approved to date.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	823	I propose to take Questions Nos. 395 and 396 together.The information requested by the Deputy will be forwarded to him as soon as possible.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	824	Payments under the Single Payment Scheme to Waterford applicants in each of the years 2007, 2008 and 2009 (to date), are as follows:2007: 2,381 applicants received payments worth €40,794,597.30;2008: 2,431 applicants received payments worth €40,741,003.50;2009: 2,450 applicants received payments worth €39,898,346.40.Under the 2009 Scheme, the 70% advance payments began issuing on 19 October, while the 30% balancing payments began issuing on 1 December. Payments are continuing to issue in individual cases cleared for payment.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	826	As communicated to you in previous replies to questions asked on this matter, my Department had analyses conducted by the Irish Equine Centre on a number of samples during 2009.  These were specifically related to the gas flushing of imported poultrymeat.Following receipt of the final elements of the results of these tests there will be further discussions with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland about any additional follow up actions.  In this context the FSAI circulated best practice guidelines to retailers on the setting of use-by dates for poultry taken from opened gas-flushed packs earlier this year.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	827	While the deadline for the receipt of applications under the 2009 Single Payment Scheme was 15 May 2009, an application was only received by my Department from the person named on 2 October 2009.  An official from my Department has recently been in direct contact with the person named and, on the understanding that medical reasons caused the delay in the submission of the application, requested that appropriate medical evidence be submitted. Immediately on receipt of a satisfactory response from the person named, the application will be further processed with a view to payment at an early date.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	828	The existing quota management system is designed to ensure, having regard to fishing patterns and market conditions, the best possible spread both between fishermen and also in terms of take up of quota during the year.A key objective for specific stocks under pressure is the avoidance of early closure of fisheries through rapid exhaustion of quota.  This is important because our whitefish fisheries are mixed and a closure can lead to discarding of marketable fish.  Under the current arrangements, a formal Quota Management Advisory Committee involving fishing industry representatives, the Department and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority meets each month and as far as possible the agreed recommendations from industry representations are followed for monthly regimes for particular stocks.  Additional meetings are organised as required to discuss the details of particular fisheries mainly in the pelagic sector.In the current year, 40 white fish stocks are being managed.  The agreed monthly catch limits are circulated to industry representatives and displayed on the Department's web- site.  Of the whitefish stocks under management only one is currently closed and that is due to a very small available quota.  A further 11 pelagic stocks and 16 deep sea stocks are also under management, many of which have very specific management arrangements including closure for  certain deepsea stocks designed to reflect the requirements of the relevant sector and allow  for the swapping of certain deep sea stocks with other Member States for stocks of interest to our industry.The fishing of pelagic species is generally confined to the spring and autumn months with the fisheries being opened and closed on the basis of industry recommendations.  In so far as it is possible under the existing regulatory framework the Department endeavours to implement industry proposals in respect of the management of the pelagic fisheries.  The available quotas are allocated in the agreed ratios to the participating vessels.  Landing figures are reviewed during the fishing periods.  Remaining quota is often re-allocated to ensure that all available quotas are landed.A key feature of all existing management arrangements is that they are designed and implemented through a process of consultation with all relevant industry groups.  Recommendations for changes in the way we manage our fisheries are always given careful consideration and if possible implemented.  My officials constantly analyse our various management arrangements with a view to maintaining economic and sustainable fisheries for our fleet.The level of uncaught quota across all stocks depends upon a variety of factors including weather, price and proximity.  For the areas subject to the Cod Recovery Plan (the Irish Sea and the north west) restrictions on the amount of time that vessels can spend at sea, the kind of gears than can be used or the number of vessels that can be authorised to fish at any one time are also in place.  In terms of the waters off the south and west coast such provisions where they are in place are not restrictive for many whitefish stocks and therefore it has to be assumed that the reason why there are a number of quotas under utilised is that vessel owners have consciously decided not to target or land particular species for business reasons.Where possible, uncaught quotas are swapped with other Member States for stocks that our industry wish to catch.  In addition, it is possible to carry forward up to 10% of a yearly quota for use the following year for a large number of stocks.With regard to the specific data requested, this is being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	829	Bord Iascaigh Mhara has undertaken a review of the ice plant network operated by the agency.  It has come to the conclusion that there is no realistic alternative to closure as sales have continued to decline and the network is operating at a significant loss.  The Board has decided in principle to close the network by December 2010.  In this regard it is noted that as part of a range of cost cutting measures proposed in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes (Volume II: Detailed Papers- Programme A — Agriculture food & fisheries policy trade and development), it was recommended that the Bord Iascaigh Mhara ice plant network, which includes the Greencastle ice plant, should be closed in favour of a more market based approach.I am informed by my officials that Bord Iascaigh Mhara is working to the 2010 timeframe, in an effort to enable an orderly withdrawal from ice manufacture and to help both minimize disruption to the seafood industry and allow the industry to prepare for the change.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	830	There are no plans for a further decommissioning scheme at present.  Any further scheme will be considered in the context of available funding and priorities for support within the seafood sector.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	833	This is a matter for the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority (SFPA), an independent authority, which was established under Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 on January 1st 2007.  The Act clearly provides that the Authority is independent in the exercise of its functions and as such I have no remit as to its work programme or its strategic deployment of resources.I have, however, asked the SFPA to reply directly to the Deputy.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	834	The EU Fisheries Councils in November and December 2008 adopted a new Cod Recovery Plan, as set out in Council Regulation (EC) No. 1342/2008 and Annex IIa of the 2009 TAC and Quota Regulation (EC) No 43/2009.  Under these regulations, Ireland is required to introduce and implement a licensing regime to manage its allocation of fishing effort — days at sea limits in areas VIa (north west of Ireland) and VIIa (the Irish Sea) for vessels using specified gear types.Under the EU Recovery Plan, each Member State is granted an annual allocation of fishing effort for the ICES areas covered by the Plan, which include the Irish Sea — VIIa, and the North West waters off Ireland and Scotland -VIa.  The fishing effort allocations to Member States are broken down by particular types of fishing gear used in these areas.The Recovery Plan is intended to restrict the fishing activity of fishing vessels operating in either the Irish Sea or the north west of Ireland and Scotland which catch cod.  The effort level was established by the EU Fisheries Council, on the basis of an EU Commission proposal, based on track record for the average of the period 2005 to 2007 and was then reduced by 25%.  The impact of this is that there is now limited fishing effort available for all vessels, including Irish vessels, fishing in the areas.Minister Killeen previously agreed to the implementation of a Pilot Effort Management Scheme for the period 1 February 2009 — 30 April 2009 which was primarily based on track record.  Some further modifications to this pilot scheme were agreed during February.  Minister Killeen also established a Steering Group consisting of representatives of the Irish fishing industry, with input from the Marine Institute, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority and Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Department to advise on how the Pilot Scheme might be revised.To date, formal meetings of the Steering Group have taken place on twelve separate occasions.  A second pilot management scheme was agreed for the period 1 May to 31 October 2009 and this was again primarily based on track record.  Following agreement of the Steering Group a one off allocation was granted to a number of vessels without track record in area VIa for the period 6 October to 31 October 2009 including the vessel referred to by the deputy.A particular difficulty in area VIa arises in relation to Article 14.3 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1342/2008 which sets a limit for the kw capacity of the vessels granted an authorisation in 2009 based on the total kw capacity of vessels active in 2006 or 2007.  Essentially, there is a limit to the number of authorisations that can be issued per year.Since its inception the Steering group has been concerned with trying to ensure that those vessel owners that were historically active in these fisheries would continue to have some degree of access under the new Regulation.  Considerable time and effort was also spent in trying to accommodate those vessel owners that for whatever reason were not active in the past but wished to become so.The Steering Group recommended that the pilot management scheme for area VIa for the period 1 November 2009 to 31 January 2010 would be based on track record for the period 2004 to 2008 and that due to the capacity cap imposed by Article 14.3 that it was not possible, for this period, to make any allocations to vessels without track record in Area VI.  This particular vessel did not have any track record of fishing using the regulated gears in area VIa for period 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2008.  Consequently, unfortunately, it is not possible to issue an authorisation to this vessel for the current management period.I and my colleague Minister Killeen, fully appreciate  that the cod recovery regime presents considerable challenges in the way it impacts on fishermen and I  wish to assure you that every effort is made to alleviate this in as far as it is practicable and within the legal framework.  Minister Killeen has made numerous efforts to try and alleviate the impact of this regulation and this work is ongoing through the Steering Group and directly with the Commission. However, for 2010 we are facing further restrictions involving an additional 25% reduction in this area.

His grant-aid has been approved and payment will be issued shortly by my Department.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	836	An application from the persons named was received on 9 October 2009.  Following an initial examination my Department wrote to the applicants on 25 November 2009 regarding a number of deficiencies in the application.  Processing of the application will recommence once these deficiencies have been rectified.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	837	I refer to my reply of 10 November 2009 to Question No. 40117/09.  The investigation into this herd is still ongoing and it is not possible to say at this stage when it will be completed.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	838	As an emergency response to the extreme flooding conditions in parts of the country, my Department has issued advice with regard to problems that may be experienced by farmers due to flooding.  Farmers are advised that in emergency cases, they are permitted to pump some water out of flooded tanks but only for reasons of animal welfare. Naturally, this concession will apply only in those areas that have been severely affected by flooding.This concession relates to pumping out of excess water only. Tanks should not be agitated before pumping and farmers should use a sludge pump if possible rather than a vacuum tanker. The suction pipe should be inserted almost to the bottom of the slurry tank so that solids are not removed. The farmer should pump out no more water than is necessary to alleviate the immediate animal welfare problem. This water should not be discharged directly to a watercourse. If water is already above the level of the central passageway or the apron, there is no point in trying to pump water from the tank. In this case, the animals will have to be removed from the shed.  This does not permit the application of slurry on land during the prohibited period for the spreading of fertilisers under the Nitrates Regulations.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	842	As the Deputy is aware, the purpose of the Government decision to implement a recruitment and promotion moratorium in the public sector is to facilitate a permanent, structural reduction in the numbers of staff serving in the public sector and is intended to contribute significant and ongoing savings to the Exchequer. In applying this moratorium generally, teaching and research activities in the education sector have been afforded significant exemptions relative to other areas of public expenditure. Nonetheless, the Deputy will appreciate that the sector has to contribute towards overall public sector numbers reductions.In the area of higher education, the Government agreed that an employment control framework be developed to provide for the application of the moratorium arrangements to higher education institutions, subject to the continued oversight and review by the HEA and both my Department and the Department of Finance. This framework allows flexibility around recruitment into posts that are considered essential to maintaining core teaching and research activities, subject to an overall ceiling on numbers employed. The Government is anxious to work with the publicly funded higher education institutions in achieving necessary reductions in public expenditure within the sector as an essential part of overall budgetary strategy. The employment control framework aims to enable this while providing sufficient flexibility for the protection of frontline teaching and research activities.It is a matter for the individual higher education institutions, and in the case of the National Optometry Centre which forms part of the School of Physics in the Dublin Institute of Technology's Faculty of Science, for DIT to manage their staffing resources in the context of implementing the framework.

These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where, for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is required. If an individual applicant considers that she/he has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant, or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, she/he may appeal, in the first instance, to the relevant local authority or VEC.Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the assessing authority, and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in her/his case, an appeal form outlining the position may be submitted by the applicant to my Department. No appeal has been received by my Department to date from the candidate referred to by the Deputy.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	844	The building project for the school to which the Deputy refers is currently at an advanced stage of architectural planning. The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction is dependent on the prioritisation of competing demands on the funding available under the Department's capital budget. The proposed building project will be considered in the context of the Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme for 2010 and subsequent years. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the delivery of the project at this time.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	845	In accordance with the conditions set out in the Department of Finance circular 23/07 my Department operates schemes to provide financial assistance to officials who undertake courses in higher or further education primarily in their own time which support and enhance their knowledge and skills. The Department does not re-assign administrative staff to particular sections solely on the basis of new or further qualifications they obtain. For example, staff who undertake legal or human resource type courses can equally use that knowledge in a wide variety of sections or units throughout the Department.In relation to supporting the professional staff, my Department assists members with continued professional development (CPD) to ensure they are familiar with developments in their particular field and maintain their professional recognition. Management in these sections can then assign particular duties/projects to the professional person they feel has the best experience and qualifications to address particular issues. The types of areas concerned are the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), the Department's Planning & Building Unit and the Schools' Inspectorate. The number of staff who availed of the scheme for the years requested by the Deputy is contained in the attached tabular statement.As outlined above, the object of the scheme is to encourage staff to undertake study on their own time with a view to having the staffing cohort in any particular line section adept with a diverse set of core skills appropriate to the Civil Service in order to deliver services to a high standard. In addition to this, the Training Unit in my Department arranges courses for staff to upskill where necessary, particularly in the area of new computer technology.

As part of the new framework for the promotion of Ireland as a centre for international education, I will shortly be establishing a High Level Group on international education, which will be reflective of the relevant Government departments, State agencies and educational providers with an interest in this area.  This Group will include representation from the English language sector.  In its initial phase of work, the Group will develop an action plan for enhanced performance in the area of international education.

Under this scheme €22m in ICT grants will be provided to primary schools before the end of this year. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, on 27th November last, a grant in the amount of €4,674.74 issued to the school to which he refers, for investment in ICT. A letter outlining the terms and conditions attached to the ICT grant scheme also issued to the school.

Although an overall offer of a contribution on behalf of the congregations collectively was sought, the congregations' responses have been on an individual basis.I will be bringing details of the congregations' offers of contributions together with the report of the Panel, appointed by the Government to assess the adequacy of the congregations' financial statements as a basis for assessing their resources, to the attention of the Government at the earliest opportunity.  The Deputy will be aware that some religious congregations have published their individual offers and details of their respective financial positions. Although the approach taken by any individual congregation is a matter for it, my objective is to have the collective comprehensive position available.  The Government will consider the publication arrangements and in this regard, I am concerned to ensure that the survivors and their representatives are kept fully informed of developments.

In a small number of cases, complex invoices, such as payments to  construction contractors, require close scrutiny before they can be certified  as being in order for payment.The following steps have been taken by my Department to ensure compliance with  the new requirement to reduce the payment period for commercial transactions  from 30 to 15 calendar days:All staff of the Department were notified of the new requirement on 28 May.  They were advised of the key steps to be taken to ensure the Department would  be in a position to adhere to the new deadline. This notice has also been  placed on the Department's Intranet site.A further notice was issued to senior management in the Department on 12  June, requesting them to ensure that prompt payment of suppliers is made a  priority and to ensure that the necessary administrative arrangements to enable  this are put in place.The Department's updated Financial Circular was issued to all staff on 27  August and included advice on payments and Prompt Payment requirements. This  circular is also available on the Department's intranet site.As part of each Department's requirement to report quarterly regarding the  new arrangement, a report was generated analysing payments made by this  Department between  June and October 2009. A copy of this report is set out below  and is also available on my Department's website. The report showed that 84.7%  of payments were made within 15 days from the date of receipt of a valid  invoice from a supplier, 10.9% of payments were made between 15 and 30 days  while 4.2% of payments were made after 30 days. A further 0.2% of invoices (9  invoices) at that time required further scrutiny before being processed for  payment.Training courses have been provided to staff in relation to the Prompt  Payment requirements.I have no plans to extend the arrangements to the payment of capitation or  other grants from my Department to schools, as they do not constitute payments  to suppliers and are not comprehended by the arrangements referred to by the  Deputy. Capitation grant payments are calculated based on student numbers  returns made by schools to my department each year by 30th September. Currently  the capitation grant to primary schools is paid in 2 instalments, the first in  January (70%) and the balance in June. Second Level schools are paid the  capitation grant in 3 equal instalments, in September, January and April.Reporting Template pursuant to Government Decision No. S29296 of 19 May 2009Government Department:  Department of Education & Science (Vote 26)Quarterly Period Covered: 15th June to 15th October 2009DetailsNumberValuePercentage (%) of total payments made€Total payments made in Quarter5,589185,455,590.07(100%)Number of payments made within 15 days4,734181,848,232.4184.70%Number of payments made within 16 days to 30 days6122,917,390.4410.95%Number of payments made in excess of 30 days234532,007.894.19%Disputed Invoices9157,962.330.16%Total5,589185,455,590.07100%Prepared by: Finance Unit Dublin — Phone No. (01) 889 2217

At that meeting it was agreed that my  Department would examine a number of possible building options in relation to  the two proposed sites identified for the school referred to by the Deputy.   One site is in the ownership of the Local Authority while the second site is in  the ownership of the Health Service Executive.  An examination of the options  identified is at an advanced stage.  My officials intend meeting with either  the Local Authority or the Health Service Executive with a view to discussing  terms for a land transfer.Upon acquisition of a suitable site, the proposed building project for the  school will be considered in the context of the capital budget available to my  Department for school buildings generally.

The application was assessed and the  project was assigned a band rating of 1.4.A technical inspection was carried out in 2006 on the existing school buildings  to determine which would be suitable to facilitate the amalgamated school. The  report produced following this inspection concluded that the most suitable  building to facilitate the amalgamation would be the girls' school and also  that an additional portion of land be acquired from the Sisters of Mercy to  facilitate the development.The Sisters of Mercy have indicated that they would, in principle, be disposed  to selling the current school site and additional lands to the rear of the  school to facilitate the proposed works.The progression of this building project and the acquisition of the additional  land required to facilitate the amalgamation, will be considered in the context  of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of my  Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the  progression of the project at this time.

The application and acceptance process for a  particular course is a matter for the higher education institution concerned.  In the case of the LMA programmes information would also have been publicly  available through the HEA website and through Department of Social and Family  Affairs offices.Applicants for places on the LMA programme were required to meet the  eligibility criteria established for the initiative. As part of the application  process, institutions were required to receive from applicants one of the  following pieces of documentation: — Confirmation from the local social welfare office of the duration of the  applicant's claim to a jobseekers payment  — A copy of form RP50 confirming the applicant is entitled to statutory  redundancy from their most recent employment.Participants on the scheme are not required to pay the €1,500 registration fee  and, while postgraduate students may be required to pay a nominal charge,  students are not charged tuition fees. Participants who continue to meet all  Department of Social and Family Affairs criteria on eligibility for Job Seekers  Benefit and Job Seekers Allowance are entitled to retain their payments while  studying on these programmes.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	860	I propose to take Questions Nos. 433 to 437, inclusive, together.The Government allocated €1m in March 2008 from the Dormant Accounts  Educational Disadvantage Programme for a scheme to assist 100 disadvantaged  schools to progress towards achieving Digital Schools Status, this was  subsequently increased to €1.6m in December 2008 in the expectation that the  scheme would be heavily subscribed.The process of identifying the 100 primary schools for participation in the  scheme involved selecting those schools participating in the Primary Urban Band  1 strand of my Department's DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in  Schools) Programme. The selection of schools for inclusion in DEIS was based on  an extensive identification process conducted by the Educational Research  Centre on behalf of the Department in 2005 which identified the socio-economic  variables that collectively best predict achievement. At present some 200  schools are included in the Primary Urban Band 1 strand of DEIS and within that  band there are varying levels of disadvantage ranging from extreme to just  severe. The 100 schools identified with the highest concentration of  disadvantage within that band have been targeted to benefit from this  particular scheme and applications were invited from these schools.The school referred to by the Deputy is outside of the first 100 DEIS Urban  Band 1 schools and therefore was not included in the scheme. The possibility of  extending the scheme in the future to other DEIS schools will be considered in  the light of future available resources.The decision to limit the grant to the top 100 DEIS band 1 schools was taken on  the basis that the available funds were limited and that dividing the limited  overall fund between all DEIS band 1 schools (of which there are presently 200)  would so dilute the individual grants as to render them insufficient to achieve  their objectives.In 2006 the Comptroller and Auditor General reported on educational  disadvantage initiatives in the Primary Sector and central to the findings was  the importance of not spreading limited resources too thinly. The rationale for  this decision was in line with these recommendations whereby limited resources  are targeted on the schools in most need. My Department is committed to  focussing its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the  most disadvantaged communities.The Deputy will also be aware that €22 million in grants for ICT infrastructure  was issued to primary schools at the end of November, with the priority on  ensuring that there is a teaching computer and digital projector in every  classroom.  The school referred to by the Deputy has been awarded funding under  this scheme.

It is my Department's policy to pay the qualified rate  to teachers from 1st September of the school year in which recognition has been  obtained from the Teaching Council.Since the qualifications were recognised during the 2009/2010 academic year,  salary at the qualified rate was backdated to the 1st September 2009 to the  teacher in question.Accordingly, the person cannot be awarded arrears back to September 2008.

The Trustees expressed some concern about the future of the school and it is my understanding that they are considering a number of options in this regard.The Department understand that the Trustees have recently met with the Board of Management, staff and representatives of the parents from the school to inform them of their concerns on its viability. Officials from my Department will shortly contact the Trustees to clarify their intentions.The Department decision will depend on the Trustees' and Board of Management's decision on the school's future.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	863	Under the terms of my Department's student grant and free fees schemes, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants and free tuition fees where they satisfy the prescribed conditions of the individual schemes, including those relating to progression.  In general, students who previously pursued a course of study are not eligible for grant assistance or free tuition fees in respect of a second period of study at the same level, irrespective of whether or not a grant or tuition fees were paid previously. The main objective of this policy is to assist as many students as possible in obtaining one undergraduate degree and in progressing, where appropriate, to a postgraduate course of study. Subject to the conditions of the individual schemes, free tuition and grants are available where students are progressing to a course at a higher level.An approved course for the purposes of the Schemes means a full-time undergraduate course of not less than two years duration and a full-time postgraduate course of not less than one year duration pursued in an approved institution.While I have no plans at present to change the current progression requirements of the existing schemes, my Department has been working closely with the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Social and Family Affairs to develop appropriate responses to meet the upskilling needs of those who are losing their jobs or facing uncertain employment prospects.The Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and therefore, their prospects of returning to the workforce. Eligibility for the Back to Education Allowance and associated payments is determined and administered by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.

Results of a survey on the uptake of Stay Safe carried out by CAPP and my Department, identified over 700 schools which were either not implementing the Stay Safe programme in full, or not implementing the programme at all.My Department, through Teacher Education Section, made additional resources available in order to provide targeted support to these schools. In September 2009, there remained 266 schools which had yet to access CPD and this number has now been reduced to less than 200.CAPP, in conjunction with the Primary Professional Development Service (PPDS) will continue to target the provision of CPD in these schools.My Department has also issued Child Protection Guidelines and Procedures to all primary schools giving direction and guidance to school management and staff in dealing with allegations or suspicions of child abuse, with the protection and well-being of the child being the most important consideration.  These were based on the Children First national guidelines issued by the Department of  Health and Children and were specifically adapted to cater for a primary school setting. Child Protection Guidelines training is available to all Designated Liaison Persons and Deputies in schools.

My Department does not collect information on the unit cost of processing grant applications within each of the 66 bodies involved.The unit cost involved for each of these awarding bodies will vary depending on their size, the level of activity, the numbers of staff assigned either on a full-time or part-time basis and other relevant factors.  The overall staffing cost associated with administering student grants in the local authorities and VECs was estimated at €8.9m in March 2009.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-12-08 00:00:00	Prelude	866	As the Deputy will be aware from my answer of 1 December to Parliamentary Question 43982/09, my Department's capital investment in schools in Waterford amounts to €6.29 million at primary level and €2.88 million at post-primary level so far this year.In any year, my Department's overall capital budget is allocated between the primary, post-primary and third-level sectors.  Within the primary and post-primary sector, the allocation is further allocated to particular capital grant schemes in operation in that sector e.g. major building projects, devolved building grant schemes such as the Permanent Accommodation Scheme, Summer Works Scheme, Emergency Works scheme and Minor Works Grant scheme (for primary schools).  These allocations are made in accordance with the expected requirements under each scheme by sector, taking into account contractual commitments under each scheme that are carried forward from previous years and the expected expenditure arising from any new projects which will commence during the year.An estimated expenditure on individual major building projects, either under construction or approved to proceed to tender and construction, is taken into account at start of year in determining the overall profiles of expenditure at sectoral level. Where projects have commenced construction and a contractual commitment can be determined, this can be taken as an accurate guide to  expected expenditure during the year. There were no major projects in construction in Waterford at the start of 2009.For projects on the construction programme, prior to the placement of a construction contract, aggregate expenditure projection is estimated in accordance with the project cost plans and the expected dates of commencement on site.There are four such projects in County Waterford currently on the construction programme.  All four projects are currently out to tender and the project costs will be confirmed when a tender report has been received for each project.The expenditure in the primary and post-primary sectors, under the various schemes, is monitored and managed throughout the year and appropriate adjustments are made as appropriate. The proportion of the annual capital allocation which will be expended on major projects in any capital year depends on the progress of individual projects to tender and construction and the speed of construction for projects on-site. The exact position in respect of individual projects will only become clear at the end of the year.

The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners. There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.  Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on the Department's website.In November 2009, the school made a further application for the provision of an additional mainstream classroom and ancillary accommodation.   This application will be assessed shortly.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme. However, in view of the level of demand on the Department's capital budget, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression the project at this time.
