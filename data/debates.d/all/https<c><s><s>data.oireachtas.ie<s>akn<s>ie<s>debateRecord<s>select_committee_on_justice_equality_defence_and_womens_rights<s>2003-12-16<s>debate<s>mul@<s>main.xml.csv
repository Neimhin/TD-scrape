The amendment list and the lists of substitute and additional amendments have been circulated to members. Is it agreed to suspend for the Order of Business and resume immediately thereafter? Agreed.Before we go to section 1, Deputy Deasy has other important business and has asked if the Minister would allow some of the amendments he has tabled on Committee Stage to be tabled on Report Stage.

In page 5, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following subsection:"(2) This Act in so far as it relates to extradition and the Extradition Acts 1965 to 2001 may be cited together as the Extradition Acts 1965 to 2003.".I welcome the Minister and his officials. This is important legislation on extradition. It will have the effect of abolishing all Ireland's extradition arrangements with the member states and putting in place a different administrative mechanism to effect the surrender of citizens in this jurisdiction. My amendment provides that this Act in so far as it relates to extradition and the Extradition Acts 1965 to 2001 should be cited together as the Extradition Acts 1965 to 2003 because effectively that is what we are dealing with. Effectively we will be establishing a mechanism for citizens to be extradited from this country, a common law jurisdiction underpinned by a Constitution, to other jurisdictions which are, by and large, civil law jurisdictions and which in a number of cases are not underpinned by a constitution. It is a fundamental issue and I would appreciate it if the Minister could accept this amendment.

If you wish, Chairman, I will go through my opening remarks so that I cover some of the other points arising.One of my questions relates to the Minister's statement that we have international obligations to ensure that this is delivered by the end of the year. What are the consequences for Ireland of refusing to incorporate the enabling legislation in this case? My understanding is that Third Pillar measures do not currently come under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Therefore there can be no proceedings against Ireland for claiming that on reconsideration of the framework directives our national Parliament considers there are inadequate safeguards and that it would require the undermining of our constitutional rights, and on this basis it is unacceptable to us.What will happen to the other countries who will not have passed this or similar legislation by the deadline? As far as I am aware, only four other countries have passed similar legislation to give effect to this arrest warrant. France and Germany recently demonstrated that one can ignore such directives. They are not abiding by the Stability and Growth Pact. If such an agreement can be ignored, what is the position in this case where the national Parliament could state that, on reflection, we do not agree to participate in the European arrest warrant provisions?When this measure was first proposed at the Tampere Summit in 1999, it was discussed in the context of an EU legal system harmonisation over a period of a decade or more. The Minister has frequently defended the superiority of our constitutional guarantees over European systems and has argued the need to protect the integrity of the Constitution. I do not know how he can justify the measures proposed in this document in the absence of harmonised safeguards.The Human Rights Commission has pointed out that the framework decision itself was based on a flawed presumption of the effective and equivalent protections between member states, but that does not necessarily exist, as the Minister knows. How could he justify measures that will reduce judicial scrutiny in Irish courts? Does he not see that this is a broader drive towards the integration of the EU legal systems and ultimately what some believe to be the creation of an EU super state? What is the difference between this proposal and the slippery slope of harmonisation?
#JohnBruton	unknown-#JohnBruton-party	unknown-#JohnBruton-dob	unknown-#JohnBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I congratulate DeputyÓ Snodaigh on his sterling defence of the British legal system and his support for the maintenance of a British legal system rather than the introduction of a rational European system which is more in line with my views of the future of this country.I have come here to support this good legislation. I strongly support the idea of a European arrest warrant. The reality is that the origin, directly or indirectly, of the majority of the crimes we face in this jurisdiction is within the operations of international drug networks and networks of other forms of crime which are organised on a Europe-wide basis. It has been estimated by Europol that there are in the region of 30,000 people engaged in international organised crime in Europe. These are gathered together in about 300 to 400 separate organised gangs, of whom about 31 originate in Ireland, but there is considerable interdependence. They are as sophisticated as any multinational company in the legitimate economy. They engage in subcontracting, in specialisation and in co-operation, even across language barriers. Many think the Albanian gangs operate only with other Albanians. The fact is that these groups have the capacity to operate multi-ethnically.The only way such groups can be combated is by a Europe-wide attempt to deal with them. That obviously requires that there should be a European arrest warrant in the case of the comparatively limited number of offences to which the European arrest warrant applies and to which the Minister's predecessor agreed. The Minister, Deputy McDowell, was then the Attorney General who wisely advised the Government in this matter and I compliment him.

If it is, as I understand it to be, one which would effectively remove the notion of a common European arrest warrant and bring us back to a system of traditional extradition, then I would not agree with it. If it is merely a slight change in the citation for explanatory purposes, I would have no difficulty with it. I regret that I was not present to hear him explain the amendment and I am commenting on it in ignorance.

I will deal with it, one way or the other, on Report Stage if he resubmits it. This is not an extradition Bill. It is a Bill to do with a rendition which is not extradition in the classical sense. It is a European arrest warrant. It is more or less on the same lines as the rendition that existed between Ireland and the constituent parts of the United Kingdom. Therefore we will have to think about whether we want to have it cited jointly with our extradition law or have it as separate free-standing legislation. I will think about that between now and Report Stage.On the broader issue, at this stage the UK, Spain, Portugal and Denmark have implemented in legislation the European arrest warrant. Belgium, Ireland, Finland and Sweden expect to be in a position to do so. Effectively eight of the 15 countries will have implemented it.Deputy Bruton will see the irony in that Germany, France, the Netherlands, Italy, Greece, Austria, Luxembourg and other states have not done so and are not expected to do so by 1 January, but I will not comment further on that save to say that there is a pattern.
#JohnBruton	unknown-#JohnBruton-party	unknown-#JohnBruton-dob	unknown-#JohnBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	11	They do not have Ministers for Justice as efficient as ours and that is obviously the problem.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	12	Returning to DeputyÓ Snodaigh's fundamental proposition, this measure is the result of a fundamental strategic decision made by the European Union at Tampere, which was that they would not go down the road of approximation and a single law for the whole of Europe but would make all the systems interoperable and mutually recognitive. They decided that they would avoid the creating of a super state with a single law, and that is what this is all about. The strategic direction at that time was that member states would continue to have autonomy in their own criminal justice systems but that the price of that, in effect, would be to make them interoperable and mutually recognitive.We are now in the position where the implementation of this system is an international obligation and in my view it would be embarrassing for Ireland, having taken the stance we have taken on our own autonomy in criminal justice matters, to say that we want to do a U-turn on this, tear up this strategy and go back to where we were in the first place. In a Europe where there is freedom of movement, freedom of travel and freedom of establishment, and all the opportunities for criminality to which Deputy Bruton referred, it seems to me that there must be some system which is adequate to respond to the opportunities which that provides for criminality.There are two broad strategies available: a uniform harmonised system of law right across Europe, which is something I believe the Irish do not want; or, alternatively, a system which effectively deals fairly and squarely - while maintaining, on the principle of subsidiarity, each member state's capacity to deal with these matters itself - with the issues of criminal law posed by all of these freedoms and which also accepts the proposition set down at Tampere that there must be an area of freedom, security and justice within the European Union.Deputy Ó Snodaigh then states - this is the point where I cross swords with him seriously - that this should be delayed until we have put in place safeguards for everybody. He should be very careful to look around the particular corner towards which he is heading. He is saying that it should be a competence of the European Union to set out safeguards and to determine what is and is not an appropriate system. I am saying to him at this stage there is a set of proposals which are coming down the tracks on minimum standards and we will see what they are and judge them when we come to them. However, I am not going to say that I will not agree to this European arrest warrant unless and until we have created a competence for the European Union to impose on member states what Deputy Ó Snodaigh calls minimum safeguards or whatever. If, in the last analysis, one accords to the European Union member states, acting either collectively with qualified majority or unanimously, the function of determining how our system of safeguards should or should not operate over and above what is in the European Convention on Human Rights by which all member states are bound, one is actually walking down the exact path that Deputy Ó Snodaigh accuses me of taking, that is, centralising in the European Union very far-reaching constitutional competencies.The correct path is for Ireland to honour its international obligation under European law by bringing this into effect, to do so on 1 January, and to be in a position throughout our Presidency to encourage, and use some leverage on, the other member states to get on with the job. It would be very wounding to our Presidency of the European Union if, on this central pillar of the area of freedom, security and justice, we were found effectively to have abandoned, had second thoughts on or had cold feet about the project.
#JohnBruton	unknown-#JohnBruton-party	unknown-#JohnBruton-dob	unknown-#JohnBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	13	It is important that there are safeguards and that the Union has the capacity to introduce safeguards and minimum standards. One of the ways in which this can be done is by accepting the draft constitution which provides for qualified majority voting in this area. If people are rendered from Ireland to another jurisdiction which involves them appearing before a judge whose first language is not the defendant's language, this will ensure that there will be rights to translation of all documents, rights to access to a lawyer and rights to various other minimum protections. The only way that will happen is by the adoption of the European Union constitution. I look forward to DeputyÓ Snodaigh's support for the constitution, given that it will provide the protections he seeks. I am glad that on this issue we are both in favour of greater European integration.

In page 5, line 17, to delete subsection (2) and substitute the following:"(2) This Act shall come into operation on such day or days as the Minister may appoint by order or orders either generally or with reference to any particular purpose or provision and different days may be so appointed for different purposes or different provisions.".I am withdrawing the amendment. It was tabled because there was a danger the Bill would not be reached before the end of the session.

The Minister and Deputy John Bruton suggest that national parliaments should still retain power so that they will not agree to the EAW unless the safeguards live up to the standards they seek. The larger states within Europe are slow to adopt this legislation but one would expect them to be the fore.Even though our judicial system was originally a British system, since the foundation of the State it has been adapted and changed so that it is an Irish system. It is no worse and no better than the imperialistic Napoleonic code on which the judicial systems of most other member states are based. We must make do with what we have until the Minister changes the entire system but that will not happen for a while. I oppose the section.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I was pleased the Minister proposed the amendment because it was not until the conclusion of Second Stage that we were informed eight of the 15 member states would fail to meet the deadline of 1 January 2004. Given the impending accession of ten new member states, that means less than one third of all member states will have adopted the legislation. I thought the Minister was standing up to the larger member states such as Germany and France, which feel they are subject to a different law, as was the case under the stability pact in regard to the basic matter of the marketplace. They have flouted the deadline with impunity, even though they should be taking the lead. As Deputy Bruton stated, the EU constitution has not been adopted but it contains other safeguards.Ireland is accepting the legislation at an earlier stage than the larger member states, yet we engaged in tortuous negotiations with various member states regarding extradition arrangements. There was a great deal of angst and the entire nation was worked up about it. The legislation will commence from 1 January 2004 but I hoped the Minister would continue to use his discretion in this regard. I thought the reason he was going down that road was that he would have flexibility regarding the appropriate time to sign the Bill into law and begin the process.This is not the appropriate time, even though there are pressures on the Minister given that Ireland will hold the EU Presidency from 1 January 2004. He may say this is the appropriate time and Ireland has committed itself to the Framework Document and cannot go back on that legally, but nevertheless this would have been a useful flexibility mechanism.

The effect of the amendment is that Ireland will be able to operate the EAW on a reciprocal basis with other member states that are in a position to do so. The amendment takes into account that not all member states will give effect to the framework decision on 1 January 2004. Furthermore, it takes account of the position of the accession states, which are due to sign up to the arrest warrant upon their accession on 1 May 2004.

In page 6, subsection (1), to delete lines 18 to 20 and substitute the following:" 'issuing state' means, in relation to a European arrest warrant, a Member State designated under section 3*, a judicial authority of which has issued that European arrest warrant;”.Amendment No. 5 contains a new definition of the term "issuing state" and is consequential on the new section 3 being inserted, as provided for in amendment No. 8, which allows the Minister for Foreign Affairs to designate a member state that has given the effect to the framework decision on the European arrest warrant.

I want to add "another person exercising judicial functions". If left as it is, it could be open to an administrative rather than a judicial authority, such as a public official or the Minister.I hope the Minister will take the amendment in the spirit in which it is presented for clarification purposes. I believe it would be a useful protection in the definition.

I am not in a position to authorise people. The member state itself must authorise people to carry out the functions similar to those required to be performed under section 27 by a court in the Irish State. I am providing for flexibility so that other member states do not have to have simply one category or another category of persons. They are free to amend their law as long as they provide in their law somebody who carries out the functions equivalent to those performed under section 27 by our courts. It may be examining magistrates or different species of tribunals. That is not really relevant as far as I am concerned.I am recognising the law of the other member states of the European Union. Whoever they nominate to carry out the section 27 functions is the person I want to designate as a judicial authority for the purposes of this legislation.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	27	The Minister is being very generous to an issuing state. There will be ten new member states on 1 June 2004. The definition covers a magistrate. We are discussing a judicial authority and I think the word "judicial" should be included in respect of every person. The terms "judge" and "magistrate" have judicial connotations but "person" does not.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	28	Perhaps I can be of some assistance to the Deputy. There is a rule of construction called a iustum generis rule which states that if a reference is to A, B, or other thing, other thing is construed as being of the same type as A and B. We do not wish to say because the person is not described as a judge or a magistrate under their law, because those titles are not used, that they are not covered by the law. The phrase “or other person authorised by law” means on ordinary rules of construction in Ireland someone similar, having a similar function in their system.

Otherwise it would just state "any person" in the first place. That is the rule of construction. This provision is designed to make it the case that whoever carries out the function may not be described as a judge or a magistrate; it could be a member of some tribunal of criminal justice in some European country.

If some European Union country has a procurator or a procureur who carries out these functions and they have divided their functions in that way, I do not want to knock somebody out of the system accidentally. Other countries are being asked to recognise our distinctions between the DPP and the Judiciary, which is very strange in most countries. Many civil law systems do not understand a system whereby there is a constitutional officer who is wholly separate from the court system and merely appears as an equal party in it. The DPP will have functions under this law in Ireland. We do not wish to use straitjacket terminology which imposes on other countries the obligation to have particular labels attached to their judicial authorities.It must be a judicial authority under the law of that country. It may be a judge or a magistrate and it could be some kind of procurator or investigative tribunal, but I am not prepared to pick labels in our law and then say that other countries must follow those labels in their law.

I understand the reason Italy does not include offences committed prior to 12 August 2002 may have to do with concerns about prosecutions and legal issues affecting certain persons in that country who are highly placed. I am not sure if this is the case. Perhaps it is not.What is the reason Austria will not allow this legislation to have retroactive effect? What is the significance of the establishment by the Republic of France of the date 1 November 1993?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	48	Under Article 52 of the framework decision, individual states were given the liberty to make statements about the degree of retrospectivity for which they would provide. The Italians have said that Italy will continue to deal, in accordance with the extradition rules in force, with all requests relating to acts before the date of entry into force of the framework decision on the European arrest warrant as provided for in Article 32 thereof. Pursuant to Article 32 of the framework decision on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between member states, Austria states that, as executing state, it will continue to deal with requests relating to punishable acts committed before the date of entry into force of the framework decision in accordance with the extradition system applicable before that date.France, Italy and Austria have availed of the provisions of Article 32. It is not for me to second guess why they did so. We could have done it too, but we did not.

If and when it comes into effect, it should apply from the date all countries sign off. It should not be retrospective. I suggest the deletion of the words "before or" in line 3 of page 7 and the deletion thereafter of the next two subparagraphs. I also suggest the inclusion of a section to ensure there is no risk to the rule of equal treatment of people who are subject to arrest warrants. This provision should be included instead of subparagraphs (2) and (3). That would be in line with recommendations made by the Human Rights Commission in its submission to the Minister and the committee in respect of equality before the law, differences in extradition standards and equality between persons charged with the same offence.

Since Ireland, my predecessor and I, did not make a statement under Article 32, it follows that I cannot make such an amendment.

Such a report will have to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. The Labour Party has suggested an amendment of this nature.

I will have to come back to the Deputy. I do not have an exhaustive list of them at this stage.
#JohnBruton	unknown-#JohnBruton-party	unknown-#JohnBruton-dob	unknown-#JohnBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I ask this to raise the matter of whether this procedure of laying an order before the House which, if not annulled before 21 days, becomes law, is appropriate in matters of such seriousness. I have great reservations about the way in which this section operates in other legislation. When I first came to the House a long time ago, there was an understanding that if an Opposition party put down a motion to annul a regulation within 21 days, there was an obligation on the Government to provide time to debate the matter. Given the 21 day restraint, the Opposition party would not be required to have the matter considered during Private Members' time. At some point during the 1970s the practice was abandoned. Successive Governments have adopted the position that motions to annul will not be entertained during Government time. In effect, this means the procedure of annulment of such orders is ineffective. Unless it is a matter of great political moment, the Opposition party will not be willing to forgo its Private Members' time and the matter will not be discussed within 21 days.While Deputy McDowell is not responsible for a practice which has grown up over the years, I ask him to consider whether or not some of the areas he identifies should not be more appropriately dealt with by means of affirmative motion. The Government would then have to table a motion which could be debated and approved in the Dáil. Some matters to be dealt with through this procedure may involve the implementation of policy in which case the procedure would be appropriate. Other matters might be of a more substantive nature, in which case an affirmative approval motion might be a more appropriate mechanism.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	59	If we were to require an affirmative motion in respect of all these matters, the time involved in each could be up to three months. It would hugely burden the business of the House to put in place such an obligation. There is enough for us to do at the moment. If either House wished to do so, it could establish a secondary legislation scrutiny committee and sit in constant session examining documents and issuing reports about whether time might be made available. Although I have been here far less time than Deputy Bruton, I have found there is no appetite for that kind of thing. It is a point that is easily made, but if it were put in place there would be no desire to participate.In support of this I must cite our experience of the constitutional obligation to consult the Houses of the Oireachtas about options and discretions. There is a limited appetite for that consultation process, even under European law as things stand. The broader point made by Deputy Bruton can only be met with the unworthy reply that if he really believed that he should have done something about it when he was in a position to.
#JohnBruton	unknown-#JohnBruton-party	unknown-#JohnBruton-dob	unknown-#JohnBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	60	That is indeed quite an unworthy reply, given the relatively brief period in which I have been in Government over the last number of years.

In page 8, before section 8, but in Part 2, to insert the following new section:"8.-For the purposes of the Framework Decision, the High Court shall be the executing judicial authority in the State.".This amendment inserts a new section before section 8 which specifies the High Court as the executing authority in the State.

In page 8, line 9, after "person" to insert "in the State".When a judicial authority in the issuing state duly issues a European arrest warrant in respect of a person it should specify the state concerned. It should only be addressed to Ireland in respect of a person who is in Ireland. There is a lack of clarity in terms of a person's location.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	67	It would be nice if we lived in that kind of world but unfortunately, when arrest warrants are issued for a fugitive offender the issuing state frequently has no idea where in the EU that person is. In effect, this will be done on a trial and error basis. We will receive many more warrants than we have fugitive offenders in our jurisdiction. It is possible that it will become standard practice, for example if somebody wanted for murder in Ireland suddenly disappears, for the Irish State to issue warrants to all EU member states so the person can be apprehended as soon as possible.

We still have a rendition system with the UK under the relevant part of the 1965 Act. Under this, a warrant issued in England is executable in Scotland or the Republic of Ireland and vice versa. We did not issue a warrant which depended on the person being in the place to which we intended to send it.

Other states will not wait for positive evidence that the person has arrived in Ireland before they issue warrants to Ireland.

It is a good thing to have economies of scale in the issuing of warrants for the arrest of fugitives. Could the Minister explain his reference to there being much bureaucracy if warrants are issued to several jurisdictions? If people from this jurisdiction become fugitives, given that there is free movement across the whole Continent, we would presumably issue warrants to all continental states within the EU.

These warrants will need to be accompanied by translations. I imagine the Irish will be selective with their warrants - they will not simply bang them out and fax them off all over Europe with translations.
#JohnBruton	unknown-#JohnBruton-party	unknown-#JohnBruton-dob	unknown-#JohnBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	78	In practice, most of the language in these warrants will be standard.

It is a technical amendment to ensure that the section only deals with criminal activities. No. 17 amends paragraph (b) to ensure that a warrant can only be issued in respect of a person on whom an immediately enforceable sentence of imprisonment or detention has been imposed, on the basis that somebody could be appealing their sentence at the time the warrant is issued, which would make a difference. Would the procedures operate if there was an appeal, in which case the person effectively would be entitled to be at large?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	88	The right of appeal is a matter for the issuing state rather than for us. There are all sorts of complexities involved. Sometimes people can serve notice of appeal outside the period, which invalidates the original order under our law. Therefore, I do not want to go down that road.In respect of the use of the word "criminal" in amendment No. 16, the arrest warrant only refers to arrest and surrender in conducting criminal prosecution or for executing a custodial sentence. Therefore, the Deputy's amendment is unnecessary. Civil forms of arrest do not arise in this instance.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I move amendment No. 17a:In page 9, subsection (3), lines 15 and 16, to delete all words from and including "unless" in line 15 down to and including "directs," in line 16.The word "unless" is being deleted to avoid any doubts about the vires of the powers being granted to the Minister under the subsection.

In page 9, subsection (3)(a), line 20, after “concerned,” to insert “and that the person will be afforded full credit for time spent in custody in the State, in accordance with the Framework Decision, on a basis equivalent to that afforded by the State pursuant to section 28,”.The amendment is self-explanatory. Full credit should be granted for time spent in custody in the state prior to the execution of the order.

Off the top of my head, I do not believe it is provided in the framework decision that credit for time spent in custody must be given. We are undertaking that ourselves.

We are willing to make such provision unilaterally, but I am not sure we can demand of other states that they must do the same. There may be cases in which such a provision would be sensible. There may also be cases in which it would not. If a person is found wrongfully to have been resisting extradition at great length, it may be that they should carry some risk. There would be a huge incentive to fight every case no matter how specious the grounds if a person thought they would always get credit for time served. One might as well serve time in Ireland as elsewhere. On policy grounds, we should leave the provision for the receiving rather than the executing state to decide.
#JohnBruton	unknown-#JohnBruton-party	unknown-#JohnBruton-dob	unknown-#JohnBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	94	As the Minister explained earlier, this process is based on mutual recognition of the legal systems of other countries. For those reasons, the arguments the Minister has advanced are persuasive.

However, it makes a considerable difference if we are to insist that anybody who comes into our jurisdiction will recieve full credit for the period in custody in the other jurisdiction while we are not in a position to have that provision reciprocated. I do not know what period of time would be served where an examining magistrate is involved and bail is not as readily available as it is here. It is a flaw in the legislation that we are willing to give credit while we cannot demand that credit be given for anybody who is sent out of this country by order. The legislation imposes an obligation on us while failing to impose it on any of the other member states. A person could serve an extra six months or even two years in prison on top of their sentence than they would if they were in this jurisdiction.

Under Article 26 of a Schedule which is not attached to the Bill being debated, though it was attached to the last Bill Deputy Costello thought he was considering——

Article 26 of that Schedule provides that the issuing member state shall deduct all periods of detention arising from the execution of a European arrest warrant from the total period of detention to be served in the issuing member state as a result of a custodial sentence or detention order being passed. Reading that, it may be that a distinction must be drawn in the case of a fugitive offender. In that instance, one would not wish to reward the fugitive for time spent in custody in Ireland on return to another country. On the other hand, if a sentence is passed, it would be fair to make that provision de novo. In any event, the obligation is made under Article 26 of the framework decision.

The purpose of the European arrest warrant is to put in place a fairly automatic procedure. A state will be required to respect the piece of paper.

I do not wish to create a whole heap of extra-curricular assurances on top of every warrant unless it is necessary to do it.

I wonder how this will apply with regard, for example, to frauds committed over the Internet. In the commission of such an offence, is the place of the offence clear? Increasingly we hear of offences involving conspiracy. The conspiracy occurs in one country and the offence takesplace in another. I am not sure it is entirely clear where exactly the offence is deemed to have occurred.The same argument could arise regarding the time of an offence, though I am not sufficiently familiar with such situations arising. Why is it necessary to specify the place in which an offence takes place if otherwise there is sufficient evidence that there was an offence and that a certain person was involved?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	120	I refer Deputy Bruton to Article 8 of the framework decision which lays out paragraphs (a) and (f) in more or less the same form. The phraseology of the framework decision is: "The European arrest warrant shall contain the following information set out in accordance with the form contained in the annex." The Irish draftsman has said that a European arrest warrant "shall, in so far as it is practicable, be in the form set out in the annex." We have left a little flexibility there. Going back to classic indictments for conspiracy in Ireland, it was that they be between two dates at a place unknown, and sometimes even with persons unknown. I recall that on one occasion during the Arms Trial a person came into court and claimed to represent the persons unknown, and ask for a right of audience. That was in 1970. I do not think he succeeded.Deputy Bruton is correct. There will be difficulties in certain kinds of inchoate crimes and fraud, in highly sophisticated crimes. There will be difficulties in saying where the offence actually took place. It is for that reason that the Irish draftsman has been slightly more pragmatic than the framework draftsperson and has left a little room for manoeuvre regarding practicability.

In page 9, subsection (1), line 32, to delete "or the English language" and substitute ",the English language or such other languages as the Minister may by order prescribe".Currently, the Bill provides that the European arrest warrants are to be received in English or in Irish. Amendments Nos. 20 to 23, inclusive, allow for the possibility of Ireland accepting European arrest warrants in other languages if the Minister makes an order specifying another language. The possibility is that there may be an agreement at EU level that EAWs could be transmitted in a limited number of languages, for example English and French. If that is introduced, I want our law to allow us to be flexible, rather than having to battle with every language every time a warrant comes in.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	142	Seeking evidence without further proof does not mean that everything in it must be accepted. The point is that it should be received in evidence without further proof. It means that one need not prove that the person whose signature appears on it is the person in question and that that is his or her signature. It does not mean that is conclusively determined. For instance, if a totally fraudulent document were presented in court, it would be quite open to someone to say that the signature is not the signature of the judge, and that a con job was being perpetrated. The effect of this provision is to allow it to be received in evidence. A document that purports to be one of these documents is allowed to be received in evidence and it is subject to the right of anyone to contradict any of its contents if someone wants to do that. Otherwise one would have to prove each individual proposition, that the person in question was duly appointed as a judge in the foreign country, that that was the judge's signature, that on a particular day in Bratislava, for example, that judge made the order in question. That kind of thing would be an unreasonable obligation.

As long as it is an accurate document, coming from the person and the state it is supposed to come from, that is all right. Is the Minister saying it is possible to make an argument as to why a document might not be submitted, despite the provision "shall be received in evidence without further proof". This is fairly strong. There is a presumption that a document presented by an issuing state, once submitted, is to be followed by the High Court.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-12-16 00:00:00	Prelude	144	It does not have that meaning, in my view. It merely means that no further preliminary proof has to be tendered before it can be received in evidence. Once it is received in evidence it can then be contradicted, rejected or whatever. Our laws on admissibility of evidence provide that documents are not normally admissible unless there is other evidence which makes them admissible. One cannot simply hand up to a court half way through a case a page purporting to be somebody's diary unless one can prove where it came from, whose handwriting is on the page or whatever. This is to get around all of that and make it prima facie admissible in court but not conclusively authentic as evidence.

On balance, the view at the moment is that it should not be accepted. The purpose of the European arrest warrant is to speed up surrender procedures. The timeframe for fixing a date for the hearing has to be definite to some extent. In addition, a person will be informed of his or her right to obtain or be provided with legal advice at the time of arrest and at the first court appearance. Our view is that, whereas we examined this issue sympathetically, we thought it would result in more delay and uncertainty.

A caveat should be inserted that a person should not be arrested unless the authorities are satisfied that the issuing state intends to issue a European arrest warrant in respect of the person.

In page 12, subsection (2), line 38, after "custody" to insert "or on bail".In this amendment I seek a similar type caveat, where a person is arrested, pending production of the warrant, that he or she be remanded in custody or on bail. It would be unconstitutional not to make provision for the possibility of bail being granted, given that every suspect in this jurisdiction is entitled to apply for bail.

To preserve the status quo it would be remarkable if the High Court could then grant bail since the person could then effectively skip. The High Court is obliged to remand the person in custody and for that purpose it should have the same powers as if the person was brought before it charged with an indictable offence. As soon as the situation of the warrant crystallises, the High Court would be in a different position. Under subsection (4) the High Court may order the release from custody of a person remanded in custody under this section if, at any time after the person has been so remanded, it appears to the High Court that a European arrest warrant has not been issued in respect of the person or, where appropriate, the issuing judicial authority has not given an undertaking under section 9(3). Effectively, one is obliged to remand the person in custody. Once the warrant has issued, the question of bail does arise. It is purely to prevent a person dancing away from the whole system.

This takes account of the likelihood that the SIRENE Bureau, which is the back up bureau, once established, will be made up primarily of members of the Garda Síochána below the rank of inspector. The present text requires that it be a garda not below the rank of inspector. We are inserting the rank of sergeant instead.

That, effectively, is what is colloquially known as habeas corpus. The High Court is obliged to remind the person who is being processed of his or her right under the Constitution to habeas corpus.Amendment No. 49 inserts new subsections (6) and (7) in place of the existing subsection (6). The new subsection (6) provides that while proceedings relating to a complaint under Article 40.4.2° of the Constitution is pending, the person shall not be surrendered. In preparing that amendment account was taken of the views expressed by the Human Rights Commission that the section, as currently framed, did not set an outer limit on the period of detention between the making of the surrender order and the actual hand over. While the Bill reflected a framework decision in that regard, it is considered that the amendment will ensure that the arrested person, first, will be aware of his or her right to bring a habeas corpus application and, second, will seek a release if the delay in the hand over is too long. That is something which is being done in deference to the Human Rights Commission’s observations. The new subsection (7) while, in effect, replacing the existing subsection (6) contains no significant change in substance.Amendment No. 57 inserts new subsections (6) and (7) in section 14. Subsection (6) provides that a person making a complaint in regard to habeas corpus under Article 40.4.2° of the Constitution shall not be surrendered while proceedings relating to that complaint are pending. Subsection (7) provides that a person to whom an order for surrender has been made shall be released from custody if he or she is not surrendered within 25 days of the order being made. A surrender order under this section does not take effect until the expiration of 15 days from the making of the order and the person must be surrendered not later than ten days after that - effectively, there is a period of a fortnight followed by one of ten days after which the person must be released unless there is some good reason for not doing so - or, second, within ten days of such later date that may be agreed by the central authority, which is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the issuing state unless habeas corpus proceedings are pending at that time.

In page18, before section 15, to insert the following new section:15.-Where, in relation to an offence specified in a European arrest warrant, the High Court decides not to make an order under section 13 or 14, it shall not be necessary for the issuing judicial authority to issue another European arrest warrant in respect of such other offences as are specified in that warrant, and, where such other offences are specified in the European arrest warrant, that warrant shall be treated as having been issued in respect of those other offences only.”.A new section is being inserted here to cater for the situation where a single European arrest warrant is issued for several offences and the High Court decides not to grant surrender for some of the offences. In such circumstances it will not be necessary for the issuing judicial authority to issue another EAW in respect only of the offences for which surrender is being granted. In other words, the High Court can grant surrender for some of the offences specified in a single European arrest warrant without the need for a revised warrant being sent to it. Accordingly, the High Court can grant surrender for some, all or none of the offences specified in a single EAW.I am considering amendments to sections 9 and 27, to be introduced on Report Stage. This relates to the substance of what is the new section 15, in that they will clarify that European arrest warrants, either received here or issued from Ireland, may be in respect of more than one offence. I just want to make that one hundred per cent clear. The amendments will be by way of stating this fact for the avoidance of doubt and may involve the addition of new subsections to sections 9 and 27 of the Bill before us.

After the proposed new section 15, to insert the following new subsection:"(2) A person shall not be surrendered to an issuing state in respect of an offence where the person is, in the issuing state, liable to be proceeded against or detained in respect of another offence in respect of which the High Court has either refused to order the surrender of the person or not been requested so to order, unless the issuing judicial authority gives an undertaking in writing that the person will not be proceeded against in respect of such other offence.".Is the Minister effectively accepting my amendment to amendment No. 59?

While I welcome some of the Minister's amendments, the fact that he is proposing large numbers of amendments and that the Opposition must deal with them within severe time constraints is not acceptable. Opposition Members cannot be expected to examine the mass of amendments proposed by the Minister before the debate on Report Stage.I object to this method of rushing through Bills. We could have taken longer to consider this Bill. That might have left us in default of the deadline of 1 January 2004 but it would have allowed us more time to consider these matters, even in January next, instead of rushing the Bill through. We are having to jump from one document to another. We do not even have a complete set of amendments which we can deal with in order. Last week we saw the debacle of two separate Bills.I wish to record my objection to this method of dealing with legislation rather than to the amendment itself.

In page 18, before section 15, to insert the following new section:"Postponement of surrender.16.-(1) The High Court may, if satisfied that circumstances exist that would warrant the postponement, on humanitarian grounds, of the surrender to the issuing state of a person to whom an order under section 13 or 14 applies, direct that the person's surrender be postponed until such date as the High Court states that, in its opinion, those circumstances no longer exist.(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), circumstances to which that paragraph applies include a manifest danger to the life or health of the person concerned likely to be occasioned by his or her surrender to the issuing state in accordance with section 13(5) or 14(5).(3) Subject to section 17*, where a person to whom an order under section 13 or 14 applies-(a) is being proceeded against for an offence in the State, or(b)(i) has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment for an offence of which he or she was convicted in the State, and(ii) is required to serve all or part of that term of imprisonment, the High Court may direct the postponement of that person's surrender to the issuing state until-(i) in the case of a person who is being proceeded against for an offence, the date of his or her acquittal or conviction (where he or she is not required to serve a term of imprisonment), or(ii) in the case of a person who is required to serve all or part of a term of imprisonment, the date on which he or she is no longer required to serve any part of that term of imprisonment.(4) Subject to subsection (5), a person to whom this section applies shall be surrendered to the issuing state not later than 10 days after such date (being a date that falls after the date specified in subsection (1) or subsection (3)(i) or (ii), as the case may be) as may be agreed by the Central Authority in the State and the issuing state.(5) Where a person makes a complaint under Article 40.4.2° of the Constitution, he or she shall not be surrendered to the issuing state while proceedings relating to the complaint are pending.".This is a new section dealing with the postponement of surrender. It is being inserted in the Bill to reflect articles 23.4 and 24.1 of the framework decision. The High Court may direct that a person's surrender be postponed on humanitarian grounds and that includes a manifest danger to the life or health of the person concerned, likely to be occasioned by his or her surrender to the issuing state. The High Court may also direct the postponement of surrender in the case of a person who is being proceeded against for an offence in the State until the date of his or her acquittal or conviction.In the case of a person who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment for an offence for which he of she was convicted in the State, being an offence other than one to which the European arrest warrant relates, the High Court may postpone surrender until the date on which the person is no longer required to serve any part of that term of imprisonment in the State.

In page 18, before section 15, to insert the following new section:"Conditional surrender.17.-(1) Where a person to whom an order under section 13 or 14 applies-(a) has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment for an offence of which he or she was convicted in the State, and(b) is, at the time of the making of the order, required to serve all or part of that term of imprisonment, the High Court may, subject to such conditions as it shall specify, direct that the person be surrendered to the issuing state for the purpose of his or her being tried for the offence to which the European arrest warrant concerned relates.(2) Where a person is surrendered to the issuing state under this section, then any term of imprisonment or part of a term of imprisonment that the person is required to serve in the State shall be reduced by an amount equal to any period of time spent by that person in custody or detention in the issuing state consequent upon his or her being so surrendered, or pending trial.".A new section which reflects article 24.2 of the framework decision dealing with conditional surrender is being inserted into the Bill. In the case of a person who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment for an offence for which he or she was convicted in the State, it being an offence other than the one for which surrender is being sought, and is at the time of the making of the surrender order required to serve all or part of that term of imprisonment, the High Court may, subject to such conditions as it may specify, direct that the person be surrendered to the issuing state for the purpose of being tried for the offence to which the European arrest warrant relates. This provision can have the effect of ensuring a speedy trial, thereby facilitating the accused, victims and other parties. Account will be taken, when determining the period to be served in Ireland, of any time spent in custody or detention in the issuing state, as a consequence of his or her being so surrendered.

In page 18, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following subsections:"(3) In proceedings under this Act, evidence as to any matter to which such proceedings relate may be given by affidavit or by a statement in writing that purports to have been sworn-(a) by the deponent in a place other than the State, and(b) in the presence of a person duly authorised under the law of the place concerned to attest to the swearing of such a statement by a deponent, howsoever such a statement is described under the law of that place.(4) In proceedings referred to in subsection (3), the High Court may, if it considers that the interests of justice so require, direct that oral evidence of the matters described in the affidavit or statement concerned be given, and the court may, for the purpose of receiving oral evidence, adjourn the proceedings to a later date.".The amendment adds new subsections (3) and (4) to section 15. The amendment provides that evidence as to any matter in which proceedings under the Act relate may be given by affidavit or by a statement in writing that purports to have been sworn by the deponent in a place other than the State, and in the presence of a person duly authorised to attest to the swearing of such a statement by the deponent. The High Court may, if it considers that the interests of justice so require, direct that oral evidence be given of the matters described in the affidavit or the statement. There is a similar provision already in section 7B of the Extradition Act 1965.

In page 18, subsection (1), line 21, after "necessary" to insert "or appropriate".This is a simple amendment so that, rather than having the cross-bar too high in terms of somebody being transferred to hospital when the Minister considers it necessary, it would also include the words "or appropriate" to read "when the Minister considers it necessary or appropriate".

This clarification was required in the case of a European arrest warrant containing multiple offences where the High Court decided a grant surrender for some, but not all, of the offences in the European arrest warrant. It is the first cousin of the rule of specialty.

The provisions in section 17 reflect article 27 of the framework decision. In particular, subsection (5) reflects the provisions in article 27.2(g) on Ireland's declaration. At the time of the adoption of the framework decision, Ireland made a declaration that the central authority, rather than the judicial authority, would be the appropriate authority for the purpose of giving consent to the waiving of specialty in this State. As regards the rule of specialty, some countries vest waiver rights in the court system, but in Ireland we have always vested those waiver rights in the Executive arm of the State.

In page 28, before section 26, but in Chapter 2, to insert the following new section:26.-In this Chapter-'domestic warrant' means a warrant (other than a European arrest warrant) issued, for the arrest of a person, by a court in the State;'European arrest warrant' means a warrant to which the Framework Decision applies issued by a court, in accordance with this Chapter and for the purposes of-(a) the arrest, in a Member State, of that person, and(b) the surrender of that person to the State by the Member State concerned.”.Section 26 defines a domestic warrant and a European arrest warrant for the purposes of chapter 2, that is, for the issuing of European arrest warrants by the State. Amendment No. 78 replaces the existing section 26. Acceptance of the amendment involves the deletion of the existing section 26 and its replacement by the new version.

In page 28, before section 27, to insert the following new section:27.-(1) For the purposes of paragraph 2 of Article 2 of the Framework Decision, the Minister may, by order, specify the offences under the law of the State to which that paragraph applies.(2) The Minister may, by order, amend or revoke an order under this section (including an order under this subsection).(3) This section shall not operate to require that an order under this section be in force before a court may issue a European arrest warrant under section 27.”.This new section is being inserted to assist Irish courts when issuing European arrest warrants. Under the framework decision the issuing judicial authorities require to indicate if the offence for which the person is being sought comes within article 2.2. The new section provides for the possibility of the Minister, by order, detailing the particular offence under the law of the State which fits within the category of offences in article 2.2 of the framework decision, thus facilitating Irish courts in meeting the requirements under the framework decision when issuing European arrest warrants.Article 2.2 contains the so-called positive list of offences for which the dual criminality requirement is relaxed. The offence is surrenderable if it is on the positive list and is punishable by at least three years imprisonment in the issuing state. It does not necessarily have to be an offence in the requested state. What effectively will happen here is that the Minister will be in a position to issue by order a list of offences which fall within the category of offences which are on the positive list.

It also aligns the phrase as may be appropriate. I am prepared to accept the substance of the amendment and I will bring forward an official amendment tomorrow along these lines.

The Good Friday Agreement suggested we get rid of it. We should not add to its legitimacy by including it in the Bill. The High Court and other courts are strong enough to deal with things without referring to a registrar of a court that I hope will cease within a short period.

The annex to the framework decision contains a format for the European arrest warrant. Subsection (3) provides that where the European arrest warrant is not in that form it must, nevertheless, contain all of the information that would be required if it were in that format.

It provides that European arrest warrants issued by the State must be transmitted to a member state by the central authority in the State, which is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

The weighting of the dual criminality requirement in relation to such offences is an essential feature of the framework decision. Consequently, I cannot accept the amendment. The provision of the framework decision, including the positive list, received Oireachtas approval in accordance with Article 29.4.6 of the Constitution. Therefore, it is a bit late now to start fiddling around with it. I am stuck with the positive list concept.

The existing provisions of section 34 deal with the situation where proceedings have been brought in the State against the person for an offence, consisting of an act or omission that constitutes, in whole or in part, the offence specified in the European arrest warrant or the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General has decided not to enter a nolle prosequi in proceedings against the person for the offence specified in the European arrest warrant.Amendment No. 96 adds a new ground. It inserts a paragraph (a) in section 34 which provides that a person shall not be surrendered if the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General is still considering but has not yet decided whether to bring proceedings against the person sought for an offence.Section 36 also deals with grounds on which the execution of a European arrest warrant may be refused, such as where the offence was committed outside the issuing state. Amendment No. 97 amends this section by deleting paragraph (a). It provided that the execution of the European arrest warrant would be refused where the offence was, in whole or in part, committed in the state. As a result, only the existing paragraph (b) remains. It provides that a person will not be surrendered for an offence that was committed, or alleged to have been committed, in a place outside the issuing state if the state would not exercise extra-territorial jurisdiction in respect of such an offence committed outside its territory.In other words, if Belgium, for example, decided to put someone on trial for an offence committed outside Belgium, Ireland would not surrender someone to Belgium if we ourselves would not exercise extra-territorial jurisdiction for the offence concerned.

In certain circumstances it may be desirable that people serve their sentence in the state in which they committed the offence.

No one can be forced to do this, one way or the other. Any prisoner abroad who is an Irish national or has close connections with the State can make an application but I am not obliged to accept someone back, nor am I obliged to allow someone to go back. This arose in the case of a murder in Limerick recently where it was suggested that someone might opt to go back to Portugal. That is not the law.

In page 33, before section 39, but in Part 4, to insert the following new section:39.-Section 3 of the Act of 1965 is amended by-(a) the insertion in subsection (1) of the following definition:' "country" includes territories for whose external relations the country concerned is responsible;',(b) the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (1A):'(1A) For the purposes of the amendments to this Act effected by Part 2 of the Extradition (European Union Conventions) Act 2001, "Convention country" means-(a) a country designated under section 4(1) of that Act, or(b) in such provisions of this Act as are specified in an order under subsection (1A) (inserted by section 41 of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003) of section 4 of the Extradition (European Union Conventions) Act 2001, a country designated by that order, to which the provisions so specified apply.’, and(c) the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (1B) (inserted by section 9 of the Act of 2001):'(1B) For the purposes of the amendments to this Act effected by Part 3 of the Extradition (European Union Conventions) Act 2001, "Convention country" means-(a) a country designated under section 10(1) of that Act, or(b) in such provisions of this Act as are specified in an order under subsection (1A) (inserted by section 41 of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003) of section 10 of the Extradition (European Union Convention) Act 2001, a country designated by that order, to which the provisions so specified apply’.”.The existing section 39 is to be replaced by the provisions in this amendment. The amendment repeats the wording of section 39(1)(a) of the Bill. Its purpose is to facilitate the operation of extradition arrangements of territories as well as countries. For example, the EAW will replace existing extradition arrangements between Ireland and the United Kingdom. However, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands will not be operating the EAW so we must bring them within the potential ambit of the European Convention on Extradition.

In page 34, before section 40, to insert the following new section:'4.-Every order under section 8 of this Act made after the commencement of section 40 of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003 shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the order is passed by either such House within the next 21 days on which that House sits after the order is laid before it, the order shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.’.”..This amendment is consequential on the amendment to section 8 of the Extradition Act 1965, which allows for the making of orders under section 8 by the Minister for Foreign Affairs rather than by the Government, which is the subject of the next amendment. Amendment No. 106 deletes the reference in section 4 of the 1965 Act to the Government making orders and replaces it with reference to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. This is in line with the proposal in amendment No. 107, which I will move in a moment.

In page 34, before section 40, to insert the following new section:41.-Section 8 of the Act of 1965 is amended by-(a) the substitution in subsection (1) of-(i) 'Minister is' for 'Government are' where it first occurs, and(ii) 'Minister for Foreign Affairs may, after consultation with the Minister,' for 'Government may',(b) the substitution of subsection (1A) (inserted by section 23 of the Act of 2001) of ’Minister for Foreign Affairs may, after consultation with the Minister, ’ for ’Government may’,(c) the substitution in subsection (2) of ’Minister for Foreign Affairs may, after consultation with the Minister’, for ’Government may’,(d) the substitution in subsection (6) of ’Minister for Foreign Affairs may, after consultation with the Minister,’ for ’Government may’ and(e) the insertion of the following subsection:'(9) An order under this section in force immediately before the commencement of section 41 of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003 shall continue in force after such commencement as if made under this section (as amended by the said section 41), and may be amended or revoked accordingly.’.and the said section 8 as so amended is set out in the Table to this section.TABLE8. (1) Where by any international agreement or convention to which the State is a party an arrangement (in this Act referred to as an extradition agreement) is made with another country for the surrender by each country to the other of persons wanted for prosecution or punishment or where the Minister is satisfied that reciprocal facilities to that effect will be afforded by another country, the Minister for Foreign Affairs may, after consultation with the Minister, by order apply this Part in relation to that country.(1A) Where at any time after the making of an order under subsection (1) a country becomes a party to an extradition agreement to which that order applies, the Minister for Foreign Affairs may, after consultation with the Minister, by order so declare, and this Part shall, upon the making of the second-mentioned order, apply to that country.(2) Where the Government have made an arrangement amending an extradition agreement the Minister for Foreign Affairs may, after consultation with the Minister, by order so declare and the extradition agreement shall thereupon have effect as so amended.(3) An order relating to an extradition agreement (other than an order under subsection (1A) (inserted by section 23(a) of the Extradition (European Union Conventions) Act 2001)) shall recite or embody the terms of the agreement and shall be evidence of the making of the agreement and of its terms.(3A) An order under subsection (1A) shall in relation to the extradition agreement concerned recite or embody the terms of any reservation or declaration entered to that agreement by a country to which the order applies, and shall be evidence of the reservation or declaration (if any) and of its terms.(3B) An order under subsection (2) shall recite or embody the terms of the amendment and shall be evidence of the making of the arrangement amending the extradition agreement concerned and of the terms of the amendment.(4) An order applying this Part in relation to any country otherwise than in pursuance of an extradition agreement, may be made subject to such conditions, exceptions and qualifications as may be specified in the order.(5) Every extradition agreement and every order applying this Part otherwise than in pursuance of an extradition agreement shall, subject to the provisions of this Part, have the force of law in accordance with its terms.(6) The Minister for Foreign Affairs may, after consultation with the Minister, by order revoke or amend an order under this section.(7) On the revocation of an order applying this Part in relation to any country this Part shall cease to apply in relation to that country.(8) A notice of the making of each order under this section shall be published in Iris Oifigiúil as soon as may be after it is made.(9) An order under this section in force immediately before the commencement of section 41 of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003 shall continue in force after such commencement as if made under this section (as amended by the said section 41) and may be amended or revoked accordingly.”.Amendment No. 107 has the effect of replacing the reference to the Government with a reference to the Minister. It deletes all reference to the Government making orders and provides, in future, that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, following consultation with the Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform, will make orders under our extradition arrangements.
