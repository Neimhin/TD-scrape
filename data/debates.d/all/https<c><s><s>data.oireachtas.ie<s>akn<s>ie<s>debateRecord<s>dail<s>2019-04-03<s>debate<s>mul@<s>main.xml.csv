Unfortunately, the situation is not improving despite the Minister's work and effort. I want to know the breakdown between project costs and administration costs. In addition, we are still not really breaking the back in terms of LEADER expenditure. The figures for the end of quarter 1 of 2019 do not show any major improvement in terms of project expenditure. I want to flesh that out and see the Minister's plans for 2019.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	2	LEADER is a multi-annual programme with a total budget of €250 million over the period 2014-20.  Some €220 million of this funding has been allocated to the local action groups, LAGs, for project and administration costs. The remaining €30 million is available for schemes to be delivered at a national level and is allocated as projects are approved. A total of 1,800 projects have been approved for funding by the LAGs, with a combined value of €62.2 million.  A further 377 projects with a value of over €23.4 million are at an earlier stage in the approvals process. Total expenditure to date by the LAGs on the LEADER programme is €44.2 million and almost €17 million has been paid out to over 650 LEADER projects.  However, project payments will increase substantially as approved works are completed and project promoters submit claims for payment.  The amount of project expenditure in the first quarter of 2019 was €3.8 million, which is double the level of project expenditure incurred in the first quarter of 2018.  This clearly demonstrates the rise in project payments, which will increase substantially during 2019. Some €27.2 million has been paid in respect of the administration costs of the LAGs, including their engagement with promoters to develop projects. LEADER administration costs are always higher at the start of the programme period when the LAGs are working with promoters in this way. However, administration costs cannot exceed 25% of the LAGs budget over the lifetime of the programme, and project expenditure will exceed administration costs as the programme progresses. The table which accompanies my reply provides details of core project approvals and expenditure in each LAG area to date. The figures do not include expenditure under national-level schemes. LEADER Project approvals and payments as at 31st March 2019  Local Action GroupLDS Project   AllocationProjects ApprovedApplications in ProcessProject Payments madeNameValueNoValue NoValue ValueCarlow €4,797,60227€1,721,7446€545,642€871,066Cavan €6,391,71547€2,900,47510€342,403€630,488Clare €6,645,000117€2,288,54713€433,805€613,914Cork North €3,810,54346€1,819,93115€538,826€514,484Cork South €2,803,47718€618,6219€739,093€213,124Cork West €3,691,75524€1,026,19915€1,282,196€196,938Donegal €9,631,407104€4,647,4329€427,143€2,122,541Dublin Rural €4,777,82946€1,396,39310€284,806€401,712Galway East €5,741,88841€1,597,7451€106,571€38,024Galway West €3,425,42527€630,5944€524,944€143,852Kerry €7,650,904190€3,800,30074€2,463,753€1,127,766Kildare €3,946,20021€912,2428€526,622€110,037Kilkenny €5,798,94957€1,589,33511€518,992€674,184Laois €5,325,00057€1,302,20810€1,049,213€699,089Leitrim €4,490,00054€2,022,16717€481,705€433,716Limerick €6,946,15172€3,848,51924€2,362,709€796,036Longford €5,698,50045€1,029,60810€342,327€111,398Louth €4,576,39757€1,578,9846€621,868€389,346Mayo €8,260,822104€4,320,36936€3,213,778€692,008Meath €5,137,34534€1,424,7717€252,443€113,876Monaghan €5,694,50038€2,257,2554€832,970€516,742Offaly €6,000,000111€2,436,3686€200,594€1,050,077Roscommon €6,581,28339€2,410,88619€1,467,311€325,312Sligo €5,720,73784€2,658,7034€41,021€791,919Tipperary €7,562,584112€3,557,62916€1,216,869€649,777Waterford €5,525,34645€3,060,6628€824,175€1,598,618Westmeath €5,563,49549€871,48510€601,336€348,887Wexford €7,580,10495€3,465,8164€96,404€576,777Wicklow €4,728,23139€1,053,31411€1,087,832€211,000Grand Total€164,503,1891,800€62,248,303377€23,427,351€16,962,709

First, there are changes to this particular roll-out of LEADER which the feedback from the ground suggests are making it harder to draw down project expenditure. The Minister made some changes when he came into office. Have those changes made any difference with regard to expenditure? Second, the area I want to focus on is the inconsistency in LEADER areas around the country. The average percentage of allocation spend is 20% but there are 16 counties below that average. At this stage in the programme, there is one company which has only an 11% spend and one with only a 12% spend, whereas the spend in Waterford is 33%. Why are there such inconsistences around the country? What is the Department doing to iron out those inconsistencies and to ensure the money actually gets spent in communities, which is where we all want it spent?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	4	I agree with the Deputy. I have done everything possible to make changes in order to make it simpler for people, in particular those in the LEADER companies, to administer the scheme. Since I came into office, I have made more than 32 changes. The Deputy is correct that the inconsistency around the country is unbelievable. Yesterday, when I was going through these questions, I looked at this issue of inconsistency. The Deputy is correct that some counties have to be complimented because they are dealing with the projects, paying out funding and doing very well. I have asked my officials to go through every LEADER company, and where LEADER companies are not spending their money, I am going to start reallocating that money. That message will go out loud and clear from this House today. The Deputy referred to the administration costs, which are 25% of the overall cost of the programme. It is a lot of money but we are paying people to do the job. I have made the changes and I cannot do any more.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	5	We are in year six of a seven-year programme and I know there will be an extension at the end of it to draw down funding. However, the reality is that €10 million more is spent on administration than on project expenditure, which is a figure that has to be kept in mind. As we go into the renegotiation of a new Common Agricultural Policy programme, along with a new LEADER programme, we have to be able to show the importance of LEADER. It is the only show in terms of community development for many communities. We cannot afford to lose European funding for it or to lose it as a scheme, given it has achieved huge things. However, we cannot allow an inconsistency in expenditure to damage it and we cannot allow this kind of spending. The Minister has to be certain in this regard. Can he give me a guarantee that by year-end, the project level of expenditure will be higher than administration?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	6	No, I cannot give that guarantee. What I can guarantee is that I am putting pressure on the LEADER companies. As the Deputy knows, given we have LEADER programmes in our county, I can only do so much. With regard to administration costs, these people are getting paid to do the job. To be fair, there are LEADER companies doing very well under the scheme. When I look at this, I see that some have 18 or 21 projects, which is not acceptable. It is not acceptable to me or the Department, and is not good enough for the LEADER programme. We want the money and the money has been given by the Government. It would be a different ball game if the Deputy was coming here to complain to me that the money was not there. I spent last year, with my officials, trying to encourage LEADER companies and we made the changes they required. As I said, I cannot do any more. They now have to do their job. What I need to do, and will do, is look at every LEADER company in the country. When I start taking money off them, I know I will have plenty of Deputies complaining in this House because I am taking from one county and giving to another. Too bad. If they do not perform, I will take the money off them.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	The question is a basic one in the context of Brexit. I know the Minister is aware of the situation. The constituency I represent is very much a Border county. Everywhere in Europe, borders are recognised as areas of economic decline because there are two jurisdictions backing up to each other. Until we hurry on the day we end that, which we hope we will do very quickly, we need to put something in place, and we certainly need to put something in place in the context of Brexit. The Department is crucial for rural communities because most of the Border counties are very rural and they need to see an increased emphasis on getting investment in place.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	It should be noted that preparations for all the various Brexit scenarios are being led at Government level by my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney. The Government's planning for Brexit was initiated in advance of the UK referendum in June 2016. My Department and its agencies have fed into this process where appropriate and will continue to engage across Government and with our stakeholders in the rural and community development sectors. The Government remains firmly of the view that the best way to ensure an orderly withdrawal and to fully protect the Good Friday Agreement is to ratify the withdrawal agreement. This is a fair and balanced deal with compromises on both sides. However, given the political uncertainty in the United Kingdom, the risk of a no-deal outcome remains. The Government, working at the EU level and at home, has been preparing for all outcomes for all communities and citizens. I am confident that we are as ready as we can be but it is important that businesses and citizens do what is necessary to be prepared. Preparing for a no-deal Brexit is about damage limitation, and a no-deal outcome may have serious implications across a number of sectors.  As part of the Government’s planning, legislation was enacted on 17 March 2019 which is focused on protecting our citizens and on supporting the economy and jobs, particularly in key economic sectors most exposed to Brexit, including Border communities. Anticipating and preparing for these possible impacts is a priority and the funding provided by my Department to build resilient communities across the country will become even more important in the event of a no-deal Brexit. My Department's focus continues to be on maintaining maximum flexibility in our programme of funding initiatives, to enable us to continue to support all communities and to target available funding to those economic sectors and geographic areas most in need. 
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	I understand that the most emphasis has been placed on the eventuality of a no-deal Brexit. However, even if there is a deal, we need to recognise that we are in a very precarious situation, particularly people living in the Border regions. Many of those communities depend on the social economy. An awful lot of people do not have access to high-level employment with very high salaries. They live in communities where that kind of infrastructure is not in place and many of them depend on the community creating the jobs to sustain itself. To make that happen, we need to see a renewed emphasis on getting more funding in place for them. I recognise that the Department is running workshops to show people how they can apply for funding for community projects. This is welcome and good. There is one in Donegal in a couple of weeks. However, we need to see more money in place. The Minister talked about places that are not spending the money as rapidly as he would like or getting through things as quickly. Certainly the Border communities and the regions around the whole Border area have been very much to the fore in making sure they use any funding to which they have access and that they use it appropriately. I urge the Minister to put more money in place and to work with those communities to ensure they can deliver.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	The Deputy is right. In my role as Minister for Rural and Community Development, community is probably the most important aspect. We have a number of community schemes. The Deputy is quite correct. A lot of people are employed in some of these community schemes and they are very important. That is why we have targeted all the schemes that we have such as the outdoor recreation scheme, the town and village scheme and the road regeneration scheme. The flexibility that I have in my Department is very important. I hope even at this late stage that we have a deal in Brexit but the Deputy is quite correct that even if we have a deal we will have problems. All I can say to him and to businesses around the Border area and around the whole country is that they have to be prepared. They have to be ready. At Government level we have put the legislation in place. We have done everything we can as a Government. At this late stage, I hope there will be a deal and I hope there will be a bit of common sense that the deal that is there will be accepted. The Deputy is right. The whole of Ireland is going to suffer and I do not want that to happen. I am hoping and I will be monitoring. That is why my Department is out there on a regular basis. We are doing the rural shows and we are also going to be lending a helping hand. We are going to be bringing in communities, telling them the schemes that we have and assisting them to fill out applications.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	While I appreciate that, what I am saying is that the Minister needs to have an additional focus and emphasis on the Border counties. About two months ago, we had people in from the Irish Central Border Area Network, ICBAN, and the other agencies around the Border. They are really animated about this situation because they see community groups all around the Border that have worked on a cross-Border relationship very well and have made great progress, many of which are related to farming businesses and the agricultural sector. They see huge problems coming down the line. They are saying that the only thing that is going to mitigate this is money. The Government needs to put money in place to try to ensure that these communities can survive. While I appreciate that there are a whole lot of schemes, what we need to see is an additional helping hand, an additional way of ensuring that these communities will get additional resources. Many of them do not have their own resources. I will give an example. There is a community centre right beside me and it missed out on the first round of funding in LEADER to get the roof done and other projects that the community needed. It got into the second round of funding but it only got a small portion of the money it needed. People are going round in a community of 600 people trying to raise the rest of the money. It is practically impossible. There needs to be recognition that in many small rural communities there is not that emphasis on trying to raise the money themselves because they do not have the resources.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	That is why last month my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, announced that the EU Commission has agreed a tenfold increase in the rescue and restructuring scheme budget from €20 million to €200 million. The Minister, Deputy Creed, is having negotiations with Brussels on a regular basis and Commissioner Hogan has said that the EU is ready to respond if there is a no-deal situation. The Government is prepared. Our Ministers are working very hard. We can only do what is required when the time comes. The Ministers, Deputies Creed and Humphreys, and every Minister in government is monitoring. My Department is meeting the LEADER companies, the Western Development Commission, rural groups, the local action groups and the councils, to make sure to have them ready. In respect of funding, we can only deal with that situation when the time arises. We are ready now. We can only do what we can do. In my own Department, we talked about the LEADER programme as Deputy Calleary did and there will be many other questions about other programmes. I have a lot of schemes out there. My biggest problem as all Deputies know is to the get the local authorities and the communities to spend the money I have actually allocated.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	To pick up on the Minister's last point, we need to make it easier for communities to spend that money. Communities are struggling to draw down that money. I know the Minister has made some changes to LEADER but we need to make it easier across all the programmes. This question is in respect of the national broadband plan and mobile phone coverage and the role in the Minister's Department of the regional telecommunications development unit. His colleagues are preparing this for the launch of the new national broadband plan. We keep being told about the access of population to broadband but as the Minister and I know, that does not necessarily wash in a lot of areas in our region in terms of access to broadband. I want to know what involvement the Department of Rural and Community Development has in the planning for the national broadband plan and also its engagement around mobile phone black spots, which are becoming a bigger issue in rural areas.
#SeanCanney	unknown-#SeanCanney-party	unknown-#SeanCanney-dob	unknown-#SeanCanney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	As the Deputy will be aware, the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has overall policy responsibility for the national broadband plan. However, my Department, through the unit referred to by the Deputy, works closely with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and with local authorities to help prepare rural communities for the roll-out of high-speed broadband. The unit also supports the work of the mobile phone and broadband task force, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. The task force was established in 2016 to identify and overcome obstacles to mobile phone and broadband services. One of the key ways in which my Department supports the preparations for the roll-out of the national broadband plan and other telecommunications infrastructure is through the network of broadband officers located in each local authority. The broadband officers, who are co-funded by my Department, provide a vital point of contact for industry and the public regarding telecoms issues. With regard to the mapping of black spots in mobile phone coverage, an invitation was issued in late 2017 to all local authorities to provide data on five or six prioritised local black spots, with a view to examining the potential for mapping mobile phone black spots in Ireland. The objective was not to compile a definitive list of black spots across the country, but to identify areas of immediate priority for the purposes of testing an approach to the mapping of black spots. While the exercise was informative, it was not comprehensive. Of the 31 local authorities, only 17 returned data to feed into the exercise. However, ComReg has recently published a national map of outdoor mobile phone coverage for 2G, 3G and 4G services for a range of providers. This map, which is available on ComReg’s website, shows the quality and prevalence of mobile phone coverage right across the country for each provider. It will prove to be a useful tool for consumers on the services available in their areas.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	I thank the Minister of State. He commented that one of the duties of the unit was to prepare rural communities for the roll-out of high-speed broadband. As he knows rural communities are prepared for that roll-out but the Department is not and the Government keeps delaying the roll-out. What is the involvement of the regional telecommunications development unit in the preparation for the national broadband plan? Is it good enough that only 17 of 31 local authorities provide the information on mobile phone coverage? What does the Department of Rural and Community Development do to follow up with the remaining local authorities? The Department provided €42,000 to each local authority to have a broadband officer in 2018 and nobody in the Department seemed to follow up on the 14 that could not be bothered to provide the very basic information. The Department was only looking for five sites. As the Minister of State said, he was not looking for a complex map. Fourteen did not bother to send it back and there was obviously no follow-up on the part of the Department even though each local authority has a grant of €42,000. That is not good enough. The Department cannot stick its head in the sand and allow that lack of response to go unnoticed.
#SeanCanney	unknown-#SeanCanney-party	unknown-#SeanCanney-dob	unknown-#SeanCanney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	16	I am not sticking my head in the sand, nor is the Department. We have 30 broadband officers in place. At the time they were only being put in place and were not working full time. To ensure the broadband officers are most effective, I meet them continually. I met them bilaterally with their chief executives in Galway about two months ago. I have stressed to them the purpose of their role. It is not right to say we are doing nothing. For example, we are preparing coverage for Malin Head where there was no coverage. In preparation for the national broadband plan, over 300 sites have been identified as the first places to get broadband when it is rolled out. Therefore we will have a hub in the communities. These have been identified by the broadband officers. In preparing for the future digitalisation of the country in rural and urban areas, the task force has been working with all the stakeholders to future-proof all our infrastructure. When installing services in the ground alongside roads etc., we are now putting in the duct work that is needed for the future. In the Deputy's county, Mayo, the broadband officer has done a digital map of all the existing assets in every town, which will be rolled out to every county.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	17	We are particularly fortunate that we have an excellent broadband officer. However, clearly 14 of his colleagues are not doing their job in providing the Minister of State with information. As he has said he meets them, can he not challenge them to provide him with the information? What is the view in the Department of Rural and Community Development on the schedule for the roll-out of the national broadband plan? The Taoiseach has announced the roll-out of the national broadband plan is conditional on the implications of Brexit on our national finances. Is that the Minister of State's view? Are we nearing a conclusion of assessment of the national broadband plan? When will the Minister of State be able to tell these communities preparing for broadband that they will be able to get broadband as opposed to talking about it? When will the people in Malin Head know what year they will actually have access to high-speed broadband? What is the timeline for the national broadband plan? It is not good enough that the Department is funding people to provide information when they are not providing the information. While I do not blame the Minister of State, someone in the Department needs to get their finger out and follow up on that information.
#SeanCanney	unknown-#SeanCanney-party	unknown-#SeanCanney-dob	unknown-#SeanCanney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	18	Just yesterday the Minister, Deputy Bruton, who is dealing with that tender, clearly stated that a report on the national broadband plan would be brought to Cabinet by Easter. That is the timeline I have, which is the same as the one the Deputy has. It was repeated again yesterday in the meeting. The Deputy has criticised the broadband officers. I met them along with the CEOs of each of the 31 local authorities in Galway. In discussing their role, I told them what they needed to do. I am confident that the role has now been mapped out for them and they will be a very important part of the roll-out. The Deputy spoke about rural areas that do not have broadband. The object of this exercise is to ensure that every house in the country is treated equally; that is my aim.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	19	This year the Department of Rural and Community Development is providing approximately €5.5 million to support projects underpinning the regeneration of the north-east inner city area of Dublin. That follows on from €3.5 million last year and €2.5 million the previous year. I ask the Minister to outline the impact that funding is having on that community. Does he believe other disadvantaged communities would also benefit from similar programmes?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	20	In 2019 my Department is providing €6.5 million towards the regeneration of the Dublin's north-east inner city. This investment will benefit not only the local community but the city as a whole. It shows the Government’s commitment to ensuring that the recommendations of the Mulvey report are implemented. The funding provided by my Department supports initiatives which are put forward by the Dublin north-east inner city implementation board, with the required oversight provided through Cabinet committee B. Some of the funded initiatives help families affected by addiction issues and drug-related intimidation, while others cover physical improvements to the Dublin's north-east inner city area. The investment also funds a pilot social employment scheme for 50 staff to work with childcare, youth work, care of the elderly and other projects. It is hoped that the experience from this pilot scheme will inform the development of similar initiatives in other urban areas over the coming years, as additional resources become available. Work is also under way to examine the effectiveness of the Government's investment to date. Outside Dublin's north-east inner city, there are many examples of disadvantaged communities benefiting from significant investment from my Department. For example, last year I provided €13 million under the community enhancement programme to help groups across the country to improve facilities in disadvantaged areas. Last week I launched the 2019 programme with funding of €4.5 million. My Department also funds the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, a five-year €190 million national programme, delivered locally, to help those in the greatest need.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	21	I thank the Minister for his reply. I acknowledge the increase of funding of €6.5 million for Dublin's north inner city. He identified some of the specific projects supported. As this is the third year of increased funding from the Department, what is the impact of that funding? The Minister spoke about the social employment project with funding of approximately €2 million, which I welcome. Many other areas across the country suffer significantly from economic disadvantage, particularly areas in Dublin with which I am familiar. In its third year, can we build on the evidence and experience of the north inner city to transfer that to other disadvantaged communities that have been stuck in long-term economic disadvantage?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	22	I thank the Deputy for his comments. I accept what he has said. There are many areas outside Dublin that could do with more funding to address disadvantage. What is happening is working very well. The task force is working on implementing the recommendations of the Mulvey report. It meets regularly and responds to Government. I have been to some of these places in Dublin's inner city. The Deputy has seen how the ring-fencing of funding to provide 50 positions on the employment scheme has worked. They are involved in the environment and in keeping their area tidy. I have been in community halls that got funding from this scheme. Small amounts of money have made a difference to their lives. As the Deputy knows, wonderful community people are involved, particularly in Dublin's inner city. One could not meet nicer people. They also appreciate the funding they are getting. They see what it does for disadvantaged areas and it is working very well. I would like to be able to roll this out in other areas. We will be able to use this task force as an example, but it will, of course, all come down to funding.I wish I had more funding, in particular for other disadvantaged areas, but this is a pilot scheme and it is working very well. The Government is committed to it.

I am very pleased to hear the positive outcome for the north inner city. That bolsters the argument I am making. If it is working for the north inner city, we must consider the other very disadvantaged communities right around the city and the country. The funding they would have received traditionally through RAPID and so on is no longer available because we now have the community enhancement programme. However, that programme is not targeted at the most vulnerable areas. I have seen the projects it supports and they are far outside the traditional RAPID areas. It is also the case that the money the Minister talks about making available for community enhancement this year is relatively small by comparison with what is going to the north inner city. On the level of support required by our most disadvantaged communities, will the Minister work to identify where those communities are? I heard the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, say on the radio this morning that he is working on next year's budget. We will gladly support the Minister, Deputy Ring, in any bid to provide additional funding to target areas of significant economic disadvantage which have endured long-term unemployment and a range of other issues. While those issues are now being addressed in the north inner city, we need to roll this out to other areas nationally.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	24	I thank the Deputy for his offer of support, which I will take him up on. It is important. The Deputy is quite correct to say that sometimes we target areas like inner-city Dublin whereas other disadvantaged areas in other parts of the country do not have the clout they should. That is why the Department uses SICAP and the community enhancement programme. Deputy Curran referred to the level of funding. I was pleased that the €6.5 million we invested in inner-city Dublin this year included an increase of €3 million on the 2018 provision. The Deputy is right that we want to see other areas being covered too. The community enhancement programme started last year with €4.5 million and we finished up by putting €13 million into it. If there are any savings in the Department this year, that is one of the areas I will look at. One of the most important programmes is one about which we do not talk but about which I have learned a great deal more since becoming Minister, namely, SICAP, which will provide funding of €130 million over a number of years. SICAP is one of the better programmes because it identifies areas and individuals and works with them. We have had many successes in Limerick and elsewhere for individuals who have been helped to create or obtain employment through SICAP. People have been helped to read and write and groups who needed help have been dealt with. I will look for further funding for the programme of which I am very fond.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	32	I launched the pilot town living scheme last October to encourage increased residential occupancy at the heart of our rural towns and villages. The six towns included in the pilot scheme are Boyle, County Roscommon; Callan, County Kilkenny; Ballinrobe, County Mayo; Banagher, County Offaly; Castleblayney, County Monaghan; and Cappoquin, County Waterford. The scheme is being led by the relevant local authorities which are acting in close collaboration with all relevant stakeholders. Funding of up to €100,000 is being made available to each local authority to progress the pilot scheme. The funding will be used by local authorities to engage with communities and local businesses to identify practical solutions to increase the number of people living in rural towns. I expect to receive a report from each of the local authorities in the first half of the year on the progress they have made. The six towns identified for the pilot represent a range of different sizes in different locations, each of which has its own strengths and challenges. Given the mix of towns involved, they may each come up with different solutions to meet the needs of their areas. However, the learnings from these pilots may also provide an indication as to what might work well for similar types of town on a wider scale. It is envisaged that the solutions identified through this pilot could lead to the development of more substantive proposals for funding from the rural regeneration and development fund in due course.

When will we be in a position to learn the lessons of the pilot scheme, given that the commitment to run it was made in January 2017? It was due to be completed by quarter 3 of 2017 but it took a long time to commence and the towns were only announced in quarter 3 of 2018. When will we have the lessons? I am aware that some projects have been announced in Ballinrobe, but is there a focus on residential property and is the Minister liaising with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to co-ordinate an approach? To quote the Minister, Deputy Ring, himself, Ireland is unbalanced. While there is a shortage of housing in our key population centres, many of our rural towns are experiencing a shortage of services which are declining due to a lack of people. Surely the Minister and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, should liaise on this project and work on a combined approach to using the scheme as part of the response to our housing crises.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	34	I will use my discretion to let Deputy Connolly in for 30 seconds.
#CatherineConnolly	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-party	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-dob	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	35	My question is exactly the same, so I am not sure what mistake was made. I know it was not the Acting Chairman's mistake, but 30 seconds is difficult. I could not disagree with the Minister's comments when he launched the scheme. Our towns and villages are at the heart of our rural communities and should be places in which people can live and raise their families in a high-quality environment. While it is a wonderful scheme, the problem has been its roll-out, which has been delayed. I have no problems with the choice of the six towns, but it is important to know what criteria were used to pick them and what criteria will be used to choose the next towns. I think of Galway. We all think of our own cities and counties, but I want to think nationally also. As such, when I look at Galway, I see that no town in the county was picked notwithstanding that we have the largest Gaeltacht nationally. I have just come back from Ballyferriter which I visited with the Irish committee and I have seen how common themes have emerged in rural areas. There is a dearth of places to live, in particular houses, and there is an absence of employment. These issues are tied together.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	36	I note to Deputy Calleary that some people, albeit not him, misunderstand that the €100,000 funding is provided, not to carry out repairs and so on, but rather to allow local authorities to work with communities, chambers of commerce and community groups. I am asking them to look at how we can get people back living in towns and villages. Deputy Calleary noted the level of vacant property around the place and that is exactly what I am trying to target. We have never had as many people living and working in rural Ireland. However, we have a different rural Ireland now. I have made the point before that we had shops on streets in towns in every corner of the country from the 1940s right up to the 1980s. That changed with multinational stores coming in. Those stores are being challenged in turn by online shopping. We hope the six towns we have selected will come back. Some might come back with similar ideas and proposals the Government may need to implement to target people to live in towns. The Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government had a scheme that did not work which means it was not the right scheme.If we are going to introduce schemes, we have to make sure that they are working. Deputy Connolly talked about the criteria. I could have picked any number of towns around the country. I left it up to the officials. We tried to vary the size and locations. I looked at Galway to see if I could get a Gaeltacht town that might fit into this scheme. That does not mean, when this pilot scheme is done, that I will not pick another 12 towns. I will try to pick 12 different counties to see what we can do. I hope that this scheme will come back with good ideas and good suggestions. I hope that Government will follow up with Deputy Calleary too.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	37	I know the Minister is sending money to local authorities for plans. There are many plans and not much action, which I know frustrates the Minister. We have all these empty spaces, even in towns and cities that are relatively healthy. As Deputy Connolly spoke, I thought of Galway. There is a lot of space above retail units that previously contained homes. With a little thinking outside the box, they could be homes again, especially considering the pressure that local authorities are under, and offered as options to older people to live in towns and closer to services. Fewer plans and more action might be the best outcome here.
#CatherineConnolly	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-party	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-dob	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	38	This is a wonderful scheme. The problem is that we do not know what criteria were used or how they were used. That is okay because it is a pilot project, but we need the result of the pilot project back on time because there has been a delay to the date in the roll-out. We need to learn from the pilot project and to look at it nationally to see which areas would benefit the most. We will clearly all pick our own areas. I am not asking the Minister to do that. In Galway and south Mayo, which is in the Galway West constituency, I think of Kilmaine, Shrule, Carraroe, Carna and of the Gaeltacht, the population of which has dropped. There is a serious crisis with the language. Surely there should be Gaeltacht areas as an essential criterion here. It is important that we publish the details of the project, learn from it and have openness and accountability about the criteria. This involves a substantial amount of money.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	39	With regard to the selection process, we could have picked any number of places around the country. We tried to get the right spread and size. In response to Deputy Calleary, the local authorities are the organisations that move the funding through but we expect that the communities will lead to get results. We give them funding and they can employ experts. A number of people have come to my Department but I do not want to get into that, because it is not for me to select who will do the work that needs to be done for these towns. I hope that they will come back. This is the first time that it is not the Government telling communities what to do. We are telling the communities to tell us what they need. The six towns that come back might have the same ideas. There is an issue relating to dereliction of property and we may need to do more for the compulsory purchase of these properties. Maybe we need to give local authorities more power to be able to take over some of these properties. There is a demand for housing for people across the country, including in rural Ireland. I would like to see some good ideas from this. With the rural regeneration scheme, we want to target areas that need investment. That is why, this week, I set out with my officials to explain to local authorities, even though they were blaming me, that they were not shovel-ready when they submitted applications. It is like the Christy Moore song with the line "Don't forget your shovel if you want to go to work." Many of these did not have the shovel but pretended to.
#MartinHeydon	unknown-#MartinHeydon-party	unknown-#MartinHeydon-dob	unknown-#MartinHeydon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	40	As the Minister knows, the senior alert scheme is very popular. We see increasing demand from individuals signing up for this when they reach the age of 65 or older. I increasingly come across cases in south Kildare where people are looking to join who do not have an existing landline. They seek a landline from Eir to link into this. We need to futureproof this. There seems to be a delay in Eir connecting these houses and I do not know if it is always financially viable for it to do so.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	44	I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 63 together. My Department is responsible for the seniors alert scheme which encourages community support for vulnerable older people in our communities through the provision of personal monitored alarms to enable them to live securely in their homes with confidence, independence and peace of mind. Funding is available under the scheme for the purchase by a registered community-based organisation of a personal alarm or pendant. Since I launched the new scheme in November 2017, demand has been very good. During 2018, over 19,200 applications were approved, with total expenditure of almost €7 million. The scheme’s allocation for 2019 is €2.3 million. As this is a demand-led scheme, it will be kept under constant review by my Department to ensure that adequate funding can be made available to meet the requirements of all qualifying applicants. There is provision under the Dormant Accounts Action Plan 2018, which also covers 2019, for funding to meet any additional demands on the scheme this year. Under the seniors alert scheme, applicants receive a free personal alarm, worn as a pendant or around the wrist. When pressed, it connects wirelessly to a base unit which is usually connected to a landline. If the applicant does not have a landline, the monitoring company can supply a SIM card for use in the base unit. There is a charge for this, usually about €5 per month. This equates to the telephone line rental that a user of the service with a landline would have to pay.
#MartinHeydon	unknown-#MartinHeydon-party	unknown-#MartinHeydon-dob	unknown-#MartinHeydon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	I thank the Minister for his response. I agree that the seniors alert scheme is a very important support for vulnerable older people to continue to live with independence and confidence in our rural communities. That is important because we all hope to live for longer and in better health. Being secure in our homes is key to that and this personal monitored alarm is a fantastic scheme. That SIM card is very important because I have come across cases where people were waiting for a landline option and there was a delay in it coming. I will look out for that option and check if it is a possibility for my constituents. The scheme itself is in high demand and that is only increasing. I think we will come across more houses in future that will join this scheme and will not necessarily have landlines, because there is less demand for landlines now than there was previously.
#PatrickDeering	unknown-#PatrickDeering-party	unknown-#PatrickDeering-dob	unknown-#PatrickDeering-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	46	Like Deputy Heydon, I think this is a very good scheme for both rural and urban Ireland. People are living for longer and they want to stay at home. The only way that they can stay at home is if they know that they will be secure and safe in their home. There is not enough promotion of these brilliant schemes. The Minister has done a good job of announcing the financing in the last couple of years. There needs to be more promotion in this area. I might have heard the Minister wrongly with regard to the figures that he mentioned. Was there €7 million last year and €2 million already this year? He might clarify those figures for me. It would be a big difference if that was the case. We need to see more of these schemes around the country. In my part of the world, Muintir na Tíre and community alerts do a lot of work in that regard. They need to be sure that they will have funding to make sure that people will be able to have one of these units to ensure that they are safe in the future.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	47	This scheme has worked very well. The Deputies are correct that there was an underspend on the scheme for many years. In 2011, €2.46 million was allocated and 7,910 people applied for and were granted assistance under the scheme. In 2012, €2.52 million was allocated and 9,142 applied. In 2013, 10,597 people were assisted under the scheme. In 2014, there were 7,120. The money reduced in each year because there was no take-up but in 2016 and 2017, we had many difficulties around the country. I took this scheme on myself, brought in the Department officials, and got Pobal to run a campaign in local radio and local papers.They administer the scheme on my behalf. The number rose from 7,301 in 2016 to 12,609 in 2017. In 2018, 19,228 people were connected to that scheme. The Deputy is correct. We engaged with the media. We simplified the scheme and explained how it works to people. Part of the problem in this country is that we make schemes too difficult. I met representatives from Pobal. I have done my best to make it easy to apply for all the schemes I have introduced. If we want people to be involved in schemes, we have to make it easier for them to apply. That is particularly the case with elderly people. I must compliment those who are running the scheme, especially Pobal. They are doing a superb job and it has worked very well.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 84 together. Social enterprises make an important contribution to Ireland's social and economic progress.  They deliver a range of services to support communities and disadvantaged individuals and use innovative and creative approaches to address social, economic and environmental challenges. As the Deputies may be aware, there have been calls for a national policy to support social enterprise for many years.  I am pleased to say that my Department is now at an advanced stage in developing Ireland’s first national policy on social enterprise. The policy is underpinned by a research and consultation exercise which was conducted by my Department in partnership with the Social Finance Foundation.  The research project was overseen by a steering group which included practitioners from social enterprises and key Departments. As part of the research project, three consultation workshops were held in Dublin, Cork and Athlone at the end of 2017 in order to obtain the views of stakeholders. In addition, an online survey was carried out which was open to all interested parties. A series of meetings was also held with relevant Departments and other stakeholders on specific issues and my officials have visited and met many individual social enterprises and social entrepreneurs. In recent weeks my Department has engaged in intensive and detailed discussions with a broad range of social enterprise stakeholders and with the wider community and voluntary sector. I now anticipate that a draft of the social enterprise policy will be published for public consultation in the coming weeks, with a view to publication of the final policy document in the middle of the year. The policy will be complemented by the implementation plan for the framework policy for local and community development and the new national volunteering strategy, both of which are also being developed by my Department. Taken together, this suite of initiatives will support the full range of organisations providing services to communities or tackling social issues, whether through a social enterprise model or through more traditional community services delivery.

Tá sé léite agam cheana. Tá an t-eolas sin uilig agam. Baineann an cheist atá curtha agam leis an dáta. Unfortunately, there is nothing new in what the Minister stated. I have all those answers. I have looked back and done my research. On of the aims behind the Action Plan for Rural Development was to develop and publish the national policy on social enterprise by the third quarter of 2017. Beart 99 - action No. 99 - a bhí i gceist. That was changed and it was then to be published in the first quarter of this year. The first quarter has now passed. The Minister anticipates it in the future and states that it is at an advanced stage. Is the draft report available for viewing anywhere or is it still not for public eyes? Can the Minister give me a date? It is a very good scheme. I am delighted with social enterprise. I want to see a coherent strategy. It is the right policy for the Government to pursue, but it is extremely frustrating to listen to talk of yet more consultation. This has been going on for years. I ask the Minister to please give me a date.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	51	I thank the Deputy. I can see that she is frustrated but I want to be honest. I have pushed this policy but I must be careful. As a representative of a rural constituency, Deputy Connolly must understand this - social enterprise is brilliant. It creates employment and any profits are put back into the businesses involved. However, I must be careful not to upset the community sector. I have to be fair to my Department and my officials. We have put a lot of work into this in the last several months. We have had a lot of consultations with the community sector, the social enterprise sector and the voluntary sector because I want to get it right. I do not want the community sector to be affected in any way. Deputy Connolly can understand that. Social enterprise is very good because it creates employment in sectors and areas where the private sector will not. I am a believer in social enterprise, but I must put on the record that I support the community sector. There are many areas in this country, such as west Galway, south Galway, west Mayo and south Mayo, where in the absence of the voluntary sector the services it provides would not be provided by the councils, the State, the HSE or anybody else. That is why I have to be careful to get this right, and I intend to do so. We are nearly there. This will be published very shortly.

Gan an obair dheonach atá á déanamh ag daoine, ní bheadh aon rud againn. I totally agree with the Minister that without community work, we would lose out. Volunteers are doing work that the Government and local authorities should be doing. I have absolutely no problem with that. However, the question is very specific. The Minister has had plenty of time. I welcome the news that it will be published soon. I would like to hear a date. We do not need the Minister to repeat how valuable social enterprise or community work is. This country would be much poorer, in every sense of the word, without either sector. We know that. I represent a community that extends from the Aran Islands to Kilmaine and Shrule. There is huge variation in that community. I am fully aware of what is happening on the ground, but without a coherent national policy we are going nowhere and dealing with it in bits and pieces. There has been ample time between 2017 and 2019. I appreciate that a steering group was set up and that consultation took place in the towns to which the Minister referred, including Athlone. However, it is time to publish the document. Any document can be reviewed. It can be rolled out for a year or two. It can be reviewed and appropriate changes can be made. I ask the Minister to let us have the policy.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	53	As already stated, we have made a lot of progress. I am very confident that we will publish this very shortly. In the context of the issues the Deputy has raised, I have to make sure that I get this right. We must remember that mine is a relatively new Department that has been in place for just 18 months. We have had a great achievement. Many have spoken about getting a social enterprise policy in place for the last 20 years. I guarantee this will be published shortly and people will be able to have an input. It will be the first time that we have had a social enterprise policy in this country and that is to be welcomed. I reiterate that I have to be careful not to interfere with the community sector in any way. That is the policy that I will implement.

#JamesBrowne	unknown-#JamesBrowne-party	unknown-#JamesBrowne-dob	unknown-#JamesBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	55	I wish to ask the Minister for Rural and Community Development to outline his plans to provide additional funding under SICAP, LEADER and other social inclusion funding programmes and I ask him to make a statement on the matter.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	56	My Department is committed to reviewing all of its schemes on an ongoing basis to ensure the benefits are maximised for local communities. In 2018, I launched the new five-year SICAP to cover the period from 2018 to 2022. I provided €38 million to the local development companies that implement SICAP in each of the years from 2018 and 2019. Over the full five years I plan to provide €190 million, but this is obviously subject to the budgetary process each year. SICAP funding supports communities to address social inclusion and equality issues and supports disadvantaged individuals in accessing the labour market and learning supports. This year, my Department is also providing €6.5 million towards the regeneration of Dublin's north-east inner city. The community enhancement programme, launched in 2018 to address disadvantage through grants for local projects, was allocated €4.5 million in 2019. Under this programme, €500,000 was ring-fenced in 2018 for provision to the Men’s Sheds Association to purchase equipment or carry out minor capital works. I will consider in due course whether or not funding can be ring-fenced again in 2019.
#JamesBrowne	unknown-#JamesBrowne-party	unknown-#JamesBrowne-dob	unknown-#JamesBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	57	SICAP is extremely important to tackle poverty and exclusion. In my county of Wexford, 27 areas are designated as very disadvantaged, in which a total of 6,500 people live, while another 30,000 live in disadvantaged areas. County Wexford has considerable potential, due to its geographical location and Rosslare Europort, and it will, I hope, see the development of the university of the south east, with a strong section of the university located in County Wexford. The areas of disadvantage, however, are under severe pressure, and while Brian Keogh, the CEO of Wexford Local Development, is doing phenomenal work, there is an element of trying to feed 5,000 with a few loaves and fish. Tom Enright, CEO of Wexford County Council, is also doing his best for the county. Some €1.7 million has thus far been provided under the current programme, which is approximately half of what a similar programme provided ten years ago. The very disadvantaged areas in County Wexford need additional funding. I return to one of my bugbears, the CLÁR programme, which has not been adjusted since the census of 2002. Some areas in County Wexford have been depopulated in that time and they are losing out on CLÁR programme funding. They are not included in the CLÁR programme because it has not been updated. Only two counties, Kildare and Wexford, outside of Dublin are not on the CLÁR programme, but Wexford very much needs to be included.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	58	The original SICAP, which ran from 2015 to 2017, came to an end on 31 December, having helped more than 110,000 individuals and assisted more than 5,000 local community groups. In 2018, SICAP exceeded its target and assisted 2,558 community groups and 1,967 individuals, under goals 1 and 2, respectively, while the targets for 2019 are 2,273 community groups and 27,313 individuals, under goals 1 and 2, respectively. As the Deputy will be aware, I am very pleased with SICAP and would like there to be more funding for it because it targets disadvantaged children, families and young people between the age of 15 and 24, disadvantaged women and Roma groups, and emerging groups with needs such as Travellers, lone parents and low-income workers, and it is important that these people are given the opportunity. Many of them have been given the opportunity and on a one-to-one basis, many of them have been assisted by SICAP. Some of them have entered the marketplace, some have employed others, some have found jobs, while others have learned to read and write. We have given them an opportunity and I welcome every opportunity we give to people in disadvantaged areas. I am pleased with SICAP. Substantial funding has been provided and the programme is working well.
#JamesBrowne	unknown-#JamesBrowne-party	unknown-#JamesBrowne-dob	unknown-#JamesBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	59	I agree that SICAP is working well in respect of the ideas behind it. It is a good idea and I compliment it in that regard, but my point was that there is not enough funding to enable it to do what it very much can do. If the €1.7 million is divided among the 27 very disadvantaged areas, there is approximately €60,000 per area per annum, but when one thinks of the number of people in each of those areas, it is not a lot of funding to help them. As I pointed out, it equates to approximately half of the similar funding that was provided ten years ago under a similar programme. It is a good programme that has been well thought out and I commend the Minister in that regard. Nevertheless, we need more funding to enable the programme to do what it can for disadvantaged and very disadvantaged areas.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	60	I agree with the Deputy and he is quite correct. We will begin budgetary negotiations again soon and I will fight for funding for SICAP, the community enhancement programme and the regeneration of north-east inner city Dublin, which Deputy Curran raised earlier. Many communities throughout the country need funding and I will make no apology in that regard. At budgetary level, I will fight to try to secure as much money as possible for SICAP, the community enhancement programme and all the programmes that assist disadvantaged people. If we cannot support and help people in disadvantaged areas, what can we do? With support from my Department, I will work hard to secure funding for the schemes.

#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	64	You are keeping it in the west.
#SeanCanney	unknown-#SeanCanney-party	unknown-#SeanCanney-dob	unknown-#SeanCanney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	65	Yes, exactly. I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 102 together. The LIS is the programme for improvement works on small private or non-public roads in rural areas. It is funded by the Minister's Department and is administered through the local authorities. As the Deputy may be aware, there was no dedicated funding for the scheme due to the constraints on public expenditure, but the Minister was conscious of the underlying demand for the scheme in rural areas throughout the country. The Minister introduced the LIS scheme in December 2017, allocating €17.5 million to local authorities for LIS roads in 2017, while in 2018, he allocated more than €20.8 million for LIS roads in two phases. On 7 February 2019, he announced the sum of €10 million for LIS 2019. Indicative allocations on a county-by-county basis can be found on the Department's website. It is a matter for the relevant local authority to determine which roads it wishes to prioritise from the allocated funding and to ensure that all roads meet the scheme criteria. Local authorities were asked to submit to the Department the final list of roads they intend to complete under the 2019 scheme on or before 1 April, and the Minister's officials are examining these submissions to ensure that they meet the scheme criteria. The LIS has been a great success since the Minister introduced it in 2017. It has supported improvement works on more than 1,200 roads in 18 months.
#TonyMcLoughlin	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-party	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-dob	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	66	I congratulate and thank the Minister and Minister of State. Like other Deputies, I lobbied the Minister for the reintroduction of the LIS, which has benefited many families, communities and local authorities throughout the country. We saw the reintroduction of the scheme in 2017, with an allocation of approximately €17.5 million, while in 2018, there was €20.8 million. In a cost-benefit analysis, the value of the scheme outweighs the work that is being done. People have benefited from the LIS in every area of the country. There could never be enough money for the LIS. Having attended meetings and spoken with local councillors and communities, however, I know there is a need for more money. Is funding available in any other Department that may be surplus to requirement? The Government might consider allocating additional funding to the LIS because there is great value for the money that is spent, as I am sure the Acting Chairman will have seen in his constituency in County Roscommon. People have benefited enormously as a result of the scheme and I ask the Minister of State to comment in that regard.
#SeanCanney	unknown-#SeanCanney-party	unknown-#SeanCanney-dob	unknown-#SeanCanney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	67	I concur with all the Deputy's points, as I am sure all the Deputies present also will. The LIS is an effective way of providing infrastructure in the most rural areas in order that we can travel safely in our cars and walk, given that some of the roads can also function as walking amenities. The Minister allowed the local authorities to claim up to 10% of the net cost of projects selected for administration, which was a reduction of 5%. The sum that local authorities can invest per individual household is capped at €1,200, which means that in case there is a large amount to be paid but there are few people, it is capped at €1,200, which is important. The Deputy asked about the future. Having had discussions with the Minister, I know that he will consider all the budgets and review them later in the year. If there is any surplus money, the LIS is an ideal place for the money to be spent quickly. The Deputy asked about other Departments but perhaps other Departments could choose to come on board. If the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has a few pounds to spare, it could invest it in the LIS because it would greatly enhance the scheme.
#TonyMcLoughlin	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-party	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-dob	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	68	I thank the Minister of State for his encouragement to local authorities and every one of us as Oireachtas Members. We see the benefits of the scheme in each of our rural constituencies.Perhaps the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Ring, will see that any money spent on local improvement schemes is very worthwhile. I hope there will be additional funding and that other funding can be made available through the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, in consultation with the Department for Rural and Community Development, to enhance all local authorities by improving roads in their areas. 
#SeanCanney	unknown-#SeanCanney-party	unknown-#SeanCanney-dob	unknown-#SeanCanney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	69	I was in the local authority in Galway and when this scheme ceased back in 2008 or 2009, we had been getting an allocation of almost €1.5 million, while last year we got an allocation of €1.9 million. We are back up there now but there are a lot of roads in the queue to be done. Local authorities are tackling them with vigour and, over the next number of years, I hope we will see roads taken out of the queue so that we can do them on demand. When an authority puts in an application it may have to wait for the next year's allocation. The scheme was great when it was first brought in and it is back in again now. We need to support it, protect it and enhance it with more money from other Departments.

#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	71	The last time I asked a question on the inspection of dog breeding establishments and the welfare of dogs, the Minister said the guidelines were being published last year, following a long consultation, and that they would come into effect in January 2019. He said there were 248 registered breeding establishments in 2016 and 258 in 2017. What is the up-to-date position on the guidelines and the number of establishments now?
#SeanCanney	unknown-#SeanCanney-party	unknown-#SeanCanney-dob	unknown-#SeanCanney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	72	Each year my Department publishes statistics covering a range of the dog control responsibilities of local authorities. These include statistics in respect of their work on dog breeding establishments. Local authorities are responsible for registrations, inspections and issuing fixed payment notices or improvement notices in relation to these establishments. Statistics for 2018 are currently being collected from each of the local authorities and, when checked and verified, they will be published on my Department's website. I plan to publish the 2018 statistics by the end of June of this year. Similarly, statistics for 2019 will be published when available in 2020. The statistics for 2017 and earlier years are available on my Department’s website. At the end of 2017 there were 258 dog breeding establishments registered. Approximately one third of these were commercial establishments, with the remainder including boarding kennels, animal welfare shelters and hunt clubs. A total of 275 inspections were carried out in total in 2017, with four improvement notices and two fixed payment notices issued. Further information is also available on the Department's website.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	73	I welcome the fact that the Minister is publishing the 2018 statistics in June. How many people have been prosecuted and convicted for breaches of the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010 to date? The 2017 figures showed there were 2,176 on-the-spot fines issued under the Control of Dogs Act and 766 were paid, with 191 prosecutions and 99 convictions. What happened to the remainder of those fines? We still hear incredible horror stories, a number of which come before the courts. There was an incident in Roscommon a few years ago and a few months ago, at a registered establishment, somebody was prosecuted and committed to prison for a number of years for gross cruelty, as well as being banned for life from having dogs and horses. Do we not need a more vigorous regime? I asked the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Ring, about this on a previous occasion. It is very unusual to have three Government Departments regulating it, in the shape of the Department of Rural and Community Development under the 2010 Act, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. Is there some area in which we could move forward and have better invigilation of these establishments? 
#SeanCanney	unknown-#SeanCanney-party	unknown-#SeanCanney-dob	unknown-#SeanCanney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	74	The Deputy is right. Last Monday week I visited an animal shelter in Tipperary on my way back from a meeting of the Atlantic Economic Corridor, AEC, task force in Tralee. When one meets people who care for animals one realises what is happening. It was a first-time experience for me, even though I am from rural Ireland where we love our dogs and our pets in general. The legislation is being reviewed and the guidelines came in on 1 January. Many comments were received by the Department during the consultation process but could not be addressed within the guidelines. The comments necessitate that my Department look at the legislation and that is what we are doing at the moment. The Department will consider the submissions as it looks at the legislation. Many respondents suggested changing the definition of a dog breeding establishment to refer to three, rather than six, breeding bitches while others said the current definition covered hunt clubs and other things, which may not be appropriate, and non-compliance was mentioned by others. There has been a plethora of submissions, which are very good and very important and which we would not have been able to cover in the guidelines. We hope the legislation process will be ready to be brought to the Chamber before the end of 2019.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	75	I thank the Minister for his thoughtful reply. When the Minister returned to Government he made a commitment to meet animal rights advocates and representative advocacy groups. Has he already met that commitment or does he still intend to do so? I am aware that he has been listening to submissions. Section 9 of the 2010 Act provides for the registration of the establishments of breeders and the Minister made an interesting point about the number of breeding dogs that should be registered. What about those who are operating under the radar? I have a rural background so I totally understand the concerns people have about all farm and companion animals. There is a provision for unannounced inspections but, given the cases that have come before the courts, there is still grave concern. We export many dogs to the UK and I do not know whether the Minister has had any liaison with the UK Minister for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Mr. Michael Gove. He said he was going to introduce new legislation on this. Dogs Trust Ireland, a distinguished advocacy group, stated in February that it had received requests from nearly 400 people to surrender their dogs after Christmas. Are there any measures the Minister can take to deal with people buying dogs for children and surrendering them within a week or two?
#SeanCanney	unknown-#SeanCanney-party	unknown-#SeanCanney-dob	unknown-#SeanCanney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	76	Absolutely. Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan brought in a number of people here who are involved in this area. I met with them and it was one of the more positive meetings I have had in a long time. They had fundamental issues which they wanted to see addressed and they came to help to do that. I gave them a commitment and I visited Tipperary after that meeting. It is a problem and a lot of things are not right, including the sale of pups online. We have to look at all of this in the context of legislation and we are working on that at the moment. Deputy Broughan referred to the surrendering of dogs in January, February and March and I urge anybody who considers buying a dog for Christmas or a birthday to ensure there is a place for the dog and that all the necessary socialisation is provided for, meaning he or she is not locked up all day because that is cruelty in its own way. We have a lot of dogs and their licensing and chipping is a huge area at which we are looking in the legislation.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	77	With the co-operation of Members, I am going to try to get the next two questions before 12 noon.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	78	We are still at a snail's pace with the LEADER programme.The Minister kindly provided figures last night in respect of the total number of projects approved and the value of the spend. Officially, all projects have to be approved by the end of 2020 because that is when the programme comes to an end. Projects then have two further years in which to spend the money. What is going to be done to simplify it, to speed up the approval of the projects and streamline the process?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	79	The current LEADER programme effectively became operational in the second half of 2016, following the signing of funding agreements with most of the local action groups who deliver the programme. As the Deputy is aware, LEADER is a multi-annual programme and expenditure typically ramps up over the course of the programming period. While concerns were initially raised regarding the procedures applying to this LEADER programme, I introduced 31 specific improvements to tackle all aspects of the programme’s administration. The pace of project approvals has increased substantially as a result of these improvements.  In total, 1,800 projects have now been approved for funding of over €62.2 million under LEADER.  This represents a threefold increase in project approvals since December 2017. A further 377 projects with a value of over €23.4 million are at earlier stages of the approvals process and I expect to see the approvals figures rise substantially more by the end of this year. Project expenditure will increase as approved works are completed and claims are submitted to my Department for payment. The level of project payments for the first quarter of 2019 was €3.8 million - double the amount for the first quarter of 2018. Overall, programme expenditure to the end of March was in excess of €44 million. We are now making good progress in the delivery of the LEADER programme.  The pace of delivery is ultimately determined at local level by the local action groups. However, I will continue to closely monitor project approvals and expenditure to ensure that the programme budget is fully utilised.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	80	With only 21 months until the expiry of the programme, the approvals in place amount to €62 million out of a total budget of approximately €160 million. We are not even halfway there in terms of approvals. Even if €160 million of approvals for projects was granted it would be impossible to achieve that level of spend, meaning that approvals should be in the region of €170 million. Would the Minister consider going to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and asking it to raise the thresholds for e-tenders in order that smaller projects could go forward on a three-estimate basis, as was the case in the past? This is one of the main reasons community groups are reluctant to come forward with smaller projects. Would the Minister consider taking such action?
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	81	The Deputy knows that I have made every effort to try to improve the LEADER programme. I include in that a 55% reduction in the amount of paperwork required from the local action groups, standardised applications for those groups to assist in streamlining the process, revised and clarified procedure and new procurement arrangements for projects. I have made 31 improvements and a number of other changes as well. Projects do not have to go to Pobal by the end of the year in order to obtain approval for funding. The Deputy asked a question, but I would ask him why some LEADER companies are able to have projects approved while others are not? I have some figures here which show that there are approvals in Carlow worth €4.797 million, including some 27 projects to the value of €1.721 million. In east Galway, there are 41 projects but only €38,000 has been spent. In west Galway, an amount of €143,000 has been spent. I have to question why some LEADER companies can do it and others cannot.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	82	The Minister has asked a fair question. One of the explanations is that, for reasons of which he is well aware, east and west Galway got going much later than the rest of the country. We should park that issue. I asked a very simple question, namely, whether the Minister will go to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to ask that the threshold for the requirement for e-tenders be raised. This can be done under EU law. It would save a great deal of the money that is currently being spent on consultants preparing e-tenders instead of on the programme. One of the biggest problems at the moment is that much of the money being provided is going to consultants rather than communities groups. It is not being spent on bricks and mortar or on getting the job done. The Minister knows that as well as I do. I am putting a practical proposal to him. He should go to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and get the threshold for the requirement for e-tenders increased and the level of bureaucracy reduced. I asked a simple question and he might provide a simple answer to it.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	83	The procurement process is being reviewed. I do not have any difficulty going to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. I am happy to try anything that will make the LEADER programme work better. As Minister, I have made more than 31 changes to the programme and it is beginning to work. If there is anything else I can do to simplify it, I will do so. I will speak to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform about what can be done about the smaller projects. We have to be careful, however. I am accountable to the Dáil and I am spending taxpayers' money. We have had difficulties with LEADER programmes in the past. We are also accountable to Europe, as the Deputy knows. If there are any problems with the LEADER programme we have to pay money back to Europe. We provide a certain amount of funding for it, as does the European Union. The Deputy asked a question about a particular matter. It is something at which I will look. We have made a lot of changes already. I will also ask my officials to look at some of the LEADER companies. I know that the Deputy and everyone else will have problems when I take money from Galway and other places that are not using it. However, I do so because the available money will be spent. The Deputy mentioned 2020. It is true that the programme will finish then, but projects will have three years to reach completion after that.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	85	The emergence of Men’s Sheds in recent years has been a very positive development for communities across Ireland. In towns, villages and cities which I have visited in my capacity as Minister, I am continually struck by the great work that Men’s Sheds do by offering a safe, comfortable and inclusive environment where men of all ages can share skills, work on meaningful projects and connect with their communities. The Government is very committed to supporting these groups. In 2018 a range of supports were available for Men’s Sheds and many of these will be available again in 2019. Last year I provided a special Men's Shed fund under the community enhancement programme.  This made €500,000 of ring-fenced funding available to Men’s Sheds groups to carry out minor capital works or to purchase equipment. Men's Sheds groups were also eligible to apply for funding under the main community enhancement programme, under which €12.5 million of funding was made available in 2018. This year, I have announced an initial allocation of €4.5 million for the community enhancement programme and the Men's Sheds continue to be eligible to apply for funding under this programme. My Department also has responsibility for SICAP which provided 40 grants totalling €34,050 to Men's Sheds groups in 2018. This support will continue to be available throughout the current iteration of SICAP which runs until 2022. In addition, under the LEADER programme for the period 2014-2020, funding to the value of €670,685 for ten projects that are for use by groups, including Men's Sheds, was approved in 2018.  This funding stream will continue past 2019.
#TomNeville	unknown-#TomNeville-party	unknown-#TomNeville-dob	unknown-#TomNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	86	I welcome the allocation of funding. Some 323 sheds across Limerick, particularly in places in my constituency such as Galbally, Glin, Doon, Killmallock and Newcastle West, have been allocated funding. I have met people from a number of Men's Sheds. I met members of the Glin Men's Shed at the horse fair a couple of months ago. One of issues I would ask the Minister to examine is that relating to capital costs versus operational costs. The sheds often have capital costs for the purposes of getting buildings up and running, for example buying tools and timber for the work the participants do. However, once the sheds are up and running, things such as tools do not represent recurring costs because they last for a number of years. Operational costs can cause difficulties, particularly in the context of, for example, insurance. This is the case throughout the country. I am aware that the cost of insurance working group is working on that issue. I am also aware that there has been a slight reduction in the cost of motor insurance, but this is having an impact on voluntary organisations. Perhaps the Department could examine the operational costs, or provide help to cover those costs. Men's Sheds may avail of the capital costs in one year and not require those funds the next year. That is not to say that they are not under pressure. I would appreciate it if the Minister could examine this matter.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	87	I thank the Deputy very much. I know he tried very hard to get some funding ring-fenced for men's sheds. As I said, they are working very well around the country. Funding programmes are in place. I will look again at this area and if there are any savings in the Department, I will see what I can do in respect of capital works for men's sheds. The Irish Men's Sheds Association is a tremendous organisation, which has given people a new lease of life. It is only right that the Government give it support and funding through SICAP, the LEADER programme and my Department because it is an organisation that is working very well.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	89	I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that over the last ten years the national CervicalCheck programme has made a very significant contribution to public health and that it has been effective in reducing cervical cancer rates since its inception. More than 1 million women aged between 25 and 60 years were screened in its first ten years. The participation rate is close to 80%, which is on a par with some of the best programmes across the globe. In the first ten years of CervicalCheck an estimated 65,000 cases of high-grade pre-cancer were detected. Cervical cancer rates, which had been rising year on year before the CervicalCheck programme began, have been reducing by 7% per year. The decision of the Minister for Health in April 2018 to offer free smear tests out of schedule to every woman who wanted one has clearly damaged this programme and put it under enormous strain. Some 79,500 women are now waiting for results and the backlog is getting worse as a result of that decision. Some have been waiting up to 33 weeks. Some 71,000 women have been waiting longer than four weeks. The HSE says that two thirds of the backlog is due to the decision on free testing. The introduction of the new HPV test, which will be far more accurate and precise, has been delayed indefinitely. In a submission to the Joint Committee on Health, the former clinical director of CervicalCheck, Dr. Gráinne Flannelly, confirmed that prior to the Minister's decision and his tweet giving the go-ahead on the Saturday afternoon in question, a Department of Health official contacted the screening service to discuss this proposal. Dr. Flannelly immediately advised against the decision, saying that, among other issues she instanced, it would fundamentally undermine the programme, that the laboratories would not have sufficient capacity and that waiting times would be longer. Within the hour the Department of Health responded by saying that the decision was to proceed with this policy in any event. This contradicts flatly the assertions made to this House by the Minister who has said in answer to parliamentary questions that neither he nor his officials were advised in advance of this decision.  Deputies Donnelly and Lisa Chambers and I have been asking questions on this since January. It has taken us three months to get to this point. Some specific questions were simply avoided and were not answered. The Minister said that neither he nor his officials received advice that recommended against these tests in advance of the decision. His officials did receive advice from the clinical director, Dr. Gráinne Flannelly, that this would undermine the programme. In the committee Deputy Lisa Chambers asked the Minister whether any clinical expert or any of his officials advised him against his decision and he said that, to his recollection, they had not. He doubled down on this assertion in replies to subsequent parliamentary questions. I put it to the Taoiseach that there are two elements to this. The programme has been damaged. It is a stark illustration of how a very poor decision can be damaging to public health. The truth needs to be told in this House. Questions need to be answered comprehensively and the full truth told about the exact sequence of events that occurred. I ask the Taoiseach to ask the Minister for Health to come to the House and give a comprehensive statement outlining the full sequence of events leading to his decision and the interactions between his Department and CervicalCheck.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	90	I thank the Deputy very much. I agree that CervicalCheck, alongside the HPV vaccine for girls, has been successful in reducing the incidence of cervical cancer in Ireland. It has led to women being diagnosed with cervical cancer sooner, which has resulted in a fall in the number of cases of cervical cancer and the number of deaths resulting from cervical cancer. Overall, both CervicalCheck and the HPV vaccine have made a huge difference with regard to women's health. I very much agree with the Deputy on that. The damage to the programme was not done by the Minister for Health but by the scandal of non-disclosure. The officials the Deputy quoted and the conditions he mentioned were at the centre of that scandal. On 1 May 2018, the Deputy himself was very critical of those officials. He said they were cold and calculating and suggested they may have been involved in illegality or in a conspiracy. In his comments on 1 May he was extremely critical of the same people he is now quoting. As the Deputy knows, the backlog of smear tests is very significant. While the clinical risk is minimal, there are tens of thousands of women who are waiting far too long to receive the results of their smear tests, which is causing anxiety and worry. I understand that. It is a big problem which we need to get on top of. Approximately 100,000 more smear tests were carried out last year than in the previous year. That was down to two factors, namely, the fact that an out-of-cycle smear test was offered and the increase in the number of women taking up the offer of cervical screening. The increase was not solely down to the extra out-of-cycle smear tests; it was also down to the increase in the number of people attending for smear tests who otherwise would not have attended. It is a positive thing that more people were attending, but it meant that there were many more smear tests than the system and laboratories could handle. As a result, while the majority of women are getting their results within 15 weeks, in some cases women are waiting as long as 33 weeks. Obviously, that is not acceptable. I am informed by the HSE that it has now sourced additional laboratory capacity, which will allow it to reduce the backlog. We should see that backlog decreasing over the coming weeks and months.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	91	I put it to the Taoiseach that he and the Minister have been in denial and that the Minister has not been upfront with this House. He needs to correct the record. Is the Taoiseach denying the sequence of events outlined by Dr. Gráinne Flannelly? Is he saying that this sequence of events did not occur? I also put it to the Taoiseach that his approach to the national screening service, notwithstanding the crisis last year, lacks character. The Minister's response also lacks character. The Taoiseach cannot say on one hand that a ten-year screening programme that has had a profound and significant impact on public health and which has reduced cancer rates-----

He is following the same line that the Minister, Deputy Harris, did in an interview with Brendan O'Connor during which he simply dismissed all of those people involved in CervicalCheck, their contribution to public health and their records in order to save his own skin. The Government panicked. The decision reeked of incompetence and panic and there were no public health criteria nor any advice from relevant individuals to justify it. Essentially, it was the wrong decision. Sometimes, it is better to admit that up front and be honest with the House when people ask basic questions. Last January, thejournal.ie ran a story on this matter and I asked questions on foot of it. They were avoided. Deputy Lisa Chambers and others also asked questions. It has taken until now and a submission being made by a person who made a contribution. I am a balanced individual and I will honestly state that the non-disclosure was wrong, but Dr. Gráinne Flannelly made a significant contribution to building up CervicalCheck.

Last week, I raised with the Taoiseach the UN special rapporteur on adequate housing's damning condemnation of the Government's record on housing. New research published in The Economic and Social Review further illustrates the points I raised last week and shows that many households and individuals are paying more than half of their incomes on rent. Those in the private rental sector, young and old, are being hit time and again with unbearable rental costs and hikes. All the while, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, stand idly by. For many people, owning a home is but a pipedream. In real terms, home ownership is beyond reach for an entire generation. Not only are houses unaffordable, but rents are at such a level that no one can put away a few quid to save for a deposit. Many of these people are working in good jobs and earn good salaries. They are up bright and early. They are people who, at any other time, would be well able to afford a decent home but are now under serious pressure, yet the Taoiseach does not seem to grasp that. Those who can ask their parents for the money for a deposit are few and far between. He should know that. The housing system is broken, yet the Government's response is to stick with its plan even though that is failing spectacularly. Sticking with the plan is predicated on preserving the interests of landlords, not on giving renters a break, which ought to be the Government's first priority. On Monday, it was revealed that Cairn Homes was to sell 300 apartments in Dublin wholesale to a vulture fund, which, in turn, will charge exorbitant rents. This is playing out now. Yesterday, the Tánaiste stated that the legislation relating to rent pressure zones is to be extended to the end of 2021, but that will not deal in any real way with the magnitude of the problem we face. We need real solutions, not piecemeal actions. We need more social homes, more private homes at affordable prices, more cost rental homes, tax relief for renters and real rent control. We also need legislation to prevent buy-to-let landlords seeking vacant possession; in other words, to prevent them from sending people into homelessness in order that they can sell their properties. That legislation will be before us and a vote will be taken on it tomorrow. I urge the Government to support it even though the Government and its friends in Fianna Fáil have previously opposed it. I am asking the Taoiseach to do this one right thing as a signal and as the beginning of a process of the Government getting to grips with the rental crisis, which affects approximately 1 million people across the State.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	116	I thanks the Deputy for raising this very important issue once again. The Government and I are really strong supporters of home ownership. I believe in home ownership and that everyone has the right to shelter and should be able to aspire to owning his or her own home. In Ireland, 71% of people own their homes. That is actually higher than the European average. The figure used to be even higher and I want to see it increase again. It was the norm for a very long time that people in their 20s could afford to buy their own homes. That is now not the case. The average person who can afford to buy his or her own home is now well into his or her 30s and people end up paying rent for a very long time before they can get on the property ladder. As a result, a figure of 71% in respect of home ownership is not good enough for me. I want to see that rise. We are absolutely committed to doing everything we can to increase home ownership again in this State. Rents are very high in Ireland, in many cases higher than what people would pay if they had a home in terms of their mortgage. That is unusual. Second, a lot of people struggle to raise a deposit, which one needs to buy a home. There are solutions, and the solutions lie in three areas. They lie in supply and providing more housing of all sorts, they lie in enhancing tenants' rights, and they also lie in helping first-time buyers. Supply is now picking up, with 18,000 new homes built last year, more than any year in the past decade. We anticipate as many as 25,000 new homes of all sorts being built this year - social housing units, but also private homes that people can buy. There will be places that people can rent because people also need places to rent. Everyone is not going to buy. People who move around a lot need to be able to rent. Second, we are enhancing tenants' rights. The Deputy will be aware of what the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government announced last night with the approval of the Government. We are: extending the rent pressure zones to 2021 in order to ensure that nobody in those areas will be the subject of a rent increase of more than 4%; changing the criteria for rent pressure zones so that they apply in more areas; extending those rules to student accommodation; and - something that I think will help to make a difference - extending notice to quit periods so that if someone is renting and the owner of the house is going to renovate or sell or if a family member is going to move back in, the owner will have to give much more notice of three months, or six in some cases, in order that the person in the house will have much more time than he or she has at present to find somewhere to live. In the current circumstances, if one is asked to vacate, one only has a few weeks to find somewhere else to live. That is not enough time in the current market. These laws will give people much more time to find place to lives. We are also helping first-time buyers. More than 10,000 people have already been helped through the help-to-buy scheme to raise deposits. That has been a very significant help for 10,000 people. The Government has given them some of their income tax back to help them raise a deposit. Ten thousand people have already been assisted to buy a home through that action.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	117	Leo fiddles while Rome burns. I am glad the Taoiseach has shared with us his deep commitment to homeownership. I am glad he at least recognises that there is a crisis and that homeownership for a whole generation is off the cards unless their mammy and daddy can help out with a deposit. The Taoiseach is missing the point of my question, perhaps deliberately. I have set out for him the real pressure that renters are under. He will be aware, as Focus Ireland has reported, that up to 70% of families presenting as homeless come from the private rental sector. I have asked the Taoiseach to take one concrete action, set aside the rhetoric and do something constructive by backing the Sinn Féin legislation that is before the Dáil. That legislation will ensure that buy-to-let landlords cannot insist on vacant possession to sell the property because that renders these families homeless. I am sure that people outside the Dáil are sick to the back teeth of the housing crisis and politicians talking about it. They want action and this is one solid action that could be taken, that could prove to people, by deed rather than word, that the Taoiseach is serious about getting to grips with family homelessness and the crisis in the rental sector.

The Government is helping people to raise a deposit to buy their own home. Some 10,000 people have already benefited from the help-to-buy scheme by getting some of their taxes back to put towards a deposit and 10,000 is not a small number. We are taking concrete action. The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, yesterday announced reforms to extend the notice-to-quit periods. A renter who is asked to quit a property because it is being renovated, sold or a family member is moving back in will have much more time to find an alternative place to live and rent. That is a concrete action. Sinn Féin's proposal is not a concrete action. We examined it and met with chief executive officers of NGOs about it. The problem is that the Sinn Féin proposal cannot apply retrospectively or to existing tenancies so it would not help one person who is currently renting or facing homelessness. It might, in fact, be counter-productive by discouraging people who are thinking about renting out a property from doing so. Somebody who has upgraded and bought a new home and is thinking about renting out their existing property might be discouraged from doing so were they to find out they would be unable to sell that property. We are taking concrete action. What Sinn Féin is proposing cannot be retrospective and will not help anyone who is currently renting or facing homelessness. It might get Sinn Féin on the news but that it is all it will do.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	120	Last week finally saw the publication of the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Climate Action entitled Climate Change: A Cross-Party Consensus for Action. The extent to which there is actual cross-party consensus for action remains to be seen. Sinn Féin took the surprising decision to reject the final draft of the report despite having been actively involved in drafting it for months. Its rejection by the Socialist Workers Party was less of a surprise. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a stark warning last year that we have only 12 years left to make major changes to our economies and ways of life in order to keep global warming at 1.5°C. That was last year so we now have 11 years left to take action. Even that 1.5°C warming is already linked to prolonged droughts in equatorial countries and to chaotic weather patterns across the globe.  Our cross-party climate report is our response to that international challenge. It provides a pathway to achieve our international commitment to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by nearly half over the next 11 years and a total reduction of emissions to net zero by 2050. This can be done but it will be hugely ambitious. I am not going to reiterate the contents of the report because we will have an opportunity to do so when we debate it in the House. I want to focus on the headline challenges that the report entails. We know where our greenhouse gas emissions come from so we can identify the sectors which require immediate action. The largest sources of emissions are agriculture, electricity generation and transport, with industry and commerce and people's home heating providing most of the rest. Ireland's current emissions are the equivalent of 16 million tonnes of carbon dioxide and includes methane and other greenhouse gases. Our commitment is to reduce our emissions to 33 million tonnes by 2030, 11 years from now. We must further reduce that to zero by 2050 which means offsetting all remaining emissions by absorbing carbon elsewhere. My questions to the Government are not only urgent but are direct and straightforward. Is the Government prepared to oversee the agricultural sector reducing its emissions from 20 million tonnes to 11 million tonnes over the next 11 years? How will that be achieved? Is the Government willing to invest public money in a massive programme of retrofitting all the homes in the State to bring emissions from people's home heating from 5.7 million tonnes to approximately 3 million tonnes and reducing energy poverty at the same time? Is the Government ready for the challenge of getting transport emissions down from approximately 12 million tonnes to 6.5 million tonnes over the next 11 years and all that entails in transforming public transport and how all of use transport in this country?

I regret that Sinn Féin and the radical left could not sign up to the report although I am not as surprised by that as Deputy Howlin. It should be evident to any of the young people who took part in those inspiring protests in favour of climate action that socialism, or this particular brand of it, is not the future. The future lies in the centre and the centre left. It is a good thing that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael were able to sign up to this report, alongside the Labour Party, the Green Party and others. The report was discussed at Cabinet yesterday and each Minister has been asked to examine the report and reply in detail to the individual recommendations which we expect will inform the Minister, Deputy Bruton's all-of-Government plan on climate action which we anticipate being able to publish this month or next month at the latest. I have also asked that there be a debate in the Dáil on the report so we have a chance to debate climate change and climate action. I agree that we need to catch up quickly over the next couple of years. We are keen to work with farmers and the agrifood industry to reduce emissions. We need to do that in a way that recognises we need to protect the incomes and livelihoods of farmers and the agrifood industry and we will work with those industries to reduce emissions, modernise farming and reform the CAP, in particular, to make it more green-focused. That will require significant changes in the way we produce food and we are up for that challenge and want to do it in a collaborative way. The cost of retrofitting all homes in the country is between €40 billion and €50 billion and it is not going to be possible for the Government to meet that cost. That would cost €5 billion a year over ten years.

We cannot find €50 billion over ten or 20 years to retrofit everyone's house but we can help. Most of the cost would have to be borne by householders but there are models that can help, for example, people retrofitting their houses and paying for it over a number of years through their ESB bill and the savings they make from energy. Similarly when it comes to transport, the big shift we need over the next ten or 15 years as people change their cars is for them to buy electric and hybrid vehicles. It is not possible for the Government to buy a new car for everyone and no reasonable person is suggesting that. What we can do is use smart measures, such as grants and carbon tax, to make it more economical for people to choose the electric vehicle or hybrid option. That is exactly what we need to do as well as, in particular, rolling out the infrastructure and the charging points throughout the country.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	124	It is very important that we make a decision that this is the priority which, if it were not for Brexit, should be consuming all of our focus so that all of our policies in terms of investment are aimed at tipping the balance against carbon. We need to do this. I purposely did not ask about the ambitious target of 70% for electricity generated from renewables because that will be achieved. It means we have to be very clear about the requirement of State agencies such as Eirgrid to co-operate with energy generators and community generated electricity to achieve that objective. The bottom line for us now is to embrace this strategy not simply as another report but as the last opportunity we will have as a people to make our urgent contribution to the real challenge of our time. I ask the Taoiseach to indicate how this report will be treated and that it will not simply be regarded as another report from another committee but will be the definitive guide to policy throughout all of the sectors that will impact on our climate to achieve the really ambitious targets and groundbreaking policy changes that are required by this unprecedented challenge.

This evening, I will meet the Chairman of the committee specifically on the report. We have proposed there should be a debate in the House on the report and I understand the Whip is working with the Business Committee to schedule it. Each Minister has been asked to respond in detail to each individual recommendation in the report and to pass on that response to the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton. The intention then is for us to publish a revised all-of-Government climate action plan this month or next month at the latest. Then it will be a case of getting on with it and I am really keen to get on with it. I agree it needs to be a major Government priority. There have to be other priorities too. Even without Brexit, I do not think climate change would be the only show in town. Jobs, the economy, incomes, livelihood and infrastructure are important.

#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	128	The issue of access to mental health services, specifically the total lack of access to residential psychiatric beds in Tipperary, is creating an appalling crisis in our county. Almost all of those who suffer psychological distress are forced to use the services of the 44-bed unit at St. Luke's General Hospital in Kilkenny. I remind the Taoiseach that on 21 December 2018, the Mental Health Commission issued summonses against the HSE as the registered proprietor of the department of psychiatry at St. Luke's hospital. On 19 February, Kilkenny District Court found against the HSE on a number of charges relating to breaches of the Mental Health Act 2001. St. Luke's General Hospital pleaded guilty to four charges, including poor maintenance of seclusion facilities and failure to comply with the rules governing the signing of the seclusion register by consultant psychiatrists responsible as required by law. The Mental Health Commission inspectors reported - and I apologise for this - that they were almost physically sick from the smell of a discarded colostomy bag that had been left in a clinical waste bin inside the room where electric shock treatment is administered. It is appalling. This is deeply offensive to the dignity of all patients, from wherever they come. Was anyone held accountable? Of course not. Judge Brian O'Shea fined the HSE a paltry €5,200. What signal does this send out to the families of the service users? More important, what does it do to meet the overwhelming need for residential psychiatric beds in County Tipperary? Each year since the closure of St. Michael's unit in Clonmel, the situation has continued to deteriorate rapidly. I accept the bona fides of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, and sincerely accept what he is trying to do but something is blocking the return of psychiatric beds to County Tipperary and it needs to be addressed urgently. It is way beyond time. If this is the crisis in the provision of adult mental health services, the crisis in child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, is even more alarming. There is not a single senior registrar for community healthcare organisation, CHO, area 3 covering north Tipperary or CHO area 5 covering south Tipperary. There is not one full-time CAMHS speech and language therapist or CAMHS social worker assigned to south Tipperary. It is appalling. When we put all of this together it is clear we are beyond breaking point in Tipperary. The HSE indicates the south east community healthcare area has the second lowest rate of acute psychiatric bed provision. If this area were to be provided with the national average rate of bed provision, an additional 18 acute psychiatric care beds would be required. I acknowledge the announcement by the National Centre for Youth Mental Health, Jigsaw, that it plans to add to its growing network, with new services in Tipperary earmarked for 2019 or early 2020. We are waiting for these. In the meantime, however, the provision of additional professional psychiatric services in the county is at an all-time low. What steps are the Taoiseach and the Government taking to address this very urgent matter?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	129	I thank Deputy Mattie McGrath for raising this important issue. I am afraid I do not have an up-to-date note in front of me on the particular issues he has raised with regard to Tipperary but I read the coverage at the time of the events he mentioned and I share his revulsion at the fact that basic things such as patient care and hygiene were not attended to properly in that unit, which is relatively new. There is no excuse for treating patients poorly or poor hygiene. These things do not require massive resources; they just require people to do their jobs properly. I am sure the HSE will respond to the Mental Health Commission's report and make sure remedial action is taken and changes made. The focus in mental health over the past ten or 15 years has been the right one. It is moving away from inpatient services to outpatient and community services and moving away from the traditional model of mental hospitals and psychiatric institutions to care in the community. This is much more appropriate and is the right way to go. The Deputy knows that in Tipperary, for example, a new Jigsaw service is being established to improve the services available in the community to people with mental health issues. There is also increased capacity in primary care, with 114 new assistant psychologists and 20 psychologists recruited by the HSE primary care unit. Most of them are now in place. There is an increased supply of psychiatric nurses, with funding for an additional 130 undergraduates per year. Ten advanced nurse practitioners in CAMHS are in training. The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, has developed a mental health telephone line, which helps to signpost people to the support they need, particularly out of hours. The Deputy is aware the budget for mental health this year will approach €1 billion, the biggest budget for mental health ever, with €55 million set aside for improvements in services alone. While there has been much focus on the national children's hospital, and I know the Deputy is particularly interested in it, we should not lose sight of the fact that three new hospitals are now under construction, one of these being the national forensic mental health campus in Portrane, which will replace the very outdated Victorian facilities in Dundrum.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	130	I do not believe the people of Tipperary and their families will take much solace from the Taoiseach's answer. More than ten months ago, on 11 May 2018, the Taoiseach's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, wrote to the chief officer of CHO area 5 outlining the need to restore some acute bed provision for adults in Tipperary following the closure of St. Michael's unit. We cannot manage without these beds. The Taoiseach said A Vision for Change is working but it is not and it is three years past its report date of ten years. It has been a disaster for Tipperary. It is a black hole instead of a vision. The Taoiseach can mention the children's hospital all he likes but we will see where it ends up. People do not have the services. They cannot get access to Kilkenny. It is not that they are not wanted there but there is not enough room there to deal with the Kilkenny and Carlow situation, not to mention the appalling vista I mentioned. There are clearly no services in south Tipperary and very few in north Tipperary. To be sent to Kilkenny or Ennis from north Tipperary is an appalling vista. The Taoiseach cannot allow it to go on. Long-stay beds will have to be reinstated in St. Michael's unit or somewhere else.We do not want every building, such as St. Luke's and St. Michael's former psychiatric unit in Clonmel, to be used for offices and storage. We want facilities that people can attend. Nurses and clinical advisers working in this area are burnt out. Psychologists are now trying to deal with this issue. Unfortunately, many patients are ending up in their graves. It is a terrible indictment of the Government and of A Vision for Change and anything to do with it.

In keeping with the Taoiseach's approach from time to time, he quoted very selectively from that contribution and suggested that I attacked people and so on. I raised very legitimate questions at the time, specifically about the issue of non-disclosure. I did not cast any aspersions on the CervicalCheck screening programme. I raised questions as to who in the Department of Health knew and, indeed, the lack of communications with the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, by his departmental officials. I made the point that the communications and frenzied reaction from the State and its agencies had caused much distress to women across the country. I raised questions about non-disclosure. I am today entitled to seek that the record of the House be corrected. In my view, officials of the Department of Health were advised by the clinical director via officials in the screening service that the decision to offer free smear tests should not proceed because it would fundamentally undermine the programme. That is a serious issue. Rather than trying to divert from that core point, questions asked in the House should be answered comprehensively. I ask the Taoiseach to ask the Minister to come to the House and correct the record in respect of that matter. In that context, when does the Taoiseach expect the new HPV test to be rolled out and introduced? Its accuracy and precision is superior to the existing form of screening.

I did not say that he criticised the programme; I said that he criticised senior people working in CervicalCheck. He stated that they were cold and calculating and suggested they may have been involved in illegality. He went on to subsequently suggest that they may have been involved in a conspiracy. I am not saying that he said that about the programme; I am saying that he said it about senior people in CervicalCheck. If the Deputy wishes to clarify that, perhaps he will tell the House exactly to whom he was referring-----

More than 7,500 children who availed of public orthodontic services in Dublin are to have their files reviewed. Many of these children were left irreversibly damaged after services were withdrawn in the mid-1990s. A report commissioned in February 2015 found that patient safety was put at risk and recommended a wider review, which is now under way. Experts at the time worked under the agreement that the report would be published in full, but that has not happened. In reply to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy O'Reilly in December 2018, the Minister committed to releasing an update on this issue in February 2019. It is now April 2019, but no report has been published to date. Will the Minister, Deputy Harris, publish the 2015 report and the wider review in full? Will he give a date for publication? If not, why not?

They are probably best raised directly with the Minister for Health. I understand it is a report of the HSE and not the Department of Health, so it may not be within the authority of the Minister to publish it. Obviously, as is always the case with reports, if they pertain to certain individuals there may be issues with their publication. I am advised that the HSE has initiated a comprehensive audit of more than 7,500 patient files available from that period and that dedicated funding and personnel have been allocated by the HSE for that work.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	151	A Programme for a Partnership Government commits to ensuring a strong and visible police force in every community. Yesterday, there was a shooting outside a school in the constituency of the Taoiseach and my colleague, Deputy Burton. It was an outrageous incident involving a gunman shooting at a man collecting a pupil from the school. It is incredibly lucky that such a reckless assault did not result in fatalities or serious injuries. It follows on from recent incidents in Drogheda and elsewhere. According to my colleague, Senator Nash, there appears to be a clear lack of resources in Drogheda. There has been an escalation in such shootings and other gangland crimes, which appear to be happening with impunity. We must not allow this to become the norm. What is the Government specifically doing about this? Will it take on these escalating attacks? We need to know whether this is a resource issue. Has the Government discussed that with An Garda Síochána? How will the Government and the Minster for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, respond?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	152	I too am very shocked by the shooting that occurred yesterday outside Riversdale Community College on Blanchardstown Road North in my constituency. My constituency agent is visiting the school today to see if there is any way we can help or any additional supports we can provide. I hope to visit the school in the coming days. I know it well and know people who attended it. It must have been a very frightening occurrence for its pupils. I very much commend the principal and staff for taking swift action to lock down the school. It is a blessing that nobody was hurt in the incident and that the gunman did not succeed in entering the school grounds. The incident is related to an ongoing feud, as the Deputy will be aware. There is a turf war involving drug dealers in the area. Yesterday, I sought a report from the Minister for Justice and Equality, who told me that significant inroads have been made in tackling this feud. There are high visibility controls in the area and have been for some time. Specialist Garda units, including the Garda dog unit, have carried out searches in Corduff with the assistance of the armed support unit for the region. The searches have resulted in the seizure of five sawn-off shotguns as well as other weapons and a quantity of controlled drugs. This is a significant operation and the Garda will continue to monitor and disrupt the activity of these criminal gangs. I encourage anyone in the area or elsewhere who has information about the incident to, please, contact the Garda and pass on the information in order that it can be dealt with.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	153	For one and a half years, the residents of Leeside Apartments in Cork fought attempts by their vulture fund landlord to evict them into homelessness. Late last week, the residents discovered that they had been victorious when news broke that the apartments had been purchased by the Clúid housing association and that in addition to those 13 families keeping a roof over their heads, a further 59 families are to be taken off Cork City Council housing waiting lists and provided with new homes at Leeside. The programme for Government promises improved tenants' rights. This was discussed by the residents when I met them last Friday night. They sent messages of solidarity to the residents of Exchange Hall in Tallaght, who are facing similar circumstances, and they asked me to send a message to the Dáil. The message is simply that they wish that no other group of residents should ever have to go through what they have gone through with their families and children over the past eight months and that the Dáil should, as a matter of urgent priority, pass legislation to ban the practice of evicting people, including families and children, into homelessness. What does the Minister say in response to the residents' appeal, request and message?
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	154	I thank the Deputy for relaying that message from his constituents. I welcome his acknowledgement of the excellent work done by Clúid, as a housing body, in taking people off the local authority housing list and putting them into homes. I do not believe the Deputy recognised before that it is an important player in the provision of social housing up and down the country. As the Taoiseach has said before, we use every means at our disposal to get people into homes, be it through local authorities, housing bodies, Part V arrangements, leasing or taking homes out of vacancy. What those coming off the housing list or out of emergency accommodation want is a home and they are not going to become ideological about who is providing it, be it the local authority or housing body. With regard to the issue the Deputy raised on protecting tenants' rights, the Taoiseach alluded to our agreeing at Cabinet yesterday a significant number of new measures to protect tenants in accommodation. The document will be published with the amendments as they go before the joint Oireachtas committee before Committee Stage next week. We are taking a series of steps, not just in respect of rent pressure zones but also under section 34. I refer to the notice to quit, how it is enforced by the Residential Tenancies Board and the extended notice periods. The information will be published very shortly.

Why, in this day and age, is SIPTU allowed to block this? What is going on? Big Jim Larkin and James Connolly would turn in their graves over this.

They provide front-line services and respond to all calls, as they did yesterday during strike time. Why are they not allowed to determine what union represents them?

I understand this dispute is of a different nature. It involves union recognition. The HSE already recognises three unions representing the National Ambulance Service staff and paramedics. It also relates to the fact that the HSE is not willing to deduct, from wages, dues for the union in question. No employer, either public or private, should be required to collect union dues directly from somebody's wages. It is a decision for the staff member if he or she wants to pay them.

One of the issues we were talking about was political advertising. I am keen to hear the timeline of the Government for the introduction of legislation to regulate and fight for transparency in political advertising here. Before the legislation is introduced, will the Taoiseach ask each Member of the Dáil, including each Minister, to commit to being fully transparent about what he or she, and each party, has spent on the online social media networks over the past year or two so we will live up to what we promise, not only in word but also in deed? Will the Taoiseach commit to transparency on expenditure on social media networks here? When does he expect legislation to be introduced?

The Minister and Minister of State responsible for housing are in the House. The public is very cynical about any progress on this issue. The Central Statistics Office told us that, in 2016, in excess of 12% of houses were vacant. We are approaching local elections. Anybody who examines 100 good houses in any housing estate, in my constituency or elsewhere across the country, will see that one in 12 is unoccupied. Those living on either side of a vacant property say the residents have gone away. Most of the properties are owned by the banks, which are sitting waiting to make more money on the backs of the people. I have asked the Minister and Minister of State on several occasions when they will take a leaf out of the book of the local authority in Louth. It acquired properties that belonged to the banks through compulsory purchase order and there was no challenge taken constitutionally. I challenge anybody in this House who is out canvassing to identify why any 100 houses are unoccupied. It is time we got to grips with this issue. The people are laughing at those of us in this House who are not challenging the Government on the issue of good vacant houses.

We are aware that the CSO numbers from 2016 include homes that were for rent or for sale and holiday homes. Therefore, the statistic does not give the true number of vacant homes in the country. We now have a vacancy team in each of our 31 local authorities. The teams submitted their plans to my Department and are doing a deep dive to find out whether homes are truly vacant or whether they are just homes for sale or holiday homes. To get vacant homes from banks, we do not have to issue a compulsory purchase order, although we do in some instances. We actually engage through the Housing Agency with each of the financial lending institutions to take their vacant homes and bring them into social housing use. It is happening in every local authority area.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	167	The health section of the programme for Government states: “We will fund hospitals and other healthcare providers for the work they do rather than on the basis of historical budgets”. There is also a reference to creating greater facilities for older people. The Minister for Health came to Longford the other day and had good news for St. Joseph's hospital but he took out the bata mór and gave Opposition Deputies a right lash for raising concerns about proposed health projects. He said we were deliberately using the over-expenditure on the children's hospital to raise such issues. That was a bad statement, bearing in mind that I do not always disagree with the Minister. If one considers Fine Gael's promises in the programme for Government, one notes that, in my locality, there was to be a 50-bed unit for older people in St. Patrick's hospital, a 50-bed unit at Sacred Heart Hospital, Roscommon, and a 50-bed unit at Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe, where there is absolute chaos in the accident and emergency department. Management and others have asked me to plead with the Minister to get the projects up and running. The Government has already delayed them so they are late already. When will Taoiseach announce the projects? Can we see genuine progress on them as quickly as possible?

I do not have in front of me the schedule indicating when they will start but I will ask the Minister for Health to provide the Deputy with a detailed reply. I did not hear the Minister's comments but I can confirm that there are those around the country trying to make out that any time a project is delayed, even one that does not yet have planning permission, it is because of the overrun on the children's hospital. That is, of course, false. It is not right that people should be so disrespectful of their constituents to make those kinds of claims.

Everyone will agree this is the most cost-effective way to care for the elderly. The Kerry and Cork budget for this vital service has been cut by €3 million, however. Some genius of an official did not include travel in the costing. The home help staff do not have wings and cannot fly from house to house. I ask the Taoiseach to examine the budget. The Government is saying the Exchequer returns are strong. On top of that, there is an issue with the fair deal scheme. No money was provided last week to Kerry and Cork for the scheme. What is going on?Is the Taoiseach asleep? Is the Minister for Health asleep? What are they doing? It is no wonder there was an overrun in the children's hospital.

It said that the company involved had 28 days to make further observations or submissions. Has there been an engagement between the company and the HSE during that period? If so, what is the current state of play? If no progress is being made, what steps can the Government take to review the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013? This drug is available to children in every other European country. We cannot make it available because we are caught up in our own red tape. If the process is not working, can we look at reviewing the 2013 Act?

As Deputies are well aware, the current process is independent of politicians. Under the Act, the Minister of the day does not decide whether drugs are approved. As the Deputy knows, the timeline for the negotiations was extended. The company has re-engaged with the HSE. We are awaiting the outcome of those negotiations to get the latest update.

Is the Taoiseach aware that 81 people were languishing on trolleys at University Hospital Limerick this morning? There were 52 people on trolleys in the emergency department and 29 people on trolleys elsewhere. I am raising this question in the context of last week's closure of a 17-bed ward. When will the patient safety Bill be introduced? Will that legislation bring an end to, or outlaw, the cavalier attitude towards patients' health, welfare and safety that is presently being demonstrated by the authorities at University Hospital Limerick?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	190	I believe the patient safety Bill is on the A list for publication in this session, over the course of the next 12 weeks. I am aware of the long-standing problem of severe overcrowding at University Hospital Limerick. I do not know the details of the reason for the closure of the 17-bed ward mentioned by the Deputy. I know that 60 additional beds are being provided in Limerick. That work is now under way. The Deputy will be aware that although things have deteriorated in the past two or three weeks, so far this year the number of patients who have had to spend time on trolleys has been at a five-year low. Regardless of whether the HSE figures or the nurses' figures are used, it is clear that between 3,000 and 4,000 fewer people have had to spend time on trolleys this year by comparison with last year. I accept that it is still far too many. We are making progress. Evidence shows that the provision of additional beds is not enough on its own. As the Deputy will be aware, University Hospital Limerick has a new emergency department.

Kerry Airport has a unique location in Farranfore because there is a train station in the village and there are good roads to Tralee, Castleisland and Killarney, which are a stone's throw away. On 3 May 2017, I raised the possibility of an international PSO for Kerry Airport with Amsterdam, which was brought to me by the Tralee Chamber Alliance. At the time, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, said it was a positive idea. Is it something the Government will look at seriously? It would open up Kerry to a whole new range of business. It would lead to connectivity with an international hub from which one can go anywhere in the world. I ask the Government to support this sensible suggestion.
#BrendanGriffinFG	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-party	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-dob	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	195	As the Deputy knows, the Government supports Kerry Airport with the Dublin-Kerry PSO funding, which is critically important for that route and for the viability of all the other routes in and out of the airport. We also support the airport through capital expenditure and operating expenses funding, which is critically important for Kerry Airport and the wider economy. I have sought advice on the idea of an international PSO to see whether there is an avenue to pursue it. I know that Edmond Harty of Dairymaster, who is a very successful businessman in the county, is very passionate about this. I am seeking advice on the matter currently. As soon as I receive that advice, I will get back to the Deputy with it. This interesting proposal may well be of benefit to the Kerry region and other regions as well.

As usual, he absconded before we could actually get to the promised legislation in order to avoid answering any questions. During our schooldays, if we had been able to shoot the breeze and fist-pump and high-five our friends about a summer trip to North Korea or a grant to get Granny more money, we would all have enjoyed ourselves. It is high time for the Taoiseach to talk to the Minister of State and his Independent Alliance colleagues to ensure they come to the Chamber to account for their actions. In an interview with the Sunday Independent at the weekend, the Minister of State created a fine mess for himself and the Government. He was not brazen enough to fail to appear here today, although he subsequently removed himself from the Chamber. The Taoiseach might be willing to tolerate this as long as the Minister of State does not raise any heckles about his use of the office of the Taoiseach to write fan mail to Kylie Minogue, or indeed about the Government's performance in health or housing. My question today relates to the Bluestack Special Needs Foundation in County Donegal and the ICARE Centre for Autism in Buncrana. When the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, met those involved with these organisations in the past, he promised he would look at making funds forthcoming to assist them. He has not done that. They have received small funding from the HSE from local funds. The Minister of State has not ensured funding has been forthcoming to support them in their work. As he is not here, I am calling on the Taoiseach to ask him to follow up on his promise. Perhaps the Taoiseach could also ask the Minister of State and his Independent Alliance colleagues to attend this Chamber to be held to account for their performance.

I am raising this matter in the context of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, which was agreed in December. It is estimated that one in 65 people is on the autism spectrum. There are 11 primary schools in my constituency that make provision for children with autism. No secondary schools in my constituency make such provision. Just 18 secondary schools in the whole of Dublin cater for children on the autism spectrum. When will we start to see secondary schools or other schools being established throughout the country under the 2018 Act to deal with the establishment of autism units? The Minister is not here.

We had an excellent debate last night to mark World Autism Awareness Day. April is World Autism Month. Excellent contributions to yesterday's debate were made by Deputies on all sides of the House. Our motion was supported by all parties and Independents. The establishment of an all-party committee on the development of an autism empowerment strategy was central to that motion. I ask the Taoiseach, as the Head of Government, to state clearly that he supports the establishment of such an all-party committee so that we, as legislators, can come up with an autism empowerment strategy within six months. Such a strategy would support many of the issues being faced by children and adults with autism and their families.

Last week, the Dáil rushed through the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill 2017. The Bill, which was supported by the Government, Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin, did not undergo pre-legislative scrutiny. It had been sidelined in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for two years. The haste in the past several weeks to get it through the Dáil has left many unanswered questions. Legal experts have since found loopholes in the Bill, the effect of which may be to allow foreign vessels from outside Northern Ireland, as well as vessels registered there, to now fish within the six-mile fishery zone limit. If this were to happen, it would have devastating consequences for inshore fishermen. Will the Taoiseach guarantee fishermen that this will not be the case?

I am not sure, however, that I am in a position to give any of the specific guarantees requested by the Deputy. I will certainly advise the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, that this matter was raised. I am sure he will want to reply to the Deputy in more detail.
#FionaOLoughlin	unknown-#FionaOLoughlin-party	unknown-#FionaOLoughlin-dob	unknown-#FionaOLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	214	My question relates to the programme for Government and public transport, which we all agree is significantly important in keeping cars off the roads. It was useful to meet representatives from Irish Rail yesterday in order to examine the company's plans for services after 2027. I want to deal with the here and now, however. Public transport should be affordable, accessible and have appropriate capacity. Thousands of commuters take the train at Newbridge, which is in my constituency, every day. However, the price of the fare from Newbridge is twice what it is from Sallins because of the short-hop zone arrangements. This results in many people driving to Sallins to take the train from that station. There is also a capacity issue and it is not safe. Last Monday, the head of the National Transport Authority informed a meeting in Kildare that while it realised the price arrangement is unfair, it would not reduce them because it does not want to encourage people to use the trains because of capacity issues. We need new carriages on these train serves.

That is covered under the Dublin Transport Authority Act and the National Transport Authority. On additional carriages and capacity for the rail network, I have been advised by Irish Rail from my own queries that additional carriages are being renovated and others are on order. That will improve capacity on our rail services but it is not possible to give an exact date for that.

Members of Carlow Institute of Technology students’ union, along with staff, staged a walkout in recent weeks calling on the Government to invest in the future of higher education. They did so to raise awareness about the key issues facing students today. Ireland will have the highest third level fees in the EU after Brexit. Will the Taoiseach outline the Government’s plans to address these key issues? Will it take a more active role in engaging with students’ unions?

It is compulsory for student teachers but they are unpaid for the three weeks they spend doing it. A recent survey by the Union of Students in Ireland found that it cost €160 per week for travel and materials without taking in the cost of accommodation. In addition, most student teachers have to go for Gaeltacht placements and these involved a significant cost. There was a grant of approximately €650 a week but it has been taken away. Many who want to do teacher training find it is only open to those who are affluent and where the bank of mammy and daddy step in. That is an unfortunate development. There are two points to be raised.

#PatBuckley	unknown-#PatBuckley-party	unknown-#PatBuckley-dob	unknown-#PatBuckley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	224	The latest available data from the HSE indicates that the 2018 national targets for access to child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, are not on track. Up to 2,453 children and adolescents are waiting for CAMHS appointments. Of those, 1,400 are waiting more than three months and 313 waiting more than 12 months. This fails to meet the HSE target that no young person should wait more than 12 months for a CAMHS appointment. What is the Government doing to address these waiting times? As the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, is aware, Cork has nearly doubled its waiting time figures this year.

It has experienced challenges in maintaining a full 24-hour on-call service. It is continuing to respond to emergencies by day and hopes to be able to produce a final plan shortly. Will the Minister of State clarify the position in respect of the review? Why are these services not fully provided? Will he give me an answer on this and seek to get to the bottom of it as soon as possible?
#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	229	I am aware of this review. The issue underpinning this is that the number of people who sought the service out-of-hours last year was 14. We have to look at available resources and see if that is the best use of them. We are engaging with the consultants on this, as well as patients, their families and the HSE, to see we are deploying our resources in the most appropriate manner.

I accept I do it on other days but not today. Deputy Eamon Ryan has already alluded to the meeting that he, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton and I had yesterday with Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer of Facebook. It was a good meeting. Among the issues discussed were those of integrity and transparency in electoral campaigns and the threat to democracy worldwide which social media poses. Mr. Zuckerberg outlined some of the measures which Facebook is implementing voluntarily at European level in advance of the forthcoming European Parliament elections. I do not agree with Mr. Zuckerberg on everything but he made a strong point when he said it is up to governments and parliaments to regulate, legislate and lead in this matter. My Online Advertising and Social Media (Transparency) Bill was introduced in 2017. It has gone through detailed scrutiny and been the subject of expert evidence. A long list of stakeholders came before the relevant committee. It has done its work and discharged its duties. We can now add Mr. Zuckerberg to that long list. We missed introducing this legislation for the repeal the eighth amendment campaign and the presidential election. The writ has been moved for the local elections and the European Parliament elections will be held in a month’s time.

We wish to introduce the Road Traffic (All Terrain Vehicle and Scrambler Motor-cycle) (Amendment) Bill 2019. Quad bikes and scramblers continue to be a problem and terrorise many of our communities. It is not only that they represent a nuisance but the matter is very serious. In the three-year period, 2014-2017, 39 people, of whom 27 were children, lost their lives due to dangerous quad bike and scrambler use. Clearly these are not toys, and are fatal in the wrong hands. Communities have had enough. This House has debated it backwards and forwards for the last three years, over the life of this Government. To be fair, the Minister for Justice and Equality has acknowledged there is a problem in this area. He has established a cross-departmental inter-agency group which has met several times to discuss this. The reason we are introducing this Bill is that in February the Minister, in a reply to me, said that in terms of road traffic or public order offences, he did not believe that any new legislation was required. I am afraid that is where we differ, and significantly.  Along with some of my colleagues, I sit on a joint policing committee. The issue of problematic and illegal use of quad bikes and scramblers comes up time and again. Senior gardaí make the same point which I must emphasise as the response must be appropriate. They tell their officers that they must not physically stop the youths who are engaging in this behaviour for their own health and safety and that of those on the quad bikes and scramblers. Therein lies the dilemma. We have road traffic legislation which is not proving effective and is not affording the garda the opportunity to apprehend and seize these vehicles. It is in that context that we are bringing forward amendments to the Road Traffic Act in this Bill and to introduce a range of other penalties, but particularly to empower the gardaí to seize these quad bikes and scramblers when they are in use.  My colleague, Deputy Lahart, will now introduce the main points of the legislation.
#JohnLahart	unknown-#JohnLahart-party	unknown-#JohnLahart-dob	unknown-#JohnLahart-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	252	The Bill is a practical response to the terrorising of communities by the illegal use of scramblers, in particular. Just today I received further video footage from my constituency of scramblers being used in a dangerous manner in Springfield, however, that is not an isolated incident. There are examples from Kingswood, Kilnamanagh, Oldbawn, and Kiltipper, and that is only in my constituency. As Deputy Curran said, this issue is widespread across Dublin, northside and southside. In 2017 alone, 62 people were injured in quad bike and scrambler accidents. While the gardaí do their best to police the use of these vehicles they currently exist in a legal lacuna. For the first time under this proposed legislation riding a quad bike or a scrambler bike in an antisocial and dangerous manner will be an offence under public order legislation. The Bill, which was designed following consultation with the key stakeholders, including members of the joint policing committees, to which Deputy Curran referred, will give garda the powers they need to seize bikes that are being ridden dangerously in all public areas, including parks and open spaces. The Bill will also increase the penalties for supplying these bikes to underage youngsters. Deputy Curran noted how between 2014 and 2017, 39 people, most of them younger people, lost their lives. The Bill will also direct the Minister to establish a national register for these vehicles to increase accountability of their owners. Too often scramblers and quad bikes are not registered to any owner making it very difficult for gardaí to enforce the laws surrounding them. Equally, the Bill will require the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to introduce regulations allowing gardaí to remove these bikes from the curtilage of a house, which is critical. As Deputy Curran said, superintendents and chief superintendents in various divisions of the Dublin metropolitan region have issued instructions to their officers not to intercept or engage in speed chases of individuals on scramblers because of the danger that presents to the community. That was a weakness in previous legislative efforts by this side of the House to deal with the matter. Our proposal closes this gap by giving the gardaí powers to seize these vehicles from the curtilage of a house, which would include the garden, following information they would have obtained, whether documentary or photographic evidence, etc., of quad bikes and scramblers being used in an antisocial way.  We are delighted to move First Stage and look forward to engaging with other spokespersons from other parties in attempts to secure their support for what is much-needed legislation, particular for communities which are very badly affected by this.

Work is under way in my Department on proposals for the establishment of a new citizens' assembly to consider gender equality. I am also proposing a citizens' assembly on a directly elected mayor for Dublin and the form that this should take. The function of a citizens' assembly is to inform the public and increase overall awareness and comprehension of topics being examined. Consideration is being given to the parameters of these topics and how best to optimise the use of an assembly's time and the taxpayers' money. I expect these proposals to come before the Government shortly. As with the Convention on the Constitution and the previous citizens' assembly, I expect the establishment of the assembly will be the subject of a resolution of each House of the Oireachtas and that the assembly will also report to both Houses.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	258	We would all welcome the Taoiseach's promise in relation to a citizens' assembly on gender equality being established. While women have made great progress in this country, nonetheless there is a lot still to do. This is the centenary of Constance Markievicz becoming a Cabinet Minister, the first such woman, certainly in Britain or Ireland. In terms of gaps, we have the gender pay gap, which in Ireland is 14%. Some 25% of Irish companies acknowledge that there is a significant gender pay gap in their business. We have a serious deficiency in the number of women involved in the governance of the universities and institutes of higher education. That needs to be specifically addressed. If women are not involved in governance, for instance, fully represented as presidents of universities and educational institutions, which they are not at all at present, it means women are absent from a very significant sphere of Irish life. We have the issue of domestic violence. On International Women's Day, the Government signed up to the Istanbul Convention but, like the signing up by the Taoiseach's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, nothing has been done by Government to implement the requirements of the Istanbul Convention, which would mean far more refuge spaces provided in Ireland for victims of domestic violence who are mainly and principally women and their children. The sooner this citizens' assembly is established, the sooner it can do some serious work to improve the position of women in Ireland.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	260	I apologise because I nipped out to say hello to the wonderful Special Olympians for a minute and I missed the Taoiseach's response. I raised this issue of the citizens' assembly on gender equality with the Taoiseach in October last. At that stage, the Taoiseach stated he would bring forward proposals. I presume the Taoiseach is still saying he will bring forward proposals. We need to see them. The citizens' assembly is a good model. It worked well in the past. It is one that could be utilised effectively in the neighbouring jurisdiction as well. We need to see action on these matters now. I want specifically to ask the Taoiseach a question on the gender pay gap. The Taoiseach will be aware that a Labour Party Bill has passed in the Seanad. Amendments could be progressed if the Government took on that Bill to deal with the egregious issue of a gender pay gap now existing in 2019. The Government has promised its own legislation which we have not seen. If the spirit of new politics is to mean anything, if there is advanced legislation that can be amended to suit the collective will of these Houses, why would the Government not simply take the Bill that is already well advanced and deal with the issue of gender pay inequality?
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	261	I, like others, welcome the focus on gender equality. The deliberative methodology of the citizens' assembly affords an opportunity to delve into the fundamentals of gender inequality. Some of the issues have been rehearsed, such as the gender pay gap and the absence or invisibility of women at senior levels in public institutions, and the universities have been correctly cited. It is important that we examine not only the gender pay gap but the phenomenon of women in low pay, women in insecure and precarious employment, women and poverty, women and poor housing, women and a system that not alone discriminates against them on the basis of their gender but also on the basis of their social class, and women and their health. We saw in the course of the CervicalCheck scandal the shocking finding by Dr. Scally of institutionalised misogyny within the health system. We need to look at how, even now, and let me refer to that scandal which still plays its way out, 80,000 women are affected by delays in smear tests and yet those who can pay privately can have their results in a fraction of that waiting time. If we are seriously to get under the bonnet of gender issues, we must get under the bonnet of equality issues. That has to be about class. It has to be about poverty. It has to be about the fact that women disproportionately experience poverty. With the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's indulgence, I will mention one final issue, that of single-parent families generally, but headed up by women. In the course of the austerity that was unleashed on the population, those families more than any others took the raw end of the stick. In a way, if one were to be cynical, which I wish to assure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle I am not, one might suggest that looking at gender equality now is a bit of a political manoeuvre to take the bad look off matters.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	262	Rhetorical or even legal commitments to gender equality are welcome, all fine and good, but to deal with many of the most serious inequalities or disadvantages that women suffer, we need tangible supports for women. I recommend that we look at two areas: domestic violence and women's refuges to support women in situations of domestic violence. We are woefully inadequate in this regard. We are operating a standard of one to 10,000 women whereas across Europe it is one to 10,000 persons. Ireland is the only country that is doing this and that means we are massively under provided for. I was shocked to learn during the week that the first purpose-built women's refuge, built in Rathmines, has been closed for two years, ostensibly because of rewiring that was needed to be done. However, that rewiring was completed in September of last year and that refuge is still not functional. The reason, it turns out, it is not functional is because Tusla is trying to outsource it. It is the only women's refuge that Tusla runs and Tusla is trying to offload it and offload and redeploy staff who have worked there for decades. Because of Tusla's determination to outsource or the Government's obsession with outsourcing, that will remain closed, maybe until the end of the year. This is a refuge that had thousands of callers and hundreds of women and children utilising it. The other matter I will mention briefly is the pathetic lack of childcare facilities. For example, a considerable development in my area, the Honeypark-Cualanor housing development, which was a NAMA development, included provision for a crèche. There is no crèche, despite the development being completed a while ago, because it is dependent on the private market to deliver crèche facilities. A bit like housing, it is not happening. There is a stark lack of affordable crèche and childcare facilities and the State is hoping that the private sector will deliver. It is not delivering. The Government needs to intervene directly and provide public and affordable childcare facilities.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	263	There is a range of issues around gender equality that one could focus in on and we do not have the time in such a short space here. I say to the Taoiseach that the issue of gender equality should be a consistent integral part of daily Government policy and we should not have to await a citizens' assembly to improve and focus on services for women and policies around women. Although people talk about the gender pay gap, the key issue, more specifically, is that many women are in low-pay occupations and very little has been done to change that story.We can take childcare as an example. There are many strategies which note the importance of childcare, particularly between the ages from birth to three years and six years old. A child will learn more from birth to three years than he or she will for the rest of his or her life. Nevertheless, people in the childcare sector are among the lowest paid. Many people complete degrees in college in early childhood development, Montessori and a variety of areas specifically focused on professional childcare and early education. We could contrast and compare their salaries with those in primary, secondary or third level education but there is really no comparison. The bulk of people in childcare - they are not all but are mostly women - are on the minimum wage in many instances. I predict this will be a great inhibitor of the growth and expansion of childcare. We have all received representations in that regard. We could also look at section 39 organisations, taking in nurses and allied health professionals, that are again discriminated against under Government pay policy. The pensions anomaly hit many more women than men. The decisions in that regard were taken by the Fine Gael-Labour Government. We must ask fundamental questions as to why, in many of the professions in the areas of healthcare and childcare, women are at the centre of what is essentially a low-pay regime. That needs to change and we do not need the Citizens' Assembly in order to start working on it.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	264	Work is under way to finalise the terms of reference for the Citizens' Assembly. I hope to bring proposals to the Government on this shortly. I had hoped to have them for International Women's Day but we have not yet finalised them. There is a discussion within the Government as to whether it should examine constitutional issues that have already been examined by the Constitutional Convention. Perhaps they require re-examination and there is a question regarding the extent to which issues that have a gender aspect but are much wider than gender should be examined. For example, there is the area of caring. There are pluses and minuses in carrying out that examination. It will require a resolution of the Houses of the Oireachtas, indicating precise terms and arrangements, to establish the assembly. Once we have a draft, we will be happy to consult with the Opposition on it. Consideration is also being given to the length of service of members and the payment of an annual stipend, transparency, research, timetable and work programmes and resourcing the establishment of the advisory group. It is expected topics will be dealt with consecutively by the assembly, with two separate cohorts of members, one chairperson and one secretariat. What we are doing with gender equality more generally is tangible and I agree that we do not have to wait for the assembly for such action. Building on the commitments in the programme for Government, there are initiatives in line with the National Strategy for Women and Girls 2017-2020, which aims to change attitudes and practices preventing women and girls from participating fully in education, employment and public life. We recently approved the text of the gender pay gap information Bill, which will promote wage transparency by requiring companies to complete a wage survey periodically and report the results showing gender pay gaps. The Bill, which will be published shortly, will also provide a range of enforcement mechanisms. It has already been approved but there is a technical delay. We have also reformed the working family payment to ensure working families do not face poverty. We have pursued reforms in the one-parent family payment. In the past three years, under this Fine Gael-Independent Government, we have increased the working family payment by €15 per week or approximately €850 per year. We are allowing lone parents who are working to hold on to more of the money they earn. There has also been the introduction of two years of free preschool education and a universal subsidy for childcare paid to all people availing of childcare for children between the ages of six months and three years. This autumn, the new national childcare scheme will kick in, resulting in increased subsidies for those people already receiving them. Many middle income families with incomes of up to €100,000 will receive subsidies for the first time. A new initiative, Better Balance for Better Business, was announced last July and it is all about increasing women's representation in senior management positions in the private sector. It is led by Ms Bríd Horan and Mr. Gary Kennedy. The Government recently decided to establish a public sector network within the 30% Club to promote greater gender balance in the senior leadership of the public sector. We also committed to and subsequently held a referendum to repeal the eighth amendment. Abortion in Ireland is now legal and provided without charge. We have also introduced two weeks of paid parental leave, which will kick in later this year. Noting that the initial sexual assault and violence in Ireland, SAVI, report was compiled a very long time ago, we have commissioned the production of a national survey on the prevalence of sexual and domestic violence, and that will be conducted by the Central Statistics Office. It is currently in the planning stage, with research stakeholder consultation and scoping to take place this year. Work is also ongoing on the implementation of a proposal to create 45 female-only senior academic roles within the higher education sector to correct the gender imbalance that exists in the area. As has been mentioned by others, on International Women's Day we had a special Cabinet meeting when we ratified the Istanbul Convention, among other actions. We may well need more women's refuge spaces and that is currently being examined. Crucially, we have changed domestic violence law and there has been a change of approach that enables courts to ensure that the abuser leaves a home rather than the person who is subject to violence. That is the correct approach, although I realise it may not always be possible. The person perpetrating violence - the abuser - should leave the family home rather than the victim and the children. That is the approach we would certainly like to take in future and legislation is either enacted or under way to allow that happen more frequently than it does now. In the context of gender balance on State boards more broadly, we have now exceeded our 40% target for representation by women on such boards but, as mentioned on previous occasions, this is patchy across the different State boards.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	265	I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 11, inclusive, and 13 together. I attended the European Council in Brussels on Thursday, 21 March, and Friday, 22 March. As I outlined in my statement to the House on 27 March, the agenda included: Brexit; jobs, growth and competitiveness; external relations; climate change; and efforts to combat disinformation. European Union reform was not an item for discussion at this meeting. We also met the leaders of Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein and marked the 25th anniversary of the European Economic Area. Brexit was the main focus at this European Council and we spent most of Thursday on this. We had a lengthy exchange and question-and-answer session with Prime Minister May and listened carefully to her requests. She asked for an extension of Article 50 until 30 June and also for formal endorsement of the agreements reached in Strasbourg the previous week between her and President Jean-Claude Juncker. The 27 EU leaders then had a detailed discussion about the best way forward and we endorsed the two documents agreed in Strasbourg. We also agreed to extend Article 50 until 22 May if the withdrawal agreement was approved last week. If it was not approved, as has proven to be the case, we agreed to extend Article 50 only until 12 April, a key date in terms of the European Parliament elections, by which time the UK must have outlined an alternative way forward for consideration by the European Council. We stated that the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop, is not for renegotiation and that any unilateral commitments the UK Government might make must be compatible with this in spirit as well as in letter. In light of the rejection of the withdrawal agreement by the UK Parliament on 29 March, we now await indications from the UK of its intentions. On Friday, we met European Central Bank President Mario Draghi and discussed the economic outlook, as well as how best to prepare the European Union for increasing global economic competition. This includes the strengthening and deepening of the Single Market, a matter in respect of which Ireland has been very active in calling for progress, particularly in the areas of services and digitalisation. We discussed our priorities for the EU-China summit on 9 April and our overall relations with China, including in the context of issues relating to trade, industry and human rights. I was very pleased that we formally appointed Professor Philip Lane as chief economist of the European Central Bank and a member of its six-person executive board. Under external relations, we committed once again to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity and expressed our readiness to continue backing the countries affected by the recent cyclone in Africa.On climate change, we reaffirmed our commitment to the Paris Agreement and endorsed the development of a long-term climate strategy for the EU. We also discussed disinformation and agreed on the need for further efforts to protect the European Parliament elections and elections across the EU. Before the first working session on Thursday, I attended two meetings. One was the EPP summit while the other was a meeting of the Nordic-Baltic Group, which Prime Minister Rutte and I attended as guests. We are like-minded small northern European countries and share interests and perspectives on issues across the EU agenda. This is a useful way to strengthen our co-operation.  I also had a short bilateral meeting with Prime Minister May on Thursday afternoon. I did not have any other formal bilateral meetings in Brussels but across the two days, I engaged with my EU counterparts using the opportunity as I always do to promote Ireland and Europe's interests.

Notwithstanding the Taoiseach's obsession with having pot shots at socialists and the left, whatever he may think about Corbyn, he is an internationalist and not a little Englander and is far more likely to want a softer kind. Regarding the Taoiseach's comments about climate change, notwithstanding the pot shots he and the Labour Party took at the socialists this morning-----

The Taoiseach's affirmation of his support for the Paris climate change agreement is a bit ironic when we will suffer major fines because of our failure in this area - a failure for which the Labour Party-Fine Gael Government must bear responsibility because it did nothing on climate change. While in government, it tried to sell off the forests and issued lots of licences for oil exploration and Coillte harvesting rights only for protests organised by the nasty left - the awful left - to defeat its proposals.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	275	On 5 March, I pressed the Taoiseach to detail the level of business preparedness for a no-deal Brexit on 29 March. He said at the time that he had the details and would provide them but for the fact that we were running out of time. A parliamentary reply to Deputy Michael McGrath last week revealed that on the date scheduled for Brexit, an incredible 40,000 businesses - 50% of those identified by the Revenue Commissioners as trading with the UK - did not have the most basic registration required to continue trading in the event of no deal. Will the Taoiseach publish full details of the current level of preparedness in the economy and provide much more than just giving numbers in terms of inquiries to State agencies? What is the reality on the ground in terms of preparedness? The Taoiseach will recall that he said last week that it was nothing less than a conspiracy theory to ask about discussions with the European Commission about the Border in a no-deal scenario. He said they were purely at official level and that no advices or instructions were given to officials and that Government had not been briefed on any discussions. Since then, the Commission has come out and said on the record that it had been holding intensive discussions with the Irish Government and that practical matters such as the nature and location of checks had been the core subject of these discussions. It has been confirmed to RTÉ that officials representing the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade have been involved in these discussions and that other intense discussions involving the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are ongoing. I would accept what RTÉ is saying because I think it is well briefed by the Taoiseach's people and has been good and on the button regarding Brexit all along. What was the problem with the Taoiseach accepting that there were ongoing discussions about it? What was the reason for this sense of denial? The Taoiseach took an aggressive approach and cast aspersions on people who were asking very basic questions about what would happen at the Border and what kind of discussions were ongoing in the event of no deal. He was very dismissive and I believe he was wrong in that regard.  I welcome the fact that Jeremy Corbyn has responded so constructively to the British Prime Minister's belated initiative in terms of bringing both leaders together. Regarding the Taoiseach's attempt last week to put Jeremy Corbyn in the same bracket as Viktor Orbán, thankfully, with all the excitement at what was happening in Westminster, I do not think they got to hear that but I think the opportunity for this country is that something sensible emerges from the discussions between the British Prime Minister and the leader of the British Labour Party that could result in a softer Brexit. Jeremy Corbyn could yet be very important in terms of the outcome for this country. 
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	276	I think most people are looking on in disbelief at what is happening in the House of Commons. Politics in the UK is dysfunctional, the UK Government is dysfunctional and the UK Parliament, the mother of parliaments, is dysfunctional. Most people recognise the efforts being made to provide political stability in this country and to ensure that our minority coalition Government, which includes a number of Independents and is facilitated by a confidence and supply agreement with the major Opposition party, has provided the time and space with this enormous challenge confronting us. The Taoiseach met President Macron in Paris yesterday and will meet Chancellor Merkel tomorrow in Dublin. There is a view that both these leaders are taking a strong stand as regards the protection of the Single Market in the event of a no-deal Brexit. This, of course, will have serious consequences for the Good Friday Agreement, efforts to avoid a hard border and our all-island economy generally. What is the position of Chancellor Merkel and President Macron in this regard? Is the big stick being waved and pressure being put on us? I have observed Government long enough to know that sometimes confidentiality is required in respect of Government intentions but this is not such a case. What plans are being put in place for the Border in the event of a crash-out Brexit?  I welcome the decision of Theresa May to finally reach out to the Labour Party in order to resolve the current impasse. I also welcome the fact that the withdrawal agreement is no longer under discussion and that it is taken as given. Regarding the EU summit next Wednesday, what will be the Taoiseach's position concerning any new request by the UK Prime Minister for a further extension to Article 50 - either a short-term or a long-term extension?
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	277	While the latest throw of the dice by Theresa May in reaching out to Jeremy Corbyn is welcome, it provides no certainty that anything conclusive will emerge much less that the withdrawal agreement will be endorsed and, therefore, the backstop will become operational. As others have said, the circus at Westminster is certainly something to behold. The default position of a crash-out Brexit remains. Just because the House of Commons, the mother of parliaments, votes against the notion of a crash out does not mean it will not happen. I was in Brussels earlier this week and had conversations with very many people. It appears to me that some travel more in hope than expectation that this issue will be resolved at Westminster. It is clear we need to be prepared for a no-deal Brexit much as none of us wish that to be the outcome. The Taoiseach has made it clear that he will not support any hardening of the Border on our island and that he will protect the integrity of the Single Market - a position reiterated by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade earlier today. Could the Taoiseach tell me how he will reconcile those two objectives? Can he categorically rule out any hardening of the Border? That includes but is not solely about Border infrastructure.I want him, as the Head of Government, to reassure people across this land, particularly in Border communities North and South, that he categorically will not give way, blink, bow and allow any hardening of the British Border on our island.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	278	Like other Deputies, I, too, welcome the final reach-out beyond the narrow confines of the hard-line Brexiteers in the DUP to a broader consensus in the British Parliament. Had this been done two years ago, I think there would have been a greater likelihood of a successful, clear majority favouring a softer Brexit. I hope to be in a position to meet Jeremy Corbyn on Wednesday with other socialist group leaders in advance of the emergency summit. A lot of positive work has been done by people such as Keir Stamer, Hilary Benn and Tom Watson as well as Jeremy Corbyn up to this point, but these are critical times. Time is running out and we are at the last edge. I wish to ask the Taoiseach about his approach to this now. I am not asking him to have a crystal ball as it is impossible to know exactly what will transpire hour to hour, much less day to day. If Theresa May requests a short extension up to 22 May, without Britain's participation in the coming European elections, what will the Taoiseach do? What will his vote and strong counsel be on this matter? I believe he will be listened to. What is his intention in this regard if that is the request that emerges?

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	280	I want to know whether there was a discussion at the summit meeting on the issue of how to protect the Single Market in the event of the emergence of a difficult Brexit. None of us wants any installations or hardening of the Border, as has been said. Nonetheless, the Minister for Finance advised me the other day that there are a total of 210 Revenue customs and excise staff employed in the Border counties on what are called compliance issues, that is, customs and excise. The Taoiseach must be aware and must have Garda briefing to the effect that there is a significant upsurge of smuggling along the Border. It is a problem for both sides of the Border. There is a real issue for all the Border communities as to how legitimate traders will be protected. Let us be honest; 210 compliance staff and 20 trained detector dog teams are just not going to do it for us. We understand that the Taoiseach must play his cards close to his chest, but Chancellor Merkel will ask him this question tomorrow because it is the Single Market that must be protected. We want to stay in the Single Market and we would like Britain to be in it as that would be a very good outcome that would help us. However, I find the figures of 20 trained sniffer dog teams and 210 compliance staff scary. The Taoiseach promised us on various occasions that 400 staff would be recruited by now. I am not aware that they have been recruited. They are being recruited. Another 200 were to follow. Perhaps the Taoiseach could update us on that.

Will the Taoiseach give an assessment of the risk that such an extension would not be accepted?

I have learned from experience over the past year or so that it can be dangerous to look into the crystal ball and make predictions about the future or to answer hypothetical questions because when it turns out that one cannot predict the future or answer every hypothetical question, one gets attacked for it. This is why I am guarded in answering questions that ask me to predict the future or come with a hypothetical answer to every hypothetical question, and I appreciate the House's understanding of this. A request for an extension will really depend on the nature of the request. I have not had a chance to speak to everyone yet but my general sense across the European Council is that it is open to granting a further extension to the United Kingdom. However, we do not want that further extension to be merely a licence for further indecision. We need a decision from the United Kingdom Government and Parliament. We need a clear plan. An extension in this context is one thing but a rolling extension that just leads to further indecision and further majorities against things but for nothing is not a solution for anyone. There is a real concern that if the UK stays in the European Union beyond the date of the European elections and does not hold European elections, there is a risk the European Parliament will not be properly constituted and that any decisions it makes, whether on legislation, budgets or the appointment of a new Commission and Commission President, may therefore not be valid. This is a real concern that many people hold. There is also growing frustration among the majority of countries that will not be adversely affected by Brexit - a frustration I do not share because Brexit is so important for us and could impact us so severely - that the concentration on Brexit is taking us away from other important issues and matters. This is worrying for us, needless to say. To respond to Deputy Boyd Barrett's questions, I do not wish to comment too much on the internal politics of the UK but I agree with him that Prime Minister May's offer to engage with the leader of the Labour Party, Mr. Corbyn, on Brexit to come to a compromise is timely. I do not know if Mr. Corbyn will rise to the occasion or whether he will show leadership and be able to come up with a compromise plan with Prime Minister May. I hope he does, but we will see if that is what happens in the coming days. Regarding business preparedness, I again encourage any business that has not engaged in this regard to please do so. Many businesses are very prepared for Brexit. Many are not and have not availed of the information or supports available and many are still adopting a wait-and-see approach. I would prefer if businesses operated a precautionary approach and made preparations. Even if no-deal is unlikely, preparations should be made in any case. I confirmed about two weeks ago - if not in the House, certainly in interviews - that preliminary or rough discussions had begun on how we can meet our twin objectives of protecting the Good Friday Agreement, on which the peace in Ireland is based, and protecting the integrity of the Single Market and customs union, on which our economy, economic model and jobs are based. This will be a difficult thing to do. We know that the backstop will work and will ensure we have tariff-free, friction-free, quota-free and bureaucracy-free North-South trade. I do not know for certain whether it is possible to come up with an alternative that does this, other than the UK remaining in the European Union or staying in the Single Market and customs union, but we will do everything we possibly can to avoid the emergence of a hard border on our island. We have the support of our European colleagues on this. We know that some things can be done remotely - the collection of tariffs, for example - and customs duties can be collected as other taxes are collected, either online or through tax offices. We know how to intercept smuggling and we already have a smuggling operation in place in respect of cigarettes, drugs, alcohol, diesel and so on.

This will have to be stepped up, and Deputy Burton is absolutely right about that. We know how to counteract smuggling. Animal checks are much more difficult. They can only possibly be done physically by vets.It is our view that those checks should take place at ports and that the island of Ireland should be treated as a whole when it comes to sanitary and phytosanitary standards, SPS. That would, however, require the co-operation of the UK. All we can do at this stage, without knowing what is going to happen, is explore options. That is what we are doing and it is happening at official rather than Government level. Turning to the question from Deputy Haughey, I was asked about the opinion of Chancellor Merkel and the position of President Macron. It is difficult for me to answer questions like that on behalf of other people. I will have a chance to speak in depth and one on one with Chancellor Merkel when she comes to Dublin tomorrow. We did not have that opportunity in Brussels some weeks ago. I did, however, have the opportunity to spend an hour or so with President Macron yesterday, both one to one and with our teams. I am heartened by the enormous support France continues to demonstrate towards Ireland. As President Macron stated, Ireland will never be abandoned by France or the European Union. If there is a no-deal Brexit, whatever issues arise will be seen as shared problems. Ireland will try to resolve them with our partners like France and the European Commission. It is not a question of there being a big stick or Ireland being put under undue pressure.  Reasonable questions, however, are being asked as to how we will protect the integrity of the Single Market and the customs union. We should not make the mistake of thinking that protecting the integrity of the Single Market or the customs union is just a case of having to follow some awkward European rules or unnecessary regulations. Our jobs and prosperity are based on our economic model and that is based on us being in the eurozone, the Single Market and the customs union. We cannot have that compromised.  I will give a small example, and this is theoretical and hypothetical. If, for example, the UK did a trade deal with the US and that brought hormone-treated beef into the UK or it did a trade deal with another country and that brought in chlorinated chicken or it did a trade deal with an Asian country with environmental or employment standards not up to Europeans standards, those products could enter into Northern Ireland from Britain, through Larne or Belfast, and could cross the Border into the Twenty-six Counties of the Republic of Ireland. There is understandable concern that they could ultimately go on from Dublin or Rosslare into France, Spain or Portugal.

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	295	I welcome this opportunity to raise the important issue of Coláiste Dhún Másc in Portlaoise. I also welcome that the Minister of State is taking this debate today. Coláiste Dhún Másc was established in 2017 and opened two years ago. The school currently has 78 pupils and is housed on an interim basis in what was the old technical school on Railway Street in Portlaoise. The building was renovated by the vocational education committee, which is now Laois and Offaly Education and Training Board, ETB. The building is okay but has some shortcomings, for example, there is very little space around it to use as play areas and no room for expansion. I give great credit to Laois and Offaly ETB, the staff of the college, particularly an príomhoide, Aoife Elster, who has done great work, and An Foras Patrúnachta, which is joint patron along with Laois and Offaly ETB. The school is dhátheangach; it is a bilingual school. There is an Irish stream and an English stream and it is very successful. There are 78 pupils in the school despite the fact it only has first and second year classes at the moment. Pupils from throughout County Laois attend. The school provides second level education for children from all schools, but particularly to those from the three Gaelscoileanna in the county, Gaelscoil Shlí Dála, Gaelscoil Thromaire and Gaelscoil Phortlaoise. It is a huge success story. It also has a stream taught as Béarla, which brings in all pupils. The school has grown beyond anyone's expectation and already has 112 pupils registered for September. I acknowledge that we have three relatively new secondary schools in Portlaoise, with three large schools built in the town in the past 15 years. I acknowledge that because sometimes we complain about what it not happening. There has been a major expansion in second level education, and indeed in primary education, in the county. Investment has been made in education over the past 12 or 13 years. Sometimes when the schools are being built people ask if they will ever be filled, but they are being filled. Demographic information is telling us they are filling up even more quickly. We have run out of space and outgrown the buildings. Portlaoise is a very fast-growing town. These schools are taking pupils from large catchment areas. Coláiste Dhún Másc in particular, because of its Irish stream, is bringing in children from all parts of the county all the way to the outer fringes. It is a great success story but it needs a new site and a new building. Laois and Offaly ETB will ensure the current building does not stand empty. It is a very dynamic organisation which plays a significant role in providing further education in counties Laois and Offaly. It provides a broad range of educational supports and all sorts of courses to help people to train, upskill and get back into work. Coláiste Dhún Másc is located in the old technical school. We must start the process of tying down a site for it so that it can move on and expand.

I am answering on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, but I have heard from people, including Deputy Stanley, about how progressive the school is, how pupils want to go to it and how well it is managed. I have also heard that it has an excellent principal. I acknowledge those facts. Coláiste Dhún Másc opened in September 2017 under the patronage of the Laois and Offaly Education and Training Board, ETB, to serve Portlaoise. In line with the establishment of such new schools generally, it commenced with an intake of first year students and enrolments at the school are continuing to grow. The school is currently located in interim accommodation sourced by the ETB and a building project to deliver permanent accommodation is included in the Department's capital programme. The delivery of the permanent school building for Coláiste Dhún Másc requires the acquisition of a suitable site. In that respect, the Department has been working closely with Laois County Council under the memorandum of understanding on the acquisition of a site. Officials have also been closely engaged with officials in the Laois and Offaly ETB regarding the process. A number of potential site options were identified and comprehensively assessed, with input from officials in the county council and the ETB. The Deputy will appreciate that multiple factors must be considered in respect of potential school sites, including sometimes complex technical issues as well as the suitability. Unfortunately, all the sites initially identified presented challenges in respect of the proposed acquisition or the delivery of school accommodation thereon. A further site option was subsequently identified and was found to present a viable solution for the delivery of accommodation and ancillary facilities for Coláiste Dhún Másc. Negotiations with the landowner in respect of the proposed acquisition of this site are at an advanced stage. The Deputy will appreciate the commercial sensitivities that attach to school site acquisitions generally and in this instance, given the delicate status of the current negotiations, I am not in a position to disclose any further information regarding the proposed location of the school's permanent accommodation. However, I assure the Deputy that departmental officials are working to advance the acquisition of a site for Coláiste Dhún Másc as expeditiously as possible with a view to facilitating the progression of the project to deliver its permanent accommodation into architectural planning at the earliest possible date. The Department will continue to liaise with officials in the Laois and Offaly ETB in order to keep them apprised of the status of the site acquisition process and will inform the ETB and school community of the permanent location for the school as soon as it is possible to do so.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	297	I thank the Minister of State for her reply, which contained some positive news. The key point is that, even after a site has been secured, it will take a considerable time, perhaps more than two years, to go through the various stages of design, planning and construction. The best case scenario will see the school up and running in 2022 or 2023. I will outline the demands on the school. It is a victim of its own success, having grown so quickly from 40 pupils in its first year to more than 200 by September. That is no bad thing. I welcome that the Department is engaging intensively with the county council and the ETB on trying to progress the school. There were difficulties with some of the sites that were identified. It makes sense to try to get the most suitable site, and I welcome that the Department is working to advance the acquisition of a site for Coláiste Dhún Másc and trying to progress the project as quickly as possible. I urge the Minister of State to speak to the Minister, Deputy McHugh, to whom I will also speak, and give him the message that, while we welcome the good news, we need to keep the push on and get a site secured so that the project can move to the design, planning permission and construction stages as quickly as possible. The population growth in the county, in particular the number of baptisms in Portlaoise and its neighbouring parishes, tell us that there will be a large increase in its secondary school population in the next five to ten years.

#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	299	I welcome the opportunity to update the Government and the House on what was termed by the CEO of Bord na Móna last October as the acceleration of decarbonisation. That acceleration has turned into a speed wobble. There is an increasing number of bog closures. The initial announcement referred to 17. Last week, a further four were added to the list. There is an increasing number of redundancies. At the time of the announcement, we were told that the number would be in the region of 400. It is now at 600 plus. There is an increasing impact on local communities and a threat to the future of the co-firing plants at Shannonbridge, Lough Ree and Edenderry. There is no correlation between the income generated by the existing carbon tax, let alone the multiple of four that is being discussed, and any benefit to my county of Offaly and the midlands region more widely, which are suffering the most from the decarbonisation programme. Allied to that, there has been no application by the Government to the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund or the coal regions in transition fund, which was set up last year, as promised. It took a visit to the European Commission by a local councillor in Offaly, Mr. Eamon Dooley, and me to find that out. We sought and welcomed the Government's establishment of the just transition forum, but it lacks the teeth and money it needs to do the work it must. Notwithstanding that, we appreciate its combined efforts with Departments and the training funds of ETBs and Athlone IT, and the role played by local representatives in that process, to upskill, match skills and help. However, I was disappointed to learn last week that discussions had been ongoing between Bord na Móna and the relevant Department on the subvention of biomass. Following the announcement, I was assured at an Oireachtas committee meeting by the CEO of Bord na Móna that, despite the obvious and glaring difficulties that might arise with the post-PSO pricing mechanism at ESB and the lack of incentives for biomass growing in Ireland, let alone imports from South Africa and elsewhere, Bord na Móna had included in its costings these variables, was happy and could give me and others the commitment that co-firing would continue. Alas, I learned last week after inquiring into the reason for the four bog closures that they were feeder bogs for co-firing at the three plants in question. Not only will 50 jobs associated with those bogs be lost, but their closure creates an obvious threat to the power plants themselves. That will have a major knock-on effect for communities.The chief executive officer of Bord na Móna said at the time of the announcement that the company staff get the programme and the need for decarbonisation and the communities in Offaly and beyond recognise the need for transition. They had, however, hoped and would appreciate if it were a just transition. In order for it to be a just transition, the Government must match that effort and commitment with funding and provide real opportunities for alternative forms of employment to be found. That has unfortunately been seriously lacking to date.  I accept that the line Minister cannot be here today and that he will respond in writing in more detail next week. I also appreciate the Minister of State's efforts on this. Nonetheless, I would have thought that, far from waiting on a six-month report from the just transition forum, the Minister would listen to members of Fine Gael and the Government, whatever about listening to me. This is having a severe impact and is akin to the Government sitting on its hands or turning out the lights on Offaly and the midlands and allowing it to drift. The carbon tax is Fianna Fáil policy and I hope it is the policy of this Government and any incoming Government to allow for the ring-fencing of revenue generated by carbon tax to be immediately directed and targeted at areas such as County Offaly which is feeling the impact of the transition.
#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	300	I thank Deputy Cowen for raising this issue, which I am pleased to take on behalf of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton. I will relay his comments and concerns to the Minister. As the Deputy said, he accepts the Minister's apologies for not being here. He is not in the House at the moment and is unable to take the question but he will revert in writing to the Deputy with further information next week. I know Deputy Cowen has already raised some of these issues with the Minister. As set out in the national development plan, the Government intends that, by 2030, peat and coal will no longer have a role in electricity generation in Ireland. This is in line with Ireland’s commitments under the Paris Agreement and the national policy position which sets out a long-term vision of an aggregate reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of at least 80% compared with 1990 levels by 2050 across the electricity generation, built environment and transport sectors. The three electricity generating plants in the midlands have a total generating capacity of 378 MW. Edenderry is a 128 MW plant owned and operated by Bord na Móna and is fuelled with a mix of peat and biomass. Under the Department’s REFIT 3 support scheme, it has support for co-firing with up to 30% biomass up to 2030. Edenderry has planning permission to co-fire with biomass up to 2023. It is Bord na Móna’s intention to operate the plant fully on biomass by 2028 if planning permission beyond 2023 is received. The plants at Lough Ree, a 100 MW plant, and west Offaly, a 150 MW plant, are both owned and operated by the ESB. Both have support under the public service obligation to fuel with peat but this support ends in December this year. Both plants have been granted support under REFIT 3 for co-firing with up to 30% biomass up to 2030. The ESB is in the process of seeking planning permission to co-fire with biomass in the plants at Lough Ree and west Offaly. The ESB is fully committed to this process as part of its strategy to lead decarbonisation in Ireland. As part of this strategy, it is anticipated that both plants will co-fire peat and biomass as soon as planning is obtained with the intention of using only biomass by 2027. Decisions on these applications are likely to be made in the later stages of 2019. An oral hearing has been scheduled for 16 April in relation to the west Offaly plant. Bord na Móna has outlined to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment a revised plan for reducing the amount of peat in the three plants up to 2028 and replacing with biomass. As the rate of biomass co-firing increases, the total biomass requirement in 2029 is expected to be about 2.6 million tonnes. This transition from peat to biomass would increase the amount of renewable electricity on the system and reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions relative to the plants continuing to run with support of 30% biomass. This is based on a number of assumptions, including that all three plants receive planning permission to co-fire peat with biomass up to 2027 or 2028, that all three plants secure additional support to produce additional renewable electricity from biomass and that, by the mid-2020s, additional quantities of indigenous biomass are available. If this plan is implemented, Bord na Móna would complete the transition out of peat production for electricity generation by December 2028, which is two years ahead of the original commitment under its 2016 sustainability 2030 policy to cease use of peat in electricity generation by 2030. Among the recommendations of the all-party Joint Committee on Climate Action in its recent report is that the Government re-evaluate its co-firing subsidy for peat and biomass given environmental concerns identified by the Climate Change Advisory Council and that both Bord na Móna and the ESB re-evaluate their future plans for biomass due to the lack of an indigenous supply. As I mentioned, the support for the use of peat in electricity generation for the two ESB plants ends this year. The support for Edenderry ended in 2015. All three plants referred to have support for up to 30% biomass to 2030. The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is examining the recommendations of the joint committee. In the context of the just transition, where no region will be left behind in the transition to a low-carbon economy, the Minister for Communications, Climate Change and Environment, Deputy Bruton, has recently written to the European Commission requesting the inclusion of the midlands region on the coal regions in transition platform. The main objectives of the platform are to enable multi-stakeholder dialogue on policy frameworks for successful transformation of carbon-intensive regions and to facilitate the development of strategies and projects in areas such as investment for structural transformation, growth and jobs.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	301	I thank the Minister of State for his response and I appreciate that he cannot get into the belly of what I had to say. I expect the Minister to respond more appropriately to what I have said. The Edenderry power plant permission was granted after much deliberation by the courts and it is a blueprint and precedent by which I expect the other two applications for co-fuelling to be successful.  I hope the Government and its representatives respond as soon as practicable on the following matter about which I seek clarity. There is a commitment to co-fuel with biomass until 2028 at which time biomass will be exclusively used. That indicates that harvesting can continue until, let us say, 2026 and the stocks would be sufficient thereafter. I was only made aware at the end of a just transition forum meeting last week that four bogs have been suspended. These are the feeder bogs for the three power plants. That would seem to indicate that the discussions with the Department responsible are not likely to yield the result the plants would have hoped. That threatens the viability of the plants, the jobs within them and the communities they serve. Information about that should be forthcoming to me as soon as possible, hopefully next week, because I want to know the detail of the discussions, what has resulted from them and what now is Government policy if it contradicts what was there previously. That is not even to mention the wide-ranging issues surrounding the greater effect and impact of the ongoing decarbonisation which has, as I said, gone from acceleration to a speed wobble with an almighty crash waiting to happen. Those who will suffer are my constituents and not those from any other part of the country.

I appreciate the Deputy being co-operative about that. I have prepared a concluding statement which does not address the specific issues the Deputy raised. I will ensure the Minister reverts to him and I note the timeline he set out for having details provided to him on the discussions and the steps being taken, particularly on the issue of the bogs. I will ensure the Minister is aware of the Deputy's request to receive that information next week, if possible.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	303	I raise the issue of out-of-hours mental health services in the north west, particularly Sligo. The Minister of State will read a response and tell me there are out-of-hours services in place, junior doctors on call and a junior doctor on back-up call. However, the experience of people in the region, particularly counties Sligo and Leitrim, is very different. I give the example of a constituent of mine who contacted me about his son, a young man who has been using a mental health service for a considerable period. As a result of abuse suffered in his youth, this young man has had mental health episodes for many years and has been in and out of hospital on numerous occasions.His family was a great support to him and was working with him and trying to help him but they were advised by the mental health service to back up a little as it was not good. They were told the mental health service would put a team around him to help him, a social worker would be put in place, which there was, and the primary care unit near his town would come into play and help look after him. The social worker retired and was not replaced. The primary care unit that was supposed to provide mental health services is very ad hoc and on numerous occasions when the man phoned nobody answered and he did not get a call back. On a couple of occasions, his father has helped him, spoken to him about it and gone with him to the mental health services. When a meltdown happens this person is inclined to self-harm, wrecks his whole house and lashes out at everybody around him. He is a danger to himself and others. The service providers told him that if ever he sees a meltdown coming on, he should go to them, that the door would be opened and they would take him in and look after him. He did so less than a week ago but when he arrived at St. Columba's out-of-hours there was nobody there. He sat for two and a half hours before he saw a junior consultant, who spoke to him for approximately half an hour and then told him he was okay to go home. He felt let down by the service and went home as distressed as he was when he arrived. A couple of days later he phoned gardaí and asked them to come and take him away or he would do something terrible. The gardaí had to bring him back into the services. This is one case but there are numerous others, sometimes involving young adolescents and children. They find there are huge holes in the service. With regard to primary care, there is supposed to be a community service for mental health patients. However, that community service is effectively vacant when people look for it, certainly in the Sligo and Leitrim region. When people arrive out-of-hours at St. Columba's in Sligo nobody is there to help. This is a reality for many people. While there may be a junior consultant on call, that same person is also on call in Sligo University Hospital up the road and may be dealing with people there and not able to leave. I want the Minister of State to find out about this. When this happens there is supposed to be a back-up junior registrar on call. How often has that person been called in? I have been told that person has never been called in. People have waited for hours with nobody to see them in very distressing and disturbing circumstances. This is a serious problem that needs to be dealt with. If people are continually turned away from the service, the next time we speak will be to discuss a tragedy after someone has been turned away from the service. We do not want this to happen. I certainly do not want it and the Minister of State and the Government, who are responsible for the situation, certainly do not want it.
#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	304	I thank the Deputy for raising the issue of mental health services in his area. As he knows, this is a priority. It is not just about money. Money will not solve the problems in the service but €105 million has been provided in new development funding over the next three years, very specifically to extend mental health services to a seven-day week. This is our first priority. Sligo Leitrim mental health services provide a broad range of mental health services to the populations of Sligo, Leitrim, south Donegal and west Cavan. Services provided encompass general adult psychiatry, psychiatry of old age, rehabilitation and recovery, mental health of intellectual disability and child and adolescent mental health services. Services are provided directly in the community and in clinical and residential settings. Sligo Leitrim mental health services operate a seven days a week, out-of-hours service based in the primary care centre in Ballymote. This provides acute mental health treatment and support to individuals from the hours of 9 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. seven days a week. The services also provide a rehabilitation and recovery service that includes home-based treatment and assertive outreach models of care to clients known to the mental health services. These are also co-located in the Ballymote primary care centre and operate from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week. In addition, our emergency departments provide national coverage through a 24-7 service from which members of the public receive acute mental health care and treatment. In Sligo, the emergency department of Sligo University Hospital provides this out-of-hours service. I acknowledge the case raised by the Deputy. I will not comment on a specific case and I know the Deputy is not asking me to do so but is using it as an illustration. He will understand and appreciate, therefore, that I cannot respond. However, I will say that I recognise and acknowledge that one of the greatest causes of distress for parents and other family members is to be with somebody who has, as the Deputy described, a meltdown or an episode of psychosis. Having to deal with this is very traumatic. The reality is that the out-of-hours service available at 1 a.m. or 2 a.m. is based in the emergency department of the local hospital. The Deputy referred to somebody being turned away from the service. This is something I will not be able to comment on or deal with because it is a clinical decision made by a medical person and I am not here to judge the decision made by a qualified medical practitioner. To give the Deputy some idea of the thinking on this, the challenge we will have far into the future, and what I am trying to do in this area, is to provide for online psychiatry. We will never be able to staff a 24-hour, seven days a week service led by a consultant psychiatrist in every county. It will never be possible and that is the reality. There is a real shortage of consultant psychiatrists worldwide. We will look at how we provide that cover a bit better. The worst place for anybody to be having an episode of psychosis or a meltdown is inside in an emergency department while waiting for two or three hours to be seen by a consultant psychiatrist. What they do in other parts of the world is deal with this through online psychiatry, whereby people can be assessed by a consultant psychiatrist immediately through online televisual conferencing. People can be assessed, diagnosed, prescribed and admitted, if necessary, there and then by wheeling up a cart similar to a blood pressure or BP cart, turning on a screen and having a psychiatric consultation. We will never be in a position of having a consultant psychiatrist sitting in Sligo waiting for the one presentation that might occur in a 24-hour period. Today, I looked at the figures for another part of the country and the number of presentations in a busy city area. There were 14 out-of-hours presentations there in the entire year. We have to look at how we do what we do, and the plan I am trying to develop is having available online psychiatry. It works throughout the world and would cover a number of different sites and provide immediate access to that key decision capacity. It would be done in an emergency department with doctors and nurses but the consultant psychiatrist providing the clinical governance would cover a number of different sites with online availability. This is my hope for the future.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	305	I thank the Minister of State. I acknowledge that nobody expects there to be somebody there every minute of the day but, at the same time, the level of difficulty that people come across in these situations is acute. The Minister of State mentioned the out-of-hours service in Ballymote. Much of the time that service consists of one member of staff who is alone in the building and very often feels vulnerable. The out-of-hours service is far from perfect in this respect. I know we cannot comment on an individual case but many of the reasons a person is turned away is because the beds are all full. There are no beds and no space or capacity. That is certainly a real situation. I know a new mental health unit is being built in Sligo but this is certainly the problem in St. Columba's at the moment and the main reason people are being turned away. The Minister of State mentioned the recruitment of staff. Does the recruitment of staff for mental health services go through the national recruitment service? The Minister of State nodded his head to indicate that it does. The amount of time it is taking is absolutely outrageous. When the mental health service in Sligo and Leitrim decides to recruit someone and advertises, the first problem is that an advertisement can be made for only one person per day in the service nationally, for some peculiar reason that nobody seems to be getting a hold of. That is ridiculous. When the service does advertise, it can take up to six months to recruit the person. It is diabolical that we are standing over this situation. There is no reason for it other than that somebody somewhere decided to draw up a set of rules by which everybody has to live, as if it is the reality of life. It is not the reality of life. The Minister of State has put out the concept that people will be able to have online consultation. When will this happen? If he is saying this is the answer he is putting forward, I will not be sceptical. I will embrace it and ask to see it. When can it happen? If the Minister of State is saying this can happen, surely there should be no reason we have to wait one year, two years or five years for somebody to write a report or a consultant to do a report on it. It should happen immediately. The Minister of State should at least tell us there will be a pilot and that it will be in the Sligo and Leitrim area. Will he give that commitment today?
#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	306	I acknowledge the Deputy's bona fides in this area. I have had many conversations with him on the subject of mental health. I have always found him to be very responsive and responsible in his approach. He does not take a narrow view but, rather, seeks to serve the greater good. I share some of his frustrations regarding the national recruitment service and trying to see how it works. I recently invited the executive clinical directors in the area of mental health from across the country, including the Deputy's CHO area, to a meeting. I wrote to them afterwards and asked them to give me examples of the difficulties they were having with recruitment and their experiences of the current recruitment process within the HSE. I am going through their responses, which I received in the past week or ten days. I have sought a meeting with the national recruitment service to better understand its work. We often pass on blame in a kind of circular way, but one must follow the chain each way. I want to hear the side of the national recruitment service. I am aware of the frustrations being expressed, as is the Deputy, particularly in the area of mental health, and I am following the chain to see if I can address some of the blockages, difficulties and challenges in the area of recruitment. The Deputy asked a specific question about the pilot. I thank him for embracing it. We must embrace change. It is easy to be sceptical and knock everything but if we do what we always did, we will get the response we have always got and that is not good enough. I recently convened a meeting in the national convention centre and explained to the attendees from across the country the concept of online psychiatry. The clinical staff believe in it and accept that it is the way forward and will complement the existing mental healthcare provision. They are up for the challenge. The HSE is currently rolling out several pilot schemes around the country in the area of delivering mental healthcare online, including psychology and psychiatry. That is how we will address the gaps in the system. Rather than psychiatrists spending three hours travelling to see a patient, they will be able to spend that time online treating multiple patients.

#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	309	I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, for coming to the Chamber to provide a reply on this matter. I acknowledge that it is not his area of responsibility and that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, is not available this afternoon, although he has previously dealt with this issue in the Topical Issue debate. I refer to the issue of safety along the N5 national primary route. The road crosses the Longford border at Termonbarry and continues across County Roscommon and through Ballaghaderreen. A bypass from outside Ballaghaderreen to Scramogue Cross, which is in my parish on the eastern side of Roscommon, is being progressed. I will try to point out to the Minister of State the dangers posed to people going about their everyday business in the villages and towns along the road. This issue affects parents bringing their children to school, people alighting at halls and older people going to daycare centres. Every day, they are faced with a significant volume of traffic. There has been a big increase in the population of Termonbarry in recent years. Many houses have been built and many people live in the area. It is probably one of the fastest growing areas in the county. However, very few new traffic control measures have been put in place in the village. Scramogue Cross is a well known point in County Roscommon. A regional road cuts through it and there have been several accidents there through the years. Strokestown has not been bypassed and a significant amount of business comes to the town as a result. However, there are now two major housing estates on the Tulsk road on the edge of the town. On numerous occasions in recent weeks, lorries have almost hit cars going into or coming out of those estates. There have been families in those cars. People live in fear of such situations. In Tulsk village, a major regional road cuts through the national primary route. There was a serious accident at that junction only the other evening and I raised it with the Minister yesterday. There are similar issues in places such as Bellanagare village and Frenchpark. There is a danger to people going about their business in locations along that national primary route. Through the possibly 40 years since the N5 was built, significantly more than 30 people have lost their lives on it. If that had occurred in any other part of the country, there would be a significant outcry. I am here to plead with the Minister of State to bring back a message to the Minister, Deputy Ross, that something must be done in the short term. In his reply, the Minister of State will refer to the bypass and how it is progressing. It will not be in place for a significant number of years - three, four or possibly more. If something is not urgently done in the meantime, there will be loss of life. There are measures that can be taken and which will not cost the Government or Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, a lot of money. A measure that has worked on other parts of the route is a roadside sign on which a driver's speed flashes up. That is one of the best ways of controlling traffic and the signs are working very well across the country. I want the Minister to spend an hour travelling the road with me, as he previously promised to do. Immediate contact should be made with TII such that within the next week or two it looks at what can be done in the short term. An example of an issue that could easily be addressed is the lack of a double continuous white line on the Tulsk road in Strokestown. Many large trucks go through the town and onto that road. It is a threat to people's lives. I ask that the Minister of State, please, bring this message back to the Minister and immediately request that TII carry out an assessment of that issue without further delay.

Under the Roads Acts 1993-2015, the planning, design and operation of individual roads is a matter for the relevant road authority in the case of local and regional roads and for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned, in the case of national roads. Within the overall context of Project Ireland 2040, the national development plan has been developed by Government to underpin the successful implementation of the new national planning framework. This provides the strategic and financial framework for TII's national roads programme for the period from 2018 to 2027. In the ten years covered by the plan, more than €11 billion will be invested in the overall road network. Ireland has just under 100,000 km of road in its network and the maintenance and improvement of national, regional and local roads places a substantial financial burden on local authorities and the Exchequer. As a result of the national financial position, there were very large reductions in Exchequer funding available for roads expenditure after the financial crisis. The Building on Recovery capital plan 2016 to 2021 and the capital plan review allocation mark a significant step forward in terms of restoring funding to the levels needed to maintain the road network in a steady state condition and allow for investment in road improvement schemes. Within the capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter in the first instance for TII in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act. In this regard, TII has progressed a project which runs from Ballaghaderreen to Scramogue. It comprises a proposed road development of 33.4 km consisting of an offline type 1 single carriageway road that runs south east from the tie-in point of the existing Ballaghaderreen bypass to east of Strokestown at Scramogue. An additional 13 km of side roads and existing road improvements, 17 at-grade T-junctions and five roundabouts will be provided as part of the scheme. The proposed route will bypass the towns or villages of Frenchpark, Bellanagare, Tulsk and Strokestown. Roscommon County Council submitted the scheme to An Bord Pleanála in December 2017. An oral hearing into the scheme was held in October 2018 and An Bord Pleanála confirmed the scheme on 18 January 2019. The expected benefits of the project are a reduction in journey times between Ballaghaderreen and Scramoge by approximately ten minutes, improved road safety for all road users and a reduction in accidents, improved environments at Frenchpark, Bellanagare, Tulsk and Strokestown as a result of the removal of through traffic from these towns and villages along the existing N5 route, and the supporting of the economic performance of counties Mayo and Roscommon through the provision of improved transport infrastructure. Following approval from An Bord Pleanála, TII intends to progress this project by moving to detailed design stage.

I am not blaming him for it. It is correct but - excuse the pun - we have to go down a different road here. The road in question is very dangerous. I will not point out, bit by bit, what I have already pointed out; suffice it to say I acknowledge some safety works have already been carried out and have worked remarkably well. At the point of entry to Strokestown, for example, we got flashing lights after a big campaign. They have almost totally prevented accidents of the kind that were happening there on a weekly or twice-weekly basis. The same was the case in Rathcroghan, a very historic place of which I am sure the Minister of State is aware. Again, we used flashing lights. There was a constant stream of accidents but the lights almost totally prevented them. I welcome and acknowledge what has been done. I am making a special plea today to get the Government to take on board the needs of the other areas. We cannot wait for the bypass. If we do not do something in the meantime, there will be carnage. There are so many near misses and so many people have been injured. Many have been killed over the years on the route from Termonbarry to Ballaghaderreen. I make a very special appeal to the Minister of State to bring my message very strongly back to the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, and TII. I am willing to work with them. I spoke to our senior engineer, Mr. Eugene Dwyer, in Roscommon County Council yesterday. He agreed with me and is concerned about areas. He agreed additional signage and flashing lights comprise the proper approach. I am looking for something to be done in the short term. It will not cost a lot. I plead with the Minister of State to take really seriously what I am saying in the interest of public safety.

In addition to the current safety programmes and major schemes, TII operates a programme of minor works, including safety improvement works. The safety section of TII carries out assessments of the network under the HD15 programme. It identifies clusters and areas prone to accidents. Under the HD17 programme, which operates under a European directive, there are route assessments. Works identified under these programmes are identified by the local authorities and they may attract funding once a feasibility report is submitted to the safety section of TII. Perhaps the Deputy will go back to the engineer and ask whether the local authority has submitted an application to TII for minor works. That has worked for me in Wexford on a number of occasions. I understand the Deputy's concerns, however. There is light at the end of the tunnel. We could be in a worse position, with the bypass not progressing. At least, progress is being made at a steady pace and the authorities are moving to the detailed design stage. I understand the Deputy's frustration because the project will take a number of years. There are steps that can be taken, such as speed vans, but drivers need to be cautious. I will relay the issues the Deputy has highlighted to the Minister.

Last week, figures released by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government indicated there are currently 3,784 children living in emergency accommodation. Temple Street Children's University Hospital reported that 842 homeless children presented to their emergency department in 2018. The single largest population experiencing homelessness comprises children. The current homelessness crisis has been discussed on a number of occasions in this House. I am seeking to highlight and address one specific aspect that has got no coverage and on which there has been no policy whatsoever, namely, the impact on young people's education. I acknowledge the presence in the Visitors Gallery and the work on this issue of representatives of Children's Rights Alliance, the INTO and Early Childhood Ireland. Children's Rights Alliance produced a report called Home Works and held a very informative briefing in the Houses yesterday. The key issue, which I have raised previously with the Minister during Question Time, is that there is no stand-alone Government policy to cater for the educational needs of children who are homeless or living in emergency accommodation. By contrast with the Department of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, who has adopted some policies to deal with homelessness, the Department of Education and Skills has made no such move. The additional needs of children who are homeless or living in emergency accommodation are not mentioned in the action plan for education nor in the Statement of Strategy 2019-2021 of the Department of Education and Skills. In addition to those who are recorded as living in emergency accommodation or homeless, there are many who are displaced temporarily to relatives' houses or other rental properties far away from the school setting. The education of this cohort is also affected adversely by the housing crisis. The Department needs to address this urgently. It does not seem to be a priority for it or the Minister. The Home Works report, produced by the Children's Rights Alliance, outlined many of the problems and proposed some solutions that are in some cases easy for the Department to implement. The report was published last July and I raised it with the Minister in November, I believe, but there seems to be no urgency. This is not a problem limited to certain areas or certain groups although it is fair to state there is a greater problem in the larger urban areas. There are children experiencing homelessness in 27% of primary schools. Schools in and beside my constituency can state the problems straightaway. In one case a child who was not in emergency accommodation moved temporarily to Dublin but forms would have had to have been filled in at the school in Dublin related to the special educational needs of the child and the extra supports. The same had to happen when the child returned to the original school after the housing problem had ended in the local area. There are schools doing tremendous voluntary work, probably confidentially, to assist families whose children are homeless or living in emergency accommodation. Teachers and principals across the country are doing their best to provide additional supports for children and families that are needed in very difficult circumstances. Relying on the ad hoc efforts of individuals is not good enough, however. What is required is a joined-up, targeted strategy from the Department of Education and Skills. Fianna Fáil believes the Department of Education and Skills must take an active role in ensuring that the education of children experiencing homelessness is impacted as little as possible. Every child in the State has a constitutional right to primary education and it is up to the State to provide it. It has to provide it to children who are homeless or living in emergency accommodation in the same way it does to every other child. Children experiencing homelessness face considerable disruption to their lives. Many have already experienced losing the family home, relationship break-up, financial stress, or simply an increase in rent. They now face a whole host of new challenges that put their right and entitlement to an education at risk. It thereby puts their life prospects at risk. This is indicated by the statistics. The finding of the Home Works report was that pupils experiencing homelessness have been shown to present with a number of visible mental health issues, including high levels of anxiety, self-stigma and embarrassment and low levels of self-esteem, which ultimately affects their ability to socialise in school and maintain friendships. It is worse if they have to move school or travel from afar. Homelessness can affect children's school attendance. We heard yesterday at the briefing that parents living in emergency accommodation have to choose which child they can send to school on a given day. In such cases, children often miss school because the accommodation is so far away. They may be late for school for the same reason.When I raised this with the Minister previously, he said the Department was focused on the additional supports provided under the DEIS programme. While it is correct that there are additional supports in DEIS schools, the problem is that the criteria for DEIS do not accurately capture this group of children. Houses in the private rental sector are not always found in areas that would be described as DEIS areas. The biggest problem here arises when people are evicted from their private rental homes. Specific targeted measures need to be put in place. The Department must actively track the children who need to be provided with additional supports. Teachers and staff who work in schools must be provided with training, advice and support on how to help children through this extremely difficult time. Funding should be made available to help children who need hot meals when this is not available in their schools. Parents who cannot afford back to school costs or who need additional home supports should be assisted. Parents have described challenges in providing school lunches while living in emergency accommodation. Such challenges are all too obvious. July provision exists to provide additional supports to children with learning disabilities. It is recognised that additional costs are associated with the provision of education in these circumstances. Nevertheless, such provision is necessary. The motion before the House asks the Minister to consider whether July provision might be necessary for children who are experiencing significant gaps in their education. The proposals that have been made by the Children's Rights Alliance have been available to the Department for the past eight months. The costs associated with them are relatively small. The first thing we are seeking is for a policy to be put in place so that someone in the Department will grab this issue and examine it. It needs to be studied so that supports can be put in place. It is simply not acceptable that at a time when the fundamental constitutional rights of children are under threat, no action is being taken. The price of failure here, in terms of education, is very high. The price of doing something is very low.
#FionaOLoughlin	unknown-#FionaOLoughlin-party	unknown-#FionaOLoughlin-dob	unknown-#FionaOLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	314	The future of society depends on our ability to foster the healthy development of the next generation. The motion before the House seeks to highlight the effects of toxic stress on children as they make their way through the education system. Toxic stress has been described by academics in many universities when they have looked at the impact of stress on children. There can be no greater stress than when a child and his or her family is made homeless. We were all shocked when we heard the new figures that came out last week. It can be extrapolated from those figures that almost 4,000 children are homeless. Many of them are in the greater Dublin area. Interestingly, we heard at a presentation yesterday that the percentage increase is actually higher outside of Dublin. I think homelessness has increased by 11.5 times outside Dublin. When we think about these children and the households, we are struck by their negative experiences. When a child loses his or her home, it is absolutely awful because he or she loses his or her primary source of support. Families can lose their houses for many reasons. If they were renting privately, they may have been evicted. Family homes can be lost in circumstances involving domestic violence or family breakup. The reason does not matter because people in homelessness suffer on many levels. We are looking at how we can help to support children. There are 150 homeless people in County Kildare at the moment. Last year, I met a number of families with children who were sitting State examinations and heard about the crises they were facing. Families suffer when they are unable to give their children security, routine, predictability and the ability to develop friendships. In such circumstances, the school often has to take over to a certain extent. It is sometimes the only safe place where a child can enjoy the routine he or she may have been used to. Being homeless affects every aspect of a child's education, including his or her behaviour, attendance, educational attainment and social response. The lack of cooking facilities in emergency homeless accommodation can mean that children do not get proper breakfasts and are unable to bring proper lunches to school. Schools have not received one element of communication or correspondence to explain how they should deal with such issues. It is absolutely at crisis point. Teachers and schools are trying to do their very best to support these children. They absolutely need that support. A cross-departmental approach, involving extra funding for non-DEIS schools and home school liaison, is needed. As many of these children are in non-DEIS schools, they are not getting the support of a teacher to help them to deal with their problems. These children have been failed by society on many levels. Our teachers and schools want to do the right thing. The parents of these children want to do the right thing. It is up to us to provide them with the supports they need. I commend the motion.

I commend my colleagues who have introduced it. I particularly commend Deputy Thomas Byrne on his work over the years to highlight the impact of child homelessness on education. The work of the Children's Rights Alliance has been significant. It has produced a very good report and very good recommendations. There is no excuse for not seeking to implement all those recommendations as a matter of the utmost urgency. This motion seeks to establish a ring-fenced €5 million fund to provide additional things needed by homeless children when they are attending school. The money in question would be used for things like hot meals, clothing, books, psychological assessments and extracurricular activities. I suggest it is a modest amount, given the amount of money that is available to the Government. I know there are always competing priorities. When I think about the 1916 Proclamation, I am reminded that we are supposed to cherish "all the children of the nation equally". In that context, there can be no bigger priority than the 3,784 children who are currently homeless. The cost of addressing this would equate to €1,320 per child, if we look at it like that. I ask the Minister to petition the Department immediately, or to divert other funds as a matter of the utmost urgency to find the €5 million that is needed as an initial amount. If more money is available, the Minister should acquire it. While I appreciate that the Minister, Deputy McHugh, is the Minister for Education and Skills, it is appropriate in the context of this motion that I raise housing issues with him too. We are engaged in an awful lot of superficial activity on the housing side. There is an awful lot of talk and an awful lot of commentary. There is an extreme lack of tangible action like the creation of supply, which means building. Our system of local authority house building is rife with duplication. We are telling experts in local authorities around the country that they can give private developers planning for 1,000 houses. When it comes to building ten houses in a place like Burtonport, Sligo, Roscommon or Collooney, we have to contend with an administrative merry-go-round of bureaucracy, which turns what the Government sees as a 59-week period for building houses into a six-year period in some instances. I fully support our efforts to meet our obligations to refugees. It is great that we can take our place in the international forum in bringing people to this country and giving them homes, but how is it that we are able to do that overnight? There is new centre in Moville, which is in the Minister's constituency. There is another new centre in Roscommon to cater for Syrians who badly need homes. I appreciate and support that, but why can we not do it for the 3,784 children who are homeless in our own country? I commend the motion. I ask the Minister to embrace the age-old principle that talk is cheap. It is time for tangible action. We have proposed some very workable solutions this afternoon.

No child deserves to be homeless. It behoves us to help in any way we can any poor child who finds himself or herself in homelessness. I am convinced that the field of education is an area in which we can work to ensure these children do not suffer any further disadvantage. It is a sad indictment of the Government that a motion of this nature needs to be brought to the floor of the Dáil. Even though six housing plans have been published, almost 4,000 children are living in emergency accommodation. I am sure this does not even reflect the true figure. The right to education is enshrined in the Constitution. This is the least any child deserves. The lack of a safe and comfortable place to call home is an obvious distraction to a child's ability to learn. This motion aims to address the matter in the absence of a credible housing plan. A family of two adults and two children presented to my office last week. Their current home is a hotel bedroom. They have had to tolerate excessive noise late at night while enduring the cramped environs of a one-bedroom living facility. The parents advised me that their eight year old child is becoming really anxious and is falling behind dramatically in school. They are struggling to provide their children with fresh and nutritious school lunches because the lack of facilities means they have an over-reliance on convenience food. I am also helping a mother who has a special needs child. She chose the location where she currently resides because she does not drive. She wants her child to have the best start in life, given the intellectual needs of the child.She has received notice from her landlord. With no empty houses in the locality, she will be required to move a distance away and make the long journey to and from school each day. What chance does a child have when the most basic of starts is not afforded to them? Being homeless presents enough adverse challenges, not to mind having the education process impeded also. I call on the Minister to support this motion.
#FrankORourke	unknown-#FrankORourke-party	unknown-#FrankORourke-dob	unknown-#FrankORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	317	I welcome the opportunity to speak this afternoon on this Private Members' motion brought before the House by my colleague, Deputy Thomas Byrne. I commend him on the work he has done in this area and in the general education portfolio. Education is a significant issue for children, both in mainstream and special educational needs schools, who become homeless. Those who require learning supports are already vulnerable. When they become homeless, it becomes more critical. Children in such circumstances tend to have to travel long journeys to school as their emergency accommodation tends to be far from where their school is based. Travelling back and forth can have a significant impact on them. Some families in such circumstances may not have the resources to travel these long journeys and they try to get their children into schools close to their emergency accommodation. However, this is not always possible. Schools can be at full capacity and extra spaces may not be available. In some cases, the families go without and this has major consequences for the children and family unit. Students in emergency accommodation have issues when trying to do their homework or study for State examinations because their families often live in one or two small rooms. This places them at a major disadvantage in developing and progressing in educational circles. Children with learning difficulties or challenges which are categorised in some cases as special needs are at a more significant disadvantage because it is difficult for a school to put the necessary resources in place. A school must also have them approved by the Department but this can be difficult if the child is not attending the school for a long time. I know of children who were attending school in Kilcock, their family was put into emergency accommodation in Portlaoise but they were offered a home in Athy. That is the kind of problem with which we are dealing. It is how one develops a mechanism of dealing with that logistical problem. Schools applying for extra resources for children with special needs must go through an assessment and then make an application to the Department. Getting approval can be a protracted process in any event. The environment of emergency accommodation is negative for children and impacts on their education. More resources need to be put in place to assist families and children who find themselves homeless and in emergency accommodation. This will in turn assist in solving the issues raised by this motion.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	318	I dtús báire, ba mhaith liom mo fháilte a ghabháil as an seans páirt a ghlacadh sa díospóireacht thábhachtach anocht, díospóireacht fadúda na daoine óga atá faoi bhrú, na tuismitheoirí uilig atá faoi bhrú agus na teaghlaigh éagsúla atá faoi bhrú fosta. Is léir go bhfuil míbhuntáistí agus deacrachtaí ann agus táim tiomanta chuig an gcothromas a bheith ag achan duine ag iarraidh cuidiú agus deiseanna fáchoinne na daoine óga go háirithe. Chomh maith leis sin, is é mo bharúil ná go mbeidh níos mó obair de dhíth leis an gcomhoibriú agus leis an gcomhpháirtíocht trasna na Ranna Rialtais. Sa Teach seo, tá dualgas orainn uilig agus tá freagracht orainn uilig as an réiteach a fháil. Tiocfaimid le chéile agus sin an fáth gur ghlac mé leis an motion seo. I thank Fianna Fáil for tabling this important and complex motion. The Government has decided it will accept it but I will clarify some of the issues raised within it. I accept it on the basis that this is a complex issue and much more work is needed on the co-ordination between Departments. While some of the work has already started, we must remain vigilant in this regard. We owe that to the young people and to their families struggling with this problem because education is what is left when everything else is forgotten. Under the Government's Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, a significant number of initiatives continue to be implemented to address the range of complex issues in the housing sector arising from the economic downturn. Tackling homelessness remains a key priority for the Government. As the delivery and supply of much needed homes continues to ramp up, further emergency accommodation has been added to the system, including additional emergency beds and family hubs. The focus is on preventing as many families and individuals as possible from becoming homeless, while exiting those experiencing homelessness from emergency accommodation as quickly as possible. Budget 2019 contained an allocation of €146 million for the provision of homeless accommodation and related services by local authorities. This is an increase of over 25% on the 2018 allocation. This funding will ensure that local authorities can provide the best possible supports to those individuals and families experiencing homelessness until they can be supported to move into homes. The Government fully recognises the importance of an inclusive education system for all, a system which embraces all children equally, equips them with the skills necessary to live the best life possible, to contribute to society and to reach their full potential. I am aware that homelessness among families with schoolgoing children can impact on school attendance, participation and retention. I am committed to providing an education system which breaks down barriers for children to allow them to participate fully in education. I am also committed to a system which gives them every opportunity not only to attend school but to have every opportunity to nurture their talents and bring out the very best in them. I tried to capture this with an Irish word we used in our three-year action plan, "cumasú", access and full potential through empowerment. I fully recognise the constitutional right of every child to attend school. I acknowledge the teachers and principals in the schools dealing with this every day. The Private Members’ motion contains several accurate statements about the effects of homelessness on children in the education context, particularly the fact the school can be the constant in their lives which can offer a place of security, friendship, support and familiarity, while, equally importantly, allowing them to continue their education. I acknowledge the research carried out by the Children’s Rights Alliance, CRA, in this regard. However, I also have several issues with the motion. It suggests that the Government has no policy to cater for the educational needs of children who are homeless or living in emergency accommodation. It also suggests that neither the Action Plan for Education nor my Department’s statement of strategy 2019 to 2021 deal with this issue. This is not correct. The statement of strategy specifically references that my Department works with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to support a co-ordinated approach to homelessness as part of the homeless inter-agency group. One of the goals of the statement of strategy is to advance the progress of learners at risk of educational disadvantage to support them to achieve their potential. This includes all children at risk of educational disadvantage, including those experiencing homelessness without labelling children unnecessarily.The action plan for education 2019 sets out that innovative approaches to improving the outcomes for learners at greatest risk of educational disadvantage will be explored. Again, this includes all children. I mentioned co-ordination. There is co-ordination but we can do more and do better. We can look at new ways of doing things. We are open to suggestion. The Private Members' motion also proposes that the homelessness inter-agency group should be expanded to include representatives from my Department. Late last year, my Department was invited to participate on this group and is now represented there. As part of this group, and in other settings, my officials have been working with officials from other Departments and agencies to address the challenges. The motion also proposes ring-fenced funding for schools in order to provide for the needs of children experiencing homelessness through the academic year. The needs of children experiencing homelessness are many which is why the Government’s response to the current situation involves a co-ordinated approach across all Departments and agencies. A significant amount of supports are provided across a range of Departments and agencies.  Delivering Equality of Opportunities in Schools, DEIS, provides additional supports. The approach is premised on the rationale that additional resources and supports allocated to schools are based on the level of concentrated disadvantage. I fully recognise that some children experiencing homelessness may not attend DEIS schools. However, the support services provided by the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, and supports from Tusla educational welfare officers are available to all schools. The motion calls on the Government to develop appropriate professional development training for teachers. NEPS psychologists are available to provide advice and guidance to principals and teachers in relation to individual students’ needs. My Department has introduced programmes for initial teacher education. The motion also calls on the Government to explore whether the July education programme might be expanded. The July provision scheme was specifically introduced to provide for students with autism spectrum disorders. We are reviewing the programme to see if it can be expanded. I will keep the House updated on that. Summer programmes are available to children who are homeless through school completion and other mechanisms. I am also happy to explore new ways of doing this. All Tusla educational welfare services are aware of the challenges faced by families experiencing homelessness. The educational welfare services work with schools to put supports in place to assist these families. Educational welfare officers also assist homeless families to access school places close to their temporary accommodation if the family request this. The school meals programme operated by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection provides funding towards the provision of food to some 1,580 schools and organisations benefiting 250,000 children at a total cost of €57.6 million in 2019. The objective of the scheme is to provide regular, nutritious food to children who are unable, due to lack of good quality food, to take full advantage of the education provided to them. I am sure that the House recognises the considerable suite of supports in place to support children experiencing homelessness in an educational context. That does not, in any way, diminish the very significant challenges faced by families and children who find themselves homeless. We know that emergency accommodation is simply that and can never be a substitute for a permanent home. As a Government, we are doing everything we can to improve housing supply while providing immediate-term supports for families. I thank the Members for raising these issues. Their doing so has provided me with an opportunity to outline to the House the Government’s commitment to ensuring that children faced with educational disadvantage, including those children who are experiencing homelessness, are provided with every opportunity to participate in and flourish within the education system. We must continue to keep this matter live on the agenda. I thank Deputy Thomas Byrne and his colleagues for raising it this evening.

The motion calls on the Government to immediately collect information on the prevalence of children experiencing homelessness who do not have additional supports provided by the Department of Education and Skills and also calls for the establishment of a €5 million initial ring-fenced fund for schools to provide for the needs of children experiencing homelessness. It asks the Government to examine whether the July education programme could be extended to children who have experienced significant disruption to their education as a result of homelessness. The July programme applies to children with autism but at every available opportunity, I like to call for it to be extended to all children with additional needs. Sinn Féin supports its extension to children experiencing homelessness as it will provide them with some pattern and regularity in their lives. Many children living in emergency accommodation will say that school is the one consistent thing on which they can rely. Sinn Féin agrees that it is outrageous that there is no Government policy to cater for the educational needs of children who are homeless or living in emergency accommodation. Their needs are not mentioned in either the Action Plan for Education or the Department of Education and Skills statement of strategy 2019-2021. We also agree that many children experiencing homelessness do not attend DEIS schools and, therefore, do not have access to the same level of supports provided to students in those schools. Responding to criticism of its inaction regarding the impacts of homelessness on children’s education, the Department of Education and Skills has stated that a range of resources are available to "support schools in dealing with identified additional educational needs, including needs which may arise for children who are experiencing homelessness". It has stated that this includes NEPS, which works through a problem solving and solution-oriented consultative approach in order to support schools to meet the needs of individual pupils. The Department also stated:DEIS also provides additional supports to schools from disadvantaged communities. Schools use these additional resources to meet the identified needs of their pupil cohort, including the additional needs that may arise for pupils experiencing homelessness.This is not good enough. We all know the reality of hardships struggles and challenges that children are currently facing and the Government has no co-ordinated strategy to tackle this. Meanwhile, with each day that passes, a child’s quality of education is being impacted upon. Children living in temporary accommodation have to travel great distances just to arrive at school. The impact that this has, particularly on small, young children or if it goes on for a long period, is obvious. They are exhausted before the day even starts. We are damaging children’s futures by taking away their chances at a decent education. Almost 4,000 children and young people in Ireland are homeless and living in emergency accommodation. Neither the Department of Education and Skills nor the State Examination Commission know how many children who are homeless will be sitting State exams this summer. This is because, in the main, candidates are entered for the junior cycle and leaving certificate examinations by their schools and the State Examination Commission has no information on the their residential status. No one is formally tracking these children and there is no specialised policy on their education needs in school. Despite the provisions the Department of Education and Skills indicates that it has in place, many teachers still feel under pressure and ill-equipped to support homeless students. The overwhelming majority of homeless families and children are either living in family hubs or rooms in commercial hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation. In many cases, indeed probably in most cases, these hotels would have no cooking or cleaning facilities or suitable areas in which to study. Some of the hubs have study rooms or places which are suitable for that, but not all do and there are none in any of the commercial hotels. Students who are homeless may end up with significantly lower exam results than usual as a result of their accommodation situation. Transportation is a major issue, particularly in rural areas. In Kilkenny, for example, there is one main hotel which provides emergency accommodation. It is located in Kilkenny city, which makes it difficult for those who live outside the city. It can also influence whether children are able to attend school at all. There are many issues which we need to tackle.  A survey carried out by the Irish Primary Principals Network found that the top three challenges for children who are either homeless or living in direct provision are anxiety, family issues and neglect. Homeless students face issues ranging from a lack of confidence, bullying, being singled out and losing friends as a result of their circumstances. These issues coincide with the stress students are under when it comes to exam preparations. Aside from providing teachers with better resources and wraparound support to assist homeless students, it seems a vital aspect of helping those who are undertaking exams is providing them with suitable study spaces and accommodation. Over the past two years, the Government has begun to move away from hotel accommodation towards the family hub model. However, we cannot normalise homelessness through the use of these hubs. We only need to look at direct provision and how that temporary solution has evolved. Schools must be able to draw on additional financial supports to provide for the needs of students experiencing homelessness such as school books, uniforms and transport and schools must be able to provide meals, homework clubs and supervised study for these students. The Minister touched on the school completion programme, which is one of the best programmes that we have. It obviously needs to be expanded and resourced better. The programme had its budgets cut during the recessionary years and it has never had that restored. The work that they do for the small money that they get is incredible. Rather than cutting back on that programme, the Minister needs to expand it. I always think there is an argument for that programme going back into the Department of Education and Skills rather than being under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. While we support this important motion, we do not want a situation where we normalise homelessness. Obviously, the crucial solution to all of this is to provide people with homes, long-term housing solutions and rent security, and building more local authority housing and providing more options for first-time buyers. I merely make the point that we obviously need supports for people, particularly students who are homeless, but we do not want to get into a situation where we are nearly talking about it as if it is a normal phenomenon. Sinn Féin supports the motion.
#PatBuckley	unknown-#PatBuckley-party	unknown-#PatBuckley-dob	unknown-#PatBuckley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	324	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Private Members' motion. I commend Fianna Fáil on bringing it forward. I like the title of the Minister's speech, which is "Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world." I suppose that is true. How ironic that it is a quote from Nelson Mandela. I welcome that the Minister stated he was "committed to providing an education system that breaks down barriers for children". Breaking down barriers and thinking outside the box is something we must do because the circumstances are different now than what they were ten or 20 years ago. My colleague, Deputy Funchion, covered many issues but I want to look at the impact on families of emergency accommodation, be it hubs, hotel rooms or bed and breakfast accommodation, from a mental health perspective. It is well documented that children who experience homelessness show high levels of mental health issues. One of the significant ones that comes through my office week in, week out is that of parents, but also children, with severe high anxiety. When one is in a tight-knit little hub or room and there is a lot of friction in the family, the parents, many of whom have jobs but just cannot afford the crazy rents, are fighting. The children see this and the anxiety levels go up and up. There is also an issue with stigma. We spoke about stigma within the mental health system, but the stigma of being homeless is soul-destroying. This is especially so for young teenagers, I suppose, because they are more clued in when they are going to school. The embarrassment of not bringing friends home starts social isolation. What happens is that children who live in emergency accommodation isolate themselves. This leads to another issue where they lose their social interaction skills, turn into loners and break their own self-esteem down. The knock-on effect of that, because one is still stuck in a small room, is that the parents see the exact same thing. Some of the Members spoke a while ago about supports. We also must support the teachers 100% financially. Nobody expects to get anything for nothing: the way the country is now one would have to earn a disease now, one does not get it for free anymore. We also must properly resource training programmes for teachers. The onus is not only on teachers. The onus is on the community itself because, as I said, there is a horrible stigma attached to homelessness - there has always been a stigma attached to mental health. The Minister also mentioned in his opening comments specific to Dublin that some, through the initiative of the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, could be entitled to free public transport. I would like to flag that need in rural areas. I guarantee that, although this is only April, we will be in here probably at the end August raising with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport that children cannot even get on school buses in rural areas. It is merely another matter the Minister needs to flag. I am conscious of the considerable impact, not only in classrooms, in schools and in the community, but on the individual, if we keep supporting and implementing policies that are damaging to the housing crisis. We have that currently. We have the national emergencies and the scandals in housing. Even though we support the motion, I reiterate it is Fianna Fáil that is keeping Fine Gael in power here and Deputy Thomas Byrne cannot talk out of both sides of his mouth. While we support the motion, let us be real and say that if we want to do something positive, let us do it and not talk about it.
#AnneRabbitte	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-party	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-dob	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	325	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak and Deputy Thomas Byrne for bringing forward this motion. I welcome that the Minister stated he accepts this motion and he is not objecting to it. I also compliment the work the Children's Rights Alliance has put into it, and particularly Dr. Geraldine Scanlon and Ms Gráinne McKenna who compiled this report. Before Christmas, myself and Deputies Darragh O'Brien and Thomas Byrne met the Children's Rights Alliance and I am delighted it has come here this evening for this debate. Yesterday, in the audio-visual room, they brought home the impacts on the families and on the children. When one goes into it, one hears of families getting up at 5.30 a.m. to ensure that they wake their children so that they catch the bus, and the children are falling asleep en route to school. There is shame and stigma, as other Deputies have said, attached to it. Sometimes they do not disclose to teachers what they are undertaking and what their hardship is because they do not want people to know and they do not want to reach out. I believe that if one has a mechanism of gathering that information, one can support such children who are coming in where the shame is removed from it. At our meeting before Christmas, Deputy Darragh O'Brien spoke about a school in his area where there were a number of homeless families and where they help in providing the lunch box. Different classes bring in a spare lunch. Nobody knows who is providing the lunch or who that lunch is for, but it ensures that every child in the classroom will have a lunch. Some families do not have the opportunity to prepare. They do not have the funds to have a nutritionally balanced lunch with a piece of fruit, protein and carbohydrates, which we teach them all about. This motion is to ensure the gathering of data so that we can support such families. The extension of the July provision to such children that we speak about in the motion is correct because these children are so exhausted they are losing out on education. I do not know how one could bring it about or how one would make it work, but they are missing out. It will impact them when they head into junior cycle or leaving certificate. It might not impact them at that particular point in time but if people continue in emergency accommodation for longer than six months, it has an impact. What of these children's right to education in the long term? They are in the position not of their own making. We should look at how we could support them. The best way we can support them is by providing the enhanced additional educational needs to ensure they can achieve in their junior certificate or leaving certificate so that they have a prosperous future.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	326	On behalf of the Labour Party, I support this motion. The factual information in the motion is self-evident in many of the schools in my constituency. Almost every school has had one or more of the families whose children attend experiencing homelessness, some for short periods of time. Some, for instance, experienced homelessness due to a disastrous fire in an apartment block almost two years ago. People experience homelessness for a variety of different circumstances. Some have come to Ireland as immigrants from other countries and they are simply not in or able to get into the housing system.Teachers in the schools have been doing their level best to support and empower such children and it is a really important contribution by teachers. If a message of hopelessness is conveyed to children, it would cause even further problems, as well as a loss of self-worth, for the children. That may be the instinct of people at times out of kindness but if we can find a way to create better lives for children while they are in homelessness, we would do them some service. The Government should put an absolute limit on the amount of time that a child can spend in homelessness. There is much data, for example, around people who become unemployed when young and particularly young men. All the international data show that this impact carries on not just into their 20s and 30s but into their 40s and 50s, and it often triggers other problems. The parallel data on children experiencing homelessness indicates that children worry about themselves and why they do not have a place to do their homework. They worry about why their mum and dad are either fighting, upset or depressed when they do not have a home. I have seen it in children staying in hotels, whom I have met from time to time, that they almost become like small adults, looking out for the parents who they love. People were very shocked by yesterday's shooting in Riversdale in my constituency of Dublin West. That was at a secondary school and the education and training board was able to immediately put in a fantastic set of supports. Approximately seven weeks ago, at the primary school at the other side of Corduff, there were two 20-year-olds on the street with guns. They did not shoot or kill anybody, which was a miracle. I was in the school and other schools in the area subsequently and the level of fear was palpable. Unfortunately, those schools have from time to time had experience of children whose families have not been able to get a proper home. The schools in the area have a counselling service through the school retention programme but Tusla and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, cannot say if it will continue. That is the reason I was there. This counselling service has a counsellor coming to the school, so if children want to talk to the counsellor because mammy and daddy do not have a house and are worried, for example, they can do it. The school principal can direct that action. However, the Minister and this Government cannot give an assurance that the service will continue. I raised the matter this morning with the Taoiseach and in fairness to him, he said he will look into it. These are big primary schools with large populations. They have 600 or 700 children. As the Minister knows from his visit to the schools in Tyrrelstown, most of the schools in Dublin West are big primary schools and much bigger than most of the primary schools in much of Donegal. This service is provided by Tusla and the school retention programme. There could be an addition to the Fianna Fáil motion by looking at the school retention programme. There could be a structure around the proposed €5 million funding that partly involves Tusla and school breakfast clubs, which are a fantastic initiative. Children can go there early in the mornings and not only do they get food but, more important, they get a social space where they can sit and chat to other children, teachers and the people making breakfast. It is such a happy place where children can go. I am sure the Minister has probably seen several school breakfast clubs but these are really important structures that help children. Will the Minister speak to his colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, and tell her not to let Tusla cut the supports that are so important to children affected by issues like homelessness? With an available counselling service, school principals can direct counsellor availability to children in particular. In one school, there are three children affected by homelessness because of a disastrous fire in the area. The school, including its parents' council and all its structures, reached out in a very caring and confidential way to help those affected families while alternative and permanent accommodation was found for them. The other person that the Minister should perhaps arrange to meet is somebody I knew when I was a child in school. All the schools I attended are DEIS schools so I know what I am talking about. The Minister should meet Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy as she knows more than anybody else the impact of families living in bed and breakfasts or in a transient situation. She would certainly be able to direct the Minister to much of the current research on the impact on families and children. A number of the proposals in the motion are very good. The Minister will be going to the teacher conferences in the next couple of weeks and he could put a programme together to meet people like home school liaison teachers. They are often the first people in the school, along with the principal or deputy principal, to deal with these matters. There is also the matter of teenagers who experience homelessness. Unfortunately, relationships in families may be very chaotic. If possible, the Government should move to supporting grandparents or other relatives who may be willing to give care or just be there for families. The homelessness problem is growing in Dublin. I have seen the figures but in Dublin, for example, much of the extra accommodation taking up the building industry's time is aimed at students. We saw reports the other day that most student accommodation is being offered at approximately €250 per week so very few Irish students are able to afford it. This is absorbing a vast amount of building capacity and, unfortunately, very little of it is available for people who need permanent homes. It is something this Government must address.

#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	328	The fact we are having such a discussion on education provision for homeless children is a sign of the crisis we have in our society. The discussion has moved on from preventing homelessness because of the Government's inability to do it. It has moved to ensuring the children who are homeless have the least affected experience as possible. It is utterly scandalous. Over Christmas I was contacted by a teacher in the constituency of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, who told me about a boy in his class. This boy had to have an operation, with eight teeth and a cyst removed. He needed somewhere to rest, recuperate and recover, according to the doctor's advice. Every day the boy turned up to school despite being unable to concentrate or pay attention. He had no choice because both he and his mother were living in emergency accommodation; there was a different bed and breakfast or hotel every day and they were turfed out every morning. He had no choice but to turn up to school, where he was utterly incapable of performing or achieving the required recovery. That is a result of the policies of this Government.How can he receive an education and recover in those circumstances when they were unable even to get the very basic access to a homeless hub, which would have at least meant that he had somewhere to rest and recuperate? The Government is responsible for that, not just in the Minister's own constituency but around the country with almost 4,000 children now homeless. The consequences are devastating for children like that boy but also in the long run in terms of the mental and physical impact on their health. Decades into the future, society will pay a price for the crisis that has been created. When one talks to homeless families, one of the first things they will always say is how they are managing with their children. Often the tale is one of trekking across the city in the case of Dublin to bring their children to this school, that school or a couple of schools and getting up very early in the morning. There are tales of not being able to prepare food and wash clothes and the impact of all of that in terms of their children being tired and hungry and sometimes not being able to access clean uniforms. I thought some of the quotes in the excellent study by the Children's Rights Alliance were very striking and very similar to the stories that come to me and, I am sure, to others. One person said:I could survive and not eat in the morning. I would not eat in the afternoon and wait for evening. I could manoeuvre that but children, they have to eat and even if they eat, they're still saying "I'm hungry". I can't pay for a bus when he has to eat and we can only walk so far. Sometimes when there's no money in my hand, I'm like "we really have to walk right now, you know" He's an understanding boy because he could see the situation and we had to walk. They had said to me about him constantly trying to go to sleep at the table in school and then getting frustrated and then not listening to what the teachers were saying.We hear story after story like that. The Government recognised this problem and promised to fix it. In 2016, it said no children would be staying in bed and breakfasts or hotels by July 2017. In fact, the situation has got worse. The response of the Minister last week or the week before regarding this contradiction between the promise made by the Government and the reality was not to promise to try harder but to withdraw the promise. It was to say that it was irresponsible to promise to end homelessness and that homelessness will always be with us. It is utterly shameful. The answer is simple. It involves rejecting the logic of the market, which makes people homeless; proper rent controls; and investment in public housing. The one light we have seen in the past week or so is the victory of those who organised together to resist evictions in Leeside in Cork. It shows that if people get organised and fight, they can win victories. It is an inspiration to the people in Exchange Hall. There are many children among this group who are facing mass eviction in Tallaght. It gives them inspiration to get organised and have protests this weekend but they should not have to do this because the Government should be passing legislation to prevent any evictions into homelessness.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	329	It is utterly shameful that we even have to discuss providing supports for homeless children. The Children First guidelines define the abuse of children as involving the systematic neglect of their needs. By any standard, the State and the Government are responsible for the abuse of children. It is an abuse for any child to have to live in emergency homeless accommodation with all that goes with it. Before discussing the contents of this motion, the first commitment should be to eradicate child homelessness so we do not even have to discuss the supports that are necessary. I urge everybody who is enraged by this phenomenon to get out on the streets for the Raise the Roof demonstration on 18 May because this must be the defining issue of the forthcoming elections. We must use this election to put a bomb under this Government in terms of its failure to deal with this outrageous and shameful scandal. I was talking to a friend who is a geneticist carrying out academic research on the impact of deprivation and homelessness on children. He put it to me in very simple terms. Deprivation, poverty and homelessness literally - biologically - get under someone's skin. A person is marked biologically for the rest of his or her life by these experiences in a way that is irreparable. The damage done to someone's mental and physical health will never be fully undone. It can be remediated somewhat by supports and a person's environment and situation subsequently but there is still trauma, physical damage to that person's body and vulnerability to disease and the development of his or her brain at every level is affected. Every day a child spends in emergency accommodation is doing permanent irreparable damage.  Most schools are discussing the homeless crisis currently. What is it like for a child sitting in the class when it is being discussed as some sociological phenomenon while the child is living in that situation and when he or she cannot bring his or her friends back home for sleepovers and so on? It is appalling and totally unnecessary when we have thousands of empty homes around the country and when people are making sickening and obscene profits from speculating on property, hoarding land, sitting on empty buildings and trying to evict people and we fail to address it because we are worried it will impact on the so-called market. The consequence is irreparable damage to children. In a way, I am reluctant even to normalise this by talking about putting these supports in place but having said that, we have no choice. Obviously, to some extent, school is a place where that can be done so I support the measures Fianna Fáil has put forward in this motion. I would add another one involving transport. There is a significant problem with people being put in emergency hubs that are miles away. I have a number of cases, some of which I have raised here. In fairness to the Minister's office, particular cases have been dealt with but it should never have got to this point. Many other cases are not dealt with. They involve parents having to drive from Wicklow to bring their children to three different schools, sit in the car all day waiting for their children and then bring them back down to Wicklow without being given any support for the transport. It is unbelievable. These things must be addressed and real and targeted supports have to be provided for children we have failed who are suffering as a result of this Government's policies but, most importantly, we must eradicate this problem immediately. Otherwise, we will be guilty of the same sort of crimes that we now condemn such as the Magdalen laundries and the industrial schools and let us not forget the people in direct provision or children coming out of residential care who are homeless. The State is failing people in the most terrible way and we need to act quickly to resolve that.

Tá sé dearfach go bhfuilimid go léir ar an leathanach céanna mar bhí mé ag éisteacht leis an díospóireacht ó mo oifig. Gabhaim aitheantas chuig Fianna Fáil agus chuig an Teachta go bhfuil an deis seo againn inniu. I acknowledge the teaching and ancillary staff, the home-school liaison, the guidance counsellors and the principals who support their students - not only those coming from bed and breakfasts, hubs and hotels but all pupils who present with a wide range of issues regardless of whether those issues are anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, a tendency to act out violently, pregnancy, self-harm and addiction along with those with special needs, Traveller children who have difficulties and those children living with parents in addiction or in prison. They are issues that in the past would be more associated with second-level schools but are now presenting at primary level. That is the reality for many of our schools. Staff must deal with very significant pressures in the middle of a changing educational environment where there are more demands relating to governance not only for principals but also for staff. They involve paperwork, policies, plans and the constant revision of policies not to mention the extent of the circulars that come from the Department. This, of course, is particularly difficult for teaching principals. So there is no doubt that as the motion suggests, there are particular issues for children coming from emergency accommodation. We know they cannot bring a friend over. There are no sleepovers and there is no personal space for homework. Sometimes there are difficulties in travel from the accommodation to the school. Parents do not want to change the school. There are difficulties with attendance and most importantly with nutrition because we know the lack of real cooking facilities means an over-reliance on takeaways and fast food leading to further increases in childhood obesity.Then there is the difficulty these children face in keeping up with sports and extracurricular activities. We know that the more stable the background, the more progress in education. I acknowledge the extra supports many schools have put in place for these children. I know from my constituency, Dublin Central, that the after-school clubs, the homework clubs and the youth clubs are also providing support. While it is very important to look at the needs of those who are vulnerable and in emergency accommodation, we cannot forget about the needs of those children coming into school from very unsuitable accommodation and overcrowded accommodation, from homes where the parents have problems with addiction or are in prison. I wish to mention the specific needs of children in the north inner city whose lives have been affected by the feud. Again, it is the schools and the clubs that are picking up the pieces and providing the supports. There are some very practical and modest steps in this Private Members' motion to ease the burden of living in emergency accommodation: a small amount for additional services; the July education programme; and more resources for home school liaison. Again, my experience of home school liaison from the north inner city is the phenomenal amount of work the officers do. They also work with foreign national children, whose parents in many cases do not speak English and are trying to navigate their way through bureaucracy. Equally, there is the work of the guidance counsellor. I have already mentioned circulars. I see that one of the recommendations is for another circular to be sent to the schools, but I think the schools themselves could write that circular from their own experience of working with children coming from emergency accommodation and unsuitable accommodation. I do not want to forget any child who is coming into school from such poor accommodation because that is also having a massive impact. I wish to mention another issue facing schools. I chair a school board of management and I was taken aback at the most recent board meeting to have received a letter from the National Council For Special Education. It went through the various options currently available: mainstream schooling with additional supports; placement in a special class within a mainstream school with a reduced pupil-teacher ratio; or a special school setting. The letter included details on special classes, and I acknowledge the genuine tone of the letter in referring to ensuring "a continuum of educational provision" for children with special educational needs. The letter asked the board to consider establishing one or more special classes in our school. The next paragraph stated that when a special class is sanctioned, the school may be eligible for enhanced capitation, specialist staff training may be available and students may be able to avail of the school transport system. There is a need to replace the word "may" with that of "shall". The letter outlined other arrangements. In this case, unless I am going to be given a massive grant to put another floor on the school, there is no way we can take on extra classes. There are practical and logical steps to make the burden of living in emergency accommodation less detrimental. It is important that we have the statistics in this regard and that we know exactly where the needs are in order that resources are directed there. Ultimately, however, it is about resolving the housing problem because then we would not have this issue.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	331	This is a very important motion. Yesterday, Ms Tanya Ward, chief executive of the Children's Rights Alliance, and Ms Gráinne McKenna, an assistant professor at DCU, presented some of the findings of their report, Home Works: A Study on the Educational Needs of Children Experiencing Homelessness and Living in Emergency Accommodation. Reference was made to the 4,000 children who are homeless. The study reflects the issue we all know of and deal with week in and week out when we meet families with homeless children. We find echoes of the impact homelessness is having on the children's lives and their schooling when they sit in front of us and we see the anguish and disappointment on their faces. Deputy Boyd Barrett eloquently outlined earlier the disastrous impacts of homelessness on children. It is more than four years since I brought this issue to the attention of the Ombudsman for Children, and over the past three years I have constantly raised it with the Minister, Deputy Zappone. It cannot go unsaid that we cannot accept a situation in which homeless children are a permanent feature of the Irish education system or Irish society. That would be a total outrage. While this hapless Government tries to come to grips with the matter, the aims of the motion before us are very valuable. Homework support grew out of the fact that teachers were noticing students arriving to school hungry and with difficulties in getting all their school gear and so on together on the way in. There is no guidance whatsoever available to schools when families or students tell them they are homeless. Principals and teachers have been doing their best in very difficult circumstances but are left looking for support and information themselves. During research for the paper we heard yesterday, teachers told of how they sometimes brought in snacks to school for children and of children who started crying when putting on their coats because they were not going home, or at least not going to a forever home like the vast bulk of our children, but were going to a hotel or a family hub or whatever. In many cases, as the Minister knows from her constituents, children have to trek across the city, facing very early starts to get to school for 9 a.m. and then another big trek home. This is a totally unacceptable situation. It is extraordinary we have allowed this to develop in our country over the past decade. It is an appalling, shameful thing. It is not the children who should be embarrassed; it is we who should be embarrassed as a Dáil that has not brought this to an end. The motion includes a very simple group of recommendations: a €5 million ring-fenced fund for schools; guidelines and recommendations to be sent to boards of management urgently; and representatives of the Department and the education system to be included in the Rebuilding Ireland action plan as we try to bring this horrible situation to an end. The Children's Rights Alliance particularly stressed the need for a small budget for schools to help deal with the needs of students experiencing homelessness; a teacher to be allocated to act as a support, just like a home school liaison officer; and the whole area of guidance. The motion before us has sought to address these matters. We support the motion and the reasonable request from Government, but it is appalling that we have allowed this situation to come to pass, that we have broken through the 10,000 barrier and that we are not taking urgent emergency steps to bring this whole situation to an end in order that our teachers, whose first priority, obviously, is the education of our young people, do not also have to deal with the suffering of children who are homeless.

I compliment Deputy Thomas Byrne and his colleagues on bringing it forward. We speak about the chaos in the United Kingdom Parliament as a national embarrassment to its politics, but the issue of child homelessness is equally a national embarrassment for this Parliament and the Government in particular. That is, if the Government could be embarrassed. I am of the view that it is past being embarrassed. It has not a morsel of shame. We simply cannot imagine the sense of disorientation children experience when they go through the trauma of finding themselves in emergency accommodation. I ask the House to just think about this. Any of us who has ever gone on holidays with our kids knows that after a day in a hotel they are frustrated and annoyed and want to get back to the familiar surroundings of a home, and they on holidays. I know very well one family who found themselves in this appalling situation an bhliain seo caite. Their nine year old deaf son was so affected that his speech development regressed by almost two years during about 12 or 14 weeks. This is the blackguarding and the neglect that the Government is wilfully perpetrating on young people. We are here talking about the educational needs of children in homelessness. How much worse is it for children who already have special educational needs and who, even if they had a home, still often cannot access speech and language therapy or other services, an issue we raise here every second day of the week? The entire system of meeting the educational needs of children in crisis is badly broken. As I said this morning to the Taoiseach, it is beyond broken. I spoke today during Leaders' Questions about Tipperary, a big county 117 miles in length. The Minister has often told me she used to visit the Cahir meat factory in her younger days. There is not a single senior registrar for the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, in the whole of County Tipperary. Is rud uafásach é sin. It is a scandal. There is not one CAMHS speech and language therapist for the whole of south Tipperary - níl aon duine ann. I welcome this motion and commend those who have brought it before the House.I wonder what difference it is going to make and what notice the Minister, or the Government, is going to take of it.  The Government is incapable of being embarrassed anymore. It is brushing these issues off and ignoring Opposition motions, even those that have the support of the majority in the House. We saw that with the motion calling for the abolition of the JobPath programme some weeks ago. It was the same with the motion on post offices. That was unanimously accepted, even by the Taoiseach. The Government will ignore that at its peril. This is even worse. Young, sick, vulnerable children are being expected to live in hotel rooms. It is an outrage. History will not be kind to the Minister or the Government on this issue. 
#MichaelCollins2016	unknown-#MichaelCollins2016-party	unknown-#MichaelCollins2016-dob	unknown-#MichaelCollins2016-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	334	Homelessness is a real and serious problem in Ireland. There are 3,784 children now living in emergency accommodation. This Government does not have any policy in place to cater for the educational needs of children who are homeless or living in emergency accommodation. In addition, the needs of these homeless children are not even mentioned in the action plan for education nor in the Department of Education and Skills statement of strategy which covers the period from 2019-2021. It really is heads in the sand time with this Government. This Government is letting down the education system in Ireland right across the board. I was contacted last year by many schools in my constituency in west Cork. The totally inadequate number of release days to teaching principals was highlighted to me, as well as the lack of regard for their mental and physical health given the increasingly unrealistic and unimaginable workload. I highlighted these concerns to the Minister. Today, however, we still have a situation where our young teachers are emigrating to other countries for better terms and more stability. All these factors affect our children in the education system.  The main concern when one talks to any teacher is always that of their students. I am on a school board of management. I know the struggles schools are going through daily. We have excellent young teaching principals in west Cork. I do not see them staying in their posts, however. They are working into the night to deal with the heavy workload they are being left with by a Government that is not even looking into the situation. This Government needs to accept that having a fully working educational system requires all of the cogs to be working together.  We saw major delays last year in processing the back to school clothing and footwear allowance. This placed serious additional pressure on families already struggling with limited incomes. My office is inundated every year with constituents having to fight to get places for their children on a school bus. All this is unacceptable. Parents have enough stress and worry already without adding all these unnecessary burdens. The closest school rule is a scandal in its own right and has been allowed continue by this House year after year.  I see many parents now fighting with Bus Éireann to try to get their child to school. Those parents are being told the school their children are going to is not the closest school. Measurements are being taken in areas where the bus never travels. That is being done to win the case and it might involve only 0.5 km or even just a few metres. In one case, a mistake was made where the route was measured through a farmyard. Any possible way is being used to cut the parent out from getting the right to have their child taken to school. The Minister of State is going to have to wake up to the problems out there. She will have to sit down with the people who might be able to create solutions. I would appreciate if she would at least do that for people.

I also thank the Minister of State sincerely for coming to County Kerry last week and for going to Ardfert national school. Her visit was very well received. There was delight that she took time out of her schedule to go there. She was most welcome. Any time she might want to come back to Kerry and she has a bit of good news that she might bring with her, we will welcome her with open arms. There is no pressure but do not come empty-handed. This is a most sincere and terribly important motion. I have dealt, as everyone else has, with families who have had terrible difficulty in getting their children to school because of homelessness and the disruption that causes in lives. The upset of not having a proper home, or a place that can be called a permanent home, creates much strife and upset. Schooling can fall to one side and that is why every possible measure has to be put in place to ensure stability for our young students. I say that because children and young people are at an important formative stage in their lives from six up to 12 or 13 years old. They need stability, routine, and the security of knowing their teachers and not being sent from Billy to Jack. Our teachers are willing and care about the students who come to them. All they want to do is help those students. It is up to us, as politicians, however, to make sure we put in place the measures, the funding and the requirements needed. It is bad enough if young people are suffering from uncertainty as to where their home is. We want to ensure that education will continue for students in that situation. That is crucially important and cannot be emphasised enough.  I turn to the structure of our schools and in particular our national schools. As Deputy Collins stated, many of boards of management are struggling trying to fundraise. Teachers and boards of management should be able to concentrate on education. Those people are not meant to be financial gurus. They are not supposed to have to be out having race nights, golfing classics and nights at the dogs to raise funds. That is not their job. Their job is to teach and educate people. They never signed up to be some sort of funding experts. It is not an election they are trying to fund. They are trying to educate young people. I feel very strongly about that. It seems to be the trend that schools are not getting enough from the Department and so they have to fundraise themselves. That is terribly unfair and it is putting an unfair burden on people. I thank Deputy Byrne again for bringing this motion before the House.

#JohnBrassil	unknown-#JohnBrassil-party	unknown-#JohnBrassil-dob	unknown-#JohnBrassil-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	337	I also want to commend Deputy Thomas Byrne on bringing forward what is a most relevant and timely motion given more than 3,500 children are experiencing homelessness. Despite reassurances from the Government that it has plans in place to deal with this, I see no sign of the situation abating in the short term or medium term, unfortunately. The first priority for any child unfortunate enough to enter homelessness is to keep him or her in the same school to continue his or her education. It would be necessary, first of all, to try to place the family in temporary accommodation to allow that to happen. The Minister's reply stated there is interaction between his Department and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. I suggest that needs to go further. There should be direct interaction with each homeless unit in each local authority. The people in those units know the exact situation on the ground. They also know the most suitable accommodation that would facilitate the child remaining in the school he or she is already going to. I ask the Minister to extend that interaction with each local authority to try to ensure the child is kept in the same school. The school would then be a place providing some level of happiness and security to the child while he or she is experiencing the very unfortunate situation of homelessness.  Other funding supports are also needed. I refer to education and nutritional supports. Those are critical. Bed and breakfast accommodation and hotels are not ideal places to provide the correct type of nutrition for a child. They could, however, receive properly nutritious food in an educational setting and that would be very helpful. Psychological and well-being supports are also very much needed. As mentioned by previous speakers, the extension of the July education provision for those experiencing learning difficulties and autism are other practical measures that could be taken on board to help those unfortunate children having to transition to and deal with homelessness. The school would be then, at least, a place of happiness and security while they are getting back into a secure environment.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	338	Like many people, I get quite traumatised talking about this issue. It is an appalling failure of our system. Without bashing anybody, I want to impress on Government that 3,800 children are homeless. It is shameful and unacceptable. If we, as Parliament and as politicians, are not able to solve this problem, one would wonder what is our role. Another aspect of this concerns me greatly. There is a certain resignation in society that this is the way it has to be. That is very sad. Can one imagine the trauma of a child this evening coming from school to a hotel room tonight? Can one imagine the trauma of a parent or parents dealing with that situation? Can one imagine the trauma of children who are not able to go to school in a normal and natural way and who hide from their friends the fact that they have no home and no roof over their heads? As we speak in this Chamber this evening, almost 4,000 children are in that situation. It traumatises me to the extent that I often wake up at night and think of my own two children, one of whom is now a young adult and one a teenager. I shudder to think about them being in that situation. I compare them with those people who I know are in this very traumatic situation.  The scars of homeless on our young people never go away. I assure the Minister of State of that. As has been already mentioned, this is now a nationwide problem; it is no longer urbanised. The fear and trauma it brings into people's lives is shocking. It raises the question, is our Constitution ruptured? What happened to "cherishing all the children of the nation equally"? Where has that gone? It does not mean anything any more because, especially in respect of homelessness, we definitely do not cherish all the children of the nation equally. Deputy Thomas Byrne has been very much to the fore with outstanding ideas in respect of education matters over a number a years. In this document he mentions specific issues that could be dealt with. This issue is traumatic and sad. As a nation and a people, we cannot become resigned to the fact that this is the way it is going to be. It is not. We must make dramatic changes.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	339	Figures released by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government last week indicated that there are currently 3,784 children living in emergency accommodation. There is no apparent Government policy to cater for the educational needs of children who are homeless or living in emergency accommodation. Regardless of where a child is living, he or she needs the security of education - whether primary or secondary - in familiar surroundings with his or her friends. The Department of Education and Skills does not collect information on children in education who are experiencing homelessness nor does it have in place a specific strategy to support such children in this extremely challenging situation. Children experiencing homelessness face massive disruption to their lives. Many have already experienced their family losing a home. Some may have experienced a relationship break-up or financial stress in the household. As a result, children's capacity for learning and ability to develop and retain relationships is negatively impacted. The challenges many families face when trying to remain positive and confident about their children's education when homeless and living in emergency accommodation, perhaps in a hub or hotel room, are absolutely immense. For many children, school is one of the only areas of stability in their lives.  I recently dealt with a young family who unfortunately became homeless in Dungarvan due to their rented accommodation becoming unavailable to them. The family of two adults and two children had to present to Waterford City and County Council in Waterford city as this is the only place in the county where homeless services are dealt with. They were subsequently accommodated in Waterford city on a temporary basis. The children, aged three and five, were enrolled in school in Dungarvan, which is an hour's travel from Waterford city by bus. As their accommodation was a short-term solution, the parents believed it was best to continue to bring their children to school in Dungarvan. Every day for six weeks, these young children undertook the two-hour return journey. While the children were in school the parents, one of whom had a disability, had to wait in Dungarvan until they finished school, each at a different time. Thankfully the family is now living back in Dungarvan, where their housing needs are met.  What struck me most about these parents was that, had it not been the case that the dad had free travel due to a disability, they would not have been able to afford the bus fares from Waterford to Dungarvan and back five days a week. That was the problem. Perhaps this is something the Minister of State could bring up with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. The family was lucky from the point of view that they had free travel which enabled them to keep the children in the security of their education. They also knew that their housing situation was going to last only a short length of time. This is not the case for all families. The fact that they would not have been able to afford this travel was the one issue this mother asked me to raise. I know that is not a matter only for the Department of Education and Skills, but for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. The cost of transport to maintain continuity of schooling for people who have to move outside their normal locations is an issue which certainly needs to be given consideration. We are all in agreement that continuity of schooling is very important for all children, regardless of where they live.
#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	340	I thank Deputy Thomas Byrne for tabling this motion and I thank the Deputies who have spoken from the heart very much. I will preface my remarks by saying that I have 31 years' experience as a primary school teacher and principal. It is a tragedy that any child should be homeless and that any children going to school should have the burden of not having a safe roof over their heads. I want to thank a particular group of people - the battalion of teachers and school communities right across the country that help these children. These children are traumatised. Deputies have used all of the words of which I could think. They are burdened and upset. They do not have security and stability. They are not coming from a secure home and do not know that they can go home in the evening and enjoy a roof over their heads. I hear exactly what the Deputies are saying. I have been taking notes since I entered the Chamber and I will bring back these points to the Department of Education and Skills. Work is being carried out in the Department to support the teachers and children. I take the point that more needs to be done. We need more houses and we need to get roofs over these people's heads or we will be here again in the future talking about other children who are homeless. To my very core, I believe that children's education is transformative and that nothing should interrupt it. Deputy Michael Healy-Rae mentioned that I had visited Ardfert national school. It was such a beautiful environment. The children were happy and confident in themselves. They were able to sing and they were delighted with their world, including their school world. They were able to compete for a Digital School of Distinction award. I would say that most of them had none of the worries of the children about whom we are talking today.The education system is for every child regardless of background, economic status or, as in this case, living conditions. A child's right to attend school is enshrined in the Constitution. The Government recognises the importance of an inclusive and all-embracing education situation. Never is it more important than in the case of children experiencing homelessness or living in emergency accommodation. School is their constant, their stable environment, the place where they learn the skills to cope with their situations, progress educationally, meet friends and be just children. The Department of Education and Skills and the Government as a whole fully recognise the barriers facing children from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds, including those experiencing homelessness. We have put in place various targeted measures to assist families and children in such circumstances. The Department provides DEIS schools with a suite of resources to support the inclusion of disadvantaged children in the education system. These include additional teaching posts, additional and enhanced funding, NEPS, support and priority access to continual professional development and the Centre for School Leadership. I note the points made about collection of data and the fact that not all homeless children will attend DEIS schools. Collection of data in the Department is done via the primary online database, POD, and post-primary online database, P-POD, systems. Collection of data at school level is complicated, since not all children or parents will want to be identified within the school system as being homeless. The key issue is that, where a child is experiencing challenges that impact on his or her education, the school is in a position to access educational supports via NEPS and other resources available to the school. Where additional supports are required outside of the school system and are provided by other Departments and agencies, consideration will be given to how best to provide information to schools to assist in accessing those supports for children. The identification of need, early intervention and prevention strategies are considered key components in supporting children who experience homelessness. NEPS works with schools through the Department's continuum of support framework. The NEPS model of service works through a problem-solving and solution-oriented consultative approach to supporting schools in meeting the needs of individual pupils. NEPS has played a central role in the development of the Department's well-being policy statement and the framework for practice, which was published last year, and it will be leading the implementation of this policy within schools over the next five years. The initiatives planned will provide schools with a framework for developing and promoting the well-being of all children and young people. In addition, NEPS psychologists support schools in implementing early intervention and prevention programmes such as the incredible years programme in primary schools and resilience building programmes, for example, the Friends programmes at primary and post-primary levels. Students facing homelessness may have the same emotional and learning needs as other students, but the immediacy of those needs is heightened. NEPS supports the role of the school in identifying individual needs and, at a systems level, in the development of a culture and environment that supports connectedness and provides structure and stability, key elements that underpin learning and opportunity. All schools will receive a 5% increase in capitation from September next. Over the course of the 2019-2020 school year, an additional €10 million will be allocated to primary and post-primary schools, of which €4 million will be allocated in 2019. This increase is the beginning of the process for the restoration of capitation, which is one of the actions included in the Action Plan for Education 2019. For DEIS schools, the home-school community liaison, HSCL, scheme and the school completion programme, SCP, are core elements of the local strategy to support school attendance, participation and retention. HSCL co-ordinators engage with parents when they become aware of concerns raised by either the school or parents. Where appropriate, and if consented to by parents, referrals are made to the SCP and children then have access to before, during and after-school supports as well as holiday programmes provided by the SCP. Eligible families can avail of the back to school clothing and footwear allowance from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to assist with the costs associated with returning to school each September. Conscious of the cost to families, the previous Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, provided in a circular issued to all schools in 2017 for measures to be adopted by schools to reduce the cost of school uniforms and other costs. For children experiencing homelessness, school attendance can often be an issue for a variety of reasons. Tusla's educational welfare services are aware of the challenges faced by families experiencing homelessness. They work with schools to put supports in place to assist these families with issues that affect them in school. Tusla seeks to maximise attendance, participation and retention rates in school to try to ensure that the education placement does not break down and the protective factors of maintaining school engagement are capitalised on.

#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	342	I express my gratitude to all sides of the House for supporting this motion. The result should be some action. I accept what colleagues have said. All of us, and certainly those of us in this party, want to end child homelessness. I agree with the statements that have been made to the effect that we do not want child homelessness and that we cannot afford as a society to normalise it. The truth is that we are dealing with a reality today that must be addressed, yet the educational issues relating to homelessness are not being addressed. We all remember the case of a young lady who spoke on "Morning Ireland" last year. Amanda was a student preparing for her exams. She had spent two years living in a hotel room with her mother, her brother and her older sister, who returned to the family from college at weekends. She described her experience in the most visceral of terms, speaking of the impact of her situation on her long-term future and how it could stop her from going to college and so on. A large body of work is required to addressed the ongoing homelessness and housing crisis. While the specific proposals in this motion are limited in scope, their target is to address the long-term harm that could otherwise result. I will severely criticise a number of the points made by the Minister, Deputy McHugh, but I also acknowledge that the Minister of State has indicated that she will bring many of the issues raised back to the Department. The Minister claimed that it was not correct of our motion to assert there was no policy, but it was. There is no policy on this matter. He pointed to the fact that the Department of Education and Skills had been invited late last year to join the inter-agency group. That is welcome and I would have accepted an amendment to that effect, but it only happened late last year and the crisis is growing larger and larger. The Department's statement of strategy references the inter-agency group but prioritises student homelessness. While the Department is right to focus on that important issue in its consideration of homelessness, there is no strategy to deal with the homelessness of schoolchildren and its impact on their educational attainment. It is not right for the Minister to come to the House and state that there is.There is no strategy or policy. There is simply a reference to everything else that is going on in the Department. I am told that homeless children are included because it refers to all children and that everyone who attends a school under the DEIS programme will benefit but that is not the point at all. There needs to be a much greater focus from the Department and it is not good enough to say that the innovative approaches to education in the action plan include all children. That is not good enough. The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, after setting out the limited actions that his Department has taken, spoke about DEIS. One of the main points of this motion is that DEIS does not cover a significant number of the students involved. We acknowledge the supports that are provided through DEIS, and there should be more and we will come back to that at some point in this Dáil, but one of the points of the motion is that DEIS supports are simply not available to a sizeable number of these children. The idea that NEPS is routinely available to homeless children is not the case. Deputy Burton stated that the counselling service and the school retention service, which I do not think is directly related to homelessness, are under threat. The latter is delivered through Tusla and not the Department of Education and Skills. NEPS psychologists are certainly stretched beyond their capacity and I cannot imagine that they are giving much in the way of assistance to schools. It is misleading of the Government to state that they are. I am glad the Minister indicated that he will look at July provision. That is being reviewed at the moment. It needs to be looked at and that is what the motion seeks. The motion looks for July provision to be considered in the cases of children who have missed significant amounts of school time. When the Minister moved on from describing what his Department is doing, which I say is not much, he proceeded to refer to what the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is doing. There was mention of transport across Dublin but that is not the point. The transport situation in rural areas, where these children are increasingly based perhaps because they are moving from Dublin, is absolutely chronic because they have to travel miles to get to school. That is preventing them getting to school at all or on time and that is the whole point of the motion. A totally different focus needs to be taken by the Department. The Minister of State referred to Tusla's education and welfare service and the sooner that is merged with the Department of Education and Skills the better because there is a lack of joined-up thinking. I compliment the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, on the work she has done. She has only a small Department but she has done her bit by placing some focus on this issue. There has been none of that in the Department of Education and Skills. The Minister of State spoke about the school meals programme operated by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. That has its purpose, of course, but is not targeted at homeless children and we want to ensure that homeless children who are in danger of not having meals and unable to take part in the school day to the fullest extent possible have their needs met. That needs to be done whether through the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection or both. It should be raised by the Department of Education and Skills at the inter-agency meetings. I would like to see the Department of Education and Skills putting items on the agenda at those meetings rather than just being there as a new member which was only invited along late last year. We are making the choice to limit the potential of these children if we do not proactively tackle this problem. We are not equipping them with the skills they need to survive and thrive. We are, in effect, locking them into a cycle of poverty. If education lifted us out of the poverty of this country, the lack of it can mire people in poverty. We need to educate our people and ensure that everybody has the opportunity to be educated fully and properly. On a side topic, the scandal of reduced hours in schools needs to be addressed. There are homeless children suffering as a result of reduced hours but those reductions also apply to children with special needs and others. The Minister for Education and Skills stated in reply to me yesterday, and I repeat it, that no school is entitled to shorten the school day for any child, and children who are homeless should not have a shortened school day because of their family circumstances or the transport difficulties they face. The experiences that homeless children are dealing with are already understood. Deputies Boyd Barrett and Paul Murphy referred to the long-term, incurable scarring effects of those experiences and I accept that. Longitudinal data from the US shows that homelessness impacts on behaviour, employability, relationships and brain development. We cannot allow this situation to continue. It is welcome that the Government is not opposing the motion but I would rather it had simply amended it to point out that Department of Education and Skills had joined the inter-agency group last December. The Government might make a genuine effort to look at these issues and think of itself as a driver in this area and does not simply depend on Tusla, the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, NEPS, particularly in areas where it effectively does not have a presence, or the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. We need much more proactivity.  I welcome that the Minister of State has said that she will go back to the Department and take up these issues because they are brought here in a spirit of genuine constructive debate and on foot of the Children's Rights Alliance. That alliance is not a political organisation but represents many organisations around the country which are dealing with these issues on a day-to-day basis. It has access to some of the best researchers in the country. I welcome Mr. John Boyle from the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, and representatives of the Children's Rights Alliance to the Gallery. I thank them all for what they are doing. I hope this motion has shone a light on their work. I encourage anyone listening to the debate to read the Home Works report because it is searing to read the experiences of the children. I have spoken to principals today and the whole issue of special needs, and especially children who are homeless with special education needs, is dreadful. The discontinuity of education is a major problem which has not really been addressed by anybody. These children have to repeatedly stop and start their education, which is an extra burden above and beyond their colleagues who do not have traditional special educational needs. I think it is agreed by everybody that homelessness is a special educational need where it leads to gaps and breaks in a child's education or the shortening thereof. We have a duty, as a Legislature and Parliament, and the Government has a duty to respond to it much more thoroughly. I thank everyone for their support. Fianna Fáil will certainly be pursuing this, as will the voluntary organisations, the NGOs, the Children's Rights Alliance and their members, and the teachers' unions and I encourage them to do so. They have seen that they have the support of everyone in the Dáil tonight and they will want to see action on that. I again thank all my colleagues for supporting this motion. I also thank Mr. Shane Smyth in the Fianna Fáil research office for his support and work. I look forward to seeing results and, as everyone has said, let us end child homelessness.

The first condition is that on the date of institution of the divorce proceedings, the spouses have lived apart from one another for a total of at least four years during the previous five years. The second condition is that there is no reasonable prospect of a reconciliation between the spouses. The third condition is that proper provision exists or will be made for the spouses and any children of either or both of them. The final condition is that any further conditions prescribed by law are complied with. I remind the House that in 1995 we were moving from a position where the Constitution provided clearly that "No law shall be enacted providing for the grant of a dissolution of marriage" to one in which divorce was to become possible in Ireland for the first time but subject to very specific conditions, which were set out in the new provision inserted by the fifteenth amendment. The purpose of the mandatory period of living apart was to ensure that divorce would not be available on an easy or casual basis, in order to address concerns about what were described as quickie divorces and the development of what was described as a divorce culture in Ireland. The four-year period was intended to ensure that spouses would not enter into divorce lightly and would have the necessary time to reflect on the serious step they were undertaking. It was also considered that it would encourage spouses to attempt to reach agreement on the terms of their separation in a way that would ensure that, when the divorce application came before a court, many of the key elements relating to children, finance and property may already have been settled between the spouses and a form of agreement reached. The four-year period of living apart can be cumulated over a five-year period. The reason for this is to allow a couple to make a reasonable attempt at reconciliation in the knowledge that, if it does not work out, they will not have lost their option to make an application for a divorce. However, it is now 23 years since divorce was introduced in Ireland and the four-year minimum living apart period is now perceived to be unnecessarily restrictive and as hindering couples who have separated from regularising their legal positions and, in many respects, moving on with their lives. The Government has taken the opportunity presented by this Private Members' Bill, introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Josepha Madigan, to re-examine the provisions of Article 41.3.2° of the Constitution and consider the question of the scope of the constitutional amendment that might be proposed. I acknowledge the work of the Minister in this regard. Without unnecessarily delaying proceedings on the amendment, it is important to point out that Ireland has one of the lowest divorce rates in Europe and I welcome this. Sadly, however, some marriages break down irreconcilably, causing immense grief, sadness and stress for everybody concerned. The Government wishes to ensure that the process for obtaining a divorce is fair, dignified and humane and allows both parties to move forward with their lives within a reasonable timeframe. I propose an amendment to the Constitution to remove the four-year minimum living apart period from Article 41.3.2°. I also propose an amendment to replace the text of Article 41.3.3° in the matter of the recognition of foreign divorces with a new provision. Over time, we have learned that very complex questions of social policy are best dealt with through detailed legislation in the Oireachtas, with the Dáil and Seanad reaching agreement in committee and plenary or making proposed changes in accordance with the rules of both Houses, rather than in our Constitution. The fundamental principles and protections concerning divorce will not change and the Government does not propose any change to the other provisions of Article 41.3.2° of the Constitution. The requirements that there be no prospect of reconciliation will remain in the Constitution. The requirement that proper provision exists or will be made for spouses and children will continue within the constitutional framework. It will also remain the case that only a court of law can grant a divorce. The Government intends, subject to the passage of the Bill by the Dáil and Seanad, to hold a referendum on divorce alongside the votes for the European and local elections on Friday, 24 May 2019. On 26 February 2019, my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, made an order under the Referendum Act 1998 to establish an independent statutory referendum commission for the purpose of the referendum on divorce. In accordance with the 1998 Act, the Chief Justice nominated Ms Justice Tara Burns to act as chairperson to the commission. It is important to have broad consensus in the Oireachtas for any proposal that will be put to the people. Deputies will recall that I have engaged in consultations with parties and political groupings on options for the scope of the constitutional amendment that might be proposed. I acknowledge the broad cross-party support in the Oireachtas for the proposed changes. Turning briefly to the proposed amendment to Article 41.3.2°, the effect of the amendment would be that the Constitution would no longer provide for a minimum living apart period, but that such a period could be defined in law by the Houses of the Oireachtas. Removing the time period from the Constitution would give the Oireachtas a greater element of flexibility to legislate to ease the burden on people who have experienced the tragedy of a marriage breakdown and wish to begin again.As it stands, the long period of living apart required under the Constitution frequently leads to couples seeking an order for judicial separation prior to obtaining a divorce, with attendant legal costs and additional upset, stress and worry. If the referendum is passed, it is the Government’s intention to deal with the living-apart period by way of ordinary legislation to be introduced in the House. The Government will bring forward a Bill to amend section 5(1)(a) of the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996 to reduce the minimum living-apart period specified in that Act to two years during the previous three. Deputies will be aware that I have published the draft general scheme of a Bill to provide for this. It is my strong contention that this reduction would enable couples whose marriages have broken down with no reasonable prospect of reconciliation to regularise their affairs sooner. A shorter living-apart period would also have the potential to reduce the legal costs involved, as couples would be less likely to need to apply for judicial separation or make a formal separation agreement while waiting to become eligible to apply for an order of divorce through the courts. I know that Irish people are very compassionate and will show empathy and understanding for those who find themselves in the desperately sad situations where marriages break down with no prospect of reconciliation. The aim of the proposed amendments is to decrease the burden on people whose marriages have, sadly, broken down. I apologise to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle if I have transgressed any regulation, but it has been some time since the House debated this issue. We are dealing with Report Stage of a Bill which would introduce what I will describe as a fundamental change and I am very keen to hear the views of Deputies with a view towards achieving consensus.

I seek clarification on one point in regard to the legislation that would follow a successful referendum. The Bill proposes that a couple seeking a divorce will be required to have lived apart for two of the previous three years. The Minister and I and probably all other Members of the House will have encountered cases involving marriages which have tragically broken down with no chance of reconciliation, but involving a couple who cannot afford to live apart due to financial pressures. The couple are living separate lives and might as well be living five, ten or 20 miles away from each other, but for financial reasons they are, essentially, trapped in the same house. What is the view of the Government on that issue? Will it propose clauses to address it? Will consideration be given to situations where it could be proven by way of verifiable facts presented to the appropriate officer or court that the couple involved would be living apart for the two-year period if they could afford to so do? Will such situations be accounted for?

I wish to address the point raised by Deputy Donnelly which I also intended to raise. I am sure all Members are aware of marriages which, unfortunately, have broken down with no prospect of reconciliation, but for financial reasons the couple are unable to live apart. I do not know if that can be addressed in the Bill or the legislation which will follow the referendum, but it needs to be discussed at some stage because, unfortunately, many estranged couples are living under the same roof. Some such people may have moved on to new relationships but remain living with their spouse for financial reasons. I cannot quantify the numbers involved, but I personally know people in that situation. We must give consideration to whether such situations can be addressed in the legislation. I do not know if that would be possible, given that the Constitution would be changed and we must be very clear about what is being proposed and the resultant legislation would have to reflect that. It is an issue which we should consider. If the Government can reach a solution on this issue, it would be worthwhile. An issue I was asked to raise by Deputy Ó Laoghaire, who, unfortunately, cannot be present as he has returned to Cork for a funeral, is that of how contested and uncontested divorces will be addressed. My view is that the proposals in the Bill would make no difference in that regard because a couple would live apart for two years of the previous three and if it was a contested divorce, it would be a matter for the courts to rule on. I do not think the issue has any bearing on this debate, but I raise it as I was asked to so do. People are entitled to contest requests for a divorce through the courts and I presume that is where they would be contested.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	350	I welcome the amendment. Solidarity-People Before Profit argued for it on Committee Stage because we thought it inappropriate to have this restriction in the Constitution. We would argue against having any restriction in regard to this issue and I will go on to address that point. As a slightly more general comment in line with the comments of the Minister on the nature of the Bill, we should not be complacent about the referendum. We must campaign for it to be passed. Most political commentators would quite confidently predict that it is likely to be passed. It is to be hoped that it will be passed by a substantial margin. One could contrast the current situation with the referendum in 1995 in terms of the extremely narrow 0.5% margin of victory and the type of rhetoric employed by the Catholic right-wing "No" campaign, such as "Hello Divorce ... Bye Bye Daddy". It is a sign of the massive societal shift in a very progressive direction that has taken place and the Bill is to be welcomed as part of that change. Fundamentally, we need a separation of church and State in this country and the Bill is part of that process. There should not be any time restrictions in regard to divorce. It is a civil right for any couple to marry, as affirmed by the marriage equality referendum. The necessary corollary to that is that people also have the right to divorce without interference or judgment by the church or State regarding why they are choosing to so do. The Government should legislate to allow people who wish to divorce to so do.  I would be interested to hear an assessment of the impact of the restrictions. Obviously, we know the impact of the current restrictions. Although the restrictions proposed in the Bill are preferable to those currently in place and it is preferable that they be enshrined in legislation rather than the Constitution in order that they may be more easily amended, we know that the current restrictions have very negative impacts. Lesser restrictions will continue to have negative, although lesser, impacts. In particular, those who will be most affected by the restrictions are the most vulnerable. The reality is that a couple, possibly without children, seeking an amicable divorce may be able to agree to say that they were living apart for two of the past three years, etc., and that the judge will accept that if it is not contested and the divorce will be very quickly processed. However, in other cases the divorce may not be amicable and may involve an abusive former partner who may dispute the amount of time spent separated in order to make it difficult for the partner seeking a divorce to obtain it. In such cases, the restriction would come into play in a negative way for those who are more vulnerable, such as people in abusive situations. I would be interested to hear the Minister's assessment of the impact of the restrictions in such instances. Solidarity-People Before Profit welcomes the legal progress represented by the Bill.In order for legal rights to become a reality, however, they need to be accompanied by economic and social changes that make them accessible. The truth is that many individuals, particularly women, are trapped in marriages or relationships that are abusive or that are simply unhappy. Without the family home or joint income, they could be made homeless. There is some irony in the fact that at the same time as Fine Gael is proposing the liberalisation of divorce laws, of which we are in favour, there have been quite substantial cuts in funding for refuge services for those fleeing domestic violence. Ireland has fewer than one third of the refuge spaces it should have according to European guidelines. There are only 11 refuge unit spaces available in Dublin city, and one in three counties across the country has no spaces whatsoever. The costs of getting legal advice and representation can be prohibitive in the case of a disputed divorce. To make accessible the legal right, which we welcome, economic and social changes are needed. It needs to be combined with the right to free legal advice and free legal representation for all who need it. Essential to all this is the discussion we were just having on the housing and homelessness. The right to safe, affordable housing and an adequate number of refuge spaces are key if people are to exercise freely their choice to be in relationships or marriages as opposed to being compelled to remain in them by economic circumstances, which is an all-too-common reality in this country.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	351	I thank the Deputies for their comments. I appreciate the parties' approach to this issue. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has been in this House longer than me but it seems from my recollection that no referendum has ever been passed with the support of a Government party or Government parties alone. I believe, therefore, it is important that we endeavour to achieve the type of consensus I am very pleased to see emerging. I thank Deputies Donnelly and Jonathan O'Brien and their respective parties. I thank the parties that are not represented here at this debate but that expressed their broad support. I acknowledge the support of Deputy Paul Murphy, who would like to see us go further, with particular reference to the time limit. We are removing a time limit from the Constitution but retaining a reduced time limit in law. I gather from what Deputy Paul Murphy said that he believes there is no necessity for such a limit. I do not necessarily agree but I am keen to ensure we put something to the people in a constitutional referendum that will receive their broad support. With that in mind, it is important that we do not delete all references in our law to a time limit. For reasons I have already stated, it is desirable to reduce the time limit but also to remove such limits from our Constitution, such that these issues can be decided by law. We will have an opportunity to address this at another stage, when proceeding with the law, should the Irish people form the view that the change put forward is desirable. I take Deputy Paul Murphy's point, however, not that I agree with it. Deputy Donnelly made an important point on living separately and apart, a point also made by Deputy Jonathan O'Brien. Deputy Paul Murphy raised it in the context of the broader economic and social debate. These are very reasonable points. I have given reasons for the Government's view on why it is desirable to have time limits. Ultimately, it will be up to the courts to decide on the basis that, regardless of what the people decide, under our Constitution divorce will be granted only by way of an order of the court. The judge will be required to take into consideration all factors in determining whether the living-separately-and-apart requirement has been met. I can say to Deputy Donnelly that the courts have already recognised circumstances in which couples can be living apart and separately but at the same time under the one roof. I say this in order to assuage the concerns of Deputies Donnelly and Jonathan O'Brien somewhat. In other words, our law has recognised that people can be sharing the one dwelling but regarded as living apart for the purpose of granting an order of divorce. The court will inquire into and deal with these circumstances. Recognition has already been an issue in our courts. Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, who probably goes further than Deputy Donnelly in this regard, should note that the question of clarifying exactly what is meant by living apart can be examined in the implementation of the legislation. I acknowledge what the courts have said and that this is an issue that will be taken into consideration by them but, for the purpose of clarification for Deputy Jonathan O'Brien, we can we can examine it further. In response to Deputy Paul Murphy, we have ample opportunity in this House to deal with the issue of housing. I do not want to digress, not that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will allow me, but I feel the Deputy makes an important point when he speaks about emergency refuge accommodation for victims of domestic violence. As Minister for Justice and Equality, I am very keen to have progress reported across the country on this matter. I have been speaking to interested parties and stakeholders in this regard. I represent a rural constituency and see parts of the country where there are deficiencies. I take the Deputy's point. It is one we will have an opportunity to revert to in the House in the context of the broader debate. With regard to advances we have made on tackling the scourge of domestic violence, I point to the recent ratification and signing of the Istanbul Convention and to legislative change of the appropriate level. We have succeeded in enacting four Bills in this House over the past couple of years. I acknowledge, as a member of a minority Government, the support and assistance of all parties in ensuring we enter a new era regarding how we treat domestic violence, showing zero tolerance towards it. For example, I am very keen to ensure appropriate investment in An Garda Síochána to allow that body, along with various agencies, to work to capacity to ensure we can tackle the issue raised.

#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	353	I would like to make a brief point about domestic refuges in response to the Minister. I am eager to see as big and substantial a "Yes" campaign as possible. I hope there will be as big and substantial a margin of victory for the "Yes" campaign as possible. To assist in the achievement of that outcome, I urge the Minister to go beyond his welcome words about the absence of domestic refuge services in large parts of the country and the deficiencies in those services relative to the European guidelines. I ask him to ensure that substantial change takes place. It is inevitable that during the discussion and conversation that takes place in society in the run-up to next month's referendum, there will be a wider discussion away from the wording of Article 41 of the Constitution about all the difficulties that are presented in the context in which relationships break down and in which people attempt to end relationships. It is obvious that legal difficulties present a significant impediment to a marriage being ended with a divorce. It is appropriate that we are dealing with those difficulties. All of the other impediments that exist will also be a part of the conversation. I urge the Minister to discuss this aspect of the matter with his Government colleagues with a view to ensuring action is taken in the next couple of months.

I move amendment No. 2:In page 4, line 16, to delete "The amendment to the Constitution effected by this Act shall be called the Thirty-fifth" and substitute "The amendment of the Constitution effected by this Act shall be called the Thirty-eighth".I am introducing amendments Nos. 2 and 3, which are technical drafting amendments, on the advice of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. I am proposing that the Title of the Bill should be amended to "the Thirty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution (Dissolution of Marriage) Bill". The change in the number of the amendment from the thirty-fifth amendment to the thirty-eighth amendment takes account of the Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Act 2018 and the Thirty-seventh Amendment of the Constitution (Repeal of offence of publication or utterance of blasphemous matter) Act 2018, which we have dealt with in referendums since this Bill was first introduced by the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Madigan. The proposed change from "Divorce" to "Dissolution of Marriage", as provided for in amendment No. 3, is intended to better reflect the wording of Article 41 of the Constitution. The proposed replacement of "to the Constitution" with "of the Constitution", as provided for in amendment No. 2, is a mere technical drafting amendment to ensure consistency with previous Bills to amend the Constitution.

I am proposing the replacement of Article 41.3.3° with a readily understandable provision which clearly provides that the Oireachtas may legislate for the recognition of foreign divorces granted under the civil law of another state. The proposed new text will do no more than set out in express terms what the courts have found to be the present state of the law. However, in order to ascertain the present state of the law it is necessary to examine the case law on the interpretation of Article 41.3.3°. I am of the view that the constitutional position regarding the recognition of foreign divorces should be clear from a reading of our Constitution, particularly Article 41 thereof. At present, different rules apply to the recognition of foreign divorces, depending on whether they are granted within or outside the EU. The Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act 1986 governs the recognition of a divorce granted in a country outside the EU. The 1986 Act provides that a foreign divorce granted after the Act came into operation may only be recognised in Ireland if it was granted in a country where either spouse was domiciled on the date on which the divorce proceedings were instituted. The recognition of foreign divorces granted prior to the commencement of the 1986 Act is governed by common law domicile rules. Those rules are now consistent with the provisions of the 1986 Act, which is our law. The determination of domicile includes an assessment of the person's intention to remain indefinitely in the foreign jurisdiction. It has proven complex to determine this in some instances. By contrast, a test of habitual residence, which may be considered less complex and more clear, generally applies across the EU. EU Council Regulation 2201/2003, which is known as the Brussels IIA regulation, governs the recognition of divorces obtained in another EU member state. Habitual residence is the key governing criterion for recognition of a foreign divorce. The Law Reform Commission, LRC, has proposed to examine the legal issues relating to the recognition of foreign divorces after the referendum as part of its new fifth programme of law reform. These are complex issues. That is why I am very keen for the LRC to have an opportunity to engage in a detailed study. I understand that will be done this year. I intend to legislate to introduce greater consistency in the recognition of foreign divorces. I ask Members to agree with me that it is best for us to be guided by the expert report of the LRC as we develop proposals for legislation in this area. However, it is also important for us to take this opportunity to signal that there will be a change in any event. The language of Article 41.3.3°, which deals with the recognition of foreign divorces, is consistent with a time in our history when divorce was expressly prohibited under our Constitution. We did not deal with this on the previous occasion. To my mind, the referendum in May is both opportune and appropriate to modernise this provision, although we will not have certainty until we have the LRC report.

#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	375	I move amendment No. 1:In page 9, to delete lines 10 and 11 and substitute the following:“(c) 9 ordinary members.”.These amendments arise from discussions on and an amendment accepted on Committee Stage to provide that ordinary members of the HSE board must include a patient advocate, a financial expert and two clinical experts. I acknowledge these were amendments from Deputy Donnelly. There was a debate and a focus in particular on clinical expertise in the context of board membership. I am proposing amendments which I believe meet the issues raised regarding this. Amendment No. 3 provides that at least one of the persons appointed to the board must be a person who is practising, or has practised, as a member of a health profession, whether in this country or elsewhere. Amendment No. 6 sets out what is meant by a health profession. It covers doctors, nurses, midwives, dentists, pharmacists, as well as the health and social care professions regulated under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005. I hope Deputies will agree this ensures the board includes membership with clinical expertise as was envisaged in the Committee Stage amendment. I listened to Deputy Donnelly’s compelling argument that it is important there is a designated space on the board for clinical expertise. It was never the intention to exclude that expertise. We went through the Public Appointments Service. I accept it is prudent and in the spirit of what Deputy Donnelly is trying to achieve in this regard.  Arising from this and the amendment made on Committee Stage, amendment No. 1 increases the number of ordinary members on the board from eight to nine. Amendment No. 2 is a technical drafting amendment to take account of the inclusion of the new provision of clinical expertise in amendment No. 3. Amendments Nos. 5 and 12 to 14, inclusive, are consequential to the increase in board membership, covering the quorum for the board and arrangements for calling board meetings. My amendments would give scope for the clinical expert to be potentially the chair or the deputy chair of the board, whereas Deputy Donnelly’s amendment did not provide that the person could only be an ordinary member. There may well be a case where the clinical expert ends up being the chair or deputy chair of the HSE board. The amendment, as passed on Committee Stage, would not allow for that. Also, the Bill, as passed by the Seanad, provides that at least two board members must be people with experience of or expertise in advocacy related matters affecting patients. The Committee Stage amendment would cause a conflict with these provisions which were included to meet the recommendations made by Dr. Gabriel Scally in his scoping inquiry into CervicalCheck. I do not believe anybody wants to have a conflict. Every Member is committed to implementing Dr. Scally's recommendations. There was an excellent amendment put forward in the Seanad by Senators Devine and Ruane to ensure that in law there are two spaces and it was not at the discretion of the Minister of the day. While it was not the intention, I am concerned about having anything in the Bill which would suggest that there should not be two patient advocates. My amendment reiterates that two of the seats should be dedicated to patient advocates, thus fulfilling an important recommendation of the Scally report. I am not proposing to expressly provide for a financial expert on the board. The amendments made in the Seanad in regard to patient advocacy ensure it will always be part of the criteria for the HSE board membership. The amendment I am proposing on clinical expertise will ensure this too will always be part of the criteria for HSE board membership. Financial expertise, however, should be viewed in a somewhat different light. Unlike advocacy and clinical expertise, financial expertise is and must be a standard requirement for any board. Financial expertise will, therefore, feature as part of the HSE board membership make-up without the need for express legislative provision. The Public Appointments Service campaign for HSE board membership sought candidates with experience and expertise in several areas, including financial planning and management. I hope to be in a position to make an announcement shortly in regard to a further board member with specific expertise in financial matters. Deputy Donnelly's amendment on Committee Stage provided that the new board should contain a patient advocate. My amendment proposes two patient advocates. This will comply with the recommendations of Dr. Scally. Deputy Donnelly proposed the new board should have financial expertise. I agree with him. I am giving an assurance that the vacant seat on the board will go to a financial expert. I hope to be in a position to announce that shortly. Deputy Donnelly rightly said there should be one or two seats for clinical expertise. I am bringing forward a proposal that will allow for one. My officials consulted the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to ensure the Bill does not have any conflicts in how it is drafted. My concern is that the amendments passed in the Seanad could be legally conflicting with those proposed by Deputy Donnelly. I am trying to marry the spirit of what the Seanad and the Deputy were trying to achieve.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	376	There are serious problems in the healthcare system, such as waiting lists, issues with which patients and their families have to deal, recruitment and retention issues, along with numerous human resources issues for nurses and midwives, non-consultant hospital doctors, general practitioners, consultants and allied health professionals. We all want them solved. We all have different views on how to solve them, however.One of the root causes of many of these problems is down to the lack of a voice for patients - something that has been greatly under-represented to date - the lack of a voice for clinicians and the lack of financial oversight. Budgets have been running over by several hundreds of millions. Clinicians do not feel represented. There is now a chief clinical lead but it is a relatively new appointment; for a long time there was none. Many of our hospitals do not have a senior clinical leads or administrators to run them. The model whereby hospitals are run by such individuals tends to work well. The exercise in appointing an interim board was very useful. We can now engage in a debate on the final details of the legislation, almost all of which Fianna Fáil will support, and have a conversation about the board that was appointed. The discussion does not have to be about hypotheticals relating to future potential boards. I will not mention any individuals or cast any aspersions. I hope that all of the eight of those who have been appointed to date are geniuses. I have no doubt that they are all excellent people. I do not refer to any individuals but let us take the board and ask if there financial expertise on it. The Minister has stated that there is not but he is looking to appoint some. There are two people with some background in patient advocacy. That is fantastic and very much in the spirit of Senator Ruane's amendment. However, something that really jumped out at me was that there was not a single person on the board with a clinical background, whether as a doctor, nurse, midwife, public health professional, physiotherapist or anything. The board is completely devoid of that. Furthermore, the chief executive has just been announced. I am sure he is a very fine person, I hope he is a genius and I wish him the very best of luck. However, it is interesting that, to the best of my knowledge, he also does not have a clinical or healthcare background or training. Neither the chief executive nor the members of the board, which, on behalf of the people of Ireland, must hold that chief executive to account and support him in every conceivable way, have clinical backgrounds. This indicates that the very damaging culture in healthcare whereby clinicians have been silenced - and it has been wired into the system that their voices are not heard - is alive and well. I am not blaming the Minister for this. He did not pick the board, he was sent recommendations by the appointment committee, but is it not extraordinary that the machine has managed to appoint a chief executive and a board and not one of those involves has a clinical background? We have the opportunity to fix that culture, albeit not even close to fully, but to make a very important step and say that, at a minimum, two members of the board must have clinical backgrounds. That is not just a sensible thing to do but it is essential. As legislators, we will have to force the clinicians voice up the chain so that they are heard. I take everything the Minister said in good faith but his amendment does not provide for two people with clinical or healthcare backgrounds. Based on knowing what the system appoints now that we have the interim board, I do not believe that it will do it on its own. It is essential that there are two people with clinical expertise. On the number of patient advocates, it was noted during the Seanad debate that research shows two are needed. One person, whether he or she has a clinical or patient background, can feel alienated and ganged up on. The Bill, as amended, provides for two clinical advocates. The Bill says that "shall include a patient advocate" - it does not say that it is limited to only one - and later in that section, on the same page, it specifies that "at least 2 of the persons" will have experience of, or expertise in, patient advocacy. The two may not sing perfectly legally but they are clearly not in conflict. The financial oversight is essential. While the Minister says he hopes to appoint someone with financial expertise the system may not want that. It did not want to appoint anyone with clinical expertise. The Bill, as amended at Committee Stage, makes the HSE stronger. It strengthens the clinical voice, financial expertise and oversight and still allows the two patient-advocacy positions. Therefore I will oppose the Minister's amendment. I would prefer not to go to a vote on that and if miscellaneous Bills come forward during the year when the legalese might be adjusted I will be very happy to work through that with the Minister. However, I would be reluctant to remove the necessity to have financial expertise and the two clinical experts given that the two patient advocates, which are also critical, feature on the same page.
#LouiseOReilly	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-party	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-dob	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	377	Having represented clinical experts in the health service who were ignored when Deputy Donnelly's party was in government, I welcome this Damascene conversion. We must have clinicians on the board. It is ludicrous to me that we do not or that there is no proviso for this. Whether intentional or not they are excluded because it is not there. We must have patient advocates. I am very struck by the Scally report's observations on that. There must be two, one person on their own will not be able to fulfil that role. The Minister said that the one remaining space will be filled by someone who will fulfil the financial role and that person has been lined-up already. I ask the Minister to explain this. Presumably that person is on the short list which has been sent to the Minister by the Public Appointments Service who the Minister believes has the requisite expertise. I share Deputy Donnelly's concerns. The difficulty is that while the Minister may be minded to make this appointment on this one occasion, if it is not mandated by legislation there might be another situation when the Minister has a change of heart or one of his successors is not so minded. Every day there are column inches full of the failings of people on boards in matters of money. I am struck by the need to have as many clinicians on the board as possible. The Minister indicated that he believes he has someone lined up who can deal with the financial end of things who is some class of an expert. Without giving away too much detail, I ask that the Minister would explain the level of qualification he or she has and why the Minister believes them to be suitable. When the Public Appointments Service looks for board members, does it look for financial experts? Is it something that it has identified in its advertisements as an area that is desirable but not essential.I am taken by the need to ensure that we have patient advocates. I am wedded to the idea that there be two of them. That is important because they can act as back-up and support for each other in that environment, which might be tough for a patient advocate given the level of work that will be undertaken. I am happy to support this provision. I ask the Minister to explain how that will be achieved given that he agrees with the need for financial expertise.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	378	I am not in disagreement with what Deputies Donnelly and O'Reilly are trying to do here. However, I must tell the House, in all sincerity and in the hope that the Deputies accept my bona fides in this regard, that I have consulted the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on this matter and its advice, which is therefore my advice to the House, is that the Bill, as currently written is - entirely accidentally and unintentionally owing to the various amendments - legally in conflict. This would make it very difficult, if not impossible, for me to enact section 16N(2)(b), the paragraph dealing with the two patient advocates. I fully accept that is not the intention of any Member. Section 16N(1)(c), which provides for "8 ordinary members, who shall include a patient advocate, a financial expert and two clinical experts", is read by the advice available to me to be in conflict with section 16N(2)(b), which provides that at least two of the persons "appointed under paragraph (a) shall be persons who, in the opinion of the Minister, have experience of, or expertise in, advocacy in relation to matters affecting patients." The advice available to me is that the Bill, as currently construed, is in conflict accidentally. For this reason, I have come forward with what I believe to be a compromise, under which we will proceed to designate a seat for clinical expertise, as the Opposition has asked me to do, to appoint a financial expert in the coming weeks, whose name I do not have but who will come through the Public Appointments Service following a request by me, and to appoint the two patient advocates who I have already named and whose bona fides everybody accepts. A further HSE governance Bill is due for publication this summer. This was in the Government legislative programme published in recent days. I am more than happy to work and engage with Deputies Donnelly, O'Reilly and Harty and the Opposition generally on further refining or rectifying this issue to achieve the outcome Deputy Donnelly seeks. I advise, however, that adopting the Government amendments is the best way to achieve an effective board, one which will have two patient advocates and a clinical and financial expert, respectively, and be up and running at the end of May. Failure to do so will, according to the advice available to me, prevent me from enacting the Scally recommendation on two patient advocates, which is not the intention of anyone in this House.

There is a missed opportunity. Unfortunately, the Minister's amendment reduces the clinical representation from two to one and does not bring in financial expertise. If he had tabled an amendment that adjusted the drafting but held on to the two clinical experts and the financial expert, we would be satisfied because the two patient advocates are contained in Senator Ruane's updated clause. Unfortunately, that is not what the Minister did. Instead, he proposed an amendment that materially changed what the committee agreed was required. I ask him to withdraw the amendments in order that we can proceed and have the essential financial expertise on the board, as well as two clinical experts and two patient advocates, as is currently provided for in the Bill. If there are drafting issues, as appears to be the case, they can be dealt with in the other Bill the Minister indicated will be forthcoming. I have no issue with adjusting the drafting. This is a great opportunity to make a strong statement that for the first time we will give clinicians, patients and financial oversight the level of statutory footing that they require. That would be a great message from this House. I appreciate this is awkward for the Minister. I would be more than happy to rectify any drafting issues when we discuss the other Bill. It is essential, however, that we hold on to the numbers the committee agreed were required on Committee Stage.
#LouiseOReilly	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-party	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-dob	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	380	I am a little conflicted on this because I do not want to do anything that interferes with the recommendations of the Scally report, which the Minister indicated the current wording has the potential to do. Likewise, I and my party have supported the inclusion of two clinicians on the board. It strikes me that the Minister has offered to potentially include such a provision in other legislation at a later date. If it can be done in a couple of months, why can it not be done now? Nobody is trying to convince anybody else because the argument has been won. We know we need clinicians and patient advocates on the board. I am unwilling to contradict previous voting positions taken by my party. However, I do not want to put us in a position whereby this legislation cannot be enacted. I appreciate the Minister has received advice, which I do not have, but the advice I have is to the contrary. I understand the Minister cannot share the advice he has but that puts us in a difficult position. I do not want to do anything that will interfere with the enactment of this legislation. The board is needed and must be placed on a statutory footing, as I have called for previously. I do want to get in the way of that, nor do I want to let an opportunity go that will provide for the maximum number of clinicians on the board. It strikes me that if this issue can be fixed in a couple of months, surely it can be fixed now. Alternatively, as Deputy Donnelly suggested, if the Minister withdraws the amendment, we will be in a position to make any changes required in a couple of months' time if there are drafting issues.
#MichaelHarty	unknown-#MichaelHarty-party	unknown-#MichaelHarty-dob	unknown-#MichaelHarty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	381	I will make a few general points on this amendment. The Sláintecare report was published in May 2017, almost two years ago. One of the main recommendations of the report was to reinstate a HSE board. In November 2017, the Taoiseach, in response to a question I put to him in the House, stated that the Government was reversing its policy on abolishing the HSE board and would reinstate it. Now, 18 months later, it is important that we get this HSE (Governance) Bill absolutely correct. Sláintecare is very strong on patient and clinical involvement. It is important that this Bill reflects the amendment that was introduced on Committee Stage. Unfortunately, the Minister was not available to attend that meeting. Perhaps we might have been able to thrash it out then if the Minister's expertise had been available. Nevertheless, the committee decided that there should be two clinical members of the board. After all, the Health Service Executive will oversee Sláintecare reform if it is given sufficient funding to develop its programme of reform and action plan. It is essential that there are two clinical experts on the board and I will certainly oppose any move away from that.  The Minister and Dr. Scally know how important it is to have patient advocates on a board. It is also critical to have persons with clinical expertise on how to deliver a service on a board. Any board that does not include clinical expertise will not be able to deliver the reform and oversee the health service as we wish it to. In that regard, I will support Deputy Donnelly's proposal.

I know the Minister has included an amendment stipulating only one but it sounds like he is okay with two. I seek clarity from the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. My understanding is that with his permission or the agreement of the House, Report Stage could be withdrawn, as it were, the amendment could be updated and we could come back shortly to adjust the amendment and push it through.

#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	384	It is not a view that is new to colleagues on the Opposition benches tonight that we must ensure the Bill is legally robust. We have spoken much about cervical cancer in these Houses, as well as the Scally report and recommendations. I accepted an amendment put to me in the Seanad and redrafted it to ensure we could implement the Scally recommendations. This relates to section 16N(2)(b) of the Bill. The reality is that the Bill as currently articulated would not enable me to enact that part of the Bill. Therefore, I would be able to have one patient advocate on the board. I understand that nobody wants to arrive at that point. The only disagreement we are having is whether we have one or two clinical experts.

I am suggesting that we accept my amendments but at the next available opportunity I will make that change. There is an opportunity on the legislative list this year and I will work with the Opposition to further refine membership of the board if it is the view of the House that there should be an additional seat for clinical expertise and a ring-fenced seat for financial expertise. I will do that but I really do not see how the House would in any way lose out tonight by allowing us to get on with the board that has been announced through the Public Appointments Service. That will allow us to enact the part to comply with the Scally report recommendations and appoint two patient advocates. As a compromise on my part, there will be a clinical expertise seat on the board. We can review the matter in a number of months because the published Government legislative programme indicates the next HSE Bill is to be brought forward for pre-legislative scrutiny in advance of the summer recess. I am happy to rectify the matter but my priority is to put this board in place and ensure we can have the two patient advocates. I know we all accept their bona fides and they have been identified. They should take their seats on the board from day one. As I said, I am compromising and changing my position in recognition of Deputy Donnelly's position in having a dedicated seat for a clinical expert. The Deputy would prefer two such experts and I am okay with that argument but there is no amendment before the House tonight from anybody to ensure that happens while enabling the patient advocacy element to be included as well.

The Minister has drafted an amendment and I presume the drafters believe it works within the Bill's parameters. The Seanad can amend the amendment very easily. Essentially, the Minister is seeking to delete the reference to a financial expert and two clinical experts. He is seeking to replace that reference with a reference to at least one person who is practising, or has practised, as a member of a health profession. That is basically what we are talking about. The amendment in question can be amended in the Seanad very quickly.

That could be a very long way out. The Minister's amendment can be amended very simply, although we do not need to get into drafting here. The amended provision could refer to two persons who are practising or have practised as a member of a health profession and a person with financial expertise. Let us meet halfway. If the Minister withdraws his amendment, we can amend this in the Seanad. It will be the same amendment but it will specify two people instead of one. My party will support that in the Seanad and we can come back here with what we need. The Minister's legal advice will be complied with, as will the committee's concern and that of the Opposition that there must be two people with clinical expertise on the board. I have a real concern that if the mechanism for bringing the stipulation from one to two people with clinical expertise - currently there is none - comes from a Bill that may go into pre-legislative scrutiny before the summer, we know it could be any amount of time before it goes through its own Report Stage. This would be a reasonable compromise to bring about the wording desired by the Minister with what the committee and the House wants, which is to have two clinical experts and one financial expert on this board.

This amendment would allow for the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to nominate a person to be a member of the board. That person could not serve in a representative function but the HSE is the single biggest employer in the State and this provision is no harm, notwithstanding the hostility sometimes expressed in here towards trade unions. I am the daughter of a trade union official and I am a former trade union official so I do not share any of that hostility. Trade unions are wonderful and this would be a wonderful nominating body to the Health Service Executive, which is the single biggest employer in the State, as I said. That is why I tabled the amendment. I consulted some of the representative groups within the health service. In other State enterprises the workers have a representative, notwithstanding the fact that the person could not act in a representative capacity. The purpose of the amendment is for a person to bring to the table the experience of being an employee of the HSE, which is really not as much fun as people might imagine all the time. We often are charged in here with being ideological, as if that is bad.I do not think there is enough ideology in this place sometimes but that is where my amendment is coming from.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	405	A discussion of our ideologies could be interesting. I want to make it very clear, as I think I did on previous Stages in the Seanad, that I certainly do not doubt that a person nominated by ICTU could well have all the qualities and experience needed to be an effective member of the HSE board. Based on my interactions with the trade union movement, I have no doubt about the calibre or experience of those individuals but I would stress that the issue is not about calibre. The issue is about nominees to the board by stakeholder groups. Having nominees by any individual organisation would not be good practice in the context of the HSE board and would inevitably result in requests for a range of other groups to nominate to membership of the board. We already take account of clinical, financial and patient advocacy expertise. Pointing out clinical expertise, they will presumably and potentially be employees of our health service as well. I do not think anyone, including Deputy O'Reilly, wants to see our board constructed by a series of nominations by a series of stakeholder groups. For those reasons and not the calibre of individuals, I do not intend to accept this amendment.

This amendment would require him or her to make himself or herself available to come before a committee, a definition of which is contained in the amendment. This is a belt-and-braces effort. We have seen issues with boards and members of boards. Notwithstanding the fact that they are all appointed in good faith and no Minister appoints a person to a board believing that he or she will not be the best person for the job, a second option in terms of oversight is proposed here.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	411	We already have guidelines on appointments to State boards that set out the confirmation process for chairperson. In fact, I think the chair designate of the HSE board offered to go before the Joint Committee on Health and the committee decided it did not need to meet with him. Persons being proposed by the Minister for appointment as chairpersons of State boards or agencies are required to make themselves available to the appropriate Oireachtas committee to discuss the approach they will take to their role as chairperson and their views about the future contribution of the body or board in question. This is a proportionate approach to take where the proposed chairperson comes before the relevant committee. I think it works well in practice. This amendment would place in legislation a requirement not only that the proposed chairperson but all the proposed members of the board would have to come before the committee to discuss their approach and views about the future contribution of the board. When this amendment was put forward previously, the point was made that the chairperson has a crucial role in leading the board. Collectively, we made a conscious decision in recent years to take politics and party politics out of selecting board members. As a result, the Public Appointments Service makes a recommendation to the Minister independent of the Minister, people are short-listed and the chair then goes before the committee. I worry whether this amendment would bring a degree of politicisation into the process. I am not sure about its appropriateness. I note that there is no requirement in the code of practice for other members to appear. I appreciate what Deputy O'Reilly is trying to do but we would be placing a much higher burden on a member of this board than on a member of any other board in the State. I am not sure that is the best way to attract people to put themselves forward for State boards. I am satisfied that the current guidelines are appropriate and that the chair would come before the committee, as appropriate. Indeed, that would be at the request of the chairperson. 
#LouiseOReilly	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-party	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-dob	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	412	I move amendment No. 8:In page 14, lines 36 to 38, to delete all words from and including "without" in line 36 down to and including "given" in line 38. This amendment is about people essentially double jobbing. Running the HSE is a very extensive and important job. We read in the newspapers that it is also an extremely well remunerated job. I do not believe it is appropriate for the CEO to have another job or to sit on the boards of other companies or businesses while he or she is operating as the head of the HSE. We have seen how a person who occupied that role sat on the board of a US company that could do business with the HSE at some point. I understand that this was approved by the Minister but that does not make it right. If we are to have someone heading up the HSE, his or her focus should be solely on that job. We are asking this person to implement Sláintecare. That is an eight-days-a week, 24-hours-a-day job. We have already lost considerable time with regard to Sláintecare. This person will be very well paid. I am not sure he or she would need to seek other employment. We are asking this person to do a very onerous and important job and we want him or her to get it right on behalf of the State. I do not believe that is compatible with having another commitment. It is possible for this individual to have all those opportunities to sit on boards and take up other work when he or she retires but I feel very strongly that the sole focus of the person who heads up the HSE should be the HSE. 
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	413	I had different views on this because we strengthened this legislation compared with the Health Act 2004, which did not suggest that the CEO would have to seek board approval for any other office, employment, business or the like. However, I am persuaded by the argument put forward by Deputy O'Reilly and am happy to accept the amendment.
#LouiseOReilly	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-party	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-dob	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	414	I move amendment No. 9:In page 18, lines 12 and 13, to delete ", or has been, or may at a future time be,".This concerns the capacity of people to tell the future. We have entered into another realm. I was struggling with the words used in the Bill, on which we had a discussion on Committee Stage. I do not understand why the wording is included in this section. It gives the CEO the option of not disclosing any information if he or she has the capacity to simply say that it might be the subject of court proceedings. On the basis that anything someone says could be the subject of court proceedings, a person would have cover to say absolutely nothing. I will not get into a debate about whether we sometimes have to drag answers out of people but it is on the public record that sometimes we do. It is about removing the excuse that it may cause an issue at some future time. Allowing a CEO not to disclose information on the grounds that something might be the subject of court proceedings in the future is very confusing. It gives the head of the HSE the opportunity to effectively operate a veto on discussing important issues, which makes me very concerned. That veto is very broad. It is a very broad interpretation. My amendment is proportionate and in order and eliminates the possibility that the CEO can do this in the future. Deputy Donnelly and I discussed this anomaly and the recognition of it on Committee Stage. I think there was consensus at the committee. Most of the amendments were withdrawn and we agreed we would have the discussion here on the floor of the House. We had a small discussion, the anomaly was recognised and all I am seeking to do here is rectify that.

I agree with everything Deputy O'Reilly has just said. If the amendment were made, the Bill would essentially state that the chief executive is not required to give evidence relating to something that may in the future be a matter for the courts or a tribunal. Within the world of healthcare, that is literally everything, so we could find ourselves in a very peculiar situation in which a committee is looking for information from the chief executive and he or she would just say no they are not required to answer any questions because everything said could at some point in the future come before the courts. I will support the amendment. On reflection, though, there is an argument to delete the whole paragraph to be amended and I will explain why. Standing Order 59 is the one that, from memory, states that Members of the Oireachtas shall not comment on live legal proceedings in very specific situations - by my understanding it is where there is a jury involved and the discussions in the Houses of the Oireachtas may influence the judge or the jury. It is therefore a very narrow restriction on debate in this House. It is broadly interpreted in the House to the effect that we should not talk about live court cases, but my understanding is that we are not prevented from doing so. I have encountered this before. This is nothing to do with the Minister, Deputy Harris, but another Cabinet Minister refused to talk about Enet, the broadband contract, because the Department had lodged an appeal which would be heard in about a year's time and therefore, he said, he was prevented under Standing Orders from even discussing the issue. I looked into Standing Order 59 and it turns out he was in no way so prevented. I therefore make the point to the Minister, Deputy Harris, that even when it comes to matters which are before the courts, it is entirely in order in this House to talk about them, except under Standing Order 59, whereby we may end up influencing a jury or a judge. Say we wanted to talk about CervicalCheck, which we talked about this morning. One could argue that a chief executive could come in and say he or she cannot talk about CervicalCheck because it is before the courts. We could say we want to talk about patient safety in maternity hospitals but a chief executive could say he or she cannot talk about that because it is also before the courts. Healthcare being what it is, one can be pretty sure that when it comes to most issues the committee would like to discuss, based on this paragraph a chief executive could if he or she so wished say a case involving the matter is before the courts. We therefore do not have the mechanism to do this. I would like to see this provision removed because the danger that discussions in the Oireachtas might prejudice the outcomes of court cases is already covered in the Standing Orders of the House. Anyway, this does not relate to the amendment. I welcome and will support Deputy O'Reilly's amendment. I am just making the point that all the amendment seeks to do is to delete ", or has been, or may at a future time be,". The fact that something was before the courts in the past should in no way allow any chief executive say, for example, in 1984 there was a case on this so he or she will not talk about it; that in the future, hypothetically, the organisation could be taken to court over anything he or she says or any of the issues discussed and he or she will not talk about them. I would go further. I refer to the issues before the courts now, just like CervicalCheck. We had four hours' debate on CervicalCheck this morning. This would allow a chief executive to say, sorry, but he or she cannot talk about CervicalCheck because there are multiple live cases before the courts. I will make an additional point. I certainly did not understand Standing Order 59. I assumed it meant that none of us can really discuss issues that are before the courts. My understanding is that we actually can. We do so all the time. We talked about CervicalCheck this morning. I would therefore love to see the paragraph deleted. I do not believe it serves democracy or accountability at all. We will support Deputy O'Reilly's amendment.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	416	I am disappointed by the position being adopted because I think it means it is likely that the amendment might pass. I need to put on the record of the House my concerns in this regard. The first point is that this is the law today, so when Deputies were at the health committee meeting this morning discussing CervicalCheck, this was the law and has been the law in the Health Act since 2004, a law brought forward by Fianna Fáil when in government. It was brought forward for good reason and not just in the Health Acts but in, I think, 25 other pieces of legislation since, including the Data Protection Act, the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Act, the National Shared Services Office Act, the Roads Act, the Workplace Relations Act, the Legal Services Regulation Act, the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act, the Competition and Consumer Protection Act and the Education and Training Boards Act. This is probably legislation on which most of us have voted and which most of us have supported. The rationale here is not to protect the entity before the committee, the HSE in this case; it is to protect the individual who may end up being adversely impacted, accidentally and unintentionally, in this regard. Often there is a lot of good work done in these Houses. We do not all discharge our duties as responsibly as we should all of the time. This is a protection for the individual. The CEO, as the House will be aware, is required to present before a committee to give an account of the general administration of the HSE. The proposed amendment would remove the current law that stipulates that the CEO is not required to give an account before a committee of any matter which has been or may at a future time be the subject of proceedings before a court or tribunal. I fully appreciate exactly what Deputy O'Reilly is trying to do here, and she has articulated it very clearly. She is trying to ensure that no one can come before a committee and obfuscate and say he or she will not answer because the matter is before a court or tribunal, or may be in the future. I get what the Deputy is trying to do, but it is important to clarify that this is a provision in place today. Whatever else the health committee might say, it has not been unable to have very detailed and robust discussions, for example, on the issue of CervicalCheck, or on many other important issues. This has been part of our health laws since 2004, when the Health Act was first enacted. The provision has been used very sparingly and is designed to protect the integrity of future legal cases, or indeed past cases, where a confidentiality or personal information aspect may arise. It is fair to say that over the time the provision has been in force regarding the HSE, there have been many occasions on which the CEO or the director general has come before the committee and the provision has not arisen. It is also important to say that where the CEO is of the opinion that a matter has been or may at a future time be a subject of proceedings before a court or a tribunal, he or she needs to inform the committee of the reason and rationale for that opinion, and it is then open to the Chairman of the committee, or indeed the CEO, if he or she believes someone is hiding behind the provision, to seek recourse to our courts. As I said, this procedure has been in our Health Act since its very beginning, it was in precedents before then and it has continued to be in legislation since then. I am concerned about abandoning the precedent and I remain of the view that we need to protect the integrity of past and future court proceedings, not for the corporate entity but for the integrity of the individual before the court. This is why I would rather the amendment did not pass. I believe this provision protects the individual. As I said, the CEO must give reasons for his or her opinion and if, having heard the reasons for the CEO's opinion, the committee still feels that the CEO needs to give an account, we have recourse to the courts. Indeed, we have seen these Houses interact with our courts on occasion. This is real and practical; it is not some abstract concept. There have already been situations in which this has happened. For example, the HSE would remind us that there was a matter before the joint committee in 2015 relating to foster care. I will not get into the specifics of the matter, but people will be aware of it as it is a matter of public record. The director general at the time was very limited in what he could comment on publicly as the matter was subject to a Garda investigation and I think this rationale was accepted by the committee. A follow-up briefing was then provided to the committee, so instead of an oral presentation there was a way of dealing with the matter that could get the committee the information. I am not against the amendment because I wish to slow down the work of committees or stop the flow of information to them. I am just of the genuine view that this is a very long-standing precedent, not just in health law, but right across the range of our public services. It is one that this House put into the Health Act in 2004. I do not think it has caused a problem but I can see a particular problem were it not there. I would reference as an example that foster care case of 2015, where the provision was used and, I believe, accepted by the committee as seemingly reasonable. The committee did not want to cause harm. It asked for help in being provided with a briefing in another way that would enable it to get the information it needed, and that was carried out satisfactorily.

What happened in it would, I believe, have happened had this provision not been in place. People just behaved sensibly, decently and with due regard to the victim. I do not believe that removing the veto would encourage or force people to behave in a way that was anything less than decent and anything other than exactly the way in which they did behave in that instance.I am minded to push this amendment. I have not been convinced by the argument made by the Minister. To me, it offers a veto. The difference between now and 2004 is that there is much discussion in the public domain regarding committees, what they can and cannot do, who can ask what, whether they should ask it, who is going to court etc. Given that environment, I am unhappy that the head of the HSE would have a veto on answering questions on the basis that something might happen. I do not believe removing this aspect will encourage people to behave in a way that is anything less than decent, as they did in 2015. Notwithstanding that, had the provisions not been there, I do believe the proceedings would have happened exactly as they did. That is because they happened in that way out of respect for the victim.

#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	435	The Government is conscious of the vital role played by the agrifood sector in sustaining the rural economy and rural communities across Ireland. There is no doubt that the agrifood sector faces considerable challenges arising from Brexit. The Government is doing everything it can, however, to ameliorate the potential impacts. In addition to the range of measures I have deployed over the last three budgets, including low-cost loan schemes and supports for product and market diversification, I and my officials have been in ongoing discussions with the European Commission in relation to the potential supports that may be required for the agrifood sector in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Most recently, I met with Commissioner Hogan in the margins of last month's Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels to discuss the potential impact a no-deal Brexit could have on the agrifood sector and the Commission's readiness to deploy support measures to help mitigate the potential impacts on farmers, fishermen and businesses in the sector. Contacts are ongoing in this regard. Irish agrifood exports have proven their ability to compete on European Union and international markets, with the value of total agrifood exports having increased by 78% in value between 2009 and 2018, from €7.8 billion to €13.9 billion according to the Central Statistics Office. This growth has been driven by the strong reputation Irish product has in meeting the highest standards of food safety and animal welfare, quality and nutrition. Third country markets also form an increasing proportion of total agrifood exports. In 2018, approximately 27% of our agrifood exports were to non-EU markets. This represents a marked increase from 2009, when they accounted for 20% of the value of exports. Half of our export growth since 2010 has come from markets outside Europe, led by a sixfold increase in exports to China, a doubling to the rest of Asia and North America and a rise of 40% in trade to the Middle East and Africa. Developing new markets and growing existing markets, based on market insights, is one of the five themes of Food Wise 2025, the ten-year strategy for the agrifood sector. Market development and diversification is also a key response to the challenges which Brexit poses for the agrifood, in particular, the beef sector. In April 2017, I launched a seven-point action plan on market access, which is being implemented through a variety of actions. These include a market prioritisation exercise for meat, dairy, prepared consumer foods, beverages and seafood, as well as subsequent detailed studies carried out by Bord Bia on behalf of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. A market access web portal was also launched in May 2018. It is available on the Department's website and provides a wide range of valuable information to exporters. In 2018 a number of additional markets were opened by the Department, including the Chinese beef market, following years of sustained effort. There has also been an enhanced programme of Government agrifood trade missions to key new markets. In respect of meat, the market prioritisation exercise identified the top five countries selected as priority markets as Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, South Korea and Vietnam. A very similar list of countries emerged in respect of dairy but with the inclusion of Indonesia instead of Mexico. New priority markets have also been identified for beverages, prepared consumer foods and seafood. China was not considered for the deep dive analysis as it was believed that a very significant level of market intelligence and information on the market was already available. Nonetheless it remains a priority market for the meat and dairy sectors in particular. Along with beef, seafood is another sector which is hugely exposed to the potential consequences of Brexit both in terms of access to resources and to destination markets. My Department has provided an additional €2 million in funding in 2019, matching what was received in 2018 under the European maritime fisheries fund operational programme. The actions funded have already helped to inform how we target markets abroad. Live exports are part of the overall export dynamic and provide a critically important alternative market for Irish farmers. In 2018, the volume of live exports increased by some 30%. Just last month, I visited Turkey to make it clear that Ireland can continue to supply quality livestock for the Turkish market. Trade missions play an important role in market development and I have been very active on this front in recent years as we strive to gain, and then develop, a presence in as many global markets as possible. Trade missions have an important role and will become even more important for market development, particularly post Brexit. I have led very successful missions to the Gulf region, the United States, Mexico, Japan and Korea in 2017, and to the US, Canada, China, Indonesia and Malaysia in 2018. These missions included participants from across the agrifood sector and featured extensive trade contacts as well as high-level political discussions. Taking all of this into account, this year in addition to the trade mission I already led to Turkey, I will lead trade missions to China in May, Japan and South Korea in June and Algeria and Egypt in November My Department currently has agriculture attachés based in London, Brussels, Paris, Rome, Geneva, Washington, Beijing and Abu Dhabi. These officers play a significant role in developing our relationships with governments and official agencies in these countries. Those placed in countries outside of the EU are essential in acquiring key intelligence on agrifood issues and progressing through the various systems to achieve market access for a variety of agrifood products. In the context of the Global Ireland 2025 initiative we are creating four new agriculture attaché positions in Berlin, Tokyo, Seoul and Mexico city. The decision to place an attaché in Berlin is informed by the need to diversify our export markets from the UK. Berlin will provide a basis to support further trade development work not only in Germany, but also in eastern Europe. The positions in Tokyo, Seoul and Mexico city are to assist in the process of gaining access for Irish agriculture products given that free trade agreements have recently been agreed by Japan, Korea and Mexico with the European Union. They also reflect the outcome of Bord Bia’s market prioritisation report, which has identified these countries among the priority markets for the Irish agrifood and fisheries sectors over the coming years. In addition to establishing attaché posts in a number of new locations, we have also stated our intention to take on local hires in certain locations in order to provide, for example, local knowledge and specialist expertise in supporting our market access and trade development work. This is all part of our work in market diversification in line with the Food Wise strategy and our seven-point market access plan announced in the wake of the Brexit decision.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	436	I welcome the opportunity to discuss the threat posed by Brexit to our agrifood sector. We are having this debate against the backdrop of the continuing chaos at Westminster, where it is still no clearer what might unfold or what the final landing place will be in respect of the UK's decision to leave the European Union. Whether it is a case of a hard Brexit or a soft Brexit, the decision will have as significant an impact on our country as it will on the UK, with regard to the agrifood sector in particular. While the total share of our national exports sent to Britain is 17%, the figure has varied between 36% and 40% for agrifood exports over the last few years. That shows how exposed agrifood is to any disruption to east-west trade and the absolute importance of taking the necessary steps to prepare for and mitigate against any such disruption caused by either a soft Brexit or a hard Brexit, although there is a particular urgency to preparing for a hard Brexit. As the Minister well knows, some of our sectors are particularly exposed. The beef sector in particular is in the eye of the storm. We saw the impact on the horticulture sector 18 months ago when Brexit was first decided upon. The resulting turmoil in the sterling exchange rate wiped out some of our mushroom sector and put massive pressure on the horticulture sector as a whole. That is nothing compared to the pressure the sector will be under in the case of a hard Brexit. When horticulture was feeling this pressure 18 months ago the Government did not step in to support the sector. Some businesses went to the wall. We cannot, under any circumstances, see a repeat of that in respect of the wider agrifood sector. It was unfortunate and unacceptable that the sector was left to fend for itself at that stage. There were job losses as a result of the lack of sufficient support to get the sector through its time of need which, thankfully, did ease as sterling stabilised. The response to Brexit of the Government and of the Minister has not been what it needs to be. There is still a lack of clarity about what measures will be in place in the event of a hard Brexit. I have said this to the Minister on a number of occasions in the Dáil. Whenever we have previously sought clarity from the Minister on the Government's Brexit response his big-ticket item in respect of the provision of assistance has been the introduction of a Brexit loan scheme. That scheme was announced in October 2017 and funding was provided for it in budget 2018. Despite the Minister selling it as one of his key Brexit measures throughout that period, that loan scheme did not materialise until it was announced last Wednesday, just a few days ago, as a means to deal with the threat posed by a hard Brexit. It was certainly not the type of product the Minister initially marketed it as, which was a measure to prepare the State for Brexit. In his recent responses the Minister has been telling us that the additional funding provided for the areas of natural constraint and beef schemes is part of his response to Brexit. Again, I do not accept that. It is part of the normal course of events and a necessary development within the agrifood sector rather than something that is specific to Brexit. We need more clarity as to what the situation will be in the event of a hard Brexit. Of course enveloping all of this at all stages has to be the national priority of ensuring that a hard Brexit does not happen. If it were to happen - it could happen in as little as a week and a half at this stage in the event of the withdrawal agreement not being agreed and no extension being granted - we still do not have any clarity as to what exactly the Government or the European Commission would do to support our agrifood sector. The stakeholders in the sector have made it clear that what will be needed in that event is support to mitigate any disruption arising from the imposition of tariffs. The traditional tools such as aid to private storage or intervention would not be appropriate because, as the Minister has accepted, they would lead to displacement from British shelves and a loss of market space which would be very difficult to recover. We would have to ensure that we keep our product moving into Britain in the short term. The best way to do that would be emergency initial aid. With less than two weeks to go, there should be a lot more clarity from the Minister and the European Commission with regard to what is on the table. We also have to accept that Brexit has already been having an impact on the beef sector in particular over recent months. Prices are as low as they have been for many years.Beef farmers have been losing their shirts on the prices for finished cattle in recent months. The Minister needs to respond via immediate emergency aid that recognises that the beef market is being undermined by poor prices and the backdrop of Brexit. Support from the Minister needs to be forthcoming immediately. There is capacity for this, given the permitted increase in de minimis state aid from €15,000 to €25,000. In particular, the Minister should work with the European Commission to ensure immediate support for our beef sector, which is already suffering. We have not seen the type of recruitment of veterinary and sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, officials that was mooted by the Government last summer. Unlike the Netherlands, which has recruited more than 1,000 customs and veterinary officials, or Northern Ireland, which I am informed has recruited specific officials, we have not seen the same happening in the Republic. Capacity has not been put in place to meet the challenge. Without it, redeployment will be required, resulting in a drain on other resources. What arrangements will be in place as regards our all-island animal health status and approach, our standards and our North-South trade? This is linked to the wider issue of a Border plan. Will the Minister work with the EU, Northern Ireland and Britain to ensure that there is either no disruption or as little disruption as possible in the event of a hard Brexit happening soon? Businesses in the agrifood sector are in the dark about what would happen in that eventuality. There is no clarity around the Government's plans and there is a lack of faith in whether the Government has a handle on the steps that need to be taken. All of our national efforts in the coming days must be aimed towards avoiding a hard Brexit while preparing for the worst. We must work with our European partners on accommodating any extension that is necessary to give the British side space and time and we must avoid doing anything that would assist in them accidentally crashing out as a result of the chaotic politics we are witnessing in Britain day after day. That must be our key objective. Avoiding any type of Brexit, particularly the hardest one, is undoubtedly in our national interest and essential for the future sustainability of our agrifood sector.

#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	438	Yes, at five minutes each. I have been reading through the Minister's comments on the agrifood sector and Brexit. We are at a critical point. Many in our rural economy are waiting on a knife edge to find out what their futures will be. In the Border counties and the west in particular, where farming income levels are probably the lowest, people have been waiting a long time. There are especially serious concerns in the beef sector. I read with interest the Minister's comments in that regard. While more than 50% of Irish beef is exported to Britain, that poses a major problem, given the introduction of the tariffs that were mentioned. The Minister stated that many of our other markets had expanded, for example, in the Middle East, China and elsewhere in the Far East. Some markets had increased to 27% while others in Asia and elsewhere had increased by 40%. What percentage of our overall agrifood exports do those markets represent? The increases could be starting from a low level. We export much of our product into Britain and other countries in Europe. In percentage terms, the increases elsewhere look good on paper. In real terms, though, we are moving low levels of food into those markets. The EU will have to come on board and support Ireland through this critical time. It is imperative that a scheme be put in place to compensate for the tariffs that Britain will charge. This is the only way to ensure that Irish beef continues to be put on shelves in Britain and holds on to its market share. That is vital for the future. The question of exporting food across the British landbridge has still not been resolved satisfactorily. Most people recognise that transport mechanisms that take our foodstuffs around Britain to reach Europe will take much longer and be more expensive and difficult. The issue of live exports has been mentioned. While the percentage of live exports has increased, this has only happened in a certain sector, namely, dairy calves. Live exports of finished cattle should not be, and are not, the answer. We need to find markets for our finished food products. I have heard increasing talk of something in recent days. Processors in Ireland have meat processing facilities across the water in Britain, and I understand they are considering the possibility of moving their operations there, bringing live cattle across and killing and processing them there instead of here. That would have a negative impact on the prices farmers get at Irish marts and on the sector as a whole, including employment therein. There are also serious concerns in our beverage industry about how this situation will be resolved in the long term. Regardless of whether there is a crash or a deal, Britain will leave the EU. No matter the mechanisms or agreements that are put in place afterwards, the following period - it will probably be five to ten years - will be difficult for the agrifood sector. While the dairy industry is somewhat stronger than the beef industry and has more flexibility, the latter is already in crisis. We need to consider how to market our product better in other places. In order to do that, we must recognise that we are probably going to have to contract. We will have to produce less for a certain period and get a higher price for it by marketing it properly, with specific reference to the unique qualities that Irish food has, for example, grass-fed beef, family farms, traceability, etc. All of these models need to be emphasised more and more and we need to find markets for our product. Its scarcity will be a factor, as we will not be producing as much. I have come to the view that we are producing too much beef to be sustainable, and that is even before Brexit. When Brexit kicks in, the danger will increase. The Government must do what it can to prepare for Brexit. Ultimately, however, Brexit is a problem between the EU and Britain, and the EU must recognise that Ireland will be a severe casualty. It will have to step in with the funding necessary to protect our vital industries, in particular the agrifood sector.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	439	As the chaos continues in Britain regarding Brexit with still no idea of how it will finish up, be it with a hard border, a soft border or, preferably from my point of view, no border at all, it is only right and proper that we are again discussing agrifood market concerns and priorities post Brexit. As I have said time and again, the number one priority should be and needs to be that, post Brexit, there would be no physical border on the island of Ireland. The agrifood sector is the sector that will suffer the greatest damage in the event of a crash-out Brexit.Regardless of what type of Brexit occurs, this sector, which is vitally important to my Border constituency will be impacted. Within my Cavan-Monaghan constituency, we have producers of high quality beef, poultry, pigs, milk and mushrooms and long-established, highly respected processing plants. This entire sector must be protected, both pre and post Brexit. This involves securing the livelihoods of the farming community, ensuring a continuing top quality level of produce and keeping all existing markets open while identifying new markets. This must involve support from Europe. We never asked for this Brexit mess to be foisted upon us. We have had our own homegrown difficulties arising from the banking crisis. We believe that real and tangible support to help build a bulwark against the worst effects of Brexit must now be forthcoming from the European Union. Similarly our Government, in preparation for the hit that our economy is going to take regardless of what type of Brexit presents, must sponsor an injection of investment to help steady the ship in the short to medium term until these sectors level out and can identify new opportunities for growth. A strong CAP budget post Brexit is also vital to protect the agricultural sector across Europe over the period ahead. This is a must and the Government must make strong representations on this and must approach it on an island-of-Ireland basis if at all possible. The nature of the sector North-South shows deeply developed integration with the inter-trading of live and processed produce and unprocessed produce for finishing. This happens currently in a co-operative manner with few barriers, yet in a stringent and well regulated market. The British market is, of course, hugely important to our agrifood sector. While we want to see that retained in the event of a hard, crash-out Brexit, we will be forced to look to new pastures. In the event of punitive tariffs and trade duties, we must get serious support from Europe to get our agrifood produce into new markets as soon as possible and at sustainable, rewarding prices. With pressures already showing on the horizon regarding climate change and sustainability of the agri sector, the last thing we need is tonnes of food rotting in processing facilities and warehouses or held up in delays at customs posts and ports on this island, in Britain, or on mainland Europe. We must do all we can to maintain our food standards. There can be no acceptance of low quality processed food being allowed into Ireland post Brexit through either the front or the back door. We have the best standards of quality food production in Europe, if not the world, so let us do all we can to preserve those standards and to help ensure not only the sustainability of the agrifood sector across this land but its development and that it will thrive in the years before us.

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	443	That is typical of Fine Gael. I have had a long-held view, expressed almost three years ago, that while Brexit will take place in some shape or form, nevertheless, in 2026, ten years after Britain passed the referendum, we will still be talking about the process, ramifications and consequences for Europe, the UK and Ireland. I am more convinced now than when I first expressed that view that I will be broadly right. The only certainty, after two years and ten months, remains the uncertainty attached to this whole process. It is our bounden duty to establish possible market priorities post Brexit and this debate is focused on that. Insofar as one can engage in such a cause or pursuit, our best efforts must be made to avoid a hard border at all costs. There will, nonetheless, be some ramifications and consequences for us. We are all aware of the significant trade exposure of various sectors of the Irish economy in a European context and, in particular, the centrality of our trading relationship with the UK. Ireland's food and live animal sectors are substantially more exposed to the UK than those of any other EU member state so market diversification has to be a major priority. This must include product diversification and the development of new products which I know is part of the Minister's focus. It is worth reviewing the statistics to get a focused view of the exposure of the Irish economy to Brexit. Irish exports to the UK were 37% of our food exports in 2018. Statistics on the exposure of the main sectors show 51% of beef exports, 56% of pigmeat exports, 79% poultry exports, 25% of all dairy exports but 50% of our cheese exports, 62% of prepared consumer food exports and 26% of our beverage exports are to the United Kingdom. Copenhagen Economics estimates a 40% increase in trade costs in a free trade agreement scenario due to customs impact and regulatory divergence. Some 850,000 trucks travel by ferry between Ireland and the UK each year, 45% of which contain perishable food and drink. The majority of Ireland's €4.5 billion food and drink exports to the EU 26 use the UK land bridge and the amounts of Irish meat exports are even larger. For fresh food and drink produce, the shortest crossing is critical. Ireland to Calais by the land bridge is a journey of approximately ten and a half hours but, if one has to travel to Cherbourg, the journey is approximately 20 hours. Our priority must be to get an ambitious EU-UK future trade agreement which avoids tariffs, tariff rate quotas, TRQs, regulatory divergence and all that. We must avoid a hard border with Northern Ireland as part of the imperatives of the Good Friday Agreement. We must have state aid for stabilisation, competitiveness and some diversification to remedy what will be a serious disturbance in the economy due to the fracture in the Single Market and I will refer to that later. There will be an impact even if it is a soft border, particularly on exchange rates. Custom burdens and regulatory checks, especially with animals, must be part of any future trade agreement. There will have to be mutual recognition of standards and custom codes. There will have to be collaboration in relation to veterinary and phytosanitary certification. The transiting of goods across the UK land bridge is critical. How that is achieved will be very important and our input will have to be critical to a future trade arrangement taking into account the all-Ireland dimensions in relation to recognition of technical applications and the seamless system that is there. There is a significant amount of work to be done. I realise that 25% of our exports are now going to non-EU countries and that is a significant increase over the past decade. It is all the result of a drive and necessity to develop new markets but they must be profitable. I note the number of trade missions that the Minister is going to embark upon this year in seeking to establish us in new and hopefully profitable global markets. We are talking about agriculture and agrifood, a highly export-orientated sector. We are trying to sell the produce of about 140,000 family farms across the country, predominantly grass-based enterprises. It is important to try and cultivate that and secure a competitive advantage over other grass-based enterprises. An average farm size is 32.5 hectares. The farms are much bigger down the south and the east coast. The Minister would probably not see many farms of that size but 32.5 hectares would be a big farm in the midlands, the north and the west. There are almost 200,000 jobs supported by the agrifood sector, which includes food and drink firms, food manufacturing, wood processing, agriculture, forestry and fishing. We saw the immediate impact on the mushroom industry, that Deputy Ó Caoláin referred to, when the exchange rates started fluctuating after the vote in June 2016. We are concerned about future tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade and we have not said much about the impact of Brexit on the EU budget. This will, of course, be a major factor in the ongoing CAP negotiations. If €10 billion, €11 billion or €12 billion is taken out and 40% of all EU spending is on agriculture, there will be some hole in the bucket which somebody is going to have to try and fill. The last thing we want is a Brexit which sees the EU and UK aligned by WTO rules. We wish to see a soft Brexit with the UK staying in the Customs Union and Single Market, or at least a soft to medium Brexit whereby the UK might leave the Single Market and customs union but has a free trade agreement with the EU with no tariffs applying.In that situation, the UK would be able to do some trade deals but we would love the UK to stay in the customs union and Single Market. Brexit has the potential to cause us a loss of our preferential market access to the UK. It is clear that Irish exports to the UK would decline, as would EU exports. Our exports to less profitable markets in the EU will have to grow considerably and we will have to sell our products somewhere if we are to maintain the same level of production. Competing on EU markets, which are not elastic to the point of consuming everything produced, will immediately result in a reduction in prices at EU market level. Ultimately, there will be a collapse in Irish farm incomes. To use Disraeli's maxim, I am prepared for the worst but hope for the best. This is what we have to do. We must budget for the least worst outcome. There is a clear need for the implementation of exceptional mitigation measures because of our particular situation and unique circumstances. Tariffs are a tax on trade and commerce. These impositions will effectively destroy a significant volume of our agrifood exports to the UK. Tariffs are taxes. They are collected and go into central funds, be they Exchequer or EU. Clearly they have to be made available to defray the damage to exports and job losses. That fund should be available. Paul Kelly of IBEC's food and drink sector is an excellent analyst in this area. He has done tremendous work. Some time ago, he argued there is a need for an adjustment fund of up to 5% of the current annual export sales to the UK. This level of funding will be required for three years to help Irish companies deal with Brexit and innovate, as the Minister said, and diversify into new markets. Further refined measures have to be brought forward to ensure landbridge access to continental Europe and the provision of sufficient capacity on direct sea routes. These are critical issues that I am sure the Minister and the Department are looking into. It will only be in the event of an agreed Brexit or approval of the withdrawal agreement that the discussion to shape the future relationship between the EU and the UK will begin. Our priority will be to try to secure trade free of tariffs and quotas; the reduction to the minimum, if at all, of any regulatory divergence pertaining to food standards and phytosanitary controls; seamless alignment, particularly on an all-Ireland basis; mutual recognition of various agreements and authorities, particularly with regard to food safety; and minimising trade barriers and hurdles. This is the optimum objective. Cushioning against sterling exchange rate fluctuations will be a top priority. In a no-deal Brexit scenario, one can anticipate a sharp fall or depreciation in the value of sterling, and this could be in the order of 10% to 25%. Sterling could be up to £1.10 against €1. A broad agreement along the lines of the withdrawal agreement being negotiated would see sterling depreciate by between 2% and 5%, or about £0.90 to €1. This is critical. There is a lot of work to be done. All we can do is pray that some sense prevails over there. I get annoyed listening to people speak about what we can do. We can do our best. We have been caught up as innocent bystanders in a battle we did not cause. Very often, people state we could do this or do that. Everything is only speculation. The youngest child in a school has a better idea about what might happen than some of us here.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	444	I agree with Deputy Penrose's final sentiment. If Brexit turns out to be much nicer than we think, I will not give the Government the credit for it but if it turns out to be a disaster, I will not blame it either because we are in the hands of the Brits and they do not even know what they want themselves. It will not be our fault or credit. The Minister said developing new markets and growing existing markets based on market insights is one of the themes of Food Wise 2025. We had a little debate about food exports to Iran in the House last week and the Minister intimated Iran buys cheaper from Brazil, Australia and New Zealand, which it does, but it wants beef of a higher quality, which Ireland has. We should be looking to export to Iran. We should also get over ourselves and get out of the nonsense of sanctions against Russia, get back on good terms and sell beef and lamb there. Even if Brexit were not happening, as I have pointed out here over recent years, there are massive challenges facing the way we farm in this country. Our overdependence on dairy and cattle is problematic in a number of ways, not just environmentally. It can also be problematic because of the knock-on effect on exports. Global warming will bring more unfavourable and unpredictable weather in the future and we have seen repeated fodder shortages. This is all the more reason we should control the numbers in dairy and beef and we should not have allowed the numbers to go so high. The numbers will need to be reduced in the long term. The Department repeatedly makes the claim that we do beef and dairy better so it is irresponsible to allow other producers to fill the space we occupy in the market. Not only are these claims unsupported by evidence but a number of recent reports have highlighted how we are nowhere near being the most emission efficient producers in the field. Professor Alan Matthews of Trinity College pointed out recently that a UN Food and Agricultural Organization study found Irish greenhouse gas emissions per kg of milk are the fourth highest in the EU, exceeded only by Poland, Estonia and Bulgaria. There are advantages to be won as this can be seen as an opportunity. We cannot continue the way we are going because it is not sustainable. What we have seen regarding beef prices is a perfect example of the fact that we need to have a better handle on how we do things. We also have to reduce the size of herds. Global warming can be seen as an opportunity. Parts of Ireland could be suitable for growing different produce that may not have been a runner previously. Some people are starting to grow wine and hemp and these are perfect examples. Organic farming should be a priority for the Department and it has many positive effects. People such as the Llewellyns and McNallys in north Dublin and the Dennisons in Waterford are good examples of how well things can be done. Much of the agricultural land in Ireland has been depleted through intensive farming over the years and organic farming can address this. The insect population is in free fall and organic farming can also address this. There are increased CAP payments for smaller herd numbers if they are raised organically, meaning there are supports from Europe to make the transition. The land can be protected, the herd can be reduced and space can be freed up to diversify what farmers produce. Farmers can look for a premium for a better, healthier and more climate friendly product. Currently, only 1% of farmers grow vegetables, the lowest in the EU, and we have only 2% organic produce from the agricultural sector. We are food insecure. We even import two thirds of our animal feed from abroad, more than any other EU country. With regard to vegetables, I believe in protecting Irish farmers and the price they get for their vegetables. We should stop the bags of carrots coming in for 45 cent. The Minister should go around Italy and see whether he sees a HiAce van. Italy ignores the EU rules on it and protects Fiat. It would not let HiAces in and it never has. We would not see one there because Italy protects Fiat.

I will let Deputy Pringle in shortly. This sector is being forced to do it without the Department and sometimes it involves conflict for them with the Government, the big farmers, the big processors and the retailers. The Talamh Beo group set up in Galway recently is a perfect example. It sees what is at stake and what needs to change. A member of the group, Fergal Anderson, stated:People want good food, a good natural environment, the same things farmers want; they want farmers to make a living and take care of the land. Farmers at the moment have to maximise everything, and be good business people rather than good farmers.We’ve people involved with different ways of managing – micro dairy, direct marketing beef, rebuilding local markets, rebuilding soil.The industry has its representation – what we don’t have is someone battling from the other corner. We say – the dominant model of production is too hard on the land, on the environment. The beef market is flooded with dairy calves. What you do doesn’t happen in isolation, it has an impact. Why aren't more feeds grown in Ireland rather than imported? We can develop hemp growing, looking at different investment models, there hasn’t been long term investment in processing industries – where does the wool, the hardwood timber, the hemp get processed? It is time for a change.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	449	As is the case with everything when it come to Brexit, the issue of agriculture is up in the air and nobody knows where it will land. As other Members stated, Brexit leaves the Government in a difficult position because it does not know in what way it should prepare for change. It could go down the road of preparing for a no-deal Brexit only to find that a deal is struck and all its preparations would be thrown out the window and wasted. There is no doubt that preparing for Brexit is very difficult. It is difficult to wade one's way through it. It amazes me that we have no control over it and no real say in what happens, but we do some amount of talking about it. It is amazing how much discussion Brexit has generated in the House and throughout the country. We may not be sufficiently discussing or focusing on things which we could deal with and tackle, although that may be a discussion for another day. Beef exports to the UK make up approximately 51% of production while dairy exports to the UK account for approximately 21% of current production. A no-deal Brexit would have a very significant impact on our exports to the UK. North-South trade would also be severely impacted. That would have a significant impact across the board and all the way down to individual farmers. It is very difficult to see how it could be offset. Teagasc estimated that the tariff on meat from Ireland into the UK would be approximately 60%. Although there would still be a market there, under the 60% tariff, beef would be 60% more expensive. It would be very difficult for us to offset that and to consider how trade with that market would continue. On building up other markets outside Ireland, it took four years of negotiations, from November 2014 to November 2018, to get the Chinese market opened for Ireland. Similar will happen in trying to open markets in other countries. What must also be considered is the distance the beef must travel to the market and how that cost would be met. That cost may be equivalent or close to the tariffs that will be put on the trade in the UK. That will have to be dealt with over time and through discussions. There is a lot of work to be done by the Department, and I acknowledge it is being done, to see exactly how we can offset some of the losses that will occur over the coming years, particularly in the case of a no-deal Brexit. Several Members have referred to the impact that Brexit will have on the EU budget. What will have the biggest impact on the EU budget, however, is the militarisation of the EU which is under way. It will have a far bigger impact on the farming and agriculture budget than Brexit will ever have. That must be remembered as we run headlong into the militarisation of the EU because Brexit will be unfairly blamed for the diminished EU budget. That is very important to note. A significant amount of work remains to be done in building relationships with third countries. I agree with Deputy Wallace regarding the need to open up trade with Iran. Dealing with Iran is no worse than dealing with Saudi Arabia. Ireland was quite happy to go to Saudi Arabia and open up trade with it. We should be looking at those markets and developing them and ensuring they are there for the benefit of us all. The next couple of years will bring turmoil, as the Minister is aware. We do not know how Brexit will work out or what will happen. We will have to wait and see.

As other Members stated, there has been so much talk about Brexit that we have nearly talked ourselves out of existence. There is a definite imponderable. We do not know what will happen. Brexit is causing untold damage and uncertainty within the agricultural sector. As the Minister, Deputy Creed, and the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, who are present, know well, both being in the farming business, the agricultural sector extends far beyond the farm gate. It is of huge significance in rural Ireland, and urban Ireland if I only cared to listen. When agriculture does well, Ireland does well. Indeed, it was the farming sector that brought us out of the previous three recessions. Farmers spend money when they are making it. They employ local, buy local and support local. Obviously, this issue will require sustained interdepartmental co-operation. I have question marks regarding many Departments, how adept they are at managing change and how lethargic they are in many areas. That is why I raised the need to maintain the continued availability of favourable terms for investment in primary agricultural processing and marketing under the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, for example. That is badly needed because farmers cannot get cash. The banks are not supporting farmers who want to invest and they have not done so since the recession. They may say they are, but they are not. They are looking for huge amounts of collateral. They nearly want the farm, the farmer's partner and their children as collateral. It is ridiculous. The Government knows that, but it is not tackling the banks because it is afraid of them. The banks are controlling the Government. I acknowledge that the SBCI offers a Brexit loan scheme. Its website states that the loan scheme is offered "in partnership with the Department of Business Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine and is supported by the InnovFin SME Guarantee Facility, with the financial backing of the European Union under Horizon 2020 Financial Instruments". That quote tells us what we need to know. There are many agencies involved and the process is very bureaucratic for a farmer or agribusiness which wishes to avail of it. That said, the conditions do not make it readily accessible to many farmers, even though to apply one must have fewer than 250 employees and a turnover of €50 million or less. Only very large operations or agricultural industries would have that many employees or that much turnover. It caters for businesses with turnover of €50 million or less.

I apologise to the Minister of State. I should be blaming the Minister who is invisible when there is a crisis in agriculture, the Minister who cannot be found to tell us what is going on. We know from Teagasc that the agrifood sector in Ireland in 2016 generated 7% of gross value added, a sum of €13.9 billion, 9.8% of Ireland's merchandise exports, and provided 8.5% of national employment. Those are good figures provided by Teagasc. One must recognise the importance of the agrifood sector demonstrated by those figures and support it. When employment in inputs, processing and marketing is included, the agrifood sector accounts for almost 10% of total employment, which is a significant amount. On the contribution of the agrifood sector to the national economy, Teagasc research indicates that the agrifood sector is one of Ireland's most important indigenous manufacturing sectors, accounting for employment of approximately 167,500 people. That is massive. As a Parliament and a country, we are underselling the importance of the sector. Our schools may also have moved away from a recognition of its importance. We must send the message that farming is vitally important and a significant employer with large spin-off industries. Our agricultural exports and foreign trade are vital. The agrifood sector includes almost 700 food and drink firms throughout the country which export food, including seafood, to more than 160 countries worldwide. I compliment all those involved, such as Bord Bia and the various other enterprise agencies that went abroad and created those markets. We now need to up our game because we are under pressure. Economic activity in the agrifood sector produces a far greater return than equivalent activity in other trading sectors of the economy. This fact is not stated enough. Agriculture is our primary industry and there is traceability from field to fork, which is important. We do not have such traceability in many other areas. We have it because agrifood companies secure 74% of raw materials and services from Irish suppliers by comparison with 43% for all other manufacturing companies. That is also a significant statistic. These are important figures and we cannot shout them loudly enough. All of this demonstrates the clear necessity of maintaining a firm financial commitment to the sector through all available State bodies, particularly because of the uncertainty associated with Brexit. I wish to raise a specific issue with the Minister, Deputy Creed, related to the operation of the Brexit loan scheme. In February this year I asked him, through a parliamentary question, for the number of applications received under the scheme and the numbers approved and rejected. I also asked about the number and value of loans provided. These were very straightforward questions, to which I was expecting to receive straightforward answers. The Minister informed me that the €300 million Brexit loan scheme had opened for applications on 28 March 2018, something I knew already, and would remain open until 31 March 2020, something we also knew. The guidelines for the scheme are quite clear in that regard. A separate issue that needs to be examined is the very narrow timeframe, but I am concerned about the fact that the Minister informed me that on 22 February 2019, 462 eligible applications had been received, of which 413 had been approved and ten were ineligible. The total number of loans progressed to sanction at bank level was only 81, with a total value of €17.3 million. Thirteen were related to food businesses, with a value of €4.2 million. What is the delay in processing the loans at bank level? The Minister might answer that question. My problem again relates to the banks. They are crippling the economy, not lending, repossessing and harassing farmers and ordinary householders every day of the week. There is intimidation. If approval has been given and the applications are eligible, what is the reason for the delay in approving at bank level? It just does not add up to me or anybody else. Perhaps the Minister might address this issue. Many issues arise. As has been said, Brexit is beyond our control and we can talk all we like about what is happening across the pond. When the United Kingdom first voted in favour of Brexit, the talk from the European Union was too strong. There was talk from the Taoiseach; the Minister, Deputy Creed, and others about there being no question of having a hard border. I asked Mr. Michel Barnier about a hard border when he addressed this House. I travel once a year to Bosnia and Herzegovina and when I do, I go through a massive checkpoint on leaving Croatia. When I asked the Taoiseach at a private meeting about six or seven weeks ago what would be different in Ireland, he told me to be careful as the border could be in Rotterdam or Calais. What is going on? There is uncertainty. The Border community, which I know intimately because my wife is from a Border county, is very concerned about the possibility of there being a hard border. The statements from the Taoiseach ranged from comments on there being no hard border to soldiers at the border. Depending on what the day of the week it was, he got up and said something different. He should be reined in as he is being reckless. In fairness to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, he has done his best and kept the ship steady, but there are many questions. I hope there will be a conclusion on Brexit one way or another very soon, but I do not know what will happen then. It will be like the leaves falling off the trees in the autumn. I do not know what will happen to Fine Gael's erstwhile colleagues in government, Fianna Fáil. They will have nothing to hide behind after Brexit.

#JackieCahill	unknown-#JackieCahill-party	unknown-#JackieCahill-dob	unknown-#JackieCahill-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	491	We will not shirk our responsibilities. All of us are out knocking on doors at the moment in support of our fellow politicians who are running in the European and local elections. At virtually every door, we are asked what is going to happen with Brexit and what impact Brexit will have. None of us has a crystal ball that shows us what Westminster will do. If one wants to get depressed at the moment, all one has to do is turn on the BBC news to hear about the chaos in Westminster. There is a lack of forward planning and cohesion over there. The only thing that is certain is that Brexit has no positives for the agrifood sector. There will not be any argument on that. Deputy Penrose referred to the exchange rate. The mushroom industry, which depends significantly on the British market, descended into chaos very quickly after the UK voted to leave the EU in June 2016. This shows how vulnerable we are to fluctuations in exchange rates. When I read an article in the farming press during the week, I was interested to note that fluctuations in exchange rates at the moment are having a beneficial effect on Irish meat processors. Unfortunately, none of that is being passed back to primary producers. There has not been enough of a focus on the impact that Brexit will have on the Netherlands and Denmark, which send a serious volume of produce into the UK market. The pig sector, which has been under great pressure in our economy for the past 18 months, will be strongly affected by Brexit if Danish pigmeat, in particular, has to find other markets. This sector cannot afford any more hits. I am worried about what will happen to it if Brexit means it has to compete with the Danish pig sector to try to find new markets. The Minister has stated on a few occasions that he has confidence in the Commission and that financial aid will be provided to protect primary producers in the event of a hard or soft Brexit. Farmers on the ground do not share his confidence. I suppose the budget is the first issue. CAP negotiations are taking place. Some 38% of the entire EU budget is spent on agriculture at the moment. If the British take their money with them when they withdraw from the EU, there will be a €4 billion shortfall. The very least the Commission could do is say that this shortfall will be made up by the other 27 member states. That would give some credibility to the suggestion that the Commission will step in with proper financial aid. The CAP budget has been shrinking over time as a percentage of the EU budget. In real terms, farmers are getting an awful lot less. The food security that European farmers are providing to the people of Europe is being undervalued in each passing year. I have spoken previously about the changes in the skimmed milk powder regulations. The concessions that have been given by the Commission in the Mercosur deal are also affecting the confidence of farmers. The Commission has agreed to these concessions in full knowledge of the damage that Brexit might do to our beef industry.From media reports, Mercosur could lead to another 100,000 tonnes of beef from South America being allowed into the EU. With a British exit, the EU would be more than 116% self-sufficient in beef. Farmers and primary producers cannot have confidence that the European Commission will step up to the plate to make up for the shortfalls in income in the event of a hard Brexit. Last week Fianna Fáil put down a Private Members’ motion on beef. Beef farmers, suckler farmers, finishers and store producers are on their knees. It is a case of those who are losing the least in the beef industry. Nobody except the processors are making money. A no-deal Brexit will, unfortunately, make that situation far worse. The Minister announced many new markets around the world with Irish beef now having access to 170 countries, along with markets for live exports into many locations. Unfortunately, the volume of beef going to those markets is extremely small. While we have provided extra resources for Bord Bia, until serious amounts of product begin moving to other countries, it is hard to see how we can survive without access to the UK market. Getting market share in any country is not easy. It is a slow process. I sat on Bord Bia for six years. I am not criticising the agency. It is doing its best to establish new markets. Several years ago, it was announced that access had been secured for Irish beef to the United States market. It was claimed it would take a significant amount of Irish beef. However, only €20 million worth of beef has gone to that market since it was opened. Unfortunately, that will not have any significant impact in the context of a Brexit situation. Some people believe the dairy sector could be bombproofed for a Brexit situation. However, our cheddar cheese market is completely dependent on the UK. To change from producing cheddar to mozzarella cheese or other soft cheese products will take time, along with a significant amount of investment and research. To get markets established in different countries will take much time too. I am concerned that a hard Brexit will leave a bitter taste in the mouth, resulting in the British trying to source products elsewhere on the dairy side. Ornua has invested significantly in the UK market. Any difficulties in operating in that market are a concern. How will agrifood standards operate with the Border? Our quality assurance scheme is a bonus for selling our products worldwide. A significant amount of the milk processed by Lakelands, Glanbia and other co-ops along the Border, comes from Northern Ireland. Over time, standards will deviate. How can we operate a quality assurance scheme for a third country which the UK would become? That will create problems for marketing our products across the globe. Different standards would apply to animal health. In the past with brucellosis, there were different standards in Northern Ireland and the South. In turn this created difficulties for us and significantly delayed the eradication of brucellosis in the South. We will have no control in a hard Brexit situation over what the UK will do with animal health restrictions. The problems that could be created are endless. Several weeks ago, Deputy McConalogue and I listened to food exporters about the problems they saw emerging. The time and costs to get products to the Continent will increase with, for example, delays at the crossings at Dover. We will not realise these problems until Brexit occurs. The biggest crib is that the European Commission claims it will not let farmers down but we have no financial information forthcoming from the EU. The Commission talks about attracting young farmers into the industry but it still has a cap on incentives for young farmers entering farming. It is little wonder that farmers are nervous and worried that the Commission will not step up to the plate with the financial aids necessary in the event of a hard Brexit.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	492	The Minister is probably hearing every minute of every day about the challenge the agrifood sector is facing. He is well aware of the fear in the agricultural community about Brexit. We are looking across the water virtually every hour of every day but we still do not know what is going to happen next. Three years ago, when we first heard the rumblings about Brexit, none of us ever thought it would occur. We thought there would be some way out. Now we begin to wonder whether there is a way out. We see different scenarios in the House of Commons and we begin to think it will happen. Then, all of a sudden, some part of the jigsaw does not fit into place and we are back to square one. There is such turmoil in the British political system that it will end up in a general election there. Beef sector exports to England alone are worth in excess of €2.5 billion. In my part of the country, beef suckler schemes are important. The sector has been under enormous difficulty for quite some time. There is the beef plan movement. We have all gone to the meetings where hundreds of farmers have said that, without Brexit, they are already under pressure. We have to welcome the fact the beef scheme is up and running. Fianna Fáil pushed for it for some time. However, the €40 per head is not doing anything and it has to be upped to €200 if the sector is to have any chance of survival. Looking at the Irish Farmers' Journal and other farming publications, one will note the poor price for calves in many marts. Deputy McConalogue referred to the horticulture sector which has not been spoken about much. I know a bit about it because I studied it in college. We need to have a discussion about this as it has suffered much in recent years. It is an area we should be trying to expand through new schemes. There was great talk some time ago about import substitution. It is an area which we should tackle with a view to increasing domestic and export production. There has been a phenomenal rise in food exports. As the Minister said in his opening statement, between 2009 and 2018, it has increased from €7.8 billion to €13.9 billion. One has to acknowledge Bord Bia and others working in the sector. However, there is much more we can do. In that regard, it is good that almost 30% of agrifood exports go to non-EU countries. We are going to have to work harder on this, however. That is why I welcome the proposal of appointing agrifood attachés to countries to promote selling our products. One has to acknowledge the work done in the Chinese market. Every percent of trade one gains in such a large country with such a large population is worth a lot. However, there is still a long way to go.We should give some credit to the former Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, for this. He and his officials brought forward Food Harvest 2020, which is where much of that planning started. The Minister spoke of countries such as Mexico, South Korea, Vietnam, and Japan. At one stage, perhaps still, Japan took much of our pig meat. Deputy Cahill spoke about that sector. The pig meat producers in this country have been through very tough years. Will the Minister update me at some stage on markets and new markets in those countries because they will become very important, particularly if a no-deal Brexit occurs. There is always a big brouhaha here about people going abroad for St. Patrick's Day for trade missions. It is a very important part of selling Ireland. No matter who is in power, politicians and officials, when they go to celebrate with the Irish in other parts of the world, many of the deputations take in trade missions. On many occasions they are very productive and open up new markets, maybe not immediately but in time. The beef scheme is oversubscribed. Will the Minister assure me that all applicants will be looked after, because that is very important? There is no doubt that our biggest trading partner in agribusiness is Britain. Recently I saw a figure of €6 billion, and there is €4 billion in imports. Someone said that compared with years ago, less material is exported to great Britain now but the agrisector is the important one for us here, and it is crucial for rural Ireland. That is why there is genuine worry throughout the country about the result of Brexit. Everyone here, regardless of what side of the House they sit on, hopes that there will not be a crash out, which I fear from the way things are going. UK tariffs will pose a €1.7 billion threat to the agrifood sector. That will be some challenge. We should also bear in mind that if that happens, the price of basic food items in this country such as bread, milk, cheese, and eggs will increase. That will cause serious inflation here. The fallout would be very bad and there is no doubt that the beef and agrisector would be decimated by a crash-out, no-deal Brexit. World Trade Organization, WTO, tariffs will cost the beef sector alone around €800 million. Thinking of that kind of money sends a shiver down the spine. In my part of the country, taking the counties around me such as Roscommon, Galway, Longford, Leitrim, Cavan, Offaly and Clare, there has been a great development in the food business. There are food chains which employ between, say, five and 20 people. Their markets are Ireland, North and South, England, Wales and Scotland. They will be wiped out if we have a crash out. They will be destroyed and it will cost thousands of jobs. It is very important that we protect our very best in those businesses as they will be under severe pressure. Some of them are very good labels but their markets do not extend outside the British Isles. These are not big conglomerates such as Glanbia, Dairygold or the Kerry Group which have world markets. It is one thing when one has a world market but it is different for small processors. I refer specifically to the cheese and yoghurt businesses which have become huge. They will be very badly affected. It is a worrying situation for us all, and I acknowledge that it is not simple for the Minister's side of the House either, because we do not know what is going to happen across the water, but we must have more preparation.
#MichaelCollins2016	unknown-#MichaelCollins2016-party	unknown-#MichaelCollins2016-dob	unknown-#MichaelCollins2016-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2019-04-03 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	493	We all know at this stage that Brexit will have many implications for Ireland, some we can predict and some we cannot, but one thing that is for sure is that there will be many challenges ahead and it is vital that we do everything in our power to protect Ireland and its industries and markets from any negative backlash as a result of Brexit. Ireland is very dependent on its agriculture exports sector. The food industry is the sector of our economy most exposed to Brexit, particularly subsectors such as processed foods, beef and dairy. Ireland exports almost 70% of its agricultural produce to Britain. The UK is Ireland’s largest market for food and drink, with 40% of our food exports destined for the UK. A reduction in access to the UK market would have a very negative impact on the Irish beef sector and potentially on the overall EU beef market. The 270,000 tonnes of Irish beef exports to the UK represent almost 10% of the intra-EU beef trade. The displacement of these exports would have a serious effect on the overall EU market. The Irish farming and food sector has a higher dependence on the UK market when compared with other sectors in Ireland, making it the most exposed sector to any negative economic impact of the UK Brexit decision. Additional tariffs for the Irish agrifood sector as a whole on exports to the UK would add an estimated €1.7 billion in costs. This could reduce or potentially wipe out Irish exports of beef, dairy and pig meat to the UK market. We already see that Brexit is causing great uncertainty across the board, such as the current chaos in the Irish agriculture industry. The uncertainty is being felt hard by our farmers and beef farmers are experiencing huge reductions in their incomes as a result. I am shocked and appalled at the lack of urgency and concern the Government has shown these beef farmers. Factories are cutting beef prices, which are down 25% to 40% per kg, or about €150 per head. This is a serious concern. Our beef farmers are losing money and many will not be able to stay in business. These price cuts are here before Brexit has hit us, and I am scared to think of the outcome when Brexit is here and the full reality is felt. Brexit is a great excuse for the factories to cut the prices of beef, and very few have been able to counteract that so far. We need to look at our dairy industry. Ireland is the only significant exporter of cheddar cheese to the UK market and the UK market is the only market of significance for Irish cheddar. We export 78,000 tonnes of cheddar cheese, or 82% of all cheddar cheese imported by the UK. It is vital that we will have tariff-free access to the UK market. The Copenhagen Economics report for the Government estimates that the UK’s departure from the European Union will cause the value of output from these key parts of the agrifood sector to fall by between 10% and 20% by 2030. The sector employs 175,000 people with a great number of people employed directly in the wider rural areas in agrifood production. Brexit will be felt right across rural Ireland. This could mean 17,000 fewer jobs or more than 30,000 fewer jobs in the case of a hard Brexit. The Government needs to support the agriculture industry by ensuring that a meaningful support package from the EU is put in place. There is no question that the Mercosur trade deal must be suspended. We need to see that live exports will be supported with more lairage and an increase in ferry capacity. The Government needs to acquire further markets for live exports of cattle. Furthermore, it is vital that the suckler cow support be at €200 per cow if farmers are to have any chance of survival. It cannot be €40 in very difficult times, a level which shocked many farmers after the previous budget. That is not how the Government shows that it wishes to protect the rural family farm.With these uncertain times ahead, and especially with the chance of a no-deal Brexit on the cards, EU agrifood operators are begging for extra aid as the clock ticks down to the cliff edge of Brexit. There are big fears out there that the existing EU contingency measures will not prevent significant disruption of supply chains in the case of a no-deal. We will need contingency measures for the agrifood sector such as temporary fast-track customs procedures, mutual EU and UK recognition of food safety standards, a grace period on product labelling and a roll-over on haulier licences. Brexit not only will affect the agrifood suppliers, but everyone in Ireland will pay the price for a no-deal Brexit. The Economic and Social Research Institute looked at 4,500 products imported from the UK and it found that a no-deal scenario could add 30% to the price of bread and cereals. Cheese and egg prices could rise by as much as 46%, while meat, sugar, confectionery, coffee and tea could see hikes of between 20% and 30%. Not only do we need to protect our agrifood market, we also need to protect our fishermen. Coming from west Cork, I know only too well how much our fishermen have suffered in recent years. Last week, I was appalled by the manner in which the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill 2017 was rushed through this House. Does the Government realise the seriousness of the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill 2017? It allows fishing vessels registered in Northern Ireland to fish inside our six mile limit, but a loophole that is in the Bill could allow foreign vessels registered in Northern Ireland access to our most precious fishery waters. Local fishermen in west Cork feel that the industry has had a raw deal and does not trust Governments to deliver. It is vital that we protect our fishermen's livelihoods. I have called for a stand-alone Minister for the marine. This is not my first time calling for this stand-alone Minister, but surely now this House can see the importance of a stand-alone Minister for fisheries and the marine, especially with Brexit looming. We cannot forget or ignore the fact that our agrifood market is also dependent on our ports. We need to look at our ports and the effect Brexit will have on them and the export market. In my constituency, we have wonderful ports such as Bantry, Castletownbere and Kinsale. Their futures need to be secured. I plead with the Government to support these ports through the uncertain times that lie ahead with Brexit on the horizon. While we speak a lot about the worry of Brexit, and probably rightly so, we must not take our eye off the ball in this country. One such area where I am afraid that this is happening is oyster farms and mussel farms. These also need to be looked at. There are three planning applications at present in my constituency's area of west Cork for oyster and mussel farms, one off Kinsale Harbour, another between Union Hall and Castlehaven and also in Bantry. I have been approached by constituents living in these areas, the inshore fishermen and people in tourism sector who are all completely up in arms about the planning application for these oyster and mussel farms. We are seeing more of these types of fish-farm planning applications popping up everywhere. Imagine three in the past month in west Cork, covering vast areas of sea. Has the Government even stopped to ask why there is an increase in applications? I will tell the Minister why. Most of these applications are from companies that are not even from this country which are exploiting our poor planning regulations because, by comparison, their own countries, such as France, have put in extremely strict regulation to make sure that oyster farms are not set up here, there and everywhere. We have left ourselves wide open in this country. I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that we need far stricter planning regulations around oyster and mussel farming. We are making ourselves an easy target for these foreign companies to come into our waters and farm our oysters and mussels. I completely agree with the anger of my constituents, the inshore fishermen and the tourism sector who are all opposed to allowing these fish farms in the most beautiful and scenic parts of the world, and mark my words it will cost us jobs in the long run. There is no gain in the local community. Most of the products are exported. They maybe employ one person. It begs the question as to how they are getting away with these planning applications, with three in the past month. I urge the Minister to put in place immediately stricter planning guidelines in order to protect our inshore fishermen, our tourism sector and our environment and the people living in these areas and I beg him not to stand idly by watching another catastrophe unfolding. Overall, it is clear that the time ahead is uncertain and that Brexit will have huge effects on Ireland. I welcome the recent announcement of €5.75 million State funding to support the expansion of Carbery factory, a cheese producer in my constituency in Ballineen in west Cork. Carbery is a huge employer and is a company that has always shown great leadership in its industry. The staff and management at Carbery are a credit to this company. They have worked tirelessly with Brexit approaching and have looked for ways to not only survive, but to grow in these challenging times. The Government could learn a lot from the attitude of Carbery and its staff.

Somewhat unusually, we are all in agreement that Brexit poses serious challenges to the agri sector, that it is, as they say, somebody else's fault but it is mainly our problem and that we must address it as we see most appropriate. Ireland currently exports to 180 markets globally, and with global population and income growth expected to continue to drive demand for food, the challenge for the Irish food and drink exporters is to identify markets that offer the best potential for growth over the medium term. Last year was another strong one for agrifood trade, with overall value reaching almost €14 billion. In terms of the key sectors, beef exports came in at €2.4 billion, dairy produce at €4.6 billion and beverages at €1.4 billion. Pigmeat reached almost €800 million and fish exports over €600 million. Live exports reached just under €0.5 billion and poultry €300 million. Market and trade insight suggest that global demand for Irish food and drink will remain positive in 2019. In line with Bord Bia market prioritisation work, growth in dairy, meats and beverages in particular will continue from emerging economies in Asia and elsewhere. A month ago, my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Creed, launched the Department's first Market Access Annual Report, which was an opportunity to reflect back on past achievements and to look to the future. In terms of the future, at the same time, the Minister also announced plans to promote trade and enhance market access in 2019. This enhanced focus on market access and trade is a key part of the Department's response to the challenges posed by Brexit and is very much in line with the market development theme under Food Wise 2025. While the work predates the decision of the UK on Brexit, it has taken on an added urgency since then. At the same time, it is important to note that opening up new third country markets to Irish food producers is a long-term strategy and that these new markets, whether in China, the Gulf states or elsewhere, will take time to develop and grow. The Department's market access effort includes work at political, diplomatic and technical levels. We also work closely with industry in our pursuit of access to various countries and I acknowledge that valuable co-operation. The Department also has a dedicated trade team, comprised of the divisions within the Department dealing with different aspects of market access, trade and exports, together with Bord Bia and Sustainable Food Systems Ireland. This draws on the cross-divisional expertise and provides a stronger focus on our offensive market access interests in existing and new markets. I pay tribute to the staff of my Department and our attaché in Beijing who won a Civil Service Excellence and Innovation Award in 2018 for their long-term collaborative project with Bord Bia, the Embassy in Beijing, the Chinese Embassy in Dublin and the meat industry, which ultimately gained market access for beef to China which amounted to some 1,400 tonnes last year. The UK remains the most important market for Irish agrifood exports accounting for 40% of all exports with a value of €5.6 billion. There are sound economic, social and geographic reasons for this trade with our nearest neighbour, which is one of the most valuable grocery markets in the world.The Minister, his officials and Bord Bia have devoted considerable time since the Brexit vote to meetings in the UK, specifically with counterparts in government and officials, as well as leaders in industry and retailers, including chief executive officers of many of our agrifood customers. We all hope for a Brexit outcome that will allow trade to continue as normal to the benefit of both countries. We remain acutely aware of the threats posed by a disorderly Brexit. However, a comprehensive programme of work is in place to lessen potential impacts. Nevertheless, Brexit underlines the Food Wise 2025 theme of developing and diversifying our markets to avail of new growth opportunities. Our focus on market access work includes an enhanced programme of ministerial trade missions, an increase in the number of agricultural attachés serving overseas and detailed market prioritisation studies. In conclusion, I am pleased the seven-point action plan has resulted in an increase in the number of markets to which we can export. My Department and Bord Bia will continue to work with partners to increase our global footprint.
