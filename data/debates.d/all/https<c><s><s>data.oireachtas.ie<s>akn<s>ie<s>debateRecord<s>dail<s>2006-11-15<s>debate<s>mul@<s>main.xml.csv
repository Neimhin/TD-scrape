#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	0	It is a hallmark of this Government that it has no problem breaking promises it makes to the nation.  We have had a litany of broken promises in the last period.  We recall the promises made immediately after the "Prime Time" exposé of the happenings at Leas Cross nursing home, that there would be a new law within months, national standards and an independent inspectorate.  All promises, all broken.The situation in nursing homes is, in fact, worse.  I could paper the walls of my office with the responses given by the Taoiseach and different Ministers about what would be done.  We were told there would a national approach from the HSE, that it now has a robust inspection scheme and that it could assure us high standards were being enforced all round.  All promises, all broken.Today we learn from the reporter Fergal Bowers that a report in July of this year, 14 months after the Leas Cross programme, finds that dedicated inspection teams in the HSE are the exception and not the rule.  Policies and procedures vary between, and even within, former health board areas and there is no consistency on whom teams report to.  He makes the point that inspection teams can express serious concerns about a particular nursing home while, simultaneously, another arm of the HSE continues to place public patients in the same home.How in the name of heavens can the Taoiseach stand over this?  Four Ministers and Ministers of State have been involved in this: the former Minister, Deputy Martin, the current Minister, Deputy Harney, the current Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, and the former Minister of State, Deputy Callely.  The Taoiseach refused to apportion responsibility to anyone, either members of the health boards or his Ministers.  This is a national scandal.When Deputy Perry exposed the illegal taking of payments from long-stay patients in public institutions, the Taoiseach was able to introduce legislation within two days to try to make it legal retrospectively so the money could be kept.  Here we are, 14 months after the Leas Cross programme, with no legislation or inspection regime.  The Taoiseach himself told the House that the inspection regime dealing with Leas Cross was of the highest standards.The Government has broken the promise on the law and broken the promise on new standards and new inspections.  How many more old men and women must spend their last days with weeping bed sores while this debacle continues on this Government's watch?  None of the four Ministers or Ministers of State at the Department of Health and Children accept responsibility for this.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I repeat what I said yesterday about the Leas Cross report, when I promised there would be a detailed account of the case that came up over a year ago.  Professor Desmond O'Neill has identified many deficiencies in the standard of care for older people in Leas Cross and the actions required to uphold those standards.  Those deficiencies in care are deeply upsetting to the families of those in Leas Cross, particularly the relatives of those who died in Leas Cross.  The Government understands their distress and we will lead with the legislative action and funding decisions to ensure high standards of care are upheld in all nursing homes, public and private.  We know from Professor O'Neill's report and others that complaints and warnings were not given the attention they warranted, a matter of deep regret.Professor O'Neill examined these issues for a year but did not engage in a blame exercise and he did not recommend disciplinary action.  I am not in a position to do what the person who spent a year examining it did not do.  Some people involved have challenged his assessment, as is their right.  The report has been sent to the Garda Síochána to enable it to take any action it considers appropriate and to the Irish Medical Council for its consideration.  Our priority is to prevent this from happening again.  That, rather than talking about what has happened, other than to express our regret and say they should not have happened, is what we are doing.We established the Health Service Executive to introduce standards across services in every county and region.  Those standards meet the highest international levels possible.  We are finalising the health Bill 2006, which will be published in this session and will create a robust system of inspections.  It will provide for the first time for a statutory office, the office of the chief inspector of social services within the HIQA organisation, with specific responsibility for the registration and inspection of all nursing home places, public and private, because they must all be examined.  He or she will inspect the homes under the regulations governing them and the standards set by the authority.  The Bill will also strengthen and modernise the registration and de-registration process.  New standards for long-term residential care facilities for older people have already been prepared.It is not the case that all nursing homes are staffed by people who could not care less about patients.  That is an appalling picture to paint.

I reject that accusation.  Like every other politician I visit nursing homes and I do not see that, I see hard working people, working for the State or private organisations, doing their best day in and day out to look after old patients.  I understand most elderly patients and their relatives are extremely happy with the service they get.

The easiest thing to do is to come in here and apportion blame to everyone, to say nothing is right without ever standing up for those working every day to look after the elderly.  That is an easy thing to do, the Opposition gets great marks for that.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	11	The Minister for Health and Children has published the draft heads of the Bill for public consultation and we have had many submissions, none of which came from politicians.  The existing nursing home regulations, under which the HSE carries out inspections of private nursing homes, were introduced in 1993 and they were amended.  There are regulations, which will now be replaced by newer regulations to be made under the proposed legislation, with the purpose of strengthening the standards for residents in homes.

It is beneath the Taoiseach to make that comment.  I am reading the report of the nursing homes inspections and registration working group which states clearly that there is no consistency and there is serious concern by one team about nursing homes and people being sent in there.  If the Taoiseach was to show leadership in this matter, he would instruct the Minister for Health and Children to call together the committee dealing with health matters, Professor Drumm of the HSE, the leaders of these teams and Professor O'Neill to find out what is happening.  The Minister for Finance will tomorrow produce his Estimates and he will have €600 million or €700 million on top of everything else for the capital programme.  That is a long way from what is happening on the ground.The Taoiseach rightly states that he wants to deal with standards across each county.  He has correctly indicated that there are concerned citizens working in this area, and they cannot come forward because there is no whistleblower legislation.  I have news for the Taoiseach, I have evidence from a person who will come forward.  This is a case I have verified of a person in a nursing home being attended to by a professional nurse.  My information states:Now take the case of a lady with mental illness with discharging sores on her legs.  She is also resident in a nursing home, and if I did not dress her legs every day in our centre she would come in every morning bare-legged, winter or summer, wearing slippers and the discharge running down her legs.  After repeated calls to the nursing home, this lady came in one morning with nappy liners placed on open sores.That is the standard the Taoiseach was talking about from some of these nursing homes.  An inspection regime is needed to go in and sort this out.  Where is the Minister for Health and Children this morning or the Ministers of State?  Why are they not dealing with this?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	35	The HSE established the working group on nursing home inspections and registrations in July 2005, shortly after the organisation was set up.  It completed the report in early summer.  The existence of the HSE working group report has been a matter of public record for some time.  Deputy Kenny is asking me to ask it to engage in a matter that it has finished.  This has been referred to publicly on a number of occasions, including in previous Dáil debates when the Minister for Health and Children answered questions.  I am answering the questions today and the Minister for Health and Children has answered questions.Among the recommendations of the report was the recruitment of dedicated inspection teams throughout the country.  These teams would have staff with nursing, medical and mental health experience.  They would also have other professionals available to them.  The inspection teams would all work from the same standardised checklist to ensure conformity across the system.  In addition, all inspections would be unannounced.The working group's approach now underpins the inspection process for private nursing homes.  The issues raised in the report underline the reason for the Government's decision to put the social services inspectorate on a statutory basis within the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  It will be independent and will create a thorough and robust system of inspections.When contracting with private nursing homes, the HSE does not send patients whose level of dependency is unsuited to the facility available.  In a number of instances, the HSE may decide that a particular private home is unsuited to the needs of high dependency patients, but it does not mean the same home is unsuited to patients with lower levels of dependencies.  The HSE has made important improvements to its nursing home inspections process since the working group report was completed in early summer.  It has been working to standardise the reports and has engaged with the nursing home inspection teams and the private nursing home sectors.With the greatest respect for Deputy Kenny, what he has asked me to do has already been done.  The legislation——

I am not saying everything is up to 100% in every single place in the country.  If it was, we would not have had the working group report, we would not be bringing in legislation and we would not have had Professor O'Neill's report.  We have put enormous resources into the HSE and we are putting legislation in place in this area.  The last legislation in 1993, by and large, covered most of this ground.  It is time to improve it now as time has moved on, although it is a relatively recent Act.I dislike the effort — it is the easiest thing in the world to do — to find something somewhere and paint it as if it is the practice everywhere.

In particular, I want to again raise the request I put to the Government on a number of occasions to have the barrier lifted while the renovation of the M50 is going  on.  I am sorry to interrupt the Tánaiste, but perhaps he will listen to me making the case before he advises the Taoiseach on the response.I read in today's newspapers that the Government proposes to buy back the bridge from the private operator for approximately €600 million.  Is that correct?  Is it correct that the company is trying to negotiate tax advantage and exemption from capital gains tax should it arise as a result of that transaction?

Is it the case, as the Secretary General of the Department has stated, that once the port tunnel is opened, 2,200 heavy goods vehicles will be decanted on to the bridge which, she said, is the equivalent of 6,600 cars per day, or one year's additional traffic on one day?I want the Taoiseach to explain if it is the case that after spending €600 million to buy back the bridge, it is the Government's proposal to install tolls at four different points on the M50.  It is not just the €600 million that is at issue here but the €900 million lost revenue estimated by DKM that would be outstanding on the contract to 2020.  The cost is €1.5 billion to the State.Is it the case that after paying out €1.5 billion, forgoing €900 million in revenue and paying out €600 million to the private operator, it is the intention and Government policy to levy tolls on a distributor road for Dublin?  Motorists, who will be very pleased to hear that the bridge is being bought back in 2008, will not be so pleased to hear that there will be four tolling points installed on the road.  What is going to happen between now and mid-2008 as motorists endure a nightmare, a daily hell, during the renovation of the M50 and the installation of grade intersections at a number of points?  It is between now and mid-2008 that the Taoiseach needs to negotiate with that company to throw open the bridge for the duration of the refurbishment works.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	68	In reply to Deputy Rabbitte, it is correct that the NRA decided at the beginning of this year, with the agreement of the Minister for Transport, to zero rate the West Link toll from mid-2008 and to compensate the NTR in accordance with the West Link agreement, the figures to be worked out in the negotiations as per the agreement.  They also decided to terminate discussions with National Toll Roads and considered that a strategically commercial solution that met the objectives of the NRA with regard to the development and management of the M50 could not be achieved with National Toll Roads.  There was a significant risk that NTR's proposals would infringe national and EU procurement rules and that was the reason for the decision.On barrier-free, open road tolling, the zero rating of the West Link toll will take effect from approximately the third quarter of 2008 and that is still the position.  Barrier-free tolling will then commence in conjunction with the completion of phase one of the M50 upgrade.  The cost of compensating NTR will be a matter for determination between NTR and the NRA, in line with the agreement.  It provides that the amount payable would be based on actual observed traffic in the 12 months preceding the application of zero tolling with an annual inflation added index.  If the toll is removed in 2008, as it is estimated, approximately €45 million per annum indexed would be payable until 2020.  Those are the broad figures on the issue.Deputy Rabbitte asked what is happening now and queried the issue of four tolls.  As I understand, there will be one toll on the new road when completed.  In the intervening time, the costs of compensating NTR, phase two of the M50 upgrade, upgrading the West Link section of the M50 and of the barrier-free tolling will be met from the total revenue from barrier-free tolling on the M50 up to 2013.  That is the basis for the calculations.  All the sections Deputy Rabbitte asked about will be paid for out of tolling over a period from 2008 to 2035.Deputy Rabbitte asked why there is not barrier-free tolling at present.  Along with the Tánaiste and several other Ministers, I have had a number of meetings with the engineering people in recent months.  They are of the opinion that this would be a disaster.  Their view is that it might help a limited amount of traffic going straight but that the tailbacks on all the intersections would make the entire M50 unworkable.  Their position is that the first part of the upgrade has commenced, the second part will commence at Easter or in early summer and the third part, which is the West Link part, will commence after that, and all three phases are to be completed within a two-year period.Six international companies of global scale have tendered for the barrier-free tolling.  It is estimated that it will take a year before the work can commence and the technology is set up.  It will take two years — I wish it had all been finished five years ago but that is not the position.  I reiterate that in two years' time, phase one, which is under way, phase two, which will commence at Easter, phase three, which is the West Link toll and the negotiations with National Toll Roads, and the new system of barrier-free tolling, which is already out to tender with considerable interest from at least six of the international bodies, will be in position.As Deputy Rabbitte will be aware from the announcement yesterday, the Dublin Port tunnel will open on the morning of 20 December 2006.  Restrictions which have been agreed between the traffic engineers and Dublin City Council with regard to certain zones for the five-axle trucks have been approved by the councillors and Dublin City Council.

This is going to be an unmitigated disaster during the refurbishment of the M50.  The situation is already intolerable for motorists and what the Taoiseach is now saying is that no remedial action of any kind will be taken.  He is sheltering behind the advice of engineers and others who contributed their fair share to the mess in the first place.If I heard the Taoiseach correctly, all the phases of the refurbishment will be paid for out of the toll by the year 2013.

The State cannot even build a new bridge adjacent to the existing bridge because of the contract entered into by Pádraig Flynn, George Redmond and Tom Roche.  While two of them are still with us, is it not in the public interest that this contract should be examined?  How is it possible to make such a negligent deal on behalf of the taxpayer?  We handed everything over to a private operator and the Taoiseach is now telling us he is to make an announcement that he is buying back the bridge.  Motorists may think they will get some relief but they will not.  There will be no relief until mid-2008 and an alternative toll will then be implemented.

The country had a population of 3.4 million which was declining.  West Dublin had no new development at that time and questions were asked about whether the new motorway would work.  In the first six months the concern was that it would be a financial white elephant.  The country has moved on and 800,000 new vehicles have come on the road in recent years——

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	102	If there are 800,000 additional vehicles and 700,000 more people, a large proportion of them in Dublin, there will inevitably be more traffic.Deputy Rabbitte asked me what was the position.  The issue of four lanes on a gantry was never accepted by the Minister, his Department or the Government.  There was one issue, namely that we would move to barrier free tolling.  There are no companies in this country who provide barrier free tolling so we have sought them internationally.  We have examined the best international standards so we can remove the barriers and adopt modern technology.  We have to follow a system of tendering and procurement.  I am told it will take well over a year to do this and to put it in place on the M50 will take some further months after that.The Government and the NRA are committed to improving the level of service provided to motorists on the M50.  We feel this will be best achieved through the M50 upgrade and the move to barrier free tolling.  A major upgrade programme is under way with a total investment of €1 billion over two years.  Phase one has commenced with the upgrade of the sections between the Ballymount and Galway road interchanges, and that is expected to be completed in early 2008.  The NRA will submit proposals on barrier free tolling arrangements — toll charges, location and technology — to the Government in due course.  Projections and taxation figures will be dealt with by advisors to the NRA, the Department and NTR.  The engineers and management of NTR and the managers of the relevant local authorities have told us they believe it will take two years to complete the work.I am well aware there are difficulties.  Deputy Rabbitte will know that my area has had five years of difficulties regarding the completion of the airport road and the Dublin Port tunnel.  Motorists have patiently dealt with the disruption.  We are spending €1.5 billion on roads, and spent up to €8 billion in recent years.  People understand that new bypasses and roads cannot be delivered without disruption——

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	107	The overrun on Leaders' Questions is symptomatic of other overruns.  Global warming is an issue regularly raised in the newspapers. The Irish Times today tells us that in 30 years time, losses from droughts, hurricanes and floods could cost up to €800 billion annually.  This is a level of impact that I do not think the Taoiseach appreciates.  I do not know if the Taoiseach has read the Stern report, which has predicted a loss of 5% of global GDP per annum unless severe cuts in greenhouse gases are agreed and implemented.  Otherwise, the economy and the environment will suffer beyond anything we can currently imagine.  Already, the World Health Organisation tells us that 150,000 people are dying annually because of climate change.Kofi Annan has today said that if we cut greenhouse gases the planet can cope.  Perhaps that gives the Taoiseach some hope.  However, Mr. Annan has also said it will cost less to cut greenhouse gas emissions now than it will to cope with the effect of them in the future.  Does the Taoiseach agree?  Does he agree we are facing our biggest economic and security challenges?  Of course, this is also a massive social, development and human rights issue and poses major problems for biodiversity.  It is the biggest challenge the global community has ever faced.Last March the European commissioner for the environment identified climate change as a greater threat than terrorism.  When I asked the Taoiseach about that he helpfully told me he was not responsible for the planet, nor was he responsible for everything that will happen between now and the end of the century.  In the meantime, the Taoiseach has signed up to 15%-30% cuts in greenhouse gases for the EU, with the objective of going below 1990 levels by 2020.  Those are cuts for the EU as a whole.  Will the Taoiseach agree to a minimum 15% cut below 1990 levels by 2020 for Ireland?  A "yes" or "no" will suffice.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	110	The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is attending the conference in Nairobi this week and will be articulating Ireland's position.  Delegates will continue discussions on a possible agreement to succeed the one made at Kyoto and Ireland will play a full part in that.  The key focus is on involving countries that do not currently have emission reduction commitments.  While I am optimistic for progress in these discussions, agreement may not be reached at this meeting.  We may have to discuss this again in the New Year.While I did not read the entire Stern report, I read the executive summary and some other sections.  His full findings on the economics of climate change will be presented at the conference later this week.  We support the key message of his report that there are strong environmental and economic reasons for taking action now.  The German NGO Watch published a report at the UN conference yesterday which ranked developed countries according to their progress in reducing greenhouse emissions.  Ireland was ranked 33rd of 56, an improvement on last year's ranking of 39th.  We have been proactive and successful in addressing national greenhouse gas emissions and we continue to be so.  We have decoupled our economic growth from increases in emissions during the 15 year period between 1990 and 2004.  During this time our emissions grew by 23% while our economy grew by 150%.  We will reduce our emissions by 11 million tonnes per annum through measures already in place including 3 million tonnes from power plants and large industry through the EU emissions trading scheme.  We are committed to and supportive of the EU emissions trading scheme.  Over 100 Irish installations are participating in that.  The strength of the economy is placing upward pressure on emissions and further measures will be put in place to address the situation.  We intend to put in place further emissions, but that will be based not on my giving figures from the top of my head but on figures provided by competent people.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	112	Can I presume the Taoiseach made a mistake when he said he wants to put more emissions in place?  Would the Taoiseach agree that boasting we have improved from 39th position to 33rd is like boasting that Ireland will beat San Marino in tonight's soccer match?  Has the Taoiseach any ambition for this country in terms of its responsibilities and the weight of responsibility on this and future generations and the economy, which stands to suffer from inaction in this area?  The Taoiseach says he has read the executive summary of the Stern review.  It bears a number of readings and perhaps he will get the opportunity to read the entire document.  As a wealthy country, Ireland has a responsibility to give leadership in this.  Our Government plans a stealth tax to pay our way out of Kyoto rather than making the necessary cuts.  This issue must be highlighted and the Taoiseach needs to respond to it.  The Taoiseach will stand over a weekly charge of between €2 million and €4 million on the Irish taxpayer as a result of failure to have proper building standards and harnessing of renewable energy, failure to provide proper public transport, while the Taoiseach has spoken about another 800,000 vehicles, and failure to have proper planning to reduce commuting.  The taxpayer has a bill of approximately €1 billion over five years for Kyoto.  That money could be spent in any number of areas including proper nursing homes, schools and hospitals.  How can the Taoiseach justify that?Today's speech by the Queen of England in the British Parliament has announced the introduction of a climate change Bill, a carbon committee and targets to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 60% by 2050.  This is supported by the Confederation of British Industry, as announced by Mr. Richard Lambert speaking on the radio this morning.  Will the Taoiseach introduce those measures?  Will he introduce a climate targets Bill that will allow us to get to grips with what we need to do in this area, yes or no?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	129	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5 together.The Government appointed Deputy Kitt as Government Chief Whip and Minister of State at my Department and the Department of Defence.  Deputy Treacy is also a Minister of State at my Department and at the Department of Foreign Affairs with special responsibility for European affairs.As Chief Whip, Deputy Kitt is primarily responsible for the organisation of Government business in the Dáil and for representing the Government's interest in all matters, procedural or otherwise, relating to the conduct of its business by the Dáil.  He chairs the Government legislation committee and oversees preparation of the Government's legislative programme.  He also has responsibility for the Central Statistics Office and for co-ordination of the Government's strategy for the continued development of the knowledge society in Ireland.In a co-ordinating role in the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Treacy chairs an interdepartmental co-ordinating committee on European Union affairs.  The committee keeps under review, and works to ensure coherence on, the full range of issues on the EU's agenda.  The Committee has a particular focus on the correct and timely transposition of EU legislation.  Deputy Treacy also has responsibility for the Government's communicating Europe initiative, which aims to foster a broad public understanding of, and identification with, the issues on the EU agenda.Deputy Treacy plays a central role in consolidating and further developing Ireland's positive bilateral EU relations, particularly with the new member states.  In addition to these duties, Deputy Treacy has a heavy workload within the Department of Foreign Affairs, representing the Government at meetings in a wide range of contexts related to European affairs and representing Ireland at EU meetings at Minister of State level on European Union affairs.  I have no plans to reallocate the responsibilities of Deputies Kitt or Treacy.

Does the Taoiseach discuss with the Chief Whip the arrangement of Dáil business and which legislation and other matters should be prioritised from week to week?  We will shortly move to the Order of Business, which is a daily feature of Dáil business.  Are the matters raised on the Order of Business about promised legislation taken into account in these meetings between the Taoiseach and Deputy Kitt?  I have noticed Deputy Kitt noting points made by Deputies.  Is that part of his responsibility?  Does he discuss the points made by Opposition voices in this Chamber arguing for specific legislation to be speeded up?  This is done time and again.  Is it part of Deputy Kitt's responsibility to take note and heed the valid arguments for specific legislation to be addressed faster?  If it is not his responsibility, whose is it?Deputy Kitt's job description includes responsibility for the operation of the pairing system.  Many people outside the Dáil will have little or no knowledge about this.  For their benefit can the Taoiseach explain how it works?  Does the Minister of State brief the Taoiseach on the operation of the pairing system?  If so, is this done on an occasional or regular basis?  These are important points and I hope the Taoiseach will give them the time they deserve.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	131	As chairman of the legislative committee, to the best of his ability the Minister of State keeps a close handle on legislation in the Parliamentary Counsel's office going through the various processes between Departments and deals with points raised in the House to the best of his ability.  We do not discuss this on a weekly basis.  At the start of each session we decide what the legislation will be on the A list, as well as other lists, during that session.  We keep account of progress in Cabinet meetings as time goes on, not every week, but perhaps once a month, on average.Pairing arrangements are the norm in all the Parliaments I have ever had dealings with.  The practice is that where members of the Executive are absent on official business, they are paired.  Where someone is ill or hospitalised etc., the Chief Whip and the Whips of the parliament concerned will try to deal with the situation to the best of their ability, and the Dáil is no exception.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	134	I notice the Taoiseach said in a reply in October 2004 that the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, will play the key role in co-ordinating and advancing preparations for the ratification of the treaty on the European constitution.  Is he still working hard on that and at what stage is his preparatory work?  Can we anticipate that this issue will be reopened between now and the general election?Is it the intention of the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, to publish a programme of Dáil reform between now and the end of the current Dáil?  Does the Taoiseach accept that, notwithstanding very modest changes over the last decade, many of our citizens have a growing conviction that our business in the House is not always relevant here and that there is a necessity for us to reorder the procedures of the House to be seen to address current issues which are relevant to the people.  People who watch proceedings of this House believe we are hogtied by anachronistic procedures that permit of current important matters of public affairs being debated everywhere but inside the House.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	135	On the constitution question, obviously matters have not proceeded at the speed we would all have wished so the workload at that end has not materialised as it should have.  The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, usefully co-ordinates closely with the ten new member states.  They are at an early stage of membership and there is a great deal of engagement with them at different levels.  He handles that area very successfully and it is an important issue.On the constitution, there will be an effort by the German Presidency to make progress on this, particularly in the run-up to preparations for the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome in March.  The Germans recently asked all member states to assign two senior officials to engage with them on that over the next four or five months, when they will try to make progress on the constitution and on a declaration on the Treaty of Rome.  They will endeavour to progress matters in light of that.  Frankly, I do not see them being able to make much progress.  I have no doubt that Chancellor Angela Merkel will try extremely hard, but I do not see matters progressing until after the French election.  However, I believe it will surface once again during the French Presidency in 2008.While a good deal of work will be done by the German Presidency, I believe it will be 2008 before it again arises.  It is becoming quite an issue in the French election and certainly all sides are indicating what they believe should be done.  That is an issue we have to watch because I do not like the tendency to cherry-pick which has been operating again and which is not in the interest of small countries, particularly Ireland.Having been involved in the business of the House at different levels, including Whip, over many years, I believe there have been great advances.  There was a time when, as leader of the Opposition, the only topic one could raise on the Order of Business was legislation.  As Opposition leader, I had about a minute before the Ceann Comhairle of the day, Seán Treacy, would cut me off, and one was not really able to raise anything.  Now, however, I know of no other Parliament but this one where one may have an order unannounced on any issue twice a week, on whatever might have come up in the previous half hour or appeared in a newspaper, or whatever was deemed to be important.We could make other advances too.  We have made useful technological advances, putting the legislation and consultation on the Internet, which is good.  The heads of Bills are increasingly being put out for open consultation, which is a very good advancement.  There were other suggestions which would have involved Ministers coming into the House for similar types of questioning on issues, but consensus has not been reached on this and one cannot make these types of changes without the agreement of the House.  It is a pity because we could make the House far more relevant.  I do not see that happening as there does not appear to be any appetite for that among the Opposition Whips.  Adjournment debates in the morning where Ministers would be obliged to come in at the start of the Dáil day as well as other suggestions would be very good, and perhaps they will be implemented at another time, but I do not foresee them being implemented in the immediate future.

Yes, the Opposition has put forward all types of bright and wonderful suggestions, as has the Government, but there has to be compromise on issues.  I do not know why we cannot get agreement on some of the simple matters.  However, there has to be give and take.  It is not just a question of the Opposition tabling suggestions and everyone agreeing.  That is not how parliaments operate.  However, there are initiatives that can be taken.  Perhaps they will be taken in a future Dáil.  I do not see any appetite among the Opposition parties to agree to the Government's suggestions in this Dáil.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	142	I certainly have a question.  As regards allocation of responsibilities among the Ministers of State, which I have asked about, has the Taoiseach considered responsibility for older persons' affairs?  That area is growing significantly in terms of public impact as regards pensions and so forth.  I wonder whether this is an area the Taoiseach has given some thought to.  Following my question to the Taoiseach, it seems very important that there should be a dedicated area of responsibility within his Department, with a Minister of State dealing with climate change, given that this must cover so many other Departments.  It is not something that can be dealt with in the Customs House.  It is time to look at that seriously, if the Taoiseach takes the matter seriously, which I hope he does.Was the Taoiseach aware of the comments by the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, that he knew who was releasing information from the Mahon tribunal?  Did the Taoiseach discuss that with the Minister of State before or after he made those comments?

It is his brief but perhaps there is an argument to extend his role to other Departments.Climate change will become a bigger issue.  It has taken up more Government time and committee time over the past number of years.  Perhaps there could be someone with responsibility across Departments or a cross-departmental group.  There is interaction under the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Perhaps it can be brought together in a coherent way under the Public Service Management Act.  We have made strides in terms of integration.  It is a matter I would examine.

For the first time in my memory, the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, attacked yours truly at a formal function in Brussels on the occasion of the Irish language being announced as a working language of the Community.  The Taoiseach and Fine Gael rightly supported the announcement.  The attack was personal and vindictive, in front of international personnel.  In my time a Minister of State never attacked a Member of the House while abroad.  I am sure the Minister of State did not let fly with the Taoiseach's imprimatur because the Taoiseach never did that.  Perhaps the Minister of State got mixed up or perhaps he wrote the script.  Why is the Ceann Comhairle shaking his head?

Is he sent out to attack helpless Deputies at home who are unable to defend themselves in the same forum?  This is not the hallmark of the Taoiseach.  Perhaps Deputy Treacy thought he was appearing before the Mahon tribunal and that it was leaking like a sieve.  We did hear about it here.  It is not standard practice for the Government and I would like the Taoiseach to rap him across the knuckles for that.  He has a delegated responsibility in the Taoiseach's Department but maybe he was operating under the remit of the Department of Foreign Affairs, where he has no formal delegation status as of 13 June.

In many instances this relates to policy issues.  Formal delegations or statutory powers are not necessary.  Only a small number of Departments have functional blocks where the full function must be designated.  A Minister of State may be required to exercise a power set in statute.  That is the case in my Department in respect of the functions of the Statistics Act 1993, which are exercised by the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt.  The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, carries out a wide range of policy and administrative functions in my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs but no formal or statutory power is required.I was not aware of the Irish language meeting.  It did not receive much publicity.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	174	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 10, inclusive, together.I proposed that the Government should engage directly with faith based communities and bodies on the development of an institutionalised dialogue.  This initiative reflects the significant role of the churches and an increasingly diverse range of faith communities, the Government's commitment to wide-ranging consultation on public policy including through social partnership and the provision for dialogue with the churches and other non-confessional bodies in the draft constitutional treaty for the EU under articles 1-52.Following the initial written consultations between officials in my Department and the prospective partners in this dialogue, a series of meetings at official level commenced some time ago with a view to formally inaugurating the process.  These meetings sought to identify the scope and structure of the dialogue as an enduring channel of communication.  The discussions have been very encouraging and it is hoped to conclude this final round of consultation in the coming weeks.  I hope all the partners in this process will be ready to engage in an inaugural meeting and commence a series of bilateral meetings with Ministers over the coming months.With regard to structure, I envisage the dialogue process will include an annual meeting and reception with all participants in the dialogue in attendance, an annual bilateral meeting with each representative body at which the State side would be led by members of the Government and include senior officials from appropriate Departments, and an ongoing channel of communication at official level.The response to this initiative from the outset has been very positive.  It has been generally welcomed as an appropriate and timely response to complement the process of change in Ireland.  The long established arrangements for delivery of services in the State, heavily reliant on and closely engaged with the churches, are in need of review.  I hope this process will give the participants and the wider community an opportunity to reflect on the continuing changes in the social patterns of life, including those arising from immigration.I understood the reported remarks from the church leaders to reflect their enthusiastic support and welcome for the dialogue, as previously conveyed directly.  I share their commitment to move forward with the process as quickly as it can be arranged.  Deputies will appreciate that for the enduring stability of this structured dialogue, it is best that the process be well prepared through the contacts which have taken place, so it can be open, inclusive and transparent.

I expected this question to be answered yesterday but I read the answer on the front page of The Irish Times this morning.  I did not think the Taoiseach or his two doughty Ministers of State would engage in that kind of practice.  While I thought that to be exclusively in the realm of the new Tánaiste, apparently it is not.

This commitment was made in the autumn of 2004 and subsequently, Members have asked the Taoiseach about it a number of times.  My understanding is that notwithstanding the front page story in The Irish Times, nothing has happened.  For example, Dr. Diarmuid Martin, Archbishop of Dublin, expressed some disappointment at the General Humbert Summer School that this commitment had not been followed through.The Taoiseach made reference to bilateral meetings and so on.  He and the former Tánaiste had a bilateral meeting with the leaders of the Church of Ireland concerning the status of Tallaght hospital in respect of matters relating to the decision to locate the new national children's hospital on the site of the Mater Hospital.  Concerns were expressed directly to the Taoiseach and the then Tánaiste about the ethos and values enshrined in the charter of Tallaght hospital.  I believe the meeting took place on 29 June and the senior churchmen present expressed concern to the Taoiseach regarding the dilution of the charter and a downgrading of the hospital itself.  Can the Taoiseach say anything to reassure the Church of Ireland in this regard?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	178	On the first question, this process came from the European constitution.  When the European constitution did not go ahead, we decided to proceed anyway.  It was not as though nothing happened through 2005, as a process had to be structured.  This was a serious effort.  We wrote to all the churches and other religious bodies, as well as the humanists.  There was a long period of engagement as they were obliged to go through their own consultative bodies and processes.  This was a long and drawn out process.  I understand they were obliged to go to their councils and conferences to ascertain whether they would engage in the process.  This happened.The second part consisted of engaging with officials as to how the bodies wanted to structure the issues.  I refer to the meetings, agendas and the kind of issues to be covered in this respect and this process is not quite complete.  There are also some issues regarding who represents who in these structures and this has taken some time.  The process includes the Most Reverend Dr. Robin Eames, Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of all Ireland, as well as the Most Reverend John Neill, Archbishop of Dublin.  It also includes the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the Methodist Church in Ireland, the Baptist, Lutheran and Moravian churches, the Religious Society of Friends, Jehovah's Witnesses, the Salvation Army, the Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, Coptic Orthodox and Romanian Orthodox churches, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, the Jewish Representative Council of Ireland, the Islamic Cultural Centre of Ireland,  the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the Republic of Ireland, the Irish Council of Churches, and the chairperson of the Humanist Association of Ireland.  It has taken considerable time to structure it as per the European constitution and get agreement.  The officials have worked hard to so do.This work is almost complete and I understand a possible structure has been worked out.  I share Archbishop Martin's view that we could get on with it.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	180	The Constitution gave some of the churches a structured position with the State.  However, most of them do not have such a position.  The two officials who have worked hard on this matter have informed me they believe they can get it going next year.I had a number of meetings with the Most Reverend John Neill, Archbishop of Dublin, as well as correspondence with various people from the Church of Ireland.  At direct meetings with Archbishop Neill, concerns were expressed to me regarding any dilution or diminution of the status of the charter that was worked out many years ago.  We emphasised to Archbishops Neill and Eames that this is not the case.  I gave them a written commitment to this effect.  There is no intention on the State's part to move away from the charter, from its commitments to the charter or from the protection of the issues of faith for the Church of Ireland.As for Tallaght hospital, we have assured them that while the decision has been made regarding Temple Street Children's University Hospital, there will be no downgrading of the Tallaght complex.  There have been numerous meetings at official level since then.  While I have not kept completely up to date with them, they asked for some particular issues to be addressed and I understand that they have been or are being addressed.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	181	As Deputy Rabbitte noted, the Taoiseach has given a reply that was published this morning.  The Taoiseach stated the structure will allow for a plenary meeting between representatives of the churches and the faith communities every year — I assume this would be among themselves — while separate bilateral meetings between the Government and the different faiths will be held on an ongoing basis.  Can the Taoiseach provide any details in this regard?  Representatives of the aforementioned churches would find it most informative to meet members of the Cabinet, particularly as they themselves follow the words of the Gospel and their religious beliefs in respect of keeping one's word and so on.  Representatives of the aforementioned Lutheran church would be extremely interested to meet the Ministers of State and some of the Ministers.Although this is a serious business, members of the Cabinet and the churches are busy people.  How does the Taoiseach envisage the practicalities of such meetings?  It would not be desirable for people to form a perception that a particular church met the Taoiseach, Tánaiste or Ministers and that consequently, things emerged.  The former Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, stated that she wanted the special relationship between State and church broken up.I do not know whether the Taoiseach considered a suggestion I made a couple of years ago.  I suggested that under the office of the President, a constitutional liaison officer with the churches could be appointed.  As such an officer would be completely objective and independent, Cabinet members would not be perceived to be under any pressure from a particular church or its members.  The officer could report regularly to the Cabinet as to the views, perceptions, concerns and anxieties of any church or group.In a small country such as Ireland, the Taoiseach and other Ministers meet heads of churches and other religious leaders regularly on formal and social occasions and so on.  I am uncertain whether the Taoiseach considers this suggestion to have any validity.  It might be a practical and streamlined method of getting messages to the church leaders from the Government and vice versa without any perception of pressure, interference or favouritism.  I do not suggest this would apply.  Did the Taoiseach give the suggestion any consideration?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	182	The article in today's edition of The Irish Times merely stated that officials were continuing their contacts with the churches.  This is well known because quite a number of articles in this regard appeared in the religious magazines.  The remainder of the article was taken up with the journalist’s conversations with representatives of churches.  Consequently, my reply did not appear in the newspaper.This area is complex both in Ireland and in other countries.  More than 150 nationalities now live in Ireland and while I do not know the current tally, more than 30 churches were present in Ireland when we engaged in consultations regarding the European constitution.  A number of these churches wish to set up schools and extend their church-related services in different ways.  In some cases, the children of members of these churches attend integrated schools.  They wish to engage with the State in respect of a range of issues.The reason this has taken so long is because we needed to agree to introduce a process whereby meetings would be held once a year with everybody where there would be total integration and that, in turn, the churches mentioned by me would meet with the relevant Minister and officials.  Officials from the Department of the Taoiseach would try to co-ordinate this process but they would not meet representatives from the churches other than when necessary.  This process will not cut across some of the long-established arrangements that been in place with the churches for years, chiefly for health and education issues.  Delegations from the main churches have come in together to discuss European legislation and equality issues for a number of years.  This does not create any great conflict.  The only change relates to a tradition dating back to the foundation of the State whereby some church leaders pay a Christmas visit but this is purely a courtesy call.  As far as meetings are concerned, they tend to operate together.The process was in the constitution because it is major issue in other countries and will become a major issue for us, namely, the range of faiths and non-faith groups represented in this country at full level.  It is important that these people feel they have a voice in Government and are able to put forward their cases.  I recently met imams representing both the Sunni and Shia branches of Islam in Ireland.  The imams of this country are working together at a time when such co-operation is not taking place in other countries.  They will examine the introduction of schools in this country which will represent all of their community.  These issues are difficult enough to address.  From my discussions with them, I am also very conscious that they read Dáil debates on every issue that affects them very assiduously.  We are very anxious to help them in respect of these issues, bring about some resolution in respect of them and assist them in obtaining land because the community is growing very rapidly.  There are 35,000 or so Muslims in the country.These are very important issues and require delicate handling.  The President can play a role but because of the number and range of faiths, the process must be closer to Government.  For 60 or 70 years, these issues would probably have affected only four or five churches but will now affect many more.  The process will probably have to take place in Government Buildings but will link in with others.  It will not involve many people but these people are seeking direct engagement with the Government and Ministers.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	183	Is it correct that the various churches and faith communities did not hear from the Government for an entire year, from the announcement in July 2005 onwards?  This is the impression I have received.  Will the Taoiseach address this because it does not indicate that the Government has ears — whatever about the churches having a voice?Will the churches be consulted over the formulation of wording for a referendum on children's rights, about which the Taoiseach has spoken?  Will this be an indication of some practical interaction?

Has the issue of education and the control of schools been addressed with the larger denominations, specifically, representatives of the Catholic faith?  This is in light of the fact that the greatest number of schools within our education system are under its direct aegis and control. Difficulties arise in new developments where people are left without school places for their children and must deal with two bureaucracies — church and State — in order to move matters forward.

There have been extensive negotiations with the churches over the past two years.  They have been attempting to produce a model into which everyone fits.  One cannot have dialogue based on the contents of the draft constitution unless everyone is involved.Education issues are everyday issues concerning the churches' schools and communities and would be discussed between the various churches and the Department of Education and Science and would not be part of this process.  The control of schools is an ongoing issue and is a problem for the majority churches, which have put it on the agenda because they do not have the personnel to undertake the work they did in the past.  In many cases, they are examining changes and are engaged with the Minister of Education and Science on this matter.

Is any other legislation on climate change promised such as a climate change targets Bill, as proposed by the British Government?From contact with the Department of Agriculture and Food, I have reason to believe that legislation on the co-existence of genetically modified food with non-genetically modified food is in preparation.  I imagine that legislation should be on a list, if it is in preparation.  Will the Taoiseach clarify that matter, given the vast opposition to GM food here and the damage it would do to farming?

We are awaiting the HIQA legislation and other major legislation, the medical practitioners Bill.  It was promised for a long time dating back to the Dr. Neary scandal, but as of yet there is no sign of it.  What exactly is going on?  When will we have sight of that Bill?

The heads of the medical practitioners Bill were approved previously and further heads of it are expected to be included in the Bill.  It is still hoped it will be available this session.  Its introduction has been delayed because of the inclusion of the additional heads of the Bill.

The matter I wish to raise was ruled out of order on Committee Stage because the scope of the Bill is confined to giving voting rights to prisoners.  This is an immediate problem.

It is a democratic right and we must correct it.  The deadline is 25 November.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government was asked to extend that deadline and he refused to do so.  A legislative change is required and an opportunity will arise today to make that change.  Will the Taoiseach allow the House to do so and ensure that the voting rights of 170,000 citizens will be restored?

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	296	It is so long since we were here that I cannot remember the last sentence I put on the record.  This amendment deals with policy directions to the commission.  Amendments Nos. 49 to 56, inclusive, are being discussed together.Amendment No. 50 proposes in page 18, line 10, after "functions" to insert "or arising from specific circumstances".  My reason for tabling that amendment was to provide for the unexpected in so far as is possible.  The Minister's amendment provides for policy directions to the commission.  It states:(b) Notwithstanding the generality of paragraph (a), such general policy directions may have regard to the following issues—(i) security of energy supply,(ii) sustainability of energy supply,(iii) competitiveness of energy supply, or(iv) such other matter which the Minister considers appropriate.".My suggestion is to include the phrase, "or arising from specific circumstances".  Specific circumstances can arise, such as those we experienced during recent weeks.  When we last discussed the issue in the House, we were not aware of them.  Gas and electricity prices were not an issue then but they are now.  We as Members of the Oireachtas have little function.  Due to the alleged independence of the regulator, the Minister has little function.  This Bill will introduce a commission with similar powers and we will not know to what extent we can initiate a policy direction.I fully appreciate the commission must have independence in its day-to-day activities and one cannot get involved in everything.  However, a particular issue may arise about which we have little or no warning and which may have a wide impact across the board.  In those circumstances it is necessary and should be possible to bring into focus an extra trigger mechanism, along with that provided by the Minister, to ensure it is possible to act in a situation where, based on what we have seen and heard to date, it appears we have no function.  If nobody has any function and everything is handed over to a commission, the presumption is that the Oireachtas must wait until the commission decides to act on a specific request from the Minister.  However, the Minister may not decide to take the necessary action at a particular time.  He may decide to do nothing, which is his right, or it may be in line with Government policy not to do anything.  It may not necessarily be in the best interests of the consumer, the economy or the wider public, however, so I ask the Minister to examine that amendment.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	297	We are taking amendments Nos. 49 to 56, inclusive, together, which deal with policy directions to the commission.  I welcome a number of the amendments which the Minister has tabled.  In amendment No. 49 he has gone a good bit of the road with the Labour Party as regards my amendment No. 51.  The Minister's amendment states that. . . policy directions may have regard to the following issues——(i) security of energy supply,(ii) sustainability of energy supply,(iii) competitiveness of energy supply, or(iv) such other matter which the Minister considers appropriate.My amendment No. 51 specifies that "these general policy directions shall include targets for energy security, energy sustainability, energy and fuel poverty and retail and wholesale pricing".  The areas that are still not specified are energy and fuel pricing.  One of the big issues this winter, and in the run-in to the general election, will be the difficulty many households face with gas, electricity and heating bills generally.  It is an overriding issue for the Labour Party, which must be addressed directly by legislation.  It should not be left to the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the Minister for Health and Children to devise policies to alleviate fuel poverty.  Issues such as fuel and energy poverty should be at the heart of policy making.  The Deloitte & Touche report noted that 20% of citizens suffer from significant fuel poverty, but such people should not be left to bear the brunt of fuel price increases.Last week, I tried to raise in the House the issue of standing charges for gas.  I asked the Minister why such charges had increased by 50% in the past year alongside gas price increases, despite the fact that the standing charge is not related to international fuel costs.  This morning, I learned from the Irish Examiner, which included a fine investigative analysis of the matter, that An Bord Gáis has raised 5% of its revenue from this incredible standing charge increase.  In addition, the Minister has imposed a 13.5% tax on top of that, so we have ended up with a €1,500 to €3,000 heating charge.Today, I noticed the announcement of Irish entries for the annual Eurovision song contest, which is somewhat related to our portfolio.  Deputy Durkan could almost compose a song about the reply I received to my parliamentary question, which stated:I can advise the Deputy that, as the setting of charges falls within the statutory responsibility of the Commission for Energy Regulation, under the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 and the Gas (Interim)(Regulation) Act 2002, I have no function in the matter.That is what the Minister told me in his reply which I finally received yesterday.  Clearly, therefore, under the current legislation, he has no interest concerning these iniquitous standing charges which are being lumped on top of the other charges.  As far as I recall, when the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources interviewed the regulator he had no comment to make on these matters either.  It is important for us to deal directly with a Minister when such directives are issued.  I commend the Minister on having come a good part of the way with us in this regard but I do not see why fuel and energy poverty cannot be referred to in the text of the Bill.  The regulator and his staff, the commissioners, the Minister's civil servants and everyone in the energy industry should be told that this issue affects 20% of the population and must be addressed.  For that reason, I will be pressing amendment No. 51.I welcome the steps the Minister is taking in tabling amendment No. 52 as regards placing the directive before the joint committee.  My amendment No. 54 seeks to lay the draft direction before the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources or the committee on energy and natural resources as it will probably be in the next Dáil.  That would be an accountable and transparent way of allowing us to discuss the content of the Minister's concerns at that time.I agree with Deputy Eamon Ryan's amendment No. 53 which seeks to extend the period from 21 to 31 days.  I understand, however, that the Minister has extended the period, introducing a 30-day rule on submissions before he brings it to the commission.  That is commendable.On amendment No. 54, I am happy that the Minister has included our committee, which has done good work.  It will be meeting again this afternoon.  In amendment No. 55, I note the Minister has added an explicit provision whereby, under subsection (1) "... the Minister shall consult with that Minister of the Government prior to the carrying out of any obligation imposed on him or her under subsection (3).".  This will be critical on issues such as climate change and global warming.  We must have annual discussions on all such issues.  In that context, amendment No. 56 seeks to establish national targets for renewable electricity and renewable energy in the coming decades.  The aim of the amendment has appeared in some form or another over a period.  It appeared, for example, in the Green Paper in which the Minister set targets for 2010 and 2030, which is a reasonable timeframe for energy matters.  The Labour Party's policy also deals with renewable energy.  Targets are always aspirational, however, and one cannot direct the market.The recent report from CER dealt with Gate 2, which raised some interesting issues in the area of renewables.  I have tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for reply next week, concerning where overall renewables will be left when Gate 2 comes on stream.  We have all agreed to a 2010 target in this area and it seems reasonable to have a 2020 target also.  The Minister aimed at a 2030 target in the Green Paper.  One may say that we should not be as prescriptive as this — in other words, putting particular dates into legislation.  My amendment No. 56 includes the years 2010, 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050.  As was stated last week in our debate on the National Oil Reserves Agency Bill, long timeframes are involved in developing energy generation.  Energy is a slow-moving vehicle resembling a large tanker or passenger ship which requires a lot of time to change direction.  From the perspective of public policy, therefore, it is good to have some outline targets.We have all noticed the current discussions on renewables.  I know the Minister was not able to attend the conference on renewables in Ennistymon, although both Deputy Durkan and I attended it and spoke on behalf of our parties.  Many people representing the wind energy sector were there.  They were anxious to develop that industry, including interconnectors and anything else that would help its development and counter intermittency of supply.  We also discussed other issues with the companies present, including wave power.  In warm countries such as Spain and Israel solar generation stations are being developed to make the most of their long hours of intense sunshine.  The Israeli energy Minister seems to be the expert in this regard.  Passive solar, photovoltaic, PV, and many other technologies exist and we have all come to realise, none more than the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, that much of this represents work for the future.  The energy research area is critical.It is hard to say exactly what we will be doing in 2030, though the committee is planning a debate on nuclear power.  Regardless, as I said to the committee and in previous debates, I felt we could set targets and review them every three years.The leader of the Conservative Party in the UK has developed an image as a green leader and I suppose elements of the green philosophy are quite conservative.  He has suggested an annual review of climate change and if he becomes Prime Minister he will have fixed annual targets for climate change and emissions.  This is a serious debate in the UK.  I am suggesting long-range targets on the renewables side and a review every three years.  This would be helpful because it would give the Oireachtas and our successors in decades to come an opportunity to review this important question.In the past I supported the Green Party Bill seeking annual reviews in the area of climate change and I feel this is a modest proposal.  I welcome the Minister's attitude to amendment No. 49 and also to the Labour Party's amendment No. 54.  I ask him to consider going the final mile on fuel poverty by putting it in legislation.  I also ask him to consider setting targets, though they can be hard to meet.Dr. Whitaker spoke of indicative planning targets when he started the first programme in the 1950s.  One can seek 4.5% growth, 5% growth or even, as we have seen recently, 10% growth and more, but it may not be achieved.  Similarly, while we are on the frontier of exciting, new renewable technologies, difficulties can arise.  Nonetheless, I will press amendment No. 56 and feel it should be adopted.

This was well debated on Committee Stage and I indicated I would consider the points raised by Deputies.  I have tried to incorporate those proposals and amendments as much as possible.  I propose, therefore, to comment on my amendments Nos. 49, 52 and 55.Amendment No. 49 addresses issues raised by Deputy Broughan during the select committee discussion.  It identifies issues found under three headings in the Department's Green Paper on energy policy which the Minister may have regard to in any general policy direction given to the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER.  It is not intended to be an exhaustive list as any Minister will require the necessary flexibility to meet a variety of competing regulatory and market issues and contingencies.  Some, as the Deputy stated, might not be easily predicted at this stage.  The issues mentioned, I believe, are sufficiently broad to meet most, if not all, contingencies.  The issues raised by the Deputy — prices, fuel poverty and wholesale prices — are dealt with under the general heading of competitiveness.  A competitive market means prices are kept to a minimum.Amendments Nos. 52 and 55 follow from an amendment originally proposed by Deputy Eamon Ryan and from discussions that took place on Committee Stage.  It is proposed to increase the minimum number of days within which representations may be made relating to proposed policy directions from the Minister to CER from 21 to 30.  This requires the Minister to submit a copy of the proposed policy direction to the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources for consideration.  The changes to subsection (5) are consequential to those made on subsection (3) and simply make reference to the Minister's obligation under the amended subsection.  The points raised by the Deputies in the majority of their amendments are incorporated in these and, if approved, the text of amendments Nos. 50, 51, 53 and 54 will fall as a necessary consequence.Regarding Deputy Broughan's amendment No. 56, the issue of targets for renewable energy with an appropriate timeframe is addressed in detail in the Green Paper on energy policy.  The Green Paper, or White Paper when it is published, sets out that reviews will take place every three to five years.  The amendment as proposed by the Deputy would not work well, a fact he adverted to.  Technology, energy sources, national and international issues and so on are constantly changing and evolving and can affect targets.  It is better this not be included in legislation, particularly as 2030, 2040 and 2050 approach, because things change so much.I assure the Deputy the Green Paper indicates energy policy will be reviewed every three to five years which has not happened in the last 30 years.

CER's gas capacity statement and EirGrid's generation adequacy report project seven and five years into the future respectively.  These are more realistic timeframes for us to deal with.  There is no basis in reality for business plans that stretch 34 and 44 years into the future.I have been as fair as possible in accepting the spirit of the amendments put forward by the Deputies and I ask them to accept the amendments I have proposed.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	302	I agree the Minister has gone some way to meeting the concerns of the Opposition and the section he has introduced is beneficial.We must provide for the unforeseen and I am not sure that has been achieved in section 10A.  As unforeseen events are likely to occur from time to time, my proposal in amendment No. 50 to insert the words "or arising from specific circumstances" would strengthen the section.  With the best will in the world, the points on which the Minister may issue policy directions to the commission may not encompass all issues that could impact on the guarantee of supply or other matters associated with the energy industry.  It would, therefore, be beneficial to include a reference to "specific circumstances".Most of the other amendments in the group speak for themselves.  On amendment No. 56, it is crucial to have a short, medium and long-term plan for the energy industry.  This is precisely what Deputy Broughan's amendment would introduce and his proposal has merit.  The Minister indicated it is impossible to have a 30-year plan.  While I agree it is difficult to predict exactly what will happen over such a period, a long-term plan can be achieved by having a series of short-term plans and correcting them on an annual basis.  This approach would deliver a streamlined, seamless plan which one could roll over every year.  Most of our European colleagues have adopted this highly effective approach, which is similar to taking a lease.Contracts for leases make provision for revisions, whether annually or every two or five years.  Unless one has this type of continuity, it will not be possible to have the seamless process required to achieve the level of import substitution needed in the energy industry.  Achieving this will be critical to whether Ireland complies with the Kyoto Protocol and makes progress towards self-sufficiency in energy generation.  Not all the matters I have outlined are covered by the Minister's proposal.

Will it be available before the general election?  I am trying to establish in legislation a requirement to continually produce energy reviews.  As I noted, with the exception of the document on renewable energy produced during the term of office of the Minister's predecessor, energy moved off the radar for much of the past ten years and consumers paid the penalty.Amendment No. 49 in the Minister's name proposes to include security of energy supply, sustainability and competitiveness as issues on which he may make policy directions to the commission.  It also includes provision for directions to be made on any "such other matter" as he considers appropriate.  I fail to understand the reason policy directions should not include setting targets in the area of energy and fuel poverty, as proposed in amendment No. 51.In a recent report, the Economic and Social Research Institute appeared reluctant to build consideration of fuel poverty into pricing, although it referred to the matter.  The Ministers for Finance and Social and Family Affairs must address this issue.  In light of the bills and standing charges being imposed on unfortunate consumers — householders, particular vulnerable citizens and businesses — the Minister for Finance should increase the fuel allowance to €45 per week in the next budget.  Many vulnerable families need at least this amount to keep their houses warm.  One of the Government's most miserable achievements has been its refusal to increase the fuel allowance in most of its budgets.Energy and fuel poverty is an important issue for our most vulnerable citizens, for whom public representatives have most responsibility and on whom deliberations in the House should be primarily focused.  It should be included in some shape or form as one of the areas on which the Minister can issue directives to the commission.

In page 19, line 7, after "electricity"" to insert the following:"and to introduce a new definition: ‘Eirgrid' which means the transmission system operator".This amendment, as with a series of amendments to follow, forms part of a range of amendments I am introducing to this Bill with the intention of providing for a much greater separation.  In some cases this is legal ownership separation, but it also relates to definitions etc. between EirGrid and the ESB.  That is increasingly seen as an essential development to ensure a competitive and open electricity sector.Although it may not be of major consequence by itself in terms of setting the definition, we should, wherever possible in this and other Bills, look to separate EirGrid from the ESB to help us bring down prices of electricity and provide a more open and competitive electricity market.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	308	I support the amendment.  It is in accord with many of our statements, particularly my statements on the independence of EirGrid.  It should be independent not only in spirit but also in the letter to the extent that State control must be solidified so as not to end up in a similar position to the telecommunications sector where a monopoly exists.  This is not in any way disrespectful to the ESB.  It would purely and simply strengthen the whole concept of deregulation, with consequential benefit to the consumer, be they industrial or domestic.  We must go that one step further.  As Deputy Eamon Ryan has suggested, the more independent EirGrid is, the better.  The Minister will probably ask how much more independent the body could be.  There should be no relationship and it should be absolutely independent.  It should be an entity on its own, having no roots or relationship with its former parent body, for want of a better description.There are benefits to encouraging new entrants to the market, which is most important.  Even if EirGrid is independent in the oldest sense of the word, there will be a certain suspicion among those who want access to the grid that the playing field is perhaps not level.  It must be not only level, but seen to be so.  It must be of such a nature as to be quite clear.The grid has a number of jobs to do.  It must guarantee security of supply, which is becoming more intricate as time goes by, as we have seen from the events on mainland Europe in the past couple of weeks.  I would be very interested to know the Minister's feelings on the role of deregulation, and how effective it is and was in Europe over the past couple of weeks.  Did it work all that well and are improvements necessary?  To my mind, particularly as legislation comes from Europe in the first instance, it is less than amusing to note what has happened in the past couple of weeks.  It is not the first time such an occurrence has come about — there has been a major outage on the European mainland before.  Two years ago in the middle of summer, as a result of excessive use of air conditioning, there were major outages across Spain and Italy.  These countries have been subject to deregulation and use the European grid.As we are an island nation, we must treat the matter much more seriously than others.  The integrity and independence of the grid is important.  We should include the amendment to encourage the maximum number of participants into the marketplace of providing electricity and to ensure the grid is totally independent and capable of making decisions in the interests of the State.  It will not necessarily play to the gallery.  The amendment is well formulated.

Amendment No. 57 is reasonable enough to include the definition of EirGrid as the TSO.  My basic belief with regard to interconnectors is that they should be considered as part of the transmission system.  That is the reason amendment No. 59 seeks to delete subsection (2)(a) of the 1999 Act.  It relates to the exclusion of an interconnector, presumably owned by a third party, from being part of the transmission system.The ESB should be maintained as a vertically integrated utility.  The network should continue to be with the ESB and the interconnector would be an integral part of that.  I am not of the mind to support the idea, which is related to the interconnector, that the board will be extended to EirGrid.  The Minister has made a decision on this and it is perhaps history.I would resist the attempt to break up the electricity network in such a way that we might end up with a number of companies owning networks and generators.  It might be argued that EirGrid would not develop along those lines.  I understand where Deputy Eamon Ryan is coming from with regard to maintenance of the network.  That could be the start of a new network, which may eventually expand EirGrid's role to control the whole transmission and distribution network.  I would be wary of beginning a process of dismantling our electricity company.This is particularly relevant in the context of recent events where there have been a number of amber alerts.  The problem associated with the introduction of competition is also an issue with regard to microgeneration.  We do not want a situation where the distribution and transmission network will become difficult to manage or where it is manipulated by vested interests who would put issues other than the security of people's electricity supply as their key modus operandi.I am easy enough with regard to amendment No. 57 but I have reservations with regard to it and to amendments Nos. 58 to 61.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	313	Amendment No. 57 is not accepted because it is not required.  EirGrid is defined in Statutory Instrument 445 of 2000 and it does not require to be further clarified in this Bill.  It is the transmission system operator.  The Deputy's amendment, like the other amendments, may be designed to make EirGrid the owner of the transmission system.If I was starting out to design an electricity or a grid system for the country at this stage on a plain sheet of paper, I certainly would not design the one we have where the major utility company, the semi-State company, ESB, owns the transmission and distribution lines and most of the power generation.  This makes it very difficult to introduce competition to the market.EirGrid is independent of the ESB in its role and function.  It may not own the transmission system but it controls it and this is important.  There was a perception in the past that it was the downtown branch of the ESB.  This perception may persist until it moves to its new headquarters and is physically separated from ESB because currently it operates from the same building as ESB.  I wish to make it clear that since 1 July 2006, EirGrid has been vested as a separate company.  It is in control of the transmission system and it has responsibility for the use of the system and for keeping CER informed about adequacy of supply to the best of its ability.In those circumstances, the type of ideological hang-up that some people have of not transferring the actual ownership of the transmission lines to EirGrid, is very difficult to understand.  The only explanation I can give is that there are people in the ESB, both in management and in the trade unions, who think the company may be privatised at some stage in the future and they will receive a big lump of money out of it——

If people do not have that in their mind, they should not have any difficulty whatsoever about seeing the transmission wires go to semi-State companies completely devoted to a transmission system operation.  There is no reason they should have any objection.  It is very difficult to understand the kind of fixation some people seem to have about refusing to allow the transmission system go to a semi-State company to ensure it remains in State hands and can be operated in the best interests——

However, we have what we have.  I am quite satisfied that EirGrid as an organisation will act and control the transmission system in an independent fashion.  They will do this in the best interests of the public and consumers and in the best interests of the economy and competitiveness.  It is important to state in this debate that the ideological hang-up or the anticipation that somebody will get a big wad of money as a result of the transmission system being privatised, are both equally silly ways of looking at this.Deputy Broughan referred to the number of amber alerts.  This has nothing to do with the transmission system operator but has to do with the vertically integrated utility and its plant to which he referred, the availability of that plant——

We are now paying the price for this policy and must spend €8 billion to €10 billion to renew the whole system.The other amendments are not accepted.  They appear to have the objective of allowing EirGrid to own an interconnector which would be considered part of the transmission system.  This text would not be consistent with the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 or Statutory Instrument 445 of 2000, as amended, which define the transmission system as being owned by the board of the ESB.  The current text already allows for any person, including EirGrid, to own the interconnector which is not part of the transmission system.  I made this announcement recently.  They were progressing the development of the 500 MW east-west interconnector which on completion will be owned by EirGrid and this is facilitated by the text of the Bill as it now stands.  EirGrid is independent and it controls the transmission system and it will continue to be independent in order to ensure the best possible service for consumers.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	320	I find the last part of the Minister's contribution very interesting.  I accept the point that EirGrid may be defined in a separate statutory instrument.  It is difficult when submitting amendments to take account of the full panoply of legislation.  It seems the Minister is concurring with me when he states that if he were beginning with a blank sheet he would not devise the current arrangements whereby the assets of a supposedly independent transmission operator are owned by a generation and supply company.  Perception is often an important factor in markets.  Because EirGrid's assets are owned by the ESB, it cannot help but be influenced by the ESB and will therefore never be truly independent.I understand a deal was done between the unions, Government and the company regarding the continued ownership of the ESB's assets.  I agree with the Minister that this could only have been motivated by the developments in Eircom where a similar State-owned network was seen to generate a massive financial return for certain parties during privatisation.  That this transmission network might bring a similar reward at a future point must have been the most significant reason for this agreement.  There is no strategic or other business reason that the ESB needs to have such ownership.Owing to the historical path, this is now something with which we have difficulty dealing.  However, this is something new.  It is a new interconnector that would allow us to operate in a different and open manner.  I found the Minister's final comments to be of interest.  Perhaps he will confirm that the interconnector we seek to construct between the east coast and Wales will be owned by EirGrid.  Have I interpreted his comment correctly?  Surely this legislation is contradictory.  Section 8(2), which shall amend the 1999 Act, reads:2A.—(1) An interconnector owned by the Board shall be part of the transmission system.(2) Subject to subsection (3) an interconnector owned by a person other than the Board shall not be part of the transmission system.How can EirGrid, which is statutorily defined as the operator of the transmission system, operate an interconnector which, under this legislation, is not part of that system?The proposed amendments may require the Minister to make further amendments to the Electrical Regulation Act 1999 to bring them into effect.  Judging by his comments, it can only be read that the Minister agrees with their intent.  This is new infrastructure which does not have to have its ownership allocated under the terms of a deal done previously.  Why are we not starting with a fresh sheet of paper?  Why are we not bringing it in an independent direction that will assist competition and help reduce prices for customers?  Why are we not taking this opportunity to copperfasten a certain amount of independence for EirGrid as the transmission operator?  I contend that the Minister agrees with the sentiments of the amendments I am suggesting, but he is doing nothing about it, and I do not understand that.

If one looks at the history of the ESB, it is probably the most historic and valuable State agency in the history of the State.  One would have to say it has always been as much a transmission and distribution company as an electricity generation one.  There was generating potential at Ardnacrusha and elsewhere, and water generated electricity was a huge component of our electricity supply when a good chunk of the country did not have electricity, and that was a recent as the mid-1950s.The distribution and transmission elements and the workforce in the company could be seen as the heart of the ESB.  At 5.20 p.m. yesterday, a time when none of us could respond, the Minister announced that the Cabinet had approved the Single Electricity Market Bill.  As a single market takes effect, will the ESB's generation assets not be below 60%?  Will the RSI index not get smaller and less influential as additional generation comes on stream?  Will we not be left with the ESB as largely a transmission and distribution company?A huge tranche of the Minister's party is Progressive Democrats-oriented and is happy in the embrace of the Tánaiste, Deputy McDowell.

Those people have always wanted to privatise the ESB, lock, stock and barrel.  Week after week one can read in journals like the Sunday Business Post constant demands that it be privatised.  Northern Ireland has had that experience with Viridian.  As I understand it, Viridian controls the network and generation.  That has also been the case elsewhere.  Therefore, one could turn it around and look at it in a different way from the Minister and Deputy Ryan.Powerful forces within the Minister's party, not the Progressive Democrats wing but the Progressive Democrats heart of Fianna Fáil will hopefully submerge into oblivion in three or four months' time.  Hopefully, the Fianna Fáil members who feel the same way will go the same way and we will have a different Government.  One could say that EirGrid was set up in response to Brussels as a pretence that we are embarking on a particular road.  Nevertheless, the Minister will still privatise the main company itself and smash it up.  I am opposed to this.  It will have negative consequences in the future.  Other jurisdictions, such as California and other American states and European countries, have felt those consequences.I do not know whether Deputy Ryan reads the British financial press, but there was a striking article in the Financial Times on Monday asking whether Scottish electricity will ever be British-owned again.  Scottish electricity is now coming under non-British control.  There are five or six major electricity players in Britain but they are being taken out of British ownership.  This is the kind of vista we should be rightly fearful of in the future.The Minister need not think that he is a cutting edge, hard decision-making liberal.  He is not.  He is representing some quite dark forces within his own party who have a harsh agenda.  The Taoiseach had to get the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, out of that office.  He was told to leave the Department of Finance and if he did not go to Brussels he would have gone back to Kildare.

The company has served the nation with distinction throughout its history.  It will probably end up belonging to E.ON or Centrica.  While this may not be the Minister's agenda, it is that of certain people in his party.  It is a conservative and reactionary agenda and I am opposed to it.  These amendments point us in that direction and are therefore dangerous.One can look at the ESB as primarily being a transmission and distribution operator.  The Minister could have followed that model but chose not to do so.  I wonder why.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	326	The National Competitiveness Council, NCC, recently published its Statement on the Costs of Doing Business in Ireland.  The publication outlines the key findings of research looking at the cost of doing business at four locations in Ireland — Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick — and comparing these to international centres such as Bangalore, Boston and Copenhagen.  The data is for one period only, January 2006, but will be updated in two subsequent reports in 2007 and 2008.The chairman of the NCC recognises that Ireland's competitive position remains favourable.  The NCC's recent annual report noted that economic growth in 2005 was one and a half times the average EU 15 GDP growth between 2000-2004 and Ireland is ranked first in the EU 15 for entrepreneurial activity.  Ireland ranks highly in the UN's human development index.  For 2005, we are eighth in the OECD group and third in the NCC's benchmarking group.  This reflects several improvements, including the elimination of employment, improvements in life expectancy and raised life satisfaction.  In addition, a recent Price Waterhouse Coopers survey ranks Ireland second in the world in terms of ease of paying taxes, while the World Bank continues to regard our regulatory environment as benign, ranking us tenth out of 175 countries.  Ireland has made significant progress both over time and relative to other countries in terms of increasing secondary school participation rates.  At 86.1% we now exceed the Lisbon target of 85%.The NCC Statement on the Costs of Doing Business in Ireland states that it is notable that most successful countries in terms of wealth are generally expensive.  In this respect, the report shows that labour costs at 59% dominate firms' business costs.  These were followed by property costs at 11%, utility costs at 9% and transport costs at 4%.  All other costs accounted for 17% of total costs.The NCC's cost profiles demonstrate the importance of labour costs for firms across all sectors.  However, the analysis by the NCC shows that labour costs, taxes and transport costs are competitive when compared to benchmarked locations in the EU 15 economies or in the United States.  Labour costs in manufacturing are marginally more competitive than in the services sectors, compared to other EU 15 and US cities.The NCC acknowledges that our cost competitiveness is also supported by relatively low taxes on labour.  The research highlights the fact that Irish cities show the greatest cost competitiveness compared to others that were looked at in medical technologies, engineering and food processing.  These are important sectors for economic development.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The report underlines the competitive position of a large part of our economy.Looking at the cost of business across all business sectors reviewed, Irish cities are on average 15% more cost competitive than the average of other high income cities.  It is inevitable that we will have a higher cost base than low cost cities examined such as Bangalore, but I am confident that our broadest competitive position will remain robust and particularly in those sectors of the economy which will drive economic growth and employment.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	327	Based on the Minister's reply, I am not sure if he has seen this report.  This is what it looks like.  One would have expected him to acknowledge that there is a problem with our competitiveness.  A number of issues go back to 2001 when the NCC briefed the Taoiseach and Tánaiste on Ireland's deteriorating competitive circumstances under a number of headings.  I draw the Minister's attention to the conclusions and policy implications of the NCC, which is chaired by the eminent Dr. Don Thornhill.  It suggests:Ireland ranks among the most expensive of the locations surveyed for electricity,water . . . waste disposal, and key non-discretionary services, especially IT services, accountancy and legal fees.  In terms of policy implications, this paper suggests that addressing the infrastructure needs of the Irish economy and tackling the high cost of services must be a key priority for the Government.  In addition, property costs, both of construction and of rental, appear out of line with our competitors.It states that "together with a risk of the decline in the value of the dollar against the euro, these challenges present a potential threat to jobs and growth in internationally trading sectors of the Irish economy, upon which we all depend", particularly manufacturing.  That is an indictment of the cost of doing business in Ireland.  I therefore ask the Minister to have another go at answering the question he was asked and to suggest the measures he will take to bring us more into line with the competition we face.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	328	I answered the question by giving a balanced perspective on the issue.  Deputy Hogan is overly concentrating on the negative.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	330	We are aware of the energy issue.  That is why the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, produced a Green Paper on energy and has brought in a number of initiatives in that area.  Our main energy problem is our high dependence on fossil fuels.  I am on a Cabinet sub-committee on the issue.We are concerned on an ongoing basis about energy prices and its effect on our competitiveness.  That is not news.  It is interesting that regional areas such as Cork, Limerick and Galway are quite competitive on labour costs in relation to the EU 15 and the US cities.  Ireland is not in the same cost frame as Bangalore, for example, nor should we expect to be.  However, the report states that compared to other cities in the EU 15 and the United States, Irish wage costs are almost 20% lower.  We have cost competitive advantages in some areas.  Deputy Hogan has identified areas in which we have cost competitive pressures and challenges, particularly in utilities, and I am not arguing against that point.Overall, the report suggests that labour is the dominant cost while utilities comprise approximately 9%.  Nonetheless, the cost of utilities is a key agenda item for Government.  Our construction industry and property market have had unprecedented scale and pace of growth.  Every economic analyst has made different predictions about this for years, but they have not happened.  It reflects, as one economist recently said, a robust employment situation.  People have bought houses because we have unprecedented employment levels.  Utility costs are an ongoing issue, particularly waste disposal, energy and mobile communication charges, and we will continue to work on making those more competitive.Ireland is significantly more cost competitive on transport than the most expensive locations throughout the world.  It is a balance.  We are doing very well in some areas and not so well in others.  Based on any international benchmark, however, the overall picture suggests Ireland is doing very well in competitiveness terms, but that is not a reason to be complacent.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	331	I acknowledge that, economically, Ireland is on a strong growth curve and we have a low level of unemployment.  However, every report published in the past year in particular signals the pressure this jurisdiction will come under in terms of competitiveness from eastern European and Far Eastern locations and that the level of investment in this country will come under greater scrutiny — it is being scrutinised already from the viewpoint of relocation because of the high cost of doing business here.  I am disappointed the Minister has no plan.The Government had an opportunity last week when the Opposition tabled an amendment to have regular reviews of utility costs imposed on the energy regulator, rather than the annual review, but the Minister chose not to take that on board.  Will he suggest any policy for the future as regards the regulation of public utilities, for example, whereby the policy remit of the regime could be changed to reduce costs for small businesses in particular, as well as consumers, to bring them into line with what we ought to expect?  An increase of 90% in electricity prices over the past four years, for example, is not something that can easily be explained to people with more costly bills this week.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	332	It can be explained when one considers our dependence on fossil fuels.  That is where the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, moved in last year's budget in terms of incentivising indigenous renewables and alternatives to our fossil fuel dependency.  That is ultimately the way forward, as well as the national energy efficiency savings programme which has been launched by the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey.  We are working with him on these issues.  We advance the competitiveness agenda, advocating on its behalf in tandem with enterprise.  He is very well aware of that and has produced a Green Paper, which represents vision in dealing with the energy issue.  However, there are global issues to be considered as well and it is not something that is entirely within our command.  Elements of it certainly are and we are working on those.I reiterate that we are taking nothing for granted.  Our view is that to sustain economic competitiveness and underpin the job creation we have witnessed in recent times, we need to invest significantly in research and investment, third level education and the workplace skills base of the economy.  These are areas where we score well, competitively, and we need to continue to reinvest in them and enhance the levels and quality of such investment into the future.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	333	I am aware through a variety of sources that there is particular concern with regard to the alleged practices of some employments in the mushroom industry.  The labour inspectorate of the Department is aware that the application of piece-rates is a feature of the remuneration structure of many mushroom enterprises.  The payment of such rates is not in itself a contravention of employment rights legislation subject to workers receiving a total remuneration package which is not below the statutory minimum rates of pay for that industry as set out in the appropriate employment regulation order, ERO.The Deputy will be aware that Irish employment rights law makes a distinction between a contract of service, which applies to an employer-employee relationship, and a contract for service, which applies in the case of an independent sub-contractor.  In effect, employment rights legislation does not apply to independent sub-contractors with the exception of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989 and the Equality Act 1998.In most cases it will be clear whether an individual is employed or self-employed.  Where there is doubt as regards the employment status of an individual the relevant Departments and agencies will have regard to the code of practice for determining employment or self-employment status of individuals.  This code was drawn up and agreed in 2001 by the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Irish Business and Employers Confederation.A number of criteria are set out in that code for determining whether an individual is an employee or self-employed.  These include whether the person is under the control or direction of another, owns his or her own business, supplies labour only, receives a fixed wage, is exposed to financial risk, assumes responsibility for investment and management, supplies materials for the job, can sub-contract the work or works set hours or a given number of hours per week, month etc.The labour inspectorate has encountered a claim by an employer in the mushroom industry that workers were engaged on a sub-contract basis and were not, therefore, subject to employment rights legislation.  In this case the scope section of the Department of Social and Family Affairs, following consideration of all the relevant facts, decided that the workers involved were employees.  This decision facilitated a recent Employment Appeals Tribunal award in favour of a number of former workers in that enterprise.A major package of measures has been agreed by the parties to Towards 2016, the new social partnership agreement, to provide for enhanced public confidence in the system of compliance.  New legislation will be published next year to provide for enhanced employment rights measures, including the establishment of the Office of the Director for Employment Rights Compliance.  Providing for greater clarity in the application of employment rights legislation to employees and the self-employed will be considered in the context of drawing up that legislation.The proposed legislation will also empower the labour inspectorate to join with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to work together in joint investigation units.  Such units will have a particular focus on the employment status of workers.In so far as the mushroom concern, details of which have been supplied by the Deputy, is concerned, I can confirm that two inspections of that enterprise have been conducted during 2006, the most recent of which was on 1 November.  Breaches of employment rights legislation were detected on both occasions.  These breaches have been rectified and all arrears due will be paid to the relevant employees.  A file is being prepared for the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	334	I thank the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs for his frank and honest response to my question, unlike his predecessor.  We have a problem here.  For people coming to this country in the hope of a better life, as so many Irish people did when they went abroad in the past, the Celtic tiger has become the Celtic predator.  It is now beyond any reasonable doubt that the entire mushroom industry needs to be seriously investigated.  That is not to say that every mushroom producer is breaking the law, but there is now enough public information to suggest that this is a crisis sector that requires a crisis response.What action does the Minister of State propose to take, for example, as regards the cases I cited to him, where there were two registered breaches of unemployment law?  One can presume, on the basis, for example, of a case in Carrickaboy, as reported in The Anglo-Celt, where 13 foreign national mushroom pickers were employed, that they were unfairly dismissed because they were, in effect, employees and not contractors.What action does the Minister of State propose to take because this is a sector that needs to be dealt with collectively, in tandem with the Department of Agriculture and Food, where this is relevant?  That would send a signal to other rogue employers and sectors which are difficult to inspect and monitor, given the limited force of the Department's current inspectorate.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	335	There certainly is a problem on the basis of some of the information we have received.  The labour inspectorate has targeted this industry in recent times, with 40 investigations, 28 of which are ongoing, in contrast to 12 last year and only seven the previous year.  The inspectorate has been following up in this area.  I have met SIPTU on a number of occasions and a group that represents some of the employers.  There is a suspicion that this group represents the best employers, but in any event, it represents some of them.  SIPTU and that group have been trying to agree the basis for a new ERO, which may well be required for this subsection of the agriculture sector.  When I met the SIPTU representative last week, he indicated the union was unhappy with the rate of progress and I shall convey that to representatives of the mushroom industry when I meet them in the next week or two, with a view to ensuring that progress is made on that.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	336	I welcome what the Minister of State has said.  I suggest he tell all the mushroom industry representatives he meets that under no circumstances will work permits be granted to them for workers coming from outside the EEA.  There is a suggestion that applications are being made for Chinese and Thai workers to come into mushroom enterprises because eastern European workers, who are now full citizens of the European Union, are no longer staying in those plants.  I expect the Minister of State is as familiar as I am with all the evidence which SIPTU, particularly Mr. Mike Jennings and others, have gathered.On the basis that we are sharing the same information, will the Minister of State say that he is considering an ERO or a joint labour committee-type floor hourly rate, irrespective of the nature of the contract, because we had something similar as regards contract cleaning in the 1980s?  Such a regulation should be imposed by the Department.  Will he say that given the EU workforce as it currently stands, certainly with the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, under whatever working arrangements are provided for by the Department, no applications for work permits will be entertained from persons outside that area, and that there will be a vigorous programme of inspection, regulation and invigilation of this sector?  The mushroom sector is a good story in our agrifood business.  Those who comply with the law, make a fair profit and pay decent wages will not be undercut by unscrupulous employers.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	337	I would like to see a new JLC or ERO in this sector, ideally in co-operation with employers and unions.  That would benefit the industry and workers tremendously.  There are some deficiencies in respect of records, as Deputies are aware.  This will be addressed in promised legislation under Towards 2016.  The legislation on work permits introduced by the Minister will address all the issues outlined by Deputy Quinn.  This will help to ensure standards are much better in the mushroom industry and others.

The Minister for Finance may specify targets for the Civil Service generally.  It is not intended to legislate to impose a similar approach in the private sector which could be counter productive.The latest available figures published in the 2004 quarterly national household survey found that there were 110,800 people with a disability or health problem in  employment, which was 6% of total employment of 1,835,000.  The Department is fully committed to promoting the employment of people with disabilities.  In 2006, the total budget provision for FÁS vocational training and employment services amounts to almost €68 million, including a budget of over €47 million for specialist training providers.The sectoral plan of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment under the Disability Act outlines the Department's key initiatives in promoting equal opportunities for disabled people in the market, which includes the development of a comprehensive employment strategy for disabled people.  The key pillars of this strategy are enhancing the effectiveness of employment and vocational training programmes for disabled people, developing financial and other supports to potential employers and disabled employees, and developing measures to promote the continued employment of workers who acquire a disability while in employment.

To state that no legislation is intended is most disappointing and to state that legislation would be counter productive is a cop-out.  Strategies have been referred to by the health boards but those that are not enforceable are not worth speaking about.  Is employment not a major issue for people with disabilities, particularly those with intellectual disabilities?  Does the Minister of State agree that unemployment levels of people with disabilities are disproportionately high?  They are far more likely to be out of work as opposed to able-bodied people, for whom there is full employment.  There is something very wrong in this regard.I am aware that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is not responsible for the public service, which is paying lip service to the 3% quota, sometimes abusing or ignoring it.  This is bitterly disappointing.  There is some dignity attached to people being employed, particularly those with disabilities.  They could have a sense of pride, feel part of society and lead a more fulfilling life.  We do not intend fixing this problem.  It is already broken.  There is no point in these quotas if they are not legally enforceable, with a binding obligation on employers.Private companies in Europe with more than 50 employees must employ a certain quota of disabled people.  In France, it is 6%, in Germany, 6%, and in Italy, 15%.  Our European colleagues view this differently.  In European countries where there are such quotas, the government imposes a levy if the employers do not meet the quota.  This provides an extra incentive.  We cannot let the situation in Ireland continue.Some public service companies get around the quota by reclassifying people.  If a grant is available, one or two people can be reclassified to avail of it.  Some positive grants and incentives are available to the private sector but there is no obligation on private sector employers to employ a certain percentage of disabled people.I have met parents of those with intellectual disabilities who are tearing their hair out.  They feel their children have an ability that is not used in the proper sense because they are being offered meaningless work.  These people wish to work in mainstream employment.  I am disappointed by the Minister of State's short, disrespectful response.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	342	I regret that Deputy Connolly finds the answer disrespectful.  I could have given more information but I wished to leave time to respond to further questions.  The Deputy refuses to acknowledge a number of facts, such as the voluntary nature of our tradition and the appropriate provision of incentives to encourage employers to hire people with disabilities.I had the honour of speaking at a conference in the National College of Ireland run by the Association of Higher Education Access and Disability, AHEAD, for students in, or graduates of, third level colleges.  Considerable progress was acknowledged, particularly in the public sector.  They believe the challenge is to inform employers of the incentives available.  There is a substantial supported employment programme, endorsed by IBEC and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It was difficult to spread the programme to the regions.  The wage subsidy scheme introduced by FÁS would have had a greater impact but it was difficult to disseminate information to the employers, particularly additional information addressing employers' concerns.  If Deputy Connolly is serious and not just scoring points, he could assist in disseminating information to employers.I wish to declare a personal interest.  I have a family member who suffered a brain injury and might benefit from some of the programmes set up by the Department.

I acknowledge that much has been done but why do we not have full employment for disabled people as we do for able-bodied people?  We should keep this under review and examine how we can achieve full employment.  We should do all in our power, which we are not doing at present.  Other schemes in other countries are more effective and we should examine them.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	344	The data in the OECD report refers to foreign direct investment, FDI, inflows and outflows that cover a wide variety of transactions.  The flows of FDI associated with companies for which IDA Ireland has responsibility would only form a component of the OECD data.  It would be incorrect to take the OECD data in isolation and infer from it that Ireland has become uncompetitive, or is losing ground, in terms of foreign direct investment in the areas in which Ireland competes, namely, manufacturing and internationally traded services.In addition, as is the case with previous OECD reports on trends and recent developments in foreign direct investment, the data on inflows and outflows exhibit much volatility from one year to the next.  This is because the data include, and appear to be dominated by, purely financial flows that move up and down in response to a wide variety of factors such as interest rate changes, repayments of inter-corporate loans, the strength of the dollar, changes in regulations and so on.  The data do not, in large measure, reflect trends in financial flows associated with investment in actual facilities to produce products and services, which are the focus of IDA Ireland activities.As noted by the report, one factor that appears to have caused a substantial shift in the flows of US investment in 2005 is the American Jobs Creation Act 2004.  While this factor had a real and substantial effect on outward flows from the United States in 2005, in terms of the dynamic of trends from year to year in future, its impact can be expected to wash out of the data quickly.As for the types of FDI that actually contribute to the development and prosperity of the Irish economy, 2005 was a remarkably good year in many respects, particularly in terms of the quality and regional spread of investments secured.  For example, the projects approved included a €42 million expansion of the Bausch & Lomb plant in Waterford, a new 300 person customer service centre to be developed by Toucan in Sligo and the location by Zeus Industrial Products of its new European operations centre in Letterkenny.  This success has continued in 2006 with, for example, projects such as Amgen in Cork, Northern Trust in Limerick and Servier in Waterford.  This is not to forget today's announcement of the creation by Google Incorporated of 500 jobs.The Government believes the best way to measure net investment by foreign firms in Ireland is through an assessment of overall economic activity and wealth creation.  After a very strong performance up to 2000, job losses from foreign-owned firms outnumbered job gains from 2001 to 2004 as the global economic downturn following the 11 September attacks took hold and the effect of the marked slow down in the information and communications technology sector was felt.  However, net job creation in foreign-owned firms was positive in 2005, which indicates that Ireland continues to be a very attractive environment for international investors.  A total of 150,689 people were in permanent full-time employment with foreign-owned firms in 2005.  This constitutes an increase from 149,079 in 2004.The level of foreign direct investment in Ireland relative to the size of the economy is one of the highest in the world.  Currently, more than 1,000 overseas companies have substantial international operations in Ireland.  These include many of the leading companies in information technology and communications, life sciences, international services, engineering and financial services.The challenge for IDA Ireland is to sustain, embed and grow this investment.  The Government's recently-announced research and development strategy copperfastens such a focus on enhancing Ireland's competitiveness to attract foreign direct investment in future.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.In responding to this challenge, IDA Ireland is focusing on the development of its employment base into high technology, high value added and high skill functions, including both high-end manufacturing and areas such as high-end services and research and development.  I am satisfied the strategies and interlinked programmes in place in IDA Ireland are the most appropriate ones to underpin our continued success in this area.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	345	I acknowledge this morning's announcement regarding the creation in Ireland of 500 jobs by Google Incorporated.  This constitutes a major boost to the Dublin region's economy, as well as a welcome boost to the IDA in its efforts to attract foreign direct investment.  However, it coincides with some concerns articulated by the OECD report.  The Minister does not appear to believe the OECD and asserts it is selective in its interpretation of the figures pertaining to Ireland.Has the Minister ever heard of a document called the European Investment Monitor report for 2006, which was produced by Ernst & Young?  It is a leading company with a database that monitors investment and its origins throughout Europe.  Its report states that although foreign direct investment into Europe increased by 5% in 2004, Ireland lost foreign direct investment that year, as it did last year.As the proportion of investment to Europe increases, the position of Ireland declines.  It reported a reduction of 11.8% in foreign direct investment to Ireland last year at a time when foreign direct investment into Europe generally increased.I wish to ask the Minister some questions.  What figures, and from whom, does the Minister believe?  From what reporting mechanism does he derive his figures?  On what basis does he believe figures?  Has he ever heard of the European Investment Monitor report and was it ever brought to his attention?  Does he have concerns regarding its comments in respect of manufacturing employment or future foreign direct investment, particularly from the United States?

I referred to the impact of the American Jobs Creation Act 2004.  If the Deputy listened carefully to my reply, he will note it stated that a range of inflows and outflows are assessed.  However, the bottom line is that 2005 was the best year since 2000 in respect of the range and quality of new investment.

A total of 70 greenfield and expansion projects were sanctioned in 2004, and a further 71 in 2005.  This year looks even better.  The quality of this year's investments says a great deal about Ireland and its world class manufacturing capability in the field of pharmaceuticals and of bio-pharmaceuticals in particular.  For example, the largest biotechnology company in the world, namely, Amgen, will locate a major bio-pharmceutical plant in Ireland.  This follows other companies such as Wyeth, Cordis Corporation in Cashel and Servier, the French pharmaceutical company to be located in Belview on the Kilkenny-Waterford border.  Two weeks ago, Merck Sharpe & Dohme announced a major expansion in Ballydine, County Tipperary.

Today, Google, the Internet company that is the brand name in terms of Internet activity, decided to locate in Ireland.  From my perspective, such high quality investments in what I would describe as the industries of tomorrow are reassuring.  Such organisations have made hard decisions.  When I visit such companies in the United States and elsewhere, they still speak highly of the quality of the workforce in Ireland, the quality of the business environment in Ireland, the agility and responsiveness of the Government, its agencies and local authorities in respect of the issue of business investment in Ireland.  When such factors are considered with our corporation tax rate of 12.5% and our good pro-employment tax polices for both personal and business taxation, we still have a good package.This is not to deny that we face competitive challenges as we do.  We must be extremely vigilant regarding issues pertaining to costs and must ensure productivity is maintained and enhanced.  I refer in particular to the substantial productivity gains made during the past decade.  While the rate of productivity growth has slowed from the dizzy heights of the late 1990s, nevertheless we must maintain a focus on issues such as productivity and so on.  Ireland is winning because it continues to focus on high value activity and this year has been very good.  Moreover, 2005 was also a particularly good year.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	351	I acknowledge that in relative terms, our unemployment levels are low and that much investment comes into Ireland.  However, when reputable organisations such as the OECD or Ernst & Young which monitor such matters suggest we must consider the challenges ahead very carefully, I certainly will not make any apologies for bringing them to the Minister's attention.  Equally however, I expect him to have a plan as to how such challenges will be dealt with and he does not have one.  He believes everything is fine and that one can assess variations from any report in a positive or negative light, which I also understand.In respect of tax, the only time when there was an overall tax reduction for workers and labour costs was when Deputy Quinn, my friend and colleague, held office as Minister for Finance between 1994 and 1997.  This was the only time when Ireland experienced a tax reduction for people as a percentage of GNP.  While the Minister might suggest otherwise, when one considers the figures for the past 15 to 20 years, this is a fact .

The research and development strategy is a plan for future industry, jobs and competitiveness.  This is why we put so much effort into it.  A total of eight Departments were involved in the process, which was chaired by my Department.  I chaired a Cabinet sub-committee on science and technology.  We see it as critical for winning more jobs for the future and underpinning the kind of quality jobs we have in pharmaceuticals, biopharmaceuticals, medical devices, financial services, digital media and other sectors.In terms of skilling, the One Step Up initiative and the national skills strategy which is currently nearing completion, we estimate that 80% of the current workforce will be part of the workforce in 20 years time.  We have clear plans and have taken investment decisions to enhance the skills of existing employees to ensure we remain competitive and underpin jobs for the future.In one rhetorical flourish, Deputy Hogan eliminated the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, from the tax reduction story of modern Ireland, which is some achievement.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	374	The details of Enterprise Ireland's expenditure over the past five years on its current headquarters in Glasnevin in order to meet both its business needs and health and safety obligations is an operational matter for Enterprise Ireland and not one in which I have a function.However, I understand from Enterprise Ireland that, in the period 2001-06, it spent €6.6 million on redevelopments on its Glasnevin site.  This expenditure was committed well in advance of the Government decision to decentralise and was necessitated by the organisation's business needs.  These included the need to accommodate the move from certain laboratory based activities to increasingly office based activities, the need to upgrade older buildings in order to meet health and safety considerations and the need to realign staff between buildings to meet the organisation's demanding strategic plan targets.  This expenditure is split between expenditure on Technology House, which amounts to €4.5 million, and expenditure on the Materials Building, which amounts to €1.6 million.  Enterprise Ireland also spent a further €640,000 on site consolidation and is now in possession of a very valuable asset which can be sold following the move to Eastpoint Business Park.  The bulk of this expenditure took place in the period 2001 to 2003.  Enterprise Ireland signed the lease in September 2006 for a single site Dublin office in Eastpoint Business Park in order to relocate its Dublin-based staff from its current four Dublin locations.  The cost of this lease amounts to €2.9 million per annum.The decision to relocate to Eastpoint was made in order to meet the business needs of the agency.  Currently, Enterprise Ireland occupies four office locations in Dublin, primarily as a result of the amalgamation of various State agencies over a number of years into a single organisation to support indigenous enterprise.  The lease on two of these buildings will expire in the fourth quarter of 2008, necessitating the move to a single site.From an operational perspective, occupying four separate locations in Dublin was suboptimal, especially for an agency mandated to provide a range of services and expertise across several critical business functions in a holistic fashion.  Crucially, having all Dublin based-agency staff in one location will enable Enterprise Ireland to further deliver on one of its most important new initiatives, namely, the creation of integrated teams of staff with complementary expertise to service client companies.  Locating Dublin- based staff in a single location will significantly increase the level of collaboration within the organisation which will enable Enterprise Ireland to deliver a more effective service to client companies.The move to Eastpoint will enable the agency to sell the majority of its valuable site in Glasnevin, while also enabling the National Standards Authority of Ireland to temporarily relocate from existing substandard accommodation which is causing health and safety problems to one of the buildings on the site which has already been refurbished by Enterprise Ireland, namely, the Materials Building. This move does not in any way impact on the National Standards Authority of Ireland's decentralisation process.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	375	It seems remarkable that we have just spent €6 million doing up two buildings, Technology House and the Materials Building, which are specific to the purpose of Enterprise Ireland but will spend a further €6 million in the next two years, given that the lease costs nearly €3 million per annum, on a building which is officially part of the decentralisation programme but which is located in the centre of Dublin, a location to which I never realised we were decentralising people.  This operation was based in the centre of Dublin and one could argue it was situated in a location in which people will have bought houses in order to get easy access to their workplace.  However, the Minister has now moved everything to a new location.Can the Minister give me details regarding the length of the lease arrangement and its terms in respect of upgrade of rent on the new premises, given that it is currently €2.9 million per annum?  How many years have we committed ourselves to?  What is the expected value the Government will get from the sale of the building?  Would it not have been possible to use the existing building given that other agencies such as Sustainable Energy Ireland are vacating that premises as part of the real decentralisation programme?  I understand that Sustainable Energy Ireland is due to decentralise to County Louth.  Who was behind the decision in respect of Enterprise Ireland?  Was it the Minister or Enterprise Ireland itself?  When was the decision made?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	376	I have already answered the Deputy's last question about when the decision was made.  The decision was made by Enterprise Ireland.  The agency has been undergoing significant change over the past two years.  It has launched a very impactful strategic vision for the future and is very clear in its focus following the report of the enterprise strategy group on what it must do to develop and grow indigenous enterprises in this country.  The feedback from many small to medium sized enterprises across the country is very positive in terms of the impact Enterprise Ireland is having on the growth of indigenous enterprise, particularly exports, and the need to help companies internationalise and globalise more quickly than we possibly did heretofore.A considerable number of recommendations emerged from the enterprise strategy group's report relating to how Enterprise Ireland should reorganise itself in terms of its core functions, particularly in areas like research and development, technology supports, sales and marketing, internationalisation and the connection between both.  Therefore, the need for integration was important.  The idea of the agency being scattered in four offices around Dublin does not make sense.  The different locations came about because Enterprise Ireland emerged from the amalgamation of a number of State agencies, all of which had their own buildings.  In terms of the future of Enterprise Ireland, it makes sense to locate the agency in one office in Dublin for its Dublin-based staff.  It has an asset which it can now sell and realise significant returns on as a result of this particular decision.The lease was signed on 13 September for a single site in Eastpoint Business Park.  As I previously stated, the cost amounts to €2.9 million per annum, which is €20,077 per square foot plus service charges.  Enterprise Ireland has taken a normal commercial 25-year lease on two office units in Eastpoint.  The lease has break clauses to enable Enterprise Ireland to effectively manage changes in accommodation levels and factors in the flexibility needed for it to comply with the Government's decentralisation programme.  The decision makes sense in terms of what Enterprise Ireland is doing.  The agency will realise a significant asset in selling it as a result of this decision.  Critically, in terms of its own objectives and remit, the decision will facilitate a far greater degree of integration of functions for the future.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	377	The Government is scattering civil servants all over the country, which will do immense damage to the long-term joined-up thinking we need in the Civil Service.  This does not appear to be a consideration in terms of splitting up the Civil Service elsewhere.Can the Minister indicate the estimated revenue that will be realised from the sale of the site?  How can an agency like Enterprise Ireland, which by definition must be engaged in strategic long-term thinking, spend €6 million in taxpayers' money and then make a decision which goes in the opposite direction, namely, a decision to move to a new premises at a cost of €3 million per year when the State owned the original premises and there was no substantial cost?  The key question is what revenue the Government expects to receive from the sale of this premises and how it can justify spending €6 million of public money which was effectively thrown out the window over the past six years.

As I said, Enterprise Ireland is going through a period of structural change not only in its objectives but in how the organisation is structured.  A fundamental document was prepared in the context of the enterprise strategy group which recommended certain courses of action.  I have full confidence in the executive management of Enterprise Ireland and it has clear focus on the future.  It is determined and enthusiastic about driving forward the indigenous enterprise sector.  I have worked hard with it, as has the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, on a range of trade missions.  We are keen to get it right for the future, as is Enterprise Ireland, because the indigenous sector must play a stronger role in the future in job creation and industrial policy.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	387	I am aware of recent media publicity concerning the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  The PIAB has received 36,000 cases since it was established.  I understand from the PIAB that 6,000 of these were settled up-front from the outset, 9,000 cases were settled between the parties during the PIAB process, more than 5,000 assessments have been made, and an estimated 4,000 cases are heading into litigation, although not all of these will necessarily go to a full hearing.This leaves 12,000 cases which are currently in the PIAB system.  Some 7,500 of these are in the assessment phase and I am assured by the PIAB that they will all be dealt with within the statutory timeframes.  The balance of cases is awaiting documentation from one of the parties or a decision from the respondent to consent to process.The Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 provides that the board must ensure that assessments are made within a period of nine months beginning on the date on which it receives the respondent's consent to assessment, or in circumstances where it appears to the board that it would not be possible or appropriate, because of the particular circumstances of the claim concerned, to make an assessment within the nine month period, the period for making an assessment may be increased to 15 months.  I am advised by the board that 93% of assessments are made within the nine month period; the remaining 7% are assessed within a further six months as allowed by the legislation and these would normally be cases where a stable medical prognosis is not available in the nine month period.The board has assured me that it has the capacity to deal with the volumes of cases on hand and projected to come before it.  Currently 72 staff are employed by the board.  This is expected to rise to 85 by the year end.  In addition, the board outsources claims preparation and helpline services to a contracted service centre, which provides flexibility and the capacity to expand processing volumes quickly to meet increased demand.  Based on statistical and actuarial trends, the PIAB has projected annual volumes of cases rising to 25,000 per annum, 40% of which are expected to be resolved between the parties following contact with the board, 20% are expected to head into litigation but not necessarily to a court hearing and the remaining 40% will be assessed by the PIAB.Total expenditure by the PIAB in 2005 was €8.08 million.  This was funded by a €2.5 million Exchequer grant, €5.2 million in fees received and €384,000 from other income sources.  The board is expected to be self-funding in 2006 in respect of operational costs.The success of the PIAB represents a good news story for consumers who can now have their claims processed much more quickly and will receive the same level of awards as made in the courts without the trauma of litigation.  The average time which it takes the board to assess cases is 7.2 months from the date of consent.  Under the previous litigation-based system cases took three to four years to be settled.  The costs associated with settling claims under that old system averaged 46% of the cost of awards, which compares to costs of approximately 7% under the PIAB system.  In addition, a large number of cases have been removed from the courts system, freeing up the courts to deal with other matters.The achievements of the PIAB to date are significant, delivering as it does a fast, efficient and, above all, fair personal injuries claims settlement system in such a short period since its establishment.  The challenges the PIAB has overcome, logistic and legal, have been formidable and while the board continues to operate in a difficult environment, I have every confidence in its ability to deliver a quality service within its statutory timelines.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	388	From discussing the issue with many people who are involved, I present a different view from that presented by the Minister and one that is based on consideration of the independent assessment of the board by journalists.  Does the Minister accept that some of those views include headlines carried in The Sunday Business Post recently to the effect that  “insurers are the big winners from injuries claims board”, “injuries board needs treatment” and “injuries assessment board needs an urgent overhaul”?  Does he accept that at this stage the board is a basket case?I wish to put some specific questions to the Minister.  Why have so few awards been made?  Why is it that from July 2004 until now out of 36,000 applications only 4,400 awards have been made?  Is it correct that what has happened here could best be described as adding another layer of bureaucracy, cost and delay to the claims process?  Where is the current annual report?  Why has it not been published?  Is it being hidden?  Does the Minister agree or is he aware that the acceptance rate for awards has fallen from 75% to 60%?  Will he advise the House why many claimants are abandoning the process?Why do the lawyers to whom I have spoken seem very happy with the system?  When I see lawyers happy with the money they are making under a system, I am concerned, having been a former lawyer.I emphasise the criticisms I put forward do not come from any vested interests but from respected journalists such as Ms Deairbhail McDonald in the Irish Independent and Mr. Pat Leahy in The Sunday Business Post.  The Minister might take on board the views of Mr. Eamon Devoy, one of the chief people in the Technical Engineering and Electrical Union.  I gather that his view of the PIAB is that it is a fiasco.  He represents the country’s largest craft union and he has said that a number of the members of his union are injured and some are killed every year and he is of the view that the PIAB is a disaster in dealing with such claims.   Is the picture we have of the Government one that is full of the self-satisfied rhetoric of Government and of the PIAB or is the Minister’s eyes closed to all these problems?

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	393	Even The Sunday Business Post article to which the Deputy referred acknowledges that insurance costs have decreased.  Motor insurance and home insurance costs have fallen to 1999 levels.  I refer the Deputy to a recent IBEC press release dated 2 November, which carried the heading "Rate of personal injuries claims falling".  It was reported on "Drivetime" on Friday, 10 November that the number of employee insurance claims in recent years indicates a downward trend in claims against business by as much as 40% in real terms, from almost 12,000 claims per year in the period to 2002 to approximately 7,000 per year in the past three years.  Court writs in personal injury claims which numbered on average 33,000 per year up to 2004 were down to 4,000 in 2005.  That is not a basket case of an enterprise.Insurance costs also show significant decline with room for further improvement on an ongoing basis.  Insurance costs have come down.  The chairperson of PIAB addressed an Oireachtas committee on 18 October at which meeting I understand Deputies and Senators welcomed the positive impact of the PIAB.  The commentary at that meeting does not fit neatly with Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's commentary this afternoon.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	395	I welcome and am a great admirer of the work of the committee from time to time, although not on all issues.  It is important to have a sense of perspective in this debate.  Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's comments on his assessment of the PIAB lack perspective and balance.As I stated, PIAB deals with cases.  As Deputy O'Keeffe knows, cases are settled within two to seven months compared to three or four years under the old system.  Costs were reduced to 7% compared to 46% under the old litigation-based system.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	397	Above all, through this programme, the Government helped to reduce motor and home insurance costs.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	398	The consumer gains nothing from it.  The only people who gain from the process are the insurance companies.  They clean up because of the reduction in fraudulent claims, which has nothing to do with the PIAB, and increased competition in the market.  I speak for the ordinary claimant and consumer who is met with delay.  Mr. Devoy of the TEEU represents ordinary claimants who find the process a fiasco.I will make a sporting offer to the Minister.  Will the Minister forget the rhetoric he is fed by the representatives of the board and accept a case exists for an independent review of its operations?  That is all I want.  An independent review is necessary.  The Minister and those involved in the board are blinded to the facts of the situation.  I will be happy if the Minister agrees to an independent review of the operations of the board which, I repeat, has not produced its annual report.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	399	I must respond — this is not rhetoric.  Data from the Central Statistics Office show motor insurance costs for September 2005 dropped to levels last seen in September 1999.  It also shows the cost of home insurance in September 2006 dropped below November 2001 levels.  This is not me or any fancy rhetoric.  It is Central Statistics Office data.I agree the insurance industry has higher profits.  Will Deputy O'Keeffe meet with the chairperson, Senator O'Toole, who is the vice-chair and a Member of the Oireachtas, and the chief executive officer——

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	405	I have.  I met with them, put these questions to them, received responses and articulated them to the House.  I ask the Deputy——

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	407	——to go to the board himself and not to add to the sustained campaign by vested interests to undermine it.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	408	I understand the particular concern expressed by the American Chamber of Commerce survey relates to fourth level or PhD graduates.  A concerted effort is made across Departments to promote fourth level education in Ireland.  This is reflected in a number of ways, including in the work of bodies such as Science Foundation Ireland.The recently launched strategy for science, technology and innovation has an explicit target of doubling the number of PhD graduates in Ireland by 2013.  The budget 2006 commitment of €300 million to the strategic innovation fund for higher education over the five years to 2010 is a further indication of the Government's focus on this area.In a tight labour market such as exists in Ireland, it is inevitable individual companies will experience difficulty at times in recruiting suitable personnel.  However, a sustained commitment exists to do whatever is required to ensure the necessary pool of qualified and skilled personnel is available and that appropriate steps are taken to anticipate and redress skills gaps.  Increased investment has been made in upskilling those in employment and FÁS received significant funding aimed at upskilling those within the workforce.The expert group on future skills needs has monitored our future skills needs since 1997.  The expert group conducts detailed research for my Department to underpin a national skills strategy to be brought forward by the Government in 2007.  The purpose of the research and subsequent strategy is to ensure Ireland identifies and meets its changing skills needs during the period to 2020.The expert group also commenced work on a specialist skills study which will underpin the development of the centre for financial services skills.  This initiative is a response to a recent report entitled Building on Success produced by the high-level clearing house group under the Department of the Taoiseach.In addition to upskilling the resident population, I introduced a system of green cards and work permits to facilitate high-skilled migration into Ireland to alleviate constraints in areas of strategic importance where skills shortages are greatest.  The ongoing commitment to building skills and competencies within the labour force will be reflected in the new national development plan.  I am confident the measures put in place by the Government will ensure the necessary pool of qualified and skilled personnel is available to cater for future demands.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	409	I acknowledge what the Minister stated.  What was worrying about the headlines put before us by the American Chamber of Commerce, particularly by Dr. Fraser Logue, was that 42% of those surveyed stated their parent company would not view Ireland favourably as a location for investment because of labour shortages and 73% stated they struggled to secure skilled labour.I tabled this question to bring these matters to the attention of the Minister and show US companies have deep concerns about these issues.  I acknowledge the Minister indicated a number of policy responses he will make.  How does he intend to communicate more forcibly that message to the American Chamber of Commerce and the companies involved and ensure it, rather than the negative message from the survey, is received?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	410	We have regular meetings with the American Chamber of Commerce.  We will discuss this issue at future meetings.  I meet individual companies overseas and here.  In the overall context, through the extraordinary inward migration to Ireland and the expanded third level system, we make every possible effort to facilitate low and high skill availability.  The decision in May 2004 regarding the accession states represented a huge increase in labour force availability to Ireland.  That should also be acknowledged by the companies concerned.  It was unprecedented and caused many other pressures for us, as we discussed.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	411	That is the reason Google is still here.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	412	The green card we will introduce as part of the work permits system will facilitate high-skilled labour and will better streamline it.  I accept the procedures must be streamlined to facilitate inter-company transfer, which will be statutorily facilitated in the Act.  We will introduce regulations to commence it in the new year.  The green card and work permit systems will focus on higher skills.A number of US companies continue to locate here.  Although we experience fast growth, the skills issue will be managed through a combination of investment, education and migration.  Other issues such as broadband and energy, which was mentioned by the Deputy, must be addressed.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	413	Directive 98/6/EC on the requirement to indicate product prices was transposed into Irish law in Statutory Instrument No. 639 of 2002 and came into force on 1 March 2003.  The directive obliges retailers to display the selling price and the unit price per kilo or litre for products.  As the Deputy is aware, I will introduce major consumer legislation later this year to establish the new national consumer agency and transpose the unfair commercial practices directive into Irish law.  I also decided to review certain EU and domestic secondary legislation in connection with consumer protection.I decided to review the EU price display legislation as it impacts on a consumer every time he or she purchases a product.  On 20 October 2006, I arranged for advertisements to be placed in national newspapers inviting comments on the regulations.  A consultation document outlining the issues on which people may wish to comment was also produced and is available on the Department's website.  I also arranged that groups and businesses with an interest in these matters be contacted.  Now is an opportune time to review these regulations as the EU Commission is conducting its own review.  Comments can be sent to my Department by Friday, 17 November 2006.  After this, I will consider the responses and decide what further action to take.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	414	Is the National Consumer Agency up and running and available for business?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	415	Yes.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	416	I will give an example of what happens.  The telephone number on the website is the Forfás switchboard.  One is put through to voicemail.  The person who ultimately answers that voicemail does not know much about the National Consumer Agency or its responsibilities.  Another constituent of mine tried to contact the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and was left waiting on the telephone for 30 minutes.  In the end, the constituent had to hang up in frustration after that long delay.  The Minister will forgive me therefore if, based on that information, I do not have much confidence in the National Consumer Agency.  I ask him to ensure that the interim arrangements he has established are actually working because they have not worked to date.  Effectively, since Ms Foley left office in August, there has been no proper channel of communication or opportunity for the public to make complaints or get the responses one would expect from a professional statutory body, albeit currently run on an interim basis.  Consumers are angry when faced with such a frustrating experience.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	417	I will certainly take up that issue with the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs which is operating as it always has, despite the change of personnel.  There may have been a blip on that particular day but the office is up and running, as it always has been and there has been no particular change there.  In fact, I recently launched the National Consumer Agency's new website, which is quite comprehensive and effective.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	418	It is a bit like Leas Cross — one would want to be careful what one opens or launches.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	419	It is available for the public to access in terms of rights data and so on.  I hope to have the legislation ready for publication before the end of the year.  It is the number one priority and is well advanced in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  The passage of that legislation will enable us to put the agency on a statutory footing.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	420	I propose to take Questions Nos. 82, 112 and 137 together.As indicated in replies to previous questions, matters relating to the liquidation of the company concerned are currently the subject of attention by the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  Each of these bodies is independent in the performance of its functions and it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the matters concerned at this stage.To the best of my recollection, I have not received any representations from directors or representatives of any of the companies referred to since my appointment.  The situation regarding the company in liquidation was brought to my attention in May 2006 by the insolvency payments section of my Department in connection with the preparation of a reply to Parliamentary Question No. 138 of 17 May 2006.As regards new legislation relating to "phoenix" situations, I would draw attention to the changes introduced by Part 5 of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001, which address problems and issues connected with business failure.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	421	I thank the Minister for his reply and I appreciate that when there are ongoing investigations the Minister is circumscribed as to what he can say.  If we can talk about the generality of such cases, however, is the Minister prepared to ensure that once those cases are brought to his attention a monitoring process will be put in place by the relevant company supervision sections of his Department?  That would ensure that potential beneficiaries of what appears to be an abuse of loopholes in company law will be able to continue to operate either as company directors or to trade in the marketplace in a way that enables them to evade the sort of responsibilities that other compliant company directors and operating companies must bear.  Without prejudice to the outcome of the final case, it would appear that certain practices were engaged in, some of which may have been legal, though sharp.  They enabled companies to evade their responsibilities, although we must await the outcome of the judgment; I am not specifically mentioning any particular case.  In a buoyant economy, which we all welcome, and at a time of great demand for the provision of services, when competition can be difficult to regulate fairly, it is incumbent upon the Department and agencies under the Minister's aegis to ensure that a level playing pitch exists for all legitimate players, rather than a field day for all the cowboys.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	422	I share the sentiments expressed by the Deputy.  I wish to put on the record the main company law provisions in Ireland dealing with such companies.  Companies that fail and re-engage in trading under a new name are addressed under the Companies Acts 1963-2005 and, in particular, under the provisions of Part 5 of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001.  Under section 56 of the latter Act, a new reporting regime to the Director of Corporate Enforcement was introduced in respect of all insolvent liquidations, under which the circumstances of the insolvency and the conduct of the company's directors are scrutinised and reported on by the liquidators.  Liquidators of such companies are legally obliged to bring proceedings for the restriction of directors unless relieved of this obligation by the Director of Corporate Enforcement.  To date, in excess of 650 company directors have been restricted.  Powers are also available to the director to pursue directors of insolvent companies which have not been placed into liquidation.  While we accept that business failure is an unfortunate part of life, the changes introduced in Part 5 of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001, in particular, are intended to address problems and issues connected with business failure, including what has been referred to as the "phoenix" syndrome.Company law is also under continuing review, particularly through the work of the company law review group.  I will undertake to revert to that group within the Department to examine this case and ascertain whether lessons can be learned about plugging loopholes.  A review of the legislation will determine whether we need to amend it further.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	426	I am a little confused, although not for the first time in my life, needless to say.  It seems that perhaps the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan and Deputy Broughan are, in fact, on the same wavelength, except that they are running along parallel lines.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	427	Parallel lines never meet.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	428	They could converge at some later stage because we are all into interconnection nowadays.  Eventually those parallel lines might cross an interconnector.  The Minister has confirmed that an interconnector will be built and will be State controlled.  I do not have any problem with that.  There might be some merit in having a second interconnector, as most people in the business believe that one will not be enough.  We might need a second one, depending upon the degree to which we propose to sell off excess power supply and may have to import power in certain circumstances.  Any observer of the system will know that can vary dramatically but I feel that something has been missed.  I do not see anything wrong with competition between the public and private sectors, although that has disappeared from the horizon in recent times.  In this House, we tend to be idealistic about it and either go for one or the other, whereas a balance needs to be met somewhere in the middle.  This is so, where a utility service is in control of one sector, such as with Eircom.  I mean no disrespect to the people involved in that company but it got away from all of us.  Some of us predicted it would happen, although that meant nothing.  It got away from us for a variety of reasons.  It is a volatile industry, it has a short technological lifespan, similar to the generation of electricity, and it is hugely attractive to investors, particularly when interest rates are low.  There is a similar situation here.  Again a utility service is in question.  It is vital to the domestic economy on a daily basis and the only thing that concentrates people's minds is a blackout.  When the lights go out there is a serious problem and heads roll, if they can be found.The integrity of the grid will be of critical importance in the future and it must remain under State ownership.  Equally, it must be kept completely separate from the generating companies.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	429	The Deputy is making his second contribution which was to last two minutes.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	430	They have been two long minutes that will come to an end shortly.  As Deputy Broughan suggested, in a totally privatised situation the transmission, as part of the grid, could be controlled by the same people, which would not necessarily be in the best interests of all concerned.  The ideal is to generate competition between the public and private sectors and ensure the fundamental infrastructure is controlled by the State so it cannot be hijacked and sold to another party which, in turn, will hijack the whole population and the economy.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	431	Is it not the case that the ESB makes the vast majority of its profits in the transmission network area?  Regarding the transmission and distribution systems, is there not a real concern that the company's profits are being sheltered in a non-competitive area?  This is another reason separation of ownership would favour open and honest competition and my colleague Deputy Broughan might find this interesting.Regarding social justice, does the Minister agree the high cost of transmission and distribution, which apply as a fixed cost to low energy users, typically those on lower incomes, is the real scandal in the current high cost of energy?  On the grounds of social justice it is essential we separate ownership to help those experiencing fuel poverty.  Regardless of ideology, nobody in this House, even the most rabid Progressive Democrats existing within Fianna Fáil, is talking about the sale of the transmission network to the private sector given the disastrous consequences of the sale of a similar wired network in telecommunications.I will return to my original question, having posed some questions on the side.  Why does this legislation not provide for EirGrid's ownership of the transmission network?  If it cannot apply to the existing transmission network it should, at least, apply to the new transmission network under construction.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	432	A number of points have been raised that are similar to those raised in the first round of contributions on this aspect of the Bill and I will try to deal with them again.EirGrid is vested, established and will own the east-west interconnector due to be completed not later than 2012.  It is important that we made this start in the area.  Everyone in the House accepts EirGrid will act independently, though I accept the Deputies' point that without ownership of the transmission system there is a danger and a public perception that it will not work independently.I was slightly lost in the argument made by Deputy Broughan before lunch relating to competition and the ESB.  Unions and management at the ESB see the ownership of the transmission wires as a kind of Holy Grail.  EirGrid currently controls the transmission system.  Whether the thinking behind that is ideological or strategic, in the hope that in the future it will be privatised, I do not know.  The transmission system does not need to be owned by the ESB.In answer to Deputy Ryan's question, little profit is made from the transmission system, as opposed to the distribution system, which is lucrative.  It is not accurate to say high energy costs arise largely from regulated returns from these two systems, though I accept they are a factor.  Deloitte & Touche shows that 70% of these costs arise from external factors, mainly the prices paid for fossil fuels and so on.  Approximately 30% arises from domestic factors, one of which is the operation and maintenance of the systems.I think Deputy Broughan was accusing some in my party and the Progressive Democrats of trying to sell off the network, but that is not on the cards.

The Deputy is basically saying he will cry for consumers and those being hit by high electricity prices but we should not ask him to upset members of the trade unions in the ESB by asking them to shift a little ground and allow the competitive market we need to come about.  As Deputy Eamon Ryan noted, a competitive market can be achieved in generation by allowing more operators into the system, making the market sufficiently attractive and increasing efficiency in areas of the ESB that have been slow to become more efficient.I do not propose to accept the amendments as they would be in conflict with the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 and Statutory Instrument No. 445.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	450	The Minister did not satisfactorily explain the legislative device he is using with regard to the position of interconnectors in the transmission system.  The new section 2A(1) states that an interconnector owned by the board is part of the transmission system, while section 2A(2) states that an interconnector not owned by the board is not part of the transmission system.  This would apply to EirGrid's ownership of the proposed interconnector.  However, section 2A(3) states: "Notwithstanding subsection (2), an interconnector owned by a person other than the Board shall be considered to be part of the transmission system for the purposes of calculating charges and imposing charges for use of the transmission system."  In that case, is an interconnector owned by EirGrid part of the transmission system?  What differences will apply to EirGrid's management of this facility versus any other facility?  What purposes are involved other than calculating and imposing charges?I do not understand the legislative ploy being used in this section.  Is it a mechanism to get around the political difficulty the Minister has with the Taoiseach or ESB trade unions?  Why will the Minister accept not the amendment to enable EirGrid to own a transmission asset?  Given that the interconnector in question is new, this would not create any historical difficulties.  Why is the Minister using this complicated and contradictory legislative device?

In page 19, line 38, after "Commission" to insert the following:", sanctioned by the Minister, and approved by a motion of Dáil Éireann".I wonder if the Minister would examine the possibility of taking this amendment on board.  It would be a painless exercise in the sense that it would be a meeting of minds in the House.  It would recognise a principle we have spoken of quite a bit with regard to this particular piece of legislation.Ironically, when I tabled this amendment we did not have the debate over price rises and decisions taken by regulators etc. that has taken place in the past few weeks.  The relevant section of the Bill reads:Section 16 of the Act of 1999 is amended—(a) by the substitution for subsection (1) of the following subsection:"(1) A person shall not—(a) construct or reconstruct a generating station for the purpose of supply to final customers, or(b) construct an interconnector,unless an appropriate authorisation has been granted to the person by the Commission.",I propose to add ", sanctioned by the Minister, and approved by a motion of Dáil Éireann".This area could become very controversial at a later stage.  The commission is independent in making decisions, but the approval should come from the Minister and the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In that context, it would lend authority and strength to the Bill.  It would not in any way interfere with the independence of the commission, but it would, importantly, give political direction to what will essentially be a political issue, namely the availability of adequate supply, be it gas, electricity etc.  It would be useful to add that particular amendment and this was the most appropriate place I could think of inserting it.  I hope the Minister consider to what extent he can accommodate it.I do not wish to revisit the previous debate on Eircom.  We should have been able to do something, but we were unable to do anything because it was all outside our control.  It was outside the Minister's control, and nothing could be done about it.  He could not reach out and get hold of the part of the infrastructure, the main framework of the communications section.This section states:(1) A person shall not—(a) construct or reconstruct a generating station for the purpose of supply to final customers, or(b) construct an interconnector,These are two very important areas.  I would like to hear the Minister's views on the subject.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	456	I have some sympathy for Deputy Durkan's proposal.  It is a bit like the discussion we had last week on NORA, the National Oil Reserves Agency.  The Minister wants to give reasonable flexibility to the Department and to CER, in this case, with regard to the development of the generation system or the possibility of an interconnector.  Clearly it could have a fundamental impact on our infrastructure down the line.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	457	I am not accepting the amendments because providing that the Minister sanction a decision of the CER and granting the authorisations being spoken about would undermine the statutory independence of the CER.  The existing provisions for CER to grant an authorisation to construct a power station, consent to construct a natural gas pipeline or license an energy undertaking do not require any ministerial consent.  Moving in this direction with this Bill is not an option, certainly not one I will exercise.There is also the question of consistency with the provision for the Minister to give policy directions to CER, which we have just discussed.  It is explicitly stated that the Minister may not issue a policy direction in respect of a person who has applied for or holds a licence, authorisation or consent.  Therefore, sanctioning a decision of CER in granting an authorisation to construct an interconnector is not an appropriate role for the Minister in this.The amendment on the issue of competitive tendering seeks to remove the option of the CER securing the construction of an interconnector by any means other than by competitive tender.  Nothing is envisaged other than this process occurring through competitive tender, which is clearly the preferred option.  It should not be the only means open to CER to secure the construction of an interconnector.Circumstances could arise where the process would need to be done in a manner other than through that method.  Therefore it is not proposed to amend the provision.  In particular, where an interconnector is part of the Irish transmission system and owned by the ESB, it would fall on the ESB to procure or carry out the works to construct it.Deputy Durkan has also tabled an amendment seeking to specify that any authorisation to construct an interconnector without prior competitive tender must be approved by Dáil motion.  As I have indicated previously, there are legitimate reasons an interconnector may be developed by a means other than competitive tender.  In any case, the Minister's consent is required before the final decision is taken.  Therefore, I do not propose to accept that amendment either.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	458	The Minister might outline some of the circumstances he envisages whereby an interconnector might be constructed without a competitive tender.  As he has hinted, I presume the ESB might be directed to build one without a competitive tender.  However, years ago in the local authorities, if a particular project was going for private tender, the local authorities would tender themselves in order to test the framework for their own contract.  By doing this, they could see if they could do it as well.I do not wish to be obtuse.  It might be somewhat beneficial to have that safeguard there and not slow the process down.  I can understand that in an emergency situation, the process might go ahead without a competitive tender.  One should remember that according to all reports, even in an emergency situation it would take a number of years, or at least one year, to build an interconnector.  I am wondering what kind of emergency situation could arise that would force everybody to avoid the competitive tendering process and proceed on an emergency basis where it could take five years for the emergency to come about?  I am not sure the idea is soundly based.

#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	461	With reference to amendment No. 63, the Minister is following the 1999 Act closely with regard to the interconnector and the terms laid down for the generation stations previously.  I have some sympathy for the general position outlined by Deputy Durkan.  In the past there has been concern about the beauty contest route being used with regard to public infrastructure.  I recall the 3G licensing system.  While the British used a competitive system which resulted in great and substantial revenues for the Exchequer, we used the beauty contest route and did so late in the day.  It could be the case that benefits to the State could be maximised by always using the competitive tender route.The Minister will have to take a decision on Eircom.  We will be asking questions next week about whether the Minister will have a competitive tender for enabling the 10% or 15% of the country that does not have broadband.  I ask the Minister to explain the reason for this provision about generation stations both in this Bill and in the original 1999 Act.  My amendment No. 63 seeks to delete the provision and to go the competitive tender route.Both Deputy Durkan and I know from our experience in local government that the competitive tender process would bring the best benefits for the community and the Exchequer.  I ask the Minister to outline the reason for retaining that section in the Bill.  In this regard it would be preferable to give CER reasonable autonomy regarding the provision of interconnection.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	462	Three or four years ago, CER tried to get the market to provide an interconnector but was not successful as there was no interest shown.  People wanted to go down the route of getting an interconnector with a regulated rate of return as they were not going to operate on a market basis.  Had the interconnector been absolutely essential, it would have been useful for CER to have been in a position to direct, for example, the ESB which would be the most competent at that stage, to provide the interconnector, without a competitive tendering process.  We should not confuse that kind of direction in an emergency situation.  We should not assume if that were to happen, that the ESB would not be obliged to go and seek competitive tenders themselves for aspects of the competition.  It is not a free hand with an option to spend as much money as possible.  There would be competitive tendering specifically for the building and so on.It is always prudent to leave oneself as much latitude as possible with regard to legislation.  I acknowledge that the courts increasingly decide we must narrow everything down and spell everything out and try to foresee every possible situation.  It is prudent that this provision remain in this Bill to allow for maximum flexibility.The Deputies asked me to provide examples of circumstances in which it might be used.  The ESB owns the transmission lines so it may be the body that has to do it.  I cannot envisage the circumstances where it might arise but it certainly will not arise within the next five or six years because we know what we are doing regarding the North-South interconnector and the east-west interconnector.  It is not likely to emerge until sometime after 2012 if we go down the route of further interconnection either to the UK or Europe.

In page 22, line 14, after "threatened" to insert ", with the approval of Dáil Éireann,".This is the old favourite triple lock system, with the approval of Dáil Éireann, which has been discussed ad
nauseam for the past week with regard to this and other legislation.  We are losing sight of this provision as time goes by.  There are those who say it is a good thing that everything should be independent but I do not agree.  Legislation produced in Parliament should be subject to Parliament and its operation, within reason, apart from the day-to-day administration, should have some reason to resort to Parliament for approval as time goes by.There is far too much development taking place in this country.  The late Brian Lenihan, a former Member of this House, used to say that the formation of quangos was coming with such rapidity that one would be dizzy looking at them.  It is regrettable and a sure sign of Governments and Ministers opting out of responsibility for being in the firing line when a decision they do not want to make arises.  However, this does not stop them from talking to RTE or various other radio stations whenever it suits them.  This is not a personal criticism of the Minister.  It is a fact of life that whether we like it or not, this House is moving further away from giving approval, especially where large corporations are concerned.  This means Ministers need not get involved not only on a daily basis but hardly ever.  If there is a crisis, the commission will handle it and there will be no reference to anybody else.  If there is good news and oil has been found and gas is spewing out of the ground at some location in some part of the country, the Minister naturally will become involved.  The amendment is useful and I ask the Minister to consider it.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	467	As Deputy Durkan said, this amendment seeks to amend the 1999 Act.  It stems from our experiences in recent years when we noted the crisis between Russia and Ukraine which threatened European gas supplies.  Until gas from the Corrib field comes ashore, we are at the end of a long pipeline.  This is clearly a key area that the Minister has rightly inserted into the Bill.I am not sure if the Chair was in the House during the infamous and harsh winter of 1981-82.  My late colleague and party leader Michael O'Leary was Tánaiste at the time and was responsible for the operation of all the systems, including the energy system, in the immediate aftermath of a huge storm.  There is also the ongoing threat from terrorism, including the recent worrying reports to the British authorities on nuclear terrorism.  There is clearly a huge role for the Minister to play, and Deputy Noel Dempsey has to be commended for including this in the section.  I am sympathetic to the Fine Gael amendments as they allow for this House to be called into session in such an emergency.  It seems reasonable to add "that the approval of the Dáil" might be required.It is right that an elected Minister should take responsibility for a serious crisis.  That is why I have tabled amendment No. 72.  It reads: "In the event of a sudden crisis in the energy market the Minister is responsible for the maintenance and full functioning of the national energy system."  If such a crisis were to happen and the Minister was in opposition, he would no doubt say that the Minister of the day must be responsible.  However, the experience of recent years is different.  The public will ask us why the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has not resigned over the issue of long-stay elderly care.  The public instinctively feels that the political head should be responsible.  This goes outside the remit of this Bill.  It does not specifically refer to the CER, although the Minister can direct it and the generating companies and licence holders.While the Minister might say that it is understood that he is responsible, he refused to answer a question I asked him yesterday about standing gas charges.  The Chair will often shoot down my questions and say they are a matter for the CER.  The operation and maintenance of the energy system itself must be the Minister's responsibility.  He must take responsibility in a time of crisis and were he to fail to discharge that responsibility he would have to resign.  Notwithstanding the CER or any other agency or organisation, such as EirGrid or the ESB, the Minister and his successors must be responsible at a time of crisis.  In the deep winter of 1981-82, the Tánaiste was regarded as being responsible, and rightly so.

Every time I visited a local authority they wanted to tell me how poorly off and cash-strapped they were.  They would produce the books to prove this to me and refer to the loss of rates and other sources of income.  In the middle of it would be "snow money", the money that the then Tánaiste, Michael O'Leary, promised local authorities from his office in Dublin.  He told them to do whatever it took to clear the roads and the Department would look after it.  They are still waiting for the money.

I know the Deputy does not intend this to mean that it should happen in the normal course of events, but it would be counter-productive to require the Minister to take control of the system even in an emergency.We return to the distinction between being accountable to the House and being responsible.  I will take responsibility for all my actions from the day that I can walk into a Department, pick my own staff and take action against people who perhaps do not do things the way they should.  I will take responsibility for all my actions.  From that time I am accountable to this House.  I explained to this House what happened rather than taking responsibility when it is somebody else's responsibility due to how he or she handled a situation.  While it is important we are accountable to the House, and I do not mind this, there is a significant difference between accountability and responsibility.

The Minister accepted the phrase completely and it improves the section because it clarifies that when the Minister orders a person to do something, that person is responsible to the Minister.  This issue of ministerial and Cabinet responsibility has been discussed way back by Mr. Walter Bagehot and various political philosophers in the 19th century.  This issue has been discussed for 200 years and it goes back to British rule.  These are unusual circumstances.  The Minister is right to include this in the Bill.  We have talked about this, and although we hope it will never happen, we fear it will because of a problem with supply, pricing or geopolitical events, hopefully not due to a major terrorist action.  It is also right to say that in a crisis the Minister would take the decisions.  However, would it not be best to say the Minister must bear responsibility if, for example, after the relevant committee investigated it, we were not happy with the outcome or we felt it could have been different?  This might arise if a future Minister made a hames of an emergency.  That is simple enough.  One might say general Cabinet and Government accountability and responsibility would apply.  Maybe collective responsibility would apply and the entire Government would resign.  I have been examining this because it is an issue on which we have asked the Minister many questions.  It should specify that the buck stops with the Minister.  That is why I am tabling this amendment.

I do not want to overstate my concern about this issue, but I raised it with CER, EirGrid and the ESB last May.  I asked them for written reports on it and asked if they were satisfied that we would be okay for the winter.  I received assurances from them in September and further information a couple of weeks ago.  I had a meeting with them two or three weeks ago during which they assured me everything would be all right.  I had a meeting this morning and received categoric assurances.  Those two bodies, particularly the CER, are responsible for advising me and when they tell me the system is okay I have to accept that they are the experts.  While I accept their word that it is not going to happen, suppose we have a blackout during the winter.  As a member of the Opposition, Deputy Broughan would call for my resignation, as would everybody else; I am not picking on the Deputy in particular and I do not seek to make a political point.  However, what more can I do than ask the experts who are responsible for advising me and get their assurance, as I have done?  I should not resign if there were a blackout.  I have a clear idea who should resign in that event, and it would not be me.

In page 24, line 36, after "Minister," to insert "who shall report to the Oireachtas,".I apologise for my absence from the House for a few minutes.  We are back on the same track of bringing the Minister and the Oireachtas into the equation.  The Minister can take this on board and I will not spend too much time on it.  It is not intrusive.  The Minister can report to the Oireachtas anyway, and it is a question of being doubly sure and keeping the Oireachtas informed on what is happening.  The Oireachtas may not normally have access to this information, be alert to it or aware of it.  There are so many directives, generated in Europe and nationally, coming through faxes, e-mails and all types of sources at present that a meitheal is needed to monitor their value, extent and impact.  It would be no harm if the Minister reports to the Oireachtas.Amendment No. 80 is related and correctly so.  It is very similar, and states "provided the Minister and the Oireachtas had been informed".  This is a similar debate to those we have had in respect of the last number of sections.  There is a necessity to inform the Minister and the Oireachtas.  Amendment No. 81 is similar and is self-explanatory.

In page 24, line 44, after "pipelines" to insert the following:"including all pipeline terminals and refineries associated with the recovery, bringing ashore and processing of Ireland's onshore or off-shore natural gas resources".These are again the amendments of the 1999 Act relating to natural gas safety and the functions of the commission thereby, by the insertion after subsection (1)(f) of the 1999 Act, where the commission, having consulted with the Minister, shall establish and implement a natural gas safety regulatory framework and report annually to the Minister etc.  It will include a system for the inspection and testing of all natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines.I sought that this should be extended to include all pipeline terminals and refineries associated with the recovery, bringing ashore and processing of Ireland's onshore or off-shore natural gas resources.  I thought this might be a useful contribution to the debate we had last week, which I do not wish to return to at length on this occasion.  However, we again witnessed unfortunate events last Friday as regards the ongoing dispute at Corrib Gas and the concerns of north Mayo, Erris and that whole area.  The safety concerns people had with the pipeline route were vindicated by the Minister's technical advisory group, TAG, by Atlantica and by the centre for public inquiry.  Because of that it would be wise to have a reference in the legislation to terminals and refineries.  Given that this is obviously a development that the Minister has suggested will lead into an exciting new time for Irish exploration, surely it is something that could be included, to give CER a fundamental role.One of the reports at the conference opened by the Minister last week, from Island Gas, I believe, suggested there might be approximately 130 to 140 years of oil supply lying in certain tranches off our western shores.  If that bears any remote relationship to reality, it is quite clear that this type of development is something that is central to recovery of those resources for our nation.  Obviously, next week we shall ask about the Indecon report and other matters referred to by the Minister.  However, it would be a useful contribution to call on the Minister to try to have those matters resolved, even at this late stage, so that we may have the recovery of our natural resources off the coast of north-west Mayo by agreement instead of the appalling incidents we witnessed last Friday. The ongoing stand-off will produce appalling dangers in the future for the people of the area as well as the Garda Síochána so I urge the Minister to take a leading role in that regard.  If the current contacts which are being developed with Shell, Norwegian interests and others lead to anything fruitful, I call on the Minister to give his immediate support.  Specifically in this case, however, it would be helpful if we included terminals and refineries.On a final point, anyone who had been dealing with this very difficult issue, such as the Minister, and spokespersons in the House, have all learned enormous lessons for the future about Irish natural resources, their exploration and what must be done. It would be an important step forward to give CER a role as regards terminals and refineries.Amendment No. 79, after line 9, relates to how the commission would carry out its safety functions so that procedures for the investigation of any incidents involving natural gas "including all onshore and off-shore exploration and recovery facilities", are provided for.  This means that at the heart of this will be a reference to the exploration programme, to try to avoid the disasters of the Corrib saga over the past ten years. It would mean a system is in place that the public could have great confidence in for any part of Ireland which might be a reception area for major off-shore resources.  As I said, the Department's conference last week seems to indicate our territorial waters and maritime economic zone is the home of great natural resources.  We shall press this point in the House in coming months and hopefully we will have the chance to have an input, after the general election, to introduce measures and a regime that will ensure all our natural resources are exploited for the benefit of the Irish people.  As regards safety, first, I ask the Minister to adopt these two amendments.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	501	The Deputy will appreciate that the gas safety provision which is under consideration in this Bill relates to downstream facilities only.  On the issue raised by the Deputy, as regards the specific types of infrastructure he describes, we are examining the matter in detail with the co-operation of CER, with a view to providing the appropriate legislative framework to ensure that such functions are properly transferred.  The Deputy may recall that this was among the recommendations made through our technical advisory group and in the Atlantica reports on the Corrib gas field.  It is agreed that there is no problem and that CER will look after this.  We are in a consultative process with CER, the petroleum industry and the Health and Safety Authority with a view to progressing the whole matter, having regard to the current requirement for analysis of regulatory impacts.  As the Deputy knows well, once regulations are being introduced and new standards are being imposed, a regulatory impact assessment must be carried out and that is taking place in consultation with the various bodies referred to.The process is much more complex than I had envisaged when we first set out on this route.  In line with what Deputy Broughan said, it has to be done correctly and we are taking a cautious approach.  I thought we might have been able to spell it out in this Bill, but because we want to do it correctly and need to consult widely, that has not been possible.  We might be in a position to amend the Bill in the Seanad to take account of the Deputy's suggestions and he might alert the Labour Party spokesperson there about that.  However, if that proves difficult for us, technically and legally, we shall have to do this via separate legislation and that is the intent.  However, I would prefer if it could be done in this Bill given that we have taken this route.  I assure Deputy Broughan that either this Bill will be amended in the Seanad or a separate Bill will be published once talks have concluded.There is nothing to be gained by returning to last week's debate.  It is not accurate to state that worries about the pipeline and its route were vindicated by TAG, Advantica and CPI.  That may be the case with the CPI report but I do not hold much store by it.  The TAG report did not make any adjudication but Advantica made it clear the pipeline, as proposed, is safe.  A number of recommendations were made to allay fears.  Mr. Peter Cassells accepted the report.  He would be the first to state he was not technically competent to second guess world experts in the area.  In a bid to meet the genuine concerns of a number of people in Mayo, he recommended a change in the pipeline.  All this was accepted by Shell and by the Department but spurned by Shell to Sea.I welcome the optimistic scenarios regarding what might lie off the west coast.  I hope the predictions are correct.  The more people exploring, the better chance we have of making finds.  Currently it is only speculation.  While it is wonderful to speak of 10 billion barrels, we must first discover them and then bring them ashore.  Before the end of the year I hope to be able to discuss the terms of the next set of licences and explorations.The scenes we saw last Friday were appalling.  No useful purpose is served by rent-a-mob or by anyone stoking up feelings.  I defend the right to peaceful protest but others have the right to work.  If everyone respects the rights of others we will not see the scenes we saw last week.

I was not there on Friday but I attended on Monday and I spoke to muintir na háite.  Grave concerns continue and I urge the Minister to take a pro-active role to resolve this because of the danger of the stand-off.  It should not fall on the shoulders of Opposition Deputies to resolve this.  It is the Minister's responsibility.  I welcome the Minister's acceptance of the principle of my amendments and his willingness to possibly include them at the next stage.  These amendments warrant a new Bill.The Kinsale exploration gave some of us domestic household gas for the first time.  Streets in my area were dug up in the late 1980s and early 1990s to supply gas for the first time even though the area is only ten miles from the GPO.  Legislation should have been published in that regard.  It is necessary in view of the impasse with Shell, which we have an opportunity to discuss next week.  The Taoiseach seems to have closed his mind to the possibility of considering the fears and proposals of the local people.  One should be open to resolutions of this matter.

None of us wishes to exacerbate the situation.  Original positions that were relatively easy to resolve have become mountains.  As legislators we must encourage those involved to accept that the use of a natural resource is imperative to the nation's economy.  We must address areas of common ground with the objective of achieving credibility in the use of our natural resources.  At some stage we must decide if we have won or lost without making it a life or death issue.  If issues such as this become life or death, no progress will take place.  We will not be able to build roads, factories or buildings.In the initial stages there were genuine concerns.  We spoke of how structures will be in place in future as a result of this legislation.  Notwithstanding the best efforts of all concerned, we arrived at an unsatisfactory situation in respect of development of the Corrib gas field.  We must learn from this.  The Minister should avail of the opportunity to make amendments in the Seanad.  The amendments tabled by my colleague are in order.

While it might be convenient for the Minister or others such as Deputy Kenny to believe this and to make such statements, it is completely wrong.  How could the Minister know when he never came to the site to examine what was happening?  He believes people who tell him what he wishes to hear.  Local people have a problem pertaining to the installation of an operation in a pristine 400 acre area that is to become what people view as a centre for the petrochemical industry.  The area is completely undisturbed and has everything going for it.  However, the proposed development will destroy the entire area to produce 50 long-term jobs.Some issues, such as cold venting of the gas were not addressed in the planning process.  Potentially, such issues are extremely damaging for the area.  The Minister continually speaks about the pipeline, which is dictated by the location of the refinery and that issue was never addressed by either Advantica or Peter Cassells.The Minister could not be more incorrect if he believes this has to do with outsiders.  It pertains to local people.  People nationwide are upset and annoyed that the Government, including the Minister and the Taoiseach, is washing its hands in this respect.  This is an extremely important matter for the people of the locality.  They are passive people who would do nothing other than protest peacefully, as they have been doing.  However, something must give when hundreds of people and hundreds of gardaí are present and Members are witnessing conflict between many people on the ground on a daily basis.  If he is interested, the Minister can come and see this reality.The price of gas has risen by 30% and the Minister is aware that were Corrib gas to be brought ashore tomorrow, it would make no difference in this regard.  As for Deputy Durkan's idea regarding security of supply, the biggest pipeline in the world links the United Kingdom with Norway and that pipeline has provided an assured supply of gas to the market, which is global.I do not understand why the Minister will not at least identify the optimal potential site for this refinery as this issue has never been considered.  The Shell to Sea campaign proposed an independent commission to consider the issue of the location of the refinery.  Although the Minister incorrectly dismissed it as being completely irrelevant, it provides a practical solution to this issue.  For all his talk of sorting out all the concerns regarding safety issues and so on, the Minister has never considered the location of the refinery.  He should do so and the best way is to accept the idea of an independent commission of inquiry.  Otherwise, this problem will simply persist.  The people deserve more.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	509	I wish to be associated with Deputy Cowley's remarks.  He has put forward a reasonable response to much of the recent emanations regarding decent, ordinary local people who have protested peacefully in order that their concerns and safety are addressed.  I stress there has been a deliberate attempt to create a perception that events in County Mayo are being orchestrated from outside, but nothing could be further from the truth.  I visited the site a number of months ago and learned at first hand of people's concerns, fears and worries.  I have also heard them articulate their position from a very reasonable standpoint.  Basically, local people want to talk to those who are prepared to listen with an open mind, rather than entering talks with a fixed position to ride roughshod over their rights.  I cannot blame people with such fears for protesting as they have been doing.  They genuinely have the interests of the country and its resources at heart.As Deputy Cowley noted, the presence of hundreds of gardaí in an area probably results in a community that lives in fear.  However, the Minister is not prepared to talk to these people.  It reflects a closed-minded approach on the part of the Government.When refineries, the amount of gas off our coast and similar issues are discussed, it is suggested that this will be of great benefit to the economy and to the people of the west.  Apart from the initial creation of jobs, the gas, which will come from our resources, will be bought at market value.  There should be honesty in this regard.  A spin is being placed on commentary, most of which emanates from those with a vested interest, as well as from the Government.  Local people are being demonised accordingly, as are people who support them from around the coastal communities of Ireland.  Throughout this island, genuinely concerned people who support them are being falsely accused of orchestrating deliberate violence, which is not the case.  I fully support Deputy Cowley's contribution in this respect.  No one has more authority to speak in this regard than a man who comes from the area and is one of the people.

Members have digressed considerably from the amendments.As for Deputy Cowley's comments, I have never denied that some local people are concerned about this project.  I have accepted this and have done everything possible to try to meet such concerns.  Although the Deputy continually berates me for not listening or not hearing what people say, I listen carefully.  People told me they had concerns regarding the pipeline running so close to their houses and wanted those concerns addressed.  Instead of taking action myself, I asked an independent body to examine the issue.  It was to listen to the local people and to record their views carefully.  When that was complete, it was to use its expertise to tell me whether the concerns and fears were justified.  I set no parameters in this respect.  If the pipeline was a problem, it would be so considered and I stated that I wanted to know whether this was the case.The independent body spent its time listening to the people.  As proof, a number of people raised the issue of the type of soil through which the pipeline would go.  The independent group informed me that this issue should be considered and offered to so do, although it was not included in its terms of reference.  I agreed and told it to go ahead.  As a result, recommendations were made in this regard.  However, I stand accused of not listening.Hence, concerns existed and were expressed.  I am uncertain whether Deputy Cowley lives in a different world.  When the National Oil Reserves Agency Bill 2006 was debated in this House last week, a colleague told me he overheard a conversation involving a man on a mobile phone on Grafton Street last Tuesday or Wednesday.  My colleague heard mention of the word Rossport and listened to the rest of the conversation, which basically involved the man telling the other person to be ready to go down on Friday because a riot would take place.  I have no reason to doubt the honesty of the Deputy who told me this story.

He told me about this conversation last Wednesday evening in the House.  The local people protesting on what I would call the "non-media" days have, by and large, engaged in peaceful protest.  They have had no problems with the gardaí on the days on which they have been protesting.  However, one can see calls for days of action every day on such websites as Indymedia and the website belonging to the Shell to Sea campaign.  On such days, people from outside the area come in and cause problems with the gardaí and local people.  Both Deputies Ferris and Cowley know this is true and I hope they will not state that nobody outside of this area was involved in the events which took place last Friday because it is not true.It is correct to say that the issue of the terminal, which is slightly related to the amendments before us, was not addressed by Peter Cassells and Advantica because the issue was dealt with by An Bord Pleanála and the planning authorities.  Environmental issues like cold venting will be dealt with by the Environmental Protection Agency.We have reached a stage where people who accuse everybody else of not being prepared to listen are themselves not prepared to accept what people are saying.  When one brings in outside people who are independent of all sides and produce reports, there must be an end to the matter at some point.  As Deputy Durkan pointed out, this matter cannot run on and on.

It is not helpful for him to engage in such activities.  There is independent verification of the safety of this project and this is as far as we can go.  It is not a case of us not listening, but of us having exhausted every single avenue that we could to try to address people's concerns and convince them that they were unfounded.  If people do not want to accept this, they do not want to accept it and there is nothing I can do to change their minds.I have a particular role to play in respect of matters like consents and permissions.  It is not my role to mediate between Shell and the local community or anybody else.  If Shell was to decide, as it has indicated, that it will change the route of the pipeline or do something else, I would have a quasi-judicial role in deciding whether that route was acceptable and safe.  I would prejudice that particular role if I was involved in negotiations or talks between Shell and the local community.  Legally, I cannot do so and I do not plan to do so.

He made allegations about some of the activities in which I am involved.  These activities involve me standing up for my constituents who elected me.  Both before and after I entered the Dáil, I spoke about the difficulties I have with the total giveaway of our natural resources and the need for the terms to renegotiated.  In fairness to the Minister, he said he would look at this, in response to our Private Members' motion, and he has assigned a group to do so.  As I understand it, he said this would take place before the end of the year.  I greatly welcome this announcement.Everything I have since done has involved standing by people who have genuine concerns.  I acknowledge that the Minister set up the Advantica review and assigned Peter Cassells as an independent monitor.  However, the difficulty lies in the fact that the pipeline's location is dictated by the location of the refinery.  There is a major problem with this and certain issues were not addressed by the planning process.  There was no code of practice in respect of the pipeline, which is required under EU law.  The issue of coal venting was not examined by the planning process.  These are very important matters which people find very upsetting.I walk with the people in peaceful protest and do not condone anything other than peaceful protest.  My views on this matter are well recognised.  The Minister has made allegations about some of the activities in which I am involved but I am merely standing with the people and if this is wrong, I do not know what to think.  This protest will continue.  This is not a threat; it is a reality.People come from outside the area to support the campaign but the people involved in protests, including the one that took place the last day, are invariably local people.  Many local people who do not come every other day come to support the protesters on open days.  Problems and conflict occur every day, which is very unfortunate, and the sooner it is ended, the better.  The solution lies with the Minister.  An independent commission is one way forward and I urge the Minister to take this option.

#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	519	If amendment No. 78 had been part of this Bill and CER had been given this safety role, it is possible that all of the sad events of the past six years would not have happened.  People have grave concerns.  Someone made a fair point to me last Monday and others from Erris and north Mayo have also made certain points to me about the entire history of this matter when they have visited this city, including the original consensus in the run up to the 2002 general elections and the change of mind by An Bord Pleanála.  I have never before come across such an occurrence.Deputy Durkan's point about what usually happens when Bord Pleanála makes a decision is correct.  For example, a new city is being built in my constituency.  My colleagues in the Labour Party and I have fought the high-density nature and height of the development, which involves the ubiquitous tiny apartment-like structures, all along the line in the planning process.  An Bord Pleanála then made a decision.  One does not suddenly come along and get another decision.  The developers have lost a number of battles along the way because of the way in which we pursued them to get the best possible environment for our constituency.Deputy Cowley made a very useful point about the wonderful, pristine nature of north-west Mayo.  It compares to possibly four or five other areas.  I often think of the Beara peninsula, with which I am very familiar, and possibly parts of west Clare, Connemara and parts of Donegal.  These are among the most pristine and unspoiled environments on the island of Ireland.  It is striking that this enormous industrial project is taking place in the heart of this community and the province of Connacht which has never had gas.  There is a long history of gas being produced and brought into Dublin.  We know how dangerous gas is and this is the fundamental reason for the Bill.  We know of people who almost died from gas leaks and these fears are understandable.Reference was made to the refinery.  I commend my colleague, Mr. Peter Cassells, on his work in this respect.  However, the refinery was not examined.  The Deputy representing Mayo made the point well that given the consents, concerns and so on, the authorities did not zero in on the refinery.We spoke about power generation earlier.  There are a number of power stations, generators and other forms of industrial production in Dublin Bay.  The people of Dublin balked at the location of a refinery in Dublin in the past.  A man from my region was a Member of this House for a brief period.  I refer to Deputy Seán Dublin Bay Loftus who represented Dublin North-East.  He became a representative because he and his community in Clontarf objected to the siting of a petrochemical refinery across the road from where they lived.  The Minister will recall they won the debate.  However, concern about such developments is an ongoing issue.The safety issue is paramount.  The Government should play a role in that regard.  It would be beneficial if the Minister could bring CER and Bord Gáis Éireann into the heart of this debate to try to get a resolution and so that we will not have to rely on foreign companies and multinationals which will benefit primarily.On the point raised by Deputy Cowley, we both had a debate on this issue last Thursday following which I was of the view that the commission of inquiry proposal could be used as a reasonable basis for serious final discussions on this matter to resolve it.  I am happy to meet the chief executive of Shell, as I will this Friday, to put that point to him face to face.  He, his team and associated companies should meet the people of Erris, Deputy Cowley and Shell to Sea and its representatives face to face with no preconditions to try to resolve this matter.  That is what everyone wants.  We do not want any more scenes such as those of last Thursday.  Muintir na háite were far and away the preponderant people participating in the protest on that day and they were the people who walked beside me.  It was interesting to meet people whom I only had made contact with by e-mail and telephone, such as Ms Imelda Moran, who has powerfully raised the cold venting issue.

In page 25, between lines 45 and 46, to insert the following:"A9F.—It shall be a function of the Commission to establish standards of training of heating and plumbing contractors in relation to the safety of home heating and plumbing installations.".".This amendment concerns the introduction of safety standards for all home heating installations.  The Minister said on Committee Stage that he would re-examine this matter.  In tabling the amendment, however, I did not have sight of the Bill as amended and recommitted to the House.  Therefore, I had to table something in order to engage with the particular section.The mechanical element of the installation of central heating systems — whether they are based on oil, gas, electricity or solid fuel — all have a safety requirement.  There have been a number of explosions in houses in which people have been injured.  More seriously, emissions of noxious gas have caused death.  One such incident occurred in Greece in recent weeks, which was caused by a gas burner.  The same safety principles apply to solid fuel central heating systems, particularly for private homes.  I have had discussions with a number of installers who say that standards need to be put in place governing home heating installations.  These standards include principles dealing with the health and safety aspects involved as well as the efficiency element of such heating systems.There are three elements to this matter.  The first is efficiency and the need to deliver in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol and EU directives.  The second is the safety element, which is what the Bill is about in many respects.  The third is a regulatory or supervisory element, which involves having a particular standard as well as the need to apply it to the installation of all home heating systems, regardless of whether they are run on gas or electricity.We must ensure that the Kyoto aspirations, health and safety standards and efficiency guidelines are met.  There is a world of difference in terms of delivering efficiency in heating systems arising from the way in which they are installed.  One can do it in a number of ways.  There is a theory that any fool can do the job, but that is not so.  Only those who have acquired a particular standard are capable of delivering the kind of efficiencies and safety requirements to which I have referred.  It would be good for the industry and the country at large if the Minister were to accept the amendment.  The Minister may wish to modify it as the case may be but I would be interested to hear what he has to say about it.  I am sure he has received representations from the industry, as other Members of the House have, which indicate a necessity to introduce this kind of standard.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	527	I support the Fine Gael amendment moved by Deputy Durkan.  The key point of his addition to this part of the 1999 Act is to require the commission itself to establish standards for heating and plumbing contractors, particularly as regards the safety of home heating and plumbing installations.  As Deputy Durkan said, there is also a concern that heating should be as efficient as possible and meet the highest installation standards, thus preventing heat loss.There are references in the Bill to combined heat and power factors.  The amendment refers in particular to installers and the important new role CER will have in this regard.  In the earlier stages of the Bill, most of the Deputies on the select committee met organisations such as RECI and others representing professionals in the electrical trade.  We discussed designated works and other types of work, as well as the requirements that will apply to the safety of electrical and gas heating installations.In the past we did not have apprenticeship-type recognition codified sufficiently in the national training and education system.  We now have the Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, a system which provides training benchmarks across the economy.  Deputy Durkan has tried to copperfasten this so that the Commission for Energy Regulation would have a specific role in training standards.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	528	The National Standards Authority of Ireland, through its gas technical standards committee, establishes the Irish technical standards and codes of practice for the safe transmission, distribution and utilisation of natural gas.  These standards are based on international best practice in the sector and underpin the content for the training syllabi of gas installers.  In addition, Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, has programmes promoting the improved training of central heating installers with particular emphasis on energy efficient technologies.  The scope of the amendments proposed by the Deputy is far too narrow.The proposed additional functions of the commission regarding downstream natural gas safety, including the regulation and certification of installers and the proposed regulatory framework, are set out in section 12.  The Bill meets all the Deputy's concerns in this regard.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	529	Notwithstanding the Minister's comments, I believe there is a necessity to introduce a standard in this area that is not provided for in the rest of the Bill.  All sides of this House support the production of alternative fuels and some of these will not involve gas, oil or electricity.  If we are to achieve the targets set regarding the alternative fuels industry, it follows that we can support a series of alternative fuels, including biofuels and the burning of wood pellets.  Standards should be introduced that relate only to the alternative fuels sector.The Minister correctly refers to the gas industry and I wish to raise a different kind of gas that can emanate from incorrect installations.  I know SEI has set out advanced standards, but the representations I received are from well-established installers in the industry who believe it is time to set out standards for the installation of home heating facilities.  There is a variety of facilities now available that are more sophisticated than those previously available.  We are now achieving a higher level of insulation in our homes, which causes a greater safety threat if carbon gases leak.We are achieving higher standards of insulation and aspire to higher standards still in the future.  We should copperfasten our position on alternative energy in this Bill by accepting this amendment or one like it.  The Minister said previously that he would consider it but he is not well disposed towards doing so at present.  Perhaps his disposition will change as the day, or night, goes on.  If an amendment of this nature is not incorporated into the legislation, we may find ourselves back here asking ourselves why it was not accepted in the first place.

In page 34, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:"(6)(a) Notwithstanding anything specified in regulations made under subsection (2), nothing in this section shall be construed as placing an onus of responsibility on a gas installer to ensure that a natural gas fitting which he or she has correctly installed in a dwelling, place of business or any common area is safely maintained after the point of delivery of natural gas, unless a contractual obligation exists obliging the installer concerned to do so.(b) Unless specified in any other enactment, the person responsible for ensuring that a natural gas fitting is safely maintained after the point of delivery of natural gas shall be—(i) in the case of a dwelling:(I) where that dwelling is the subject of a tenancy, but is not the subject of a lease between a landlord and tenant, the person entitled to receive the rent;(II) where that dwelling is the subject of a lease between a landlord and tenant, the landlord (subject to the responsibilities of landlords and tenants as set out in sections 12 and 16 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004); or(III) where that dwelling is not the subject of a lease or tenancy between a landlord and tenant, the person who would be entitled to receive the rent if the dwelling were the subject of a tenancy or lease,(ii) in the case of a premises used as a place of business:(I) where that premises is the subject of a lease between a landlord and tenant, and a covenant (whether express or implied and whether general or specific) exists that the tenant, as lessee, shall keep the premises in repair, the tenant in occupation; or(II) where that premises is not a premises to which clause (I) applies, such person as the Commission may specify from time to time in the framework published under section 9(1F), following consultation with the Minister, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and such other Minister of the Government (if any) as, in the opinion of the Minister, appears appropriate, and(iii) in the case of a common area of land which includes any dwellings the subject of subparagraph (i), or any places of business the subject of subparagraph (ii), or both, and which area is being managed by a management company, that management company.(c) For the purposes of this subsection—(i) the term ‘business' is to be interpreted in accordance with the meaning given it by section 3 of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act 1980,(ii) the term ‘dwelling' is to be interpreted in accordance with the meaning given it by section 4 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004,(iii) the terms ‘lease', ‘landlord', ‘tenant', and ‘tenancy' as they are used in paragraph (b)(i), are to be interpreted in accordance with the meaning given to them by section 5 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, and(iv) the terms ‘lease', ‘lessee', ‘landlord' and ‘tenant' as they are used in paragraph (b)(ii) are to be interpreted in accordance with the meaning given to them by section 3 of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act 1980.”.This arose from a discussion on Committee Stage.  There was general agreement that we needed to clarify this provision.  The purpose of the amendment is twofold: to ensure that a natural gas installer who correctly installs a natural gas fitting is not responsible for ensuring it is kept in good repair or replaced and to specify the persons responsible for ensuring such a fitting is repaired or replaced and for contracting the services of a gas installer to carry out this work.Members agreed following discussion of a number of amendments on Committee Stage that clarification was necessary and this amendment attempts to achieve that aim.

This work is not carried out by Bord Gáis Éireann staff and the Minister says the onus is on the installer where it has been correctly installed.  I presume it is up to CER to determine but the upgrade has caused problems in my areas where BGE contractors do not want to take responsibility where fittings were safe before they went in but when they left the premises gas was escaping.

If the question on amendment No. 103 is agreed to, amendment No. 104 cannot be moved.  These amendments overlap, are addressed to the same part of the Bill and must be discussed together, although they are not related.  Otherwise, amendment No. 104 would fall with the decision on amendment No. 103 and there would be no opportunity to debate it.Amendments Nos. 103 and 104 are technical amendments to the same part of the Bill.

In page 45, lines 19 and 20, to delete all words from and including "with-" in line 19 down to and including "Finance" in line 20.This relates to the 2001 Act and the amounts of capital stock, as well as the exercise of the powers of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in that regard.  I originally tabled that amendment to ensure the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources would have the key powers in this regard.  I am simply seeking, in that particular subsection, to withdraw a reference to the Department of Finance.I know it is the usual modus operandi in State agencies that the Minister for Finance is given the key role in this regard.  I was thinking in particular of the experience of the ESB some years ago when one of the Minister’s predecessors, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, was in office.  In order to fund the renovation of the transmission and distribution networks, the ESB raised its own finance.  The reaction of the Minister at that time, as well as the Minister for Finance, was restrictive of the operation of the company.  That  was my primary impetus to seek to amend subsection (3).

It is fairly standard across all the legislation.  The proposal to remove the requirement for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to consult with the Minister for Finance would not be acceptable to the Department of Finance, and it certainly would not be acceptable to me.

Ministers can act to sell shares in a State body as long as they have the permission of the Minister for Finance.My original thought was if we left out the reference to the Minister for Finance, I believed that if the matter was not referred to the Minister for Finance, the matter would have to be returned to the House for further legislation.  I am just looking at a note I made in submitting the amendment.  That would mean this House would have to be involved.  That was what I was trying to achieve.  I was hoping the Minister would have to come back one more time with it, rather than the Minister making the decision about the sale of a semi-State body, for example, without our permission.  That is the background, and it is a significant amendment.

I thank all those who contributed in one way or another on both sides of the House to this important and topical legislation.  It was unfortunate the Bill had to come into the House in a truncated version because events were unfolding.  It would be better practice in future to anticipate the full scope intended in this legislation.  It would be far better from the Minister's point of view and from the point of view of those discussing the Bill to bring it into the House in that fashion.  It is very difficult to discuss a Bill when one has not seen the full version of it and one must table amendments to something that one has not seen.  It is like boxing in the dark, which is a very difficult process and a very dangerous practice.  Notwithstanding the fact that he did not, in a wave of collegiality at the end, embrace our amendments in a welter of enthusiasm, we will forgive the Minister.  We hope the Bill will do the job it was intended to do and I thank the Minister.

I thank the Ceann Comhairle, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Acting Chairman for assisting the passage of the Bill through the House.  I acknowledge the help and assistance I have received from Deputies opposite.  We have had robust debate on a number of occasions as the Bill passed through the House.  It has undergone a number of significant and important changes as a result of this consideration, which is how it should be.The Bill started out as a regulatory Bill.  Deputy Durkan is correct that it is better if we could anticipate things as they unfold.  It is a better practice that the completed Bill is before the House from the outset.  It now touches on a number of other key areas, including gas safety, mine site rehabilitation and strategic infrastructure.  Despite the fact that I did not accommodate all Deputy Durkan's amendments, the Bill gives a key role to Members of the Oireachtas in the development of policy in the future.I refer to the public safety issue which was raised by Deputy Broughan.  I reiterate my response to him that it will be dealt with either in the Seanad or in separate legislation in the coming year.I thank my officials and the staff of the House for all the assistance and co-operation received in the passage of the Bill through the House.
#JimmyDevinsFF	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-party	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-dob	unknown-#JimmyDevinsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	578	I wish to share time with Deputies Fiona O'Malley, Cooper-Flynn, Callanan, Fleming and Moloney.I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Private Members' motion on patient safety.  Anyone who has involvement in the provision of health care, be it in the front line or through a family member or friend recovering and receiving care, or even at the political level, will want the highest level of patient safety.  We also want the quality of the health care to be of the highest level.  There is no doubt that a significant minority of patients can be harmed because of their involvement with the health services.  While this potential has always existed, and unfortunately will always exist, it would be foolhardy in the extreme to ignore it.We must seek to keep adverse effects to a minimum.  Where they do occur, there must be an open and transparent system of reporting, investigating and hopefully preventing a recurrence in the future.  For this to happen, it is essential that a mind change occur within those who work in the health care system.  For far too long, defensiveness has been the over-riding response to adverse effects and costly and long drawn-out litigation has been the ultimate result.  I warmly welcome the adverse event reporting system established under the clinical indemnities scheme.  This will allow all those working in the health care system to identify, examine and learn from mistakes made.  The advantage at local level is that such an adverse effect will lead to a rapid local analysis and response which should result in the issue being resolved quickly.  Another advantage is that any such issue will be reported nationally.  This can provide information to the HSE so mistakes made in one of the old health board areas can be avoided elsewhere.  This is one of the great advantages of the national remit of the HSE.I note the Minister welcomed the Leas Cross nursing home report in the House last night and that the HSE will work to implement its recommendations as quickly as possible.  It is vitally important the team of nursing home inspectors be trained and put in place as soon as possible.  There are many excellent private and public nursing homes dotted all over the country.  Sligo has St. John's Hospital and Nazareth House as public facilities and Summerville and Mowlam as private ones.  I know from my experience of dealing with them they all operate to the highest standards.There is nothing to fear from having a stringent inspection process.  Patients and their families will be reassured by the fact that regular and unannounced inspections will be carried out.  The secret to inspections is to make them unannounced.  In that way, no one can accuse the institution of being forewarned.What happened in Leas Cross was totally unacceptable and must not be allowed to occur again.  I commend the Minister's actions in this regard and I support the Government amendment to the motion.

The last time I spoke on this issue was just after the "Prime Time" report.  I echoed the sentiments expressed at that time by many Deputies that "Prime Time" had performed a great public service by highlighting the patient safety issue.  It rightly focused us, for a change, on the treatment that elderly people within our society are receiving.  I joined colleagues at that time in looking for legislation to be enacted to deal with the issues raised.In that regard members of the Government have faced a "damned if we do, damned if we do not" scenario; we are criticised when legislation is introduced too slowly or too quickly.  The Minister has simultaneously been accused of acting too quickly in terms of reform, and for acting too slowly on the relevant legislation.  It seems she can never get it right.  Some of the contributions so far would lead one to believe no action on the necessary legislation has taken place.  The heads of the Bill were published by the Minister, Deputy Harney, in March this year.  It is extraordinary, bordering on the hypocritical, for some in the Opposition to cry foul at this point, given that of the approximately 70 submissions received in the three-month consultation period on the Bill, not one was received from Opposition parties.

This is strange given the Health Information and Quality Authority is already in place, albeit on an interim basis.The call for a patient safety authority seems quite restrictive, timid and unambitious given that the Minister's Bill provides for inspection of all nursing homes, both public and private, as well as residential centres for children and people with disabilities.  The Opposition has sets its sights quite low, and the Government is correct to provide for a wider remit.  All of these residential locations must be subject to rigorous and effective inspection.  The Government's Bill is much more ambitious than anything Fine Gael has proposed in this motion.It is reminiscent of Fine Gael's unambitious commitment to delivering 600 new step-down beds when the Minister has already explicitly said the HSE is to use as many public and private nursing home beds as required to free up beds for patients awaiting admission.  Acute beds that become available as a result will be ring-fenced for those patients awaiting admission in accident and emergency departments.  It is as many as is required and not just 600.The Minister for Health and Children's Bill is evidence of the Government's determination to make patient safety the driver of major reform throughout the health system.  It sets new standards, will strengthen the inspection regime, and ensure the gathering and publication of new information on services.  This approach has delivered progress on hospital hygiene and must work within this sector.  I welcome all positive and realistic contributions from all sides of the House.  Much is being done, and this is needed because there is no doubt that problems persist.  This acknowledges the persistence of these problems.The Government is working to make patients' voices increasingly heard.  Only then will the correct decisions and actions be taken.  The Government has made it clear that as many services as possible will be made available as locally and as safely as possible.  We must recognise the problems, the action needed and the action already under way.  To do otherwise serves nobody, least of all the patient.  While raising this issue is commendable, it would be more commendable if it were done in the context of an engagement which was positive and ambitious and which recognised the work already achieved.
#BeverleyCooperFlynn	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-party	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-dob	unknown-#BeverleyCooperFlynn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	589	I also welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.  Everybody in the House recognises that patient safety and care should be at the centre of our health policy.  Like other Members present, I welcome the publication of the Leas Cross report.  We were all shocked when this matter came into the public domain last year.  It caused much concern not just for the patients of Leas Cross but for patients of nursing homes across the country because of a lack of confidence in the nursing home inspectorate system.  While I welcome a number of changes that have occurred over the past year, as we all know there has been considerable media comment that despite the improvements in the inspection system it is still not all it should be.  I welcome the introduction of a new national training programme for inspection team members and the hiring of 32 elder abuse officers.  I also welcome the fact that under the new Health Bill 2006 the social service inspectorate will be put on a statutory basis.  That is critical.In my limited time I will deal with some specific issues.  As we discuss patient safety and care the inequality of the subvention rate across the country amazes me.  I have mentioned this time and again in this House and at the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  I mention it because it has a critical part to play in patient safety and care.  Many patients, particularly in the west, are not receiving the standard of care they should because of the inequality in the subvention system.  In the past I have mentioned that in my county one cannot get enhanced subvention.  It has been discontinued for new applicants since the spring.  The maximum subvention one can get in County Mayo is €190.50 per week, compared to €850 which patients in the east can get.  That is a scandalous gap of almost €700.  Are we saying older people in the west are not entitled to the same standard of care as those in the east?  The Minister for Health and Children has acknowledged, at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, that it is inequitable and discriminatory, and she has said she intends to do something about it, as has Professor Brendan Drumm.If a person is unable to get a bed in a public facility and qualifies for the maximum subvention but cannot afford to pay the balance between the subvention, combined with his or her pension, and the cost of a private nursing home, what is he or she to do?  We have acknowledged that the person is entitled to the maximum amount of subvention and care available, but he or she cannot afford to pay.  This scandal has gone on for too long and must be rectified as a matter of urgency.  Enhanced subvention could be reintroduced immediately.  Although the Minister allocated an extra €20 million in last year's budget to deal with this issue, that money had been spent before it was announced and it made no difference in subvention rates.  I welcome the commitment given by the Government in the social partnership agreement Towards 2016 and I have spoken to the Minister for Health and Children about this.  The commitment will be that the level of State support for residential care should be indifferent to whether a person is in a public or private facility.  I agree fully with that, but we are a long way from it.  Although it will cost a large amount of money to implement it, if we are serious about patient care and safety it must be done as a priority.  I have already mentioned that the €20 million from last year was inadequate and I ask that enhanced subvention be restored as an interim measure.I have a number of other important policy points dealing with patient safety and they were part of the ten-point plan to deal with the accident and emergency crisis.  People have referred to contract beds.  There is not one contract bed in County Mayo.  When I last raised this at the Joint Committee on Health and Children I was told that negotiations were ongoing, however nobody could tell me how many contract beds would be allocated to the county or what stage negotiations had reached.  I was told they were due to end shortly, but we are still waiting.  The home care package initiative is fantastic and I welcomed it wholeheartedly when it was introduced.  However, while 500 home care packages were announced nationwide last year, only five of those were available in County Mayo.  How can that be a real option for an elderly person?  How can we be serious about caring for people in our community and providing adequate patient care if only five are available in a county of 110,000 people where we have already acknowledged that approximately 16% of the people are over the age of 65?  I am glad to say that has improved.As a result of my bringing the matter before the Joint Committee on Health and Children approximately 60 home care packages are available for 2006, but that is still inadequate.  The majority of people in my county receive a maximum of approximately five hours of home help per week.  If we are serious about a policy of patient care and safety we must ask ourselves, despite the extensive resources being spent on health, whether that is adequate.I was going to mention a sad case in an acute hospital I dealt with recently, but I do not have time.  If even some of those issues, particularly on looking after the elderly in their own homes, the home care packages and the contract beds, or only equalisation of subvention rates, could be resolved it would be a major step forward.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	590	I also welcome these few minutes to speak in this debate and to support the Government amendment.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has made it clear that this is about patient safety, not just about hospital buildings and where hospitals should be located.  I welcome the fact, particularly arising from the Leas Cross report, that we will at last have statutory inspections and not pre-planned visits.  As a member of a former heath board, I often witnessed the nonsense of notifying the local hospital or nursing home of the possibility of a visit.  At last we have seen a robust attack on the service area to ensure that the Minister's commitment will be honoured and I welcome that.  It is important that the legislation coming before the House will strengthen regulation and inspections and this will go a long way to assuring the public about quality and safety.  People are concerned at the lack of accountability.  They hear of incidents occurring in nursing homes and it causes great alarm.It is important to reflect on what the Minister has said about the numbers of patients presenting for surgical procedures in some hospitals.  It is important that we realise it is not just about flying the county hospital flag.  It is important that patient safety is taken into account by way of the levels of procedures provided in some institutions.  Recent figures indicate the proportion of patients treated by consultants doing more than 50 procedures per year has increased from 23% in 1997 to 58% in 2003.  We must welcome this.  Figures recently released indicate that 308 of 1,800 patients have had their surgery performed by consultants doing fewer than 30 procedures per year.We must take patient safety into account.  Arguing a case purely to keep a local hospital open but abandoning the possibility of ensuring patient care is something all public representatives must consider.  A further figure was of the 76 consultants who carried out breast cancer surgery in 2003.  Some 45 had carried out fewer than ten procedures a year and 37 had performed five or less.  When debating the need for specialised care and supervision, it is incumbent on the Government to ensure that if we are citing local hospitals that need to retain their services we take into account that it is vital for patient safety that the surgeons involved are up-skilled and at their best, and they will achieve this only by the level of treatment they carry out.Groups coming before the Joint Committee on Health and Children have made me aware of MRSA and patient safety.  The committee has discussed this regularly with the HSE and the families of those who have unfortunately been affected.  The point has been made that we need a regulator or somebody in control, to whom reports are made, to ensure that the maximum safety measures and procedures are in place.  It has also been said that the time has come for someone at local level to be responsible for enacting policies that ensure the MRSA bug can be eliminated.  I support the amendment and what the Minister is trying to do.  It is very important that she has made the point that it is not just her job to ensure we have the best standards by way of hospital construction and services; it is more important to ensure that staff providing those services are trained to the highest professional standards and can ensure the delivery of excellent services.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	591	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Again, the whole emphasis is on the patient and that is as it should be.  Thankfully, we have come a long way from the situation where a hospital administrator would claim the hospital would work perfectly were it not for the patients.  That attitude needed to be rooted out of the system and hopefully it is now long gone.I particularly like the commitment in the amendment to a new social services inspectorate, to be run on a statutory basis, and that will be brought forward shortly in the new legislation.  That is essential and I hope it will be an inspectorate with teeth and power.  It is important that it be given graduated powers and sanctions.  If there are minor problems sanctions may be taken against the nursing home in question while more serious offences will justify graver penalties.  Ultimately, if a situation is unacceptable, the inspectorate will have the power to close a particular establishment on a temporary or full-time basis, depending on the circumstances.  However, the idea of a sole option available to an inspectorate as the draconian all or nothing — to close an establishment completely or take no further action — has often led to mistakes being made in the past and I hope the legislation will take this into account.It is important that the new inspectorate deal with public and private nursing homes and facilities.  The view at present is that it is the private sector establishments that need inspections.  It is good for staff and those who run the public sector facilities as well to know that they are subject to independent inspection and it is good for morale to be given a nice clean comprehensive report.  It is also to be welcomed that inspection reports for nursing homes are on the Internet.  That is a major step forward, one that everyone will agree is a welcome and modern development.The legislation will provide that staff can make complaints without fear of retribution.  Although it is not being highlighted as a major achievement, that, in practice, could be the most important element of the legislation.  With more than 100,000 employees in the health service, there is a complete range of service providers in each section from medical care to  catering staff.  It is good, if people believe a patient is not being treated properly, that they can make a complaint without their careers being affected.  It  is important that this protection is in place.  It is welcome, too, that the statutory complaints process will be enshrined in the new legislation, so that people may make formal complaints.  An independent review mechanism and a proper system should be set up.Up to now the role of the Ombudsman has been an underused resource as regards the HSE.  From my experience as a public representative I have encountered some difficult cases in tragic situations, where the official shutters come down in the HSE, or in the health boards as they were.  Sometimes the Ombudsman can help to mediate successfully without matters having to reach the litigation stage.  The Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly, has the ability to go into the HSE and make recommendations for improvements.  I believe the HSE would welcome this and we should see greater use of the Ombudsman's office in HSE affairs in the years ahead for the betterment of the health service.
#JoeCallananFF	unknown-#JoeCallananFF-party	unknown-#JoeCallananFF-dob	unknown-#JoeCallananFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	592	What happened at Leas Cross was completely unacceptable.  Since the emergence of the issues raised by Leas Cross the HSE has made many improvements in its nursing home inspection process.  The working group on nursing home inspections and registrations produced a report in July this year which set out a consistent and robust template that now underpins the inspection process.  The HSE has embarked on a programme of standardising inspection reports across the country in accordance with current legislation.  As part of this process there is significant engagement with the private nursing home sector and the nursing home inspection teams.Most of the private nursing homes are providing very good care.  With more inspections being carried out without prior notice we can look forward to an excellent standard of care in our nursing homes.  It is very important that we continue to provide public geriatric beds and I welcome the decision to build a new unit at St. Brendan's hospital, Loughrea, where care of the elderly is of a high standard.  I compliment the nurses and everybody involved at that hospital.  I also welcome the proposal to build a new community nursing home in the grounds of St. Brigid's Hospital, Ballinasloe.I attended a meeting in Claregalway at the weekend concerning private nursing homes.  The sons and daughters and other relatives of elderly people in such institutions attended the meeting to discuss nursing home subventions.  Speaker after speaker said how difficult it was for them to keep their elderly in nursing homes due to the lack of proper subventions.  This is a topic I have spoken on before because the rate of payment in Galway is one third of what is being paid in the eastern part of the country.  I know the Minister is reviewing the situation with a view to creating a better and fairer scheme for the elderly in nursing homes, and I welcome this.  I also welcome the Minister's introduction of the home care packages.  I have long promoted the notion of home-based subvention, but I have always felt an old person should have the choice of being looked after in his or her own home for as long as possible.  This can now be done under the home care packages, but we must increase the budget for this service as there will be growing demand for it.Social services that provide day care and meals and wheels for older people do not get the recognition they deserve.  I am very familiar with Ballinasloe and Portumna social services, which provide excellent services and care for many elderly people, who mostly live alone, by providing them with hot meals and bussing them to day centres, two or three days a week.  There they meet their elderly friends and enjoy themselves, while being looked after by caring staff, most of whom are voluntary.  This type of service keeps hundreds of elderly people out of hospital and would cost the State millions.  I ask the Minister to provide greater funding for such  groups.I also welcome the increase in funding for home helps in 2006, bringing the budget for that area up to €30 million, which is providing more home help hours for those who need them.   It is the Government's policy to maintain older people in dignity and independence at home, in accordance with their wishes, while at the same time providing high quality residential care when they can no longer be maintained in this manner at home.  Forecasts suggest that by 2031 the percentage of the population aged over 65 will be between 18% and 21%.  The Government is committed to services for older people, both residential and community based, to meet the demands of a growing elderly population.  From 1997 to 2005, inclusive, additional spending on health services for older people was in excess of €302 million.  The total spend in 2006 will be €1.2 billion.  I compliment the Minister on her great  work on behalf of the elderly and I support the Government's amendment.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	593	I very much welcome and support the motion being put forward by Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  I listened to the contributions of previous contributors, Deputies Devins and Fiona O'Malley.  Deputy O'Malley said this was a Government which listened to patients.  Not only does it not listen to patients, it does not listen to their loved ones and it does not listen to Deputies.  The Government set up the HSE, which is a further layer of bureaucracy.  We find it very difficult to even get answers to parliamentary questions at this stage.One only has to look at the treatment of patients by this Government to see it does not seem to care.  I have dealt with a number of Ministers during the tenure of this Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government.  I tried to make representations to them on behalf of those who suffered symphysiotomy but I was stonewalled.  Let us consider the Dunne inquiry and whether the loved ones were heeded.  They have received no satisfaction, nor have the victims of the hepatitis C scandal.  It seems the routine is that the wall comes up every time.  This is regrettable.Deputy Devins referred to a procedure to examine adverse effects.  In the aftermath of a bad election, politicians hold a post-mortem and consider what went wrong.  There is no post-mortem examination in the case of clinical adverse effects.  This is also the case in Britain with the NHS.I urge the Minister of State to read an article in yesterday's The Independent.  A pilot, Mr. Martin Bromiley, gives an account of the routine operation carried out on his wife.  The operation went wrong and she died.  He examined safety procedures in the NHS and was shocked to find out that there was no training of doctors and nurses to deal with emergency situations.  The article states:The risk of dying on a scheduled aircraft flight today is one in 10 million.  By contrast, Bromiley now knows, the risk of dying in hospital as a result of medical error is one in 300.  That means hospital treatment is 33,000 times more dangerous than flying on a scheduled airline.Either one can be confident boarding an airplane or one should be very nervous going into hospital.A Fianna Fáil Member told me that one would be better off having an operation on the kitchen table, considering the high rates of MRSA in our hospitals.  Mr. Bromiley has been asked to speak at a number of conferences on the need for proper training for those in operating theatres and elsewhere in our hospitals.  During Mrs. Bromiley's operation, a simple tracheotomy was needed but none of the medical staff at the operating table could do it.  The article quotes Mr. Bernard Ribeiro of the Royal College of Surgeons: "Professional failures are more often due to behavioural difficulties, personal conflict, lack of insight, systems failure or defective infrastructure than technical failings or lack of knowledge."If we had protection of whistleblowers, we could make some progress.  A whistleblowers Bill was published but it became stuck on Committee Stage and has not been seen since.  There is fear of accountability and transparency.  If we had it, Leas Cross would not have happened, nor would the case of Dr. Neary at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  I support this proposal for legislation.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	594	Ar son Teachtaí Shinn Féin ba mhaith liom tacú leis an rún seo in ainmneacha na dTeachtaí Fhine Gael agus Lucht Oibre.  This is a timely motion in the wake of the report by Professor Des O'Neill on the scandalous neglect of vulnerable people in the Leas Cross nursing home.  The publication of the report is a further damning indictment of successive Governments and health board or HSE bureaucracies that presided over a system that allowed the old and the vulnerable to be treated disgracefully in nursing homes.  There is no doubt that inadequate staffing, inadequate care and, most seriously, inadequate vigilance by State authorities led to the deaths of patients in Leas Cross and in other nursing homes.The terms of reference given to the author of the report, Professor O'Neill, were flawed as they only provided for a documentary inquiry.  The relatives of the deceased were not given the opportunity to participate even though they have valuable evidence to give about the treatment of their loved ones.  Some of them have given moving and harrowing testimony in the media.  Others have stories to tell also and have a right to see them placed on the record and outside the glare of media if they so choose.  The Minister for Health and Children should provide a forum for the relatives to make this evidence available.In the wake of the initial exposé of the scandal of Leas Cross, both the Minister for Health and Children and the Taoiseach promised a nursing homes inspectorate.  This has not been delivered.  The Government also needs to implement the recommendations of the National Economic and Social Forum report on the care of older people.  It needs a clear strategy to end the over-reliance on private nursing homes for the care of older people and to ensure that all those who wish to be cared for in their own homes can be facilitated with the full support of all relevant State services.We have waited for years for the Health Bill to put the health information and quality authority and the social services inspectorate on a statutory footing.  When all those structures are in place, the Government must ensure their effectiveness.  Otherwise, we will simply be creating further layers of bureaucracy.  Whatever body has overall responsibility for patient safety must be independent and must cover all care settings.  The MRSA and Families group has highlighted the fact that different regimes for infection control and prevention operate in public hospitals, private nursing homes and other sites where residential care is delivered.  This must be addressed as a matter of urgency.  Consistency is needed across the board.A lack of accountability in sections of the medical profession and a lack of vigilance by the State authorities led to the ordeal endured by women in the Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda in the 1970s and 1980s.  The women affected are still seeking justice and the full truth.  The Leas Cross scandal occurred in the past decade.  While the further measures introduced in the wake of Leas Cross to address patient safety are welcome, the question must be asked how many other similar cases of neglect were going on throughout the county at the same time as Leas Cross.  How many deaths are attributable to such neglect?  We may never know.The motion mentions the case of the late Pat Joe Walsh who bled to death in Monaghan General Hospital because a diktat from on high decreed that a life-saving operation could not be performed on him in that hospital.  I extend continuing sympathy to his family, which is now contemplating legal action.  This is yet another family who feel driven to resort to the courts to get justice because of the treatment of a loved one within the health care system.  It is a disgrace that they should have to do so.What is the Government's response to the case of Pat Joe Walsh in its amendment to this motion?  It asks the Dáil to "recognise that high patient volumes are needed for specialist services to achieve the best clinical outcomes".  With all due respect, I do not have to be a Deputy for Cavan-Monaghan to identify that as a pathetic response.  The systematic cutting of services at Monaghan General Hospital has led to the deaths of patients, including that of Pat Joe Walsh.  The policy of over-centralisation of hospital services is based on a skewed interpretation of the training requirements of medical staff, the demands of insurers and the interests of medical professionals concentrated in the larger hospitals.  It is being driven by the Government and the HSE.In the north-east region we are promised a new super hospital sometime in the future.  In the meantime, local hospital services are being cut.  The Teamwork report is the same strategy of over-centralisation wrapped in a new package and it has been comprehensively rejected by those in my constituency.  I reject that report and restate Sinn Féin's demand, in common with campaigning communities, for our local hospitals to be given the rightful place in the health and safety of patients.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	595	Last Friday, I attended the opening of a nursing home in my constituency.  It is one of a number of new facilities that have been developed recently and more are planned.  This is evidence of the growing need to make provision for our elderly.  It is a major step for frail people or elderly couples to leave their homes, move away from the neighbourhoods with which they are familiar and move into nursing homes.  However, I fear many of them are moving into an environment that more closely resembles a hospital than a nursing or retirement home.  I have noticed a fundamental change in nursing homes due to the shortage of hospital beds.  The ratio of high dependency patients is growing continually.  I do not refer to people with conditions such as dementia, but to people who are attached to drips and who undergo ongoing acute treatment of the kind one would expect to see in a hospital.  Higher proportions of people with acute illnesses affect the social environment and create a higher risk of infection.Members must understand that terms such as step-down facilities also have consequences.  While medical consequences must be anticipated and responded to, social consequences are as important if elderly people are to enter retirement homes to live out their lives.  This implies good levels of activity and social interaction, which become difficult with disproportionate numbers of people who are very ill.I support the motion before the House, which seeks a patient safety authority.  I have heard words such as "robust" used in respect of the so-called new arrangements.  Unless new arrangements are backed by defined standards, the availability of adequate resources and accountability when failures occur, cases such as Leas Cross will continue to arise.  There must be a separate agency to police standards.
#JamesBreen	unknown-#JamesBreen-party	unknown-#JamesBreen-dob	unknown-#JamesBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	596	The establishment of a safety authority in both the United States and Britain has been welcomed by patients, their families, the health care providers and their insurers.  Such authorities operate in a manner similar to that used in aviation, whereby serious incidents and near misses are reported to a central authority, thus helping to identify early trends, epidemics and misdiagnoses throughout the health system.  This can reduce potential maltreatment and serious errors at a later stage.It is imperative that such a system respects the confidentiality and identity of staff, hospitals, health care centres and patients.  My constituency office receives large numbers of calls from people on a daily basis that highlight problems they have encountered in hospitals, nursing homes and the health service.  Such callers constitute a cross section of hospital patients, visitors and staff.  The establishment of such an authority would help to get rid of some of the problems raised.  They would be addressed more quickly if staff in particular could avail of a whistleblower facility.The British patient safety authority produces quarterly national reports that are available for public inspection.  Hospitals that report to the authority are named on the authority's website.  This increases public confidence in such hospitals.  The principle behind such an authority is to find out how problems occurred, rather than who was at fault.   In addition to improving patient care, such solution-based systems give rise to better risk management in the health service and consequently, to cheaper insurance premiums for health care providers.It is time for the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to come clean and publicly state what the future holds for our hospitals.  In County Clare, Government Members publicly praise the allocation of €25 million for the development of Ennis General Hospital and a new CAT scanner was recently announced for the hospital.  However, in a meeting last week with county councillors and Deputies from County Monaghan, the Minister stated that 26 hospitals nationwide would have their services downgraded next June, after which only one regional hospital in each area would retain full services.  Does that mean that Ennis General Hospital will lose its doctor-led accident and emergency service next June after the general election is out of the way?  It is time to put an end to the half truths and misleading statements emanating from the Minister, other Government party Members and the Health Service Executive and put patient welfare at the forefront of our national health care policy.

I will provide three examples.  First, older people in my county who only have their pensions cannot get transport for essential hospital appointments.  Second, half a dozen home care packages were announced last year.  Although this figure may rise to 50 this year, they have not progressed past January because the service is cash-strapped.  Third, I refer to the terrible scandal of people who have nothing and yet must try to find money to receive basic care and to stay in nursing homes.  This is a complete abdication by the State to the private sector and it is not working.A few days ago, Members saw how the HSE was obliged to stop sending people to certain private nursing homes.  This was due to understaffing because such nursing homes are profit-based.  The State should take over such care.  The State has a legal obligation to care for people with extremely high dependency across the board at its own expense.  This is how it should be and I call for its implementation.  Moreover, not-for-profit ventures are the way forward for high dependency individuals.  There has been complete neglect on the part of the Government.  The examples I have given make it clear that the way forward for those with high dependencies is for the State to take over their care.

The case of Mr. Pat Joe Walsh has been dealt with by my colleague, Deputy Ó Caoláin.  I want to know what is the Government's position in this regard?  The kind of step-down facility it hopes to provide in County Monaghan caused the death of Pat Joe Walsh.  I cannot accept that.As for the Teamwork report, many people believe it will not apply to them.  I remind them that initially, it will apply to four counties in the north east.  It is a pilot project and will eventually be rolled out nationally.  While it will not happen before the next general election, it will come to people's doors.Moreover, after the next general election, there will be further closures of accident and emergency departments nationwide.  People may take comfort from noting that money is being spent on their local hospitals and consequently may wonder how services could be terminated or reduced.  Monaghan General Hospital has never had so much money spent actively on it as at present.  A total of €4.5 million is being spent to refurbish two wards and Monaghan General Hospital has a state-of-the-art accident and emergency department.  At present, it has 24-hour accident and emergency services with medical cover seven days a week.  It is proposed to replace this with 12-hour nurse-led cover seven days a week.  Moreover, its X-ray department service, which operates on a 24-hour basis seven days a week will be replaced with a day service.  The high care unit will be moved, first, to Cavan and eventually to Drogheda and acute beds will be removed.The Health Service Executive states that the hospital will have a residential component.  This is new phraseology that means a step-down facility or, if one prefers, an upgraded nursing home.  This is what people claim to be a better and safer service, although no new service will be put in its place.  On any given day on which a trolley count is performed, counties Cavan and Monaghan will have more than 20% of the national trolley count.  The staff in both hospitals are worked into the ground and are absolutely demoralised.  Someone should re-examine what constitutes a better and safer service.  While I know that services must be upgraded, there is a role for smaller hospitals.  They should be allowed to play that role in the delivery of health care services.
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	599	I support the motion to put patient safety at the heart of the health services.  I want to use my time to draw attention to an issue of patient safety, albeit not in the context of a social care facility.Recently, one of my constituents began to lose the sight in her eyes.  Using her medical card, she attended her GP, who advised her to see a specialist as quickly as possible.  The GP wrote to the Mater hospital on her behalf and she then tried to make an appointment.  She was told there was a long waiting list and that she might not be reached until October 2007.This alarmed her greatly as her eyesight was deteriorating rapidly.  She contacted my office and I tried to assist her.  However, not even the National Treatment Purchase Fund could secure an appointment for her.  The reality was that as she was on a low income and had a medical card, she would be obliged to wait irrespective of the urgency of her condition.  This lady waited for a number of months to no avail.  She then arranged to borrow the necessary money, contacted the Mater Private Hospital and was then able to make an immediate appointment.  The consultant confirmed the seriousness of her condition and made arrangements for the necessary treatment with his team.  The moral of the story is that at present, if one is on low pay and has a medical card in Ireland, under the Government's two-tier health service one can go blind while waiting for treatment.  However, if one has the money, one can receive such treatment immediately.In a follow-up parliamentary question, I asked the Minister to arrange for the HSE to reimburse my constituent with the several hundred euro she had borrowed and that she was obliged to pay to secure the initial appointment.  This was bluntly refused by the Minister in her reply to the Dáil.  This constitutes inequality, Progressive Democrats-style, in this House and it can only be addressed by political change in this State.

I congratulate Professor O'Neill for producing an excellent report which makes very harrowing reading.  He has done a tremendous public service to the State, and in particular to elderly people.  His report is a damning indictment of the political and health systems, the HSE and the Department of Health and Children, which repeatedly failed to act despite knowing what was going on.I call on the Minister to launch an inquiry into Bedford House nursing home in Balbriggan.  Bedford House is similar to Leas Cross in that the HSE transferred patients from St. Ita's Psychiatric Hospital in Portrane to it at the same time that it transferred patients to their deaths in Leas Cross.  The decision by the HSE to transfer these patients to these two nursing homes is a very serious issue.  It is interesting that the HSE chose to transfer patients to a nursing home owned by a doctor, namely, Dr. Nasser.  The facts are that this nursing home, Bedford House, was in a most shameful and disgraceful condition while this process was ongoing.I will give the House some idea of what was taking place at Bedford House.  A routine inspection took place on 19 February 2004.  Regarding physical condition, the report concluded that the inside of the nursing home appeared very rundown.  It found that the window curtains in five of the bedrooms were falling off and could not be closed.  There was no screen between any of the patients in room 17, a four-bedded room upstairs.  The four men in this room used commodes for toileting.  The report found that in room 23, which was occupied by two patients, the curtain screen rail and curtain were on the floor and the patients' clothes were strewn over the curtain.  In addition, the curtain was off the window rail and the light over the bed was not working.  The report then went on to detail how emergency call bells were not working, how a bedside locker in one room was unsteady, how the door was falling off another and how the linoleum floor covering was replaced in two rooms upstairs but the old covering was left in a pile outside the front of the building.In respect of hygiene, the report found that patients were given a bath or shower once every ten days.  It found that in the sluice room downstairs, the toilet was used by patients but there was no wash hand basin and the sluice did not have a wide outlet.  There were two baths in the nursing home but the one upstairs was not used.  There were seven showers but only four were used and they had not been cleaned, while there were 12 toilets and one of these was being fixed.  The report found that in the bathroom between bedrooms 3 and 4, the floor was dirty and the commode pan was not emptied.  The floors were dirty in some of the other bathrooms and cleaning was in progress.  When seats were lifted on a number of commodes, they were found to be dirty.  Some beds were only half made as clean linen was unavailable and some of the vacant beds were not made up.I have a copy of a letter of complaint from a woman whose father was a private patient of Bedford House.  I will try not to identify the man in question by age.  The letter complained that he had to take four stairlifts to his bedroom which was situated at the top of the nursing home.  As a result, he could not go to bed when he wished and was obliged to wait for the night staff after 8 p.m.  The letter went on to state that:He shares a bedroom with another man, both of whom use commodes at night and the bedroom carpet is filthy.  I find now that the day room smells of urine, which is totally unacceptable as it is both unhygienic and unhealthy.  The chairs in this room are never cleaned.My father has been in this home since August 2003 and has had the best of treatment from the staff but lately the staff numbers have been cut to a minimum and the patients are being hurried and not enough time or attention paid to them.  For the past week to ten days the television is out of action — the patients have nothing else — and the answer is always the same that they are fixing it tomorrow.She then goes on to complain about the standard of food at the nursing home.  She concludes by stating that she is not sure of the solution to these problems as the bedroom is the only one available to her father due to the fact while he was in hospital for tests in October 2003, his room was given away as patients were being taken in from St. Ita's in Portrane.This is the type of nursing home to which the HSE delivered patients.  Shameful and disgraceful as Leas Cross was, this particular nursing home, to which patients from St. Ita's were transferred, is much worse.  I am calling for an investigation into all aspects of the management of this home.  It is interesting to note that the nurse in charge of this nursing home had an unusual duty.  She was running another nursing home at the same time, something that is forbidden by law, and appears to have done so for a period of up to nine months.  The health board knew about this because I am reading this from its reports.  Nothing has changed since the activities at Leas Cross and Bedford House were highlighted because the law has not changed and offers no protection to patients.I have a letter of complaint from another individual relating to the same nursing home.  It states the general cleanliness of the home was undesirable, the bathrooms were smelly, excrement was dug into the floors, residents were not showered or bathed, there was a lack of supervision and some residents were not dressed in the morning and hence left in their bed clothes all day.  The letter says glasses from which patients had to drink were unwashed and filthy, that they were left out of reach of patients and shared among patients and that patients did not know which drinks were their own and drank other patients' drinks.  The letter goes on and on.At the end of it all is one Government, one Minister and the HSE, which have completely avoided accountability in the Dáil.  I heard the Taoiseach speak about the matter yesterday and today in the Dáil.  He has some cheek to think he can get away with it.  He might get away with many things but he will not get away with this because the people will not allow it.  They expect better from the Minister, the Department, the HSE and the medical profession.  Imagine a doctor owning the nursing home in question.  I wonder what the Medical Council thinks of it.The strangest thing is that the inspectors who were responsible for the inspection of this nursing home also inspected Leas Cross and have now been employed by the HSE in a private capacity to provide consultation in respect of an inspection regime for private nursing homes.  The entire system is rotten from top to bottom.  This Government has failed disgracefully in vindicating the rights of patients but worse than this, it transferred the most vulnerable elderly patients from St. Ita's to Leas Cross and Bedford House where many of them died in disgraceful conditions.There is a difference here between public and private patients and between people who have a psychiatric illness and those who do not.  The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, read a report from the European Commission that inquired into the torture and mistreatment of patients in the EU.  These are people who are abused while they are in the hands of the State in an involuntary capacity.  The Minister of State will stand charged before the next visit of that committee to Ireland because he delivered these unfortunate people, many of whom have since died, into the hands of the same nursing home owners who treated them disgracefully.  The Minister of State knows this because he has read its last report and was a Minister of State when it was delivered.  The medical profession has stood by and participated in it, as has the nursing profession, the HSE and the HSE inspectors.  That is what we are living with and that is what this Government is providing to people.Other substandard nursing homes exist.  A list of 12 such homes produced in 2001 was given to me by the HSE.  An inquiry should be launched into each of these homes.  I will not discuss them tonight as I do not have sufficient time, but one of them was run by a Montessori teacher who had no medical training.  For many months, she was the manager of a nursing home, about which she knew nothing.  Strange as it may seem, although it may not seem strange at all, patient records from this nursing home were put into a skip and burned so that when inquests were held, no records could be found.I received a complaint last week from an undertaker who said he took possession of a body which was in an appalling condition from a nursing home.  He stated he had never seen anything like the condition of this body, which he said was covered in faeces, including the fingernails.  He could not believe it.  I also received a complaint last week concerning another nursing home from a person who said that when regular staff are off work at weekends, young people work in the home and leave the elderly patients in their own bodily fluids and faeces all night and that when the woman returns after the weekend, patients' bodies are literally caked in faeces.  That is true, and that is what is going on.  The Government cannot shy away from that.  The Minister has done nothing about it.  She stands charged before the court of public opinion.  The Government has failed in the most important respect, namely, to protect the most vulnerable people in our community, our elderly.I acknowledge the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is doing his best to provide for the needs of children, but at the other end of that scale are people who are closer to leaving this world.  It is sad to recall that in one home the prayers of the dying are not read as a resident dies.  I will be happy to give the Minister of State the name of that home following this debate.  Nothing has changed, which is the saddest aspect of all, and nothing will change until we come into Government when we will make sure that this changes.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	601	I am pleased to have this opportunity to make a contribution on the need to establish a patient safety authority and to put patient safety at the centre of our health service.  Unfortunately to date, this has not been the case.In recent times there has been a litany of shocking revelations about deficiencies in our health service to such an extent that public confidence in it has been undermined.  In the short time at my disposal I wish to address the litany of revelations in respect of Leas Cross.The Leas Cross report, which had to be dragged out of the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive, is one of the most damning reports in the history of this State.  The Government, the health boards and the medical profession must be condemned for the systematic failure that led to the mistreatment of elderly people in the Leas Cross nursing home.  The most startling aspect of this shameful episode is that the Government and authorities could and should have intervened earlier to have the Leas Cross nursing home investigated and closed.I will elaborate on why I say that.  In 1994, well before the "Prime Time Investigates" programme on Leas Cross, a range of problems were identified by the inadequate inspectorate system, which we now have in place, and brought to the attention of the Department of Health and Children and the health boards regarding the deficiencies in nursing care in nursing homes not only in Leas Cross but throughout the length and breadth of the country.  The range of problems identified at that time included staffing levels and nursing policy issues, maintenance and accommodation standards, hygiene problems, lack of incentives for residents, poor record keeping, insufficient or no active involvement from the local authorities on fire safety issues, lack of equipment and appropriate clinical practices, for example a lack of pressure mattresses, and discrepancy in the contract of care.  These issues were well known to the Minister and her junior Ministers with responsibilities in this area.I am aware of a submission to Professor O'Neill in respect of the death of a 91 year old relative of a constituent of mine, who first entered Leas Cross in December 2002 and who died in 2004.  Among the issues raised were: the patient was injured and knocked to the floor on numerous occasions; the 91 year old man lay in bed for three days with a broken hip before being seen by a doctor; when he was eventually brought to Beaumont Hospital the doctor who admitted him said this elderly man was suffering from malnutrition when he arrived in the hospital; and his death certificate was not registered as required.  All these issues were raised with the health board at the time.Over the years I have raised with the senior officials of the health boards the policy of transferring residents from the loving homely environment in St. Ita's to private nursing homes and I question the criteria, need and justification for this policy.  After reading Professor O'Neill's report, it is obvious the care of the residents of St. Ita's who were transferred was not the main priority.  There was another agenda — senior management had to be seen to implement a policy of moving patients from St. Ita's, irrespective of the consequences.People with intellectual disabilities have no one to speak for them and therefore it is important that I place on record some of the facts that were brought to the attention of the officials of the health board as far back as 2003.  If the officials of the health board knew about them, the officials of the Department of Health and Children also knew about them.  A consultant in old age psychiatry raised the need to follow up patients transferred from St. Ita's Hospital to Leas Cross.  A further letter, within two weeks, from two senior consultants also referred to a need for follow up services.  They particularly drew attention to the fact that three of the initial group of 14 patients discharged to Leas Cross had been referred fairly quickly to Beaumont Hospital as being seriously ill.  Nursing care appeared to have been the issue in all these cases.  The last two patients had arrived with bronchial pneumonia and one was suffering from dehydration.  These concerns were brought to the attention of the director of the nursing home inspectorate team on 9 January 2004.  These consultants also pointed out that seven deaths had occurred since the transfer of the patients on 3 September, and three of them occurred over the Christmas period.  This damning letter was circulated to everyone within the system and we are told that nobody knew anything about it and nobody was responsible.Professor O'Neill's report states that a memo exists of issues discussed with the director of nursing of Leas Cross following a visit to Leas Cross nursing home in July 2004.  The consultant highlighted the main concern was lack of qualified staff, auxiliary staff and basic nursing care to meet patients' needs.  She also noted a lack of stimulation, occupational therapy and supervision.  Four of the former St. Ita's patients — many of whom I knew to see because I live in Portrane and I used to visit patients there who were cared for in a loving, caring environment — were sitting in wheelchairs and others in old Buxton chairs.  Generally, personal hygiene was poor.  That was never the case in St. Ita's where these patients were looked after and minded for years.  Clothes were grubby in appearance and a few patients had a strong odour of incontinence.  Staffing appeared inadequate with only one qualified staff nurse and nine care staff caring for 65 residents in one area and one qualified staff nurse and four attendants for approximately 40 residents in another area.  These concerns were also expressed to many of the senior people in the Department and the health boards.A further matter of concern raised by the consultant psychiatrist was that the group with dementia as a primary diagnosis had a high mortality rate in Leas Cross.  The admissions that were transferred to hospitals were characterised as suffering from dehydration, pneumonia and skin care problems raising concerns over adequacy of care.  I could go on and list further concerns.This is the reality of lack of care and attention given to some of the most vulnerable people in our society.  We are charged with looking out for those people and Ministers and officials in the health boards have responsibility for the care of people with intellectual disability.  What were they doing in arranging for these patients to be taken out of hospital and put into a nursing home, knowing what was going on?  Did they do anything about it?  No, they kept their heads down.What are we told about this report?  Nobody is responsible and nobody is prepared to put up their hands and say there was a mistake, there was an error.It is painfully obvious that the Minister, the Department and the health boards simply turned a blind eye to these problems and as a result elderly people and people with intellectual disabilities, who are among the most vulnerable in our society, suffered appalling conditions and treatment in Leas Cross.  This is an indictment of the failure of the Government's policy in this area over the years.  We do not have a clear and transparent set of rights and entitlements for older people and their families.  We do not have a system which ensures quality care is delivered.  We do not have a fair and equitable system for financing care.  With all the money available to it, this Government failed in its commitment to provide 800 public nursing home beds for the most vulnerable in our society.  In my area of north Dublin people in need of public nursing homes will be dead years before their time.  It is up to the Government to take responsibility and look after the most vulnerable in our society.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	602	I listened to the debate this evening and I thank those Deputies who contributed.  The Government is committed to ensuring high quality care is available to all patients and to the further development of the health services, in particular, addressing issues of patient safety.Last night, it was stated that insufficient funding was provided.  No Government has provided more funding to these services than the present one.  A total of €110 million was provided this year for older persons in palliative care with an additional follow-on of €40 million for next year.  This investment was the largest increase ever provided for older persons in palliative care.  The total expenditure in the Department on services for the elderly this year was €1.2 billion.Last night, it was stated that more support should be made available for the cost of nursing home care borne by individuals and their families.  New funding arrangements for persons in nursing homes will be finalised by the Department of Health and Children in line with the commitments given in the partnership agreement Towards 2016.  These arrangement will apply irrespective of whether a person is in a private or public facility.  The new arrangements will propose co-payments by care recipients, based on a national standardised financial assessment, a principle also agreed by the Government.A working group was established by the Department to review the standards last set down in 1993 for residential care settings for older persons.  Membership of the group comprised officials from the Department, the Health Service Executive, the social service inspectorate and the Irish Health Service Accreditation Board.  The group was involved in developing draft standards of both public and private residential care for older people.  These draft standards will be circulated shortly to interested parties for consultation.The Irish Health Service Accreditation Board examined the development of accreditation standards.  These will be introduced when the national standards are in place.  This board and the Department are involved in ongoing consultation on national accreditation standards.It is a matter of public record that the HSE working group report on nursing home inspection and registration was completed in July.  The executive's approach to nursing home inspection was strengthened in light of the report.  One of the recommendations was the recruitment and establishment of dedicated national inspection teams which would include medical, nursing and mental health professionals and have access to other professionals as required.All teams carry out inspections using a common approach based on a standard check list.  Inspections were on an unannounced basis for the past 12 months.  The transparency of the entire system is ensured by making reports available to the public.  It was suggested in the media that one arm of the HSE continues to place public patients in nursing homes which are found to be substandard by the HSEs own inspection regime.  I assure the House this is no longer the case.The health Bill will be published before the end of the year and will establish the Health Information and Quality Authority on a statutory basis.  It will be an independent body, incorporating the office of the chief inspector of social services.  Reliable and accurate information on what is happening in our system is a critical prerequisite to effective action.  We must improve our data collection, analysis and results dissemination and share information on preventing clinical error across our health services.  The authority's role on information will also be a key driver of the quality and patient safety agenda.I assure the House the Government is fully committed to ensuring patient safety is central to health policy and legislation.  Significant steps were already taken to ensure improvements in this area.  All steps necessary will continue to be taken to ensure real and lasting improvements in patient safety.  The Government has done a considerable amount of work to progress the patient safety agenda.The HSE provides centralised planning, which enables one area to more easily learn from another and best practice to spread.  It provides national leadership in quality and risk management across hospitals and primary and community care.  The clinical indemnity scheme brings together valuable information on incidents and valuable lessons can be learned from this.The Department put considerable effort into developing standards of care for older persons and the HSE implemented new management structures to facilitate safety.  Through the Health Information and Quality Authority, the Government will put in place another major element of an independent standards regime.  All of the elements I mentioned will combine to form a robust and effective patient safety infrastructure.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	603	The reason I wish to speak on this issue is because I raised it on many occasions when I was my party's deputy spokesperson for health in 1999, including with the then Minister of State, former Deputy Tom Moffatt in October of that year.  Deputy Gay Mitchell and I also raised it in a Private Members' motion.  I stated then and I will state now that expensive visiting committees go to prisons to protect the rights of prisoners who committed murder, rape, assault and abuse but no inspectorate is in place for nursing homes.The people to blame for Leas Cross are the Minister and former Minister for Health and Children and the officials in the Department.  They knew about it and they were told about it.  What really makes me angry is when I raised the issue of a public nursing home in Belmullet, the best the Department of Health and Children could do was to have an open day.  I went there and saw an elderly woman up against a wall down which water was dripping.  After I raised the issue, a sum of €1 million was made available by the Western Health Board to repair it.The health board thought it would cover it up by bringing in the then Minister of State, former Deputy Moffatt, and the media.  They did not cover it up.  Leas Cross was not covered up because it was a scandal waiting to happen.  If we had accountability in this country the Minister for Health and Children and the former Minister for Health and Children would be out the door.  Two Ministers resigned in Sweden, one because she did not pay her television licence and the other because she did not pay tax for employing a nanny.  However, we let our elderly be abused.  The health board, the Ministers and the Government knew it.  On many occasions in 1999, I spelled it out.  Report after report and Minister after Minister stated something would be done.  Many other Leas Cross situations exist throughout the State.  It is wrong.  If it happened in a Third World or any other country, the Opposition would ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to bring in the ambassador for that country and state to him or her we could not allow it to happen.  However, it is okay to abuse our own elderly.This has gone on too long.  I want to see the legislation introduced immediately.  I want to see an inspectorate put in place and officers going into public and private nursing homes to ensure our loved ones, some of whose parents died for this country, get the best protection from the State.  The Government knew about this in October 1999, 2000 and 2001.  If accountability existed in the country, two or three Ministers would resign.  They should do the honourable thing.  We would not have as much abuse in this country if they did their jobs.
#LiamTwomeyIND	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-party	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-dob	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	604	We stated last night that no Minister showed sufficient respect to elderly people to bother turning up at the HSE press conference last Thursday.  Now, we see the same Ministers cannot bother to stay in the Dáil Chamber to hear what the Opposition has to state about the Leas Cross report.  This is the type of arrogance creeping into the Government which makes it disrespectful to the people it is supposed to represent.I thank all Deputies who contributed to the debate.  I recognise the great work done by families, care assistants, doctors, nurses, private nursing homes and administrators in the HSE who care about patients.  When I commented on the HSE tonight, the people I am referring to know who I am talking about — it is not everybody in the HSE but a small cohort who more or less colluded with Ministers, as Deputy Ring said, over the past nine or ten years in keeping elderly people in terrible conditions in a small minority of nursing homes and letting people get away with it.It seems that there is no end to the scandalous fallout from the Leas Cross affair.  Today, it was revealed that 14 months after the "Prime Time" programme and 20 months after Martin Hynes had seen and reported on the poor treatment of residents in Leas Cross, nothing has changed in the inspection of nursing homes.  Absolutely nothing has changed so what does it take to wake up the Government?  There is no doubt that both the Government and the HSE have been left with zero credibility as regards looking after the elderly, given what we have seen in the past couple of weeks.The Government's amendment in response to Fine Gael and Labour's motion for the urgent creation of a patient safety authority is a damning indictment of its failure.  The amendment shows up the Government's incompetence, which is unbelievable.  There are 14 points in the Government's amendment and those dealing with patient safety or setting standards in the health service are either non-existent or have been in a need-to-do category for at least five years.  I doubt whether too many members of the Fianna Fáil Party have read those points, but if they did they would find they are not currently part of the health care service.I will take one example to demonstrate why we should not longer believe the Government cares about elderly people.  The Neary scandal in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital was exposed in 1998 but even today, as we speak in this Chamber, we have no competence assurance for doctors, no new medical practitioners Bill and no HIQA legislation, which includes the social services inspectorate.  All of these things were promised before the last election.  This week, just like last year when this scandal was exposed in the "Prime Time" programme, which struck a deep chord with the general public, they were all promised again.  This is totally unacceptable to the public.  The Government has refused to accept the very things on which it was asked to make recommendations.It gets worse, especially when we deal with the recommendations of the report by Judge Harding-Clark on Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  Yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Harney, told the House that things had improved dramatically with regard to the recommendations in the judge's report on Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.  However, neither the Minister, her officials, the HSE nor, to the best of my knowledge, the hospital itself have any action plan to deal with the report's recommendations, which is completely contrary to what the Minister said last night.  She has done nothing to implement those recommendations.  In fact, and this can be confirmed by the HSE, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital is short 40 staff nurses and midwives.  The hospital where this crisis started and which led to the Neary report is now short of staff nurses and midwives.  It is back in crisis again, where it all began.  The Government cannot seem to get it right when it comes to protecting patients.This morning, I took part in RTE's "Morning Ireland" programme.  On the same programme Mr. Aidan Brown represented the HSE and tried to provide the type of reassurances we have come to expect from the Government and the HSE.  It is the type of reassurance people probably got on the Titanic.  It was so half-hearted it was a disgrace.  He was trying to tell us that proper inspections are now being carried out but he was caught out before.  Since the day the HSE was established we have been told that things will get better.  A year later, “Prime Time” exposed the fact that matters are getting worse.  The HSE may apologise but its gets caught again for not improving the inspection regime.Mr. Brown tells us that things are getting better but I have been made aware that in the past three months, nursing home inspections were carried out for the HSE with no doctor or nurse present.  After all that has happened in the past, that is the type of inspection report Mr. Aidan Brown is trying to convince the people of Ireland is adequate in this day and age.The Minister of Health and Children also spoke about standards of care being promoted by the Irish Health Service Accreditation Board.  Most people will not be familiar with that board.  Last November, the Minister received standards that were drawn up by this board.  I would like to know if those standards have been published and, if so, are they being used?  I believe, however, that they have not been published one year after they were received by the Minister for Health and Children.  Therefore, the very elements, which the Minister is telling us are making things better, are not actually being implemented.  We do not have HIQA or the social services inspectorate to protect nursing homes.  In addition, we are not using the Irish Health Service Accreditation Board's standards.  Nothing to which the Minister referred is being used.Item 12 in the Government's amendment to the motion "notes that the Minister for Health and Children will introduce regulations in early 2007 which will set out a statutory framework for the introduction of a complaints process throughout the HSE".  If there was ever a perfect example as to why Fine Gael and Labour's patient safety authority needs to be established urgently, this is it.  Two years after the establishment of the HSE, the Minister has not drawn up the set of regulations under which patients could make complaints.  The Minister in charge has not introduced a process whereby patients can make complaints about the HSE.  This is incompetent.  I know that some people may not understand what corporate governance is but surely Ministers, who have been in power for almost a decade, understand the most basic things about it.  This is absolutely ridiculous.Another issue has cropped up with regard to the report on the death of Mr. P. J. Walsh.  We have seen no improvements in the service in the north east, but I will deal with that matter at the Committee on Health and Children tomorrow.  The recommendations of the inquiry into Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital have not been implemented by the Government either.I now turn to the case of Mr. Peter McKenna.  The House will be aware that Mr. Martin Hynes, who appeared on television last week to discuss this issue, wrote the report on Mr. Peter McKenna in 2000.  It concerned a patient who was treated disgracefully in Leas Cross, yet those responsible still sent patients in there.  They were being sent to their doom and those responsible did not care.  Leas Cross is a shocking indictment of the Government's incompetence and arrogance.  As Deputy Ring said, at least one Minister should resign to show that the Government has some respect for the people it claims to represent.  The actions of those concerned are both shameful and disgraceful.The failure to provide a funding policy for future care of the elderly is another aspect of this problem.  The Government has no problem pushing through legislation to force elderly people to sell their homes, but it has no respect for patients when it comes to their future care.Some of the Government's representatives here obviously do not have a clue what is going on.  HIQA is not better than the Fine Gael and Labour proposals.  To the best of my knowledge, HIQA does not apply to private hospitals.  The Progressive Democrats are trying to build more private hospitals even though there is currently no set of standards to protect patients.  Therefore, what the Progressive Democrats claim they will establish, with their lap-dogs in Fianna Fáil, will not even apply to private hospitals.  In some respects, HIQA is the Irish version of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the UK.  Recently, the latter body tried to deny UK cancer patients a drug because it cost too much.  The HIQA proposal is all about costs, processes and evaluation.  It does not put the patient at the centre of focus for the health care services.  The Government has really lost touch with the sort of people it is supposed to be representing.  That is why it gets wrapped up in processes, evaluation and all that old nonsense.

HIQA has no advocacy process, which is part of our proposed patient safety authority.  It has no whistle-blower legislation either.  Deputy Fiona O'Malley said that Fine Gael and Labour are unambitious.  Having achieved nothing itself, it is saying that our proposals are unambitious.  That is rich coming from a Government putting forward points to justify its care of patients, which remain unimplemented or non-existent.  She suggests our proposal is unambitious.Fine Gael and the Labour Party's proposal relating to a patient safety authority is practical, realistic and will ensure the patient is central.  When Deputy Fiona O'Malley said this proposal was unambitious the image entered my mind of Marie Antoinette suggesting the poor of Paris should eat cake when told of their hunger.  It seems Deputy O'Malley has a similarly poor connection with the people she represents.  The Government has completely lost touch with the elderly people it represents.  Fianna Fáil Deputies need to wake up because they always claim to represent the poor and oppressed in Irish society, but it seems ten years in power has erased such sentiments.  Perhaps they now feel the little people no longer matter and the cost of keeping elderly people is higher than their human value.  That is the way the Government is treating them.  I am happy to move this motion and I would like to see the Fianna Fáil Deputies come into the House to show how much they disrespect their elderly constituents.

#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	608	I take this opportunity to welcome a major new report on car crime and joyriding, "The Nature and Impact of Joyriding in Priorswood", by Michael Rush, Paula Brudell and Aogan Mulcahy of the school of applied social science at UCD, which was prepared for the Priorswood taskforce on joyriding, of which I am former member.  The report was launched at a well attended seminar at the Hilton Hotel in Clare Hall, Dublin 17, chaired by Pádraig White, the long time chairman of Coolock Development Council and outgoing chairman of the Northside Partnership.  Many local residents attended, including young people, and agency and community leaders, including our local Garda inspector, Mr. Dónal Waters, and Dublin city area manager, Mr. Declan Wallace.The report is commendable because it is based on the views, experiences and feelings of local residents and of some young people who participate in the activity, not just the views of an expert group coming to tell a local community how things are when they have no real idea what is happening on the ground.In the past 20 years, the community in this and similar areas in my constituency have suffered greatly from the criminal behaviour where cars are either bought or stolen to be used for joyriding until they are destroyed.  I raised this issue more than 30 times with the Taoiseach on the Order of Business in the 28th Dáil and brought two Bills into the House to make the Government face up to the legal problems caused by this activity.The taskforce on joyriding was established in 1998 and covers the parish of Priorswood, which along with Belcamp and Darndale parishes makes up the north Coolock area.  The report makes clear that the causes of joyriding are complex, particularly because this deviant and criminal behaviour has persisted for so long.  The issues that emerge in the report show again that even in the current era, the area still experiences profound socioeconomic disadvantage.  In the past it had unemployment rates of up to 80% and there is a major lack of educational and recreational facilities for young people.  The design of estates facilitated joyriding and other criminal behaviour.  I mentioned this on several occasions but a member of Fianna Fáil told me I was wasting Dáil time by raising this issue, a disgraceful comment on an attempt to give voice to a major problem that affects significant parts of Dublin, Cork and Limerick.A positive development in this report is the analysis of the views of 26 young people ranging in age from 11 to 23 years, all of whom were proud of their area but who also noted that it still experiences serious disadvantage in terms of recreation and other facilities.  The young people who were spoken to, one of whom addressed the report's launch, mentioned over and over the social context of joyriding, with young people acting as audiences for serious criminal behaviour.It is also noteworthy that the views of senior residents of the estate were canvassed and that they raised the ongoing desperate situations in which many people found themselves as a result of harassment linked to car crime and other antisocial behaviour.  Their children's educational attainment was often seriously damaged by the mayhem in the streets, mayhem that would not have been tolerated in most other areas.  The cost is also mentioned, along with the danger of being present in an area where joyriding was taking place.  My experience echoes that; I came across a scene where a child had just been killed and another seriously injured 15 years ago, which sparked my interest in this deviant behaviour.The Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Health and Children should examine this report in detail and consider how its recommendations could be implemented.  It is the fourth report on this phenomenon and it also refers to the new phenomenon of boy racers and dangerous driving.  Yesterday my party leader spoke of a Marshall Plan for areas like Priorswood, which is precisely what the Government needs to do, as the Minister of State knows from his own constituency.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	609	I am deputising for the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who regrets he cannot be here this evening.I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment and I am aware of his longstanding interest in this subject.  I assure him the Tánaiste shares his concern and that of the public in general regarding serious car crime and associated anti-social behaviour, in particular so-called joyriding.  It is generally a hard core of youths who engage in this activity, many of whom are known to the Garda.  Unfortunately, there is a high degree of recidivism.  The Garda continually monitors trends in car theft, with a view to identifying and targeting persistent offenders and policing areas which are unfortunately prone to suffer such activities.  Persons serving sentences for persistent offences related to so-called joyriding are not granted early temporary release except in the most exceptional circumstances.With these aims, the Garda Síochána operates special foot and mobile patrols, targeting specific areas in response to identified local requirements.  All vehicles the subject of unauthorised takings are technically examined when recovered and known offenders are targeted for these offences.  In each Garda division there is a traffic unit that targets incidents of joyriding and enforcement outside peak traffic hours.The Garda and local authorities have made good progress in recent years with regard to estate management and are actively reducing the opportunities for joyriding.  For example, physical changes, such as barriers, speed ramps, in-fill housing, raising of plinth walls and widening of footpaths are being used to reduce access to areas frequented by youths engaged in these activities.  Gardaí are constantly liaising with community groups and a number of projects are operating which have proved invaluable in dealing with offenders.Among these are a number of Garda youth diversion projects, which are a community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiative seeking to divert young persons from becoming involved, or further involved, in anti-social and criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects.  By so doing, the projects also contribute to improving the quality of life within communities and enhance the relations between the Garda and the community.  Funding has been provided by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for the Woodale Garda youth diversion project in the Darndale and Priorswood area.The Garda Síochána Act 2005, which is the most significant item of legislation affecting the Garda Síochána since the force was established, provides for the establishment of a range of new bodies.  Among these are joint policing committees.  The fundamental idea behind the committees is that the policing of our society, and the communities which make it up, cannot take place in a vacuum where the Garda itself decides how policing is to be carried out, without any input of views from society and communities.It is democratically desirable that the community makes such an input and in addition it is desirable that policing in our increasingly complex and diverse society requires such an input to be more effective.  These committees provide a forum in which both sides can consult, discuss and make recommendations on matters affecting the policing of the local authority area.  Central to this would of course be discussion of anti-social behaviour.The joint policing committee has to be established in accordance with guidelines issued by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, after consulting the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The guidelines were issued in June.  As a result of the number of local authorities in the State, the Tánaiste was of the view that it would be desirable to start by setting up a number of pilot committees and consequently 22 were set up.  These include committees for the Dublin City Council area and Fingal.The guidelines make special provision for the city council area.  As a result of the size of the area, in addition to the joint policing committee, they provide for the establishment of five local sub-committees, corresponding to the city's local areas.  In addition to members representative of elected members and the Garda Síochána, local officials and representatives of the voluntary and community sector can also attend.  The Dublin committee and sub-committees have started their work.As the Deputy has indicated, the Priorswood task force on joyriding was established in 1998 and is the only one of its kind in Ireland.  Funding of €127,000 was made available by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for pilot implementation of its anti-joyriding strategy during the two-year period 2002 to 2003.  This represented 75% of the total costs, with the balance coming from the then northern area health board, now the HSE.  The task force's strategy involved developing joint initiatives with local agencies and the community to prevent young people from joyriding, engaging with joyriders, including those in custody, developing alternatives in education, training and leisure and developing appropriate models of family support.The Minister has been informed by the Garda authorities that members of the Garda community policing unit have been part of the task force since 1998, which in conjunction with Dublin City Council and other local statutory community bodies has reduced the instances of joyriding by 25%.I understand the report on the nature and impact of joyriding in Priorswood was not submitted to the Tánaiste's Department, but that a copy has very recently been obtained.  The report notes a reduction in joyriding using various measurements, and this is welcomed.  A key recommendation of the report referred to by the Deputy is that the joyriding issue be considered within a concerted approach by local government and local development agencies and the RAPID programme.  This should be done within a wider context of developing local anti-poverty and social inclusion measures. There is no doubt this type of crime is a complex problem which, while requiring significant inputs from the criminal justice system, can only be tackled to lasting effect through a multi-faceted and multi-agency response involving the community and relevant statutory bodies.The report is being considered in the Tánaiste's Department and I understand it is also being considered by other Departments which will have an input into the response to its recommendations.  In addition, the report is being examined by senior Garda management in the Dublin metropolitan region.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	610	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this very important matter.  A serious problem has arisen in my constituency regarding cervical smear cytology.  Cervical smear tests are recommended for all women aged between 20 and 65.  As the national smear testing programme has not yet been rolled out to counties such as Kerry, many GPs do their own screening on a voluntary basis.  The majority of GPs have been sending smears to the laboratory at the Royal College of Surgeons unit in Beaumont Hospital for the past nine years or so, where they get a very professional service, with results returned after a waiting time of six to eight weeks.On Wednesday last, GPs received correspondence from the RCSI lab, advising that it could no longer accept smears, with immediate effect.  No explanation was given, I understand.  Apparently, the only alternative is to send the smears to Cork University Hospital.  However, the staff in CUH are under considerable pressure and are just about coping with their current workload.  They are still opening smears they received last April.  Besides that, they do not accept liquid-based smears from GPs, a method used by most GPs and predominantly across Europe.Cork University Hospital only accepts smears taken using wooden spatulas, with the sample being placed on a slide manually by the GP.  As a result of the backlog of work in CUH, the staff are under so much pressure that they have not yet adopted technology to analyse liquid-based smears.Cervical cytology is a labour-intensive job.  It involves highly-trained cytologists analysing a smear through a microscope for a considerable length of time.  Even if the CUH lab was equipped to do liquid smear tests, it just could not double its output overnight if all the GPs now using the RCSI had to be accommodated.The GPs must send their patients' smears to an accredited lab which can process liquid-based smears and report on them within three months at most.  They are reluctant to return to the old method of taking smears using wooden spatulas as the liquid-based method is accepted as being superior.  Besides that, they are not prepared to wait seven months for the result of a smear test as this could be fatal for the patient.The vast majority of GP smears are carried out on GMS patients.  The GPs do not get paid for this work, not even for the special delivery postage.  The concern of the GPs is not driven by money, but it is rather a genuine concern for the patients' health.  Early diagnosis and medical intervention in many cases is the difference between the life and death of a woman with cervical cancer.  Deaths are preventable and it would be a tragedy if GPs had to stop doing smear tests because they had no place to send them for analysis.I call on the Minister, through the Minister of State, to make direct contact with Professor Brendan Drumm of the Health Service Executive to request him to make immediate provision so that Kerry GPs can have access to a modern accredited lab which can accept liquid-based smears.  I am sure the Minister of State will accept that the women of Kerry, and those living in other parts of the country who depend on the RCSI unit at Beaumont Hospital, deserve this service at least.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	611	I am taking this Adjournment debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  The laboratory of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland at Beaumont Hospital has decided not to continue with the testing of cervical smears referred by general practitioners in the southern and north-eastern areas.  Approximately 60 practices are affected.This laboratory is private and contracted by the HSE to conduct liquid-based testing on cervical smears sent in by general practitioners.  On 9 November 2006, the HSE wrote to general practitioners in Kerry affected by the decision asking them to refer cervical smears to Cork University Hospital instead of to the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland.  General practitioners were asked to implement this change with immediate effect.  These are transitional arrangements necessary to ensure that general practitioners are aware of the designated laboratories for the testing of cervical smears taken at their practices.The director of the Irish cervical screening programme is to meet representatives of Cork University Hospital again next week.  The aim of the meeting is to deal with any issues the hospital may have in covering the additional workload involved.  The objective of the HSE is to improve on an ongoing basis the turnaround time for receipt of cervical test results.  The programme has provided training to laboratory staff at Cork University Hospital to conduct liquid-based testing.  This test is more costly than conventional testing, is more accurate and tests can be conducted more quickly.  It is more efficient as it results in fewer repeat smears.  This means that significantly fewer women will be asked to have a repeat test.The executive is concerned about the unacceptable turnaround time for conventional smears in the southern area.  It has decided to refer smears to two private laboratories, one of which is in the United Kingdom.  Contract approval was signed earlier this week following a competitive tendering process.  Arrangements are now being made to refer samples to the two laboratories.  The HSE expects to have test results available commencing next month.The issue raised by the Deputy is also relevant to cervical screening generally.  The Minister wishes to see the Irish cervical screening programme rolled out nationally as soon as possible, based on an affordable model and in line with international best practice.  Significant preparatory work is well under way involving the introduction of new and improved cervical tests, improved quality assurance training and the preparation of a national population register.  An additional €1.3 million was made available to the HSE in 2006 to prepare for the roll out.The Minister will shortly establish a national cancer screening service to amalgamate BreastCheck and the ICSP, to deliver both programmes on a national basis.  This will maximise the expertise in both programmes, ensure improved efficiency and develop a single governance model for cancer screening.  The plan is to have cervical screening managed as a national call-recall programme via effective governance structures that provide overall leadership and direction, in terms of quality assurance, accountability and value for money.  All elements of the programme, call-recall, smear taking, laboratories and treatment services must be quality assured, organised and managed to deliver a single integrated service.The Minister will request the service to ensure that the laboratory elements will be delivered in an efficient and cost effective manner that ensures high quality and good turnaround time for results.
#JohnEllis	unknown-#JohnEllis-party	unknown-#JohnEllis-dob	unknown-#JohnEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	612	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing Deputy Finneran and I to raise the matter of the proposed closure by Glanbia of its canning facility at Rooskey, County Roscommon.  The House will be aware that the Rooskey plant was destroyed by fire some years ago and the only part of the premises that avoided the fire was the cannery which continued to operate until the recent proposal by Glanbia to close it.This is a completely retrograde step in view of the fact that this facility had an offer for a management buy-out some six months ago but which has been rejected by the board of Glanbia.  This management buy-out would have managed to save the jobs of the 85 people who are employed there.I ask the Minister of State to ask Glanbia to reconsider the position with regard to the proposed closure and to re-examine the possibility of the management buy-out.  I hope that in doing so Glanbia would realise that it has now benefited to the tune of €30 million as a result of the insurance claim it received in respect of the fire at the plant.  This money has not been invested in the Rooskey community or in the community served by the plant prior to the fire.  There is an onus on Glanbia to ensure that it considers the management buy-out and reconsider it or else decide to ask Enterprise Ireland to take over the business and see what can be done to market the site and allow the jobs in Rooskey to be retained.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	613	I join with my colleague, Deputy Ellis, in raising this matter on the Adjournment.I refer to the loss of the remaining 85 jobs and the disgraceful treatment handed down to the village of Rooskey and its people by the Glanbia company which has already pocketed some €30 million of an insurance claim following a fire in the factory in 2002, with the loss of more than 400 jobs.  The ultimate insult is the refusal of a management buy-out which would have protected the remaining 85 jobs.This is a disgrace and a severe blow to the area, to the people of Roscommon and south Leitrim.  I am outraged that the management of the canning facility at Rooskey and the Glanbia company have decided to close the facility in the new year, despite a recent attempt at a buy-out which has the support of a Dutch family company and which would have provided an outlet for the products in Europe.  A buy-out was lined up and support was established for the facility.  I do not understand how they could do this to the people of Roscommon and Leitrim considering the job losses they have already experienced at the facility.I call on the Government to put pressure on Glanbia to reopen the discussions between the buy-out company and Glanbia.  I ask that all the State agencies become involved to ensure that this facility which is the last canning facility in the country, is maintained.  If they are not prepared to entertain this on their own site, I ask that they stay in business or allow the business to continue until the middle of 2007 so that the county manager of County Roscommon, with the State agencies, can provide an alternative site to save these jobs and perhaps provide increased jobs in that area.  Canning is not an industry that we will ever see in Ireland again if this facility in Rooskey is closed down.  Glanbia owes more to the people of County Roscommon and County Leitrim than it is currently providing.  The Government should put strong pressure on the company.  My colleague and I are speaking here on behalf of the people of the area.  We are expressing the widely held view in that area that this company has walked away and pocketed a significant sum of money without giving any positive response to the local people.  It has a chance to do so now and my colleague and I are calling for that to be done.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	614	I thank the Deputies for raising these matters.While responsibility for the food sector rests with the Minister for Agriculture and Food, I was very disappointed to hear about the situation at the company in question.  I am very conscious of the effects that the job losses will have on the workers concerned and their families, as well as on the local community in the surrounding area.  This is very disturbing news for the workers employed in this meat canning plant who now face losing their jobs.  I wish to assure all those concerned that the State agencies under the remit of my Department will provide every support they can.  The priority will be to secure alternative employment for those involved at the earliest opportunity.  The role of FÁS, the industrial training agency, will be of particular importance in providing support and assistance to the workers facing redundancy.The Glanbia plant in Rooskey, County Roscommon, was established in 1972 when a canning plant was set up alongside a pork slaughtering plant.  As a result of a fire at the plant in May 2002, the boning and slaughtering activities were terminated.  Consistent with the sectoral strategy for pork at that time, Glanbia rationalised its slaughtering operations and consolidated that activity into two sites, Roscrea and Edenderry.  This consolidation of facilities was driven by a need to achieve international competitiveness in the pork sector where over 50% of the output of the pork division of Glanbia is exported.The cannery operation survived on the Rooskey site and employed 85 people.  While exports to third countries were a big part of the business in the early 1990s, the current business is involved primarily in exporting to the UK as well as supplying the domestic market.  Products include a range of canned products such as hams, corned beef, pies and ready-made meals.The performance of this business declined in 2005, when a long-standing contract to supply canned pork products was lost.  This resulted in the loss of 1,500 tonnes of sales volume per week, forcing the company to put most of the work force on a three-day week.  The overall canned meat market is in decline as a result of changing consumer preferences and a greater emphasis on fresh and chilled products.  In recognising the declining market segment for canned meat products, Enterprise Ireland has been working with Glanbia Rooskey to stimulate new product development to replace products in decline.  Over the past two years, a significant amount of effort was put in to replace that business and Enterprise Ireland, under its research and development grant aid scheme supported a number of potential new product development projects.  Regrettably, there was no positive outcome from these initiatives.This year, Glanbia undertook a strategic review of its activities at the Rooskey plant.  During the review process, an approach was made by two of the existing management team who were interested in purchasing the business.  While Enterprise Ireland held discussions with the potential new owners and actively encouraged Glanbia to do business if possible, I am informed that the interested parties were unable to develop a viable business plan that could show any growth opportunities for the cannery market.  As a result, Glanbia was not prepared to proceed with the management buy-out.  Enterprise Ireland understands that Glanbia feels that it has exhausted all possibilities regarding a management buy-out and, as a result, it announced the closure of the Rooskey plant on 14 November 2006, with the loss of 85 jobs.There are currently ten IDA Ireland-supported companies in County Roscommon employing approximately 900 people.  Enterprise Ireland has 78 client companies in the county, employing approximately 1,950 people.  Under the Government's decentralisation programme, the Land Registry part of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be relocating to Roscommon.  This will see 230 jobs moving to the town.The most recent live register figures for County Roscommon show a figure of 1,224 for October 2006, down from 1,264 in the previous month.  The industrial development agencies will be making every effort to secure new investment and job opportunities in Roscommon.  There are already a number of important groups and committees working to develop the business infrastructure in County Roscommon.  These include the board and economic group of Roscommon County Development Board and the board and evaluation committee of Roscommon County Enterprise Board.  The efforts of the development agencies, together with local interests, will be very important in the future and I am confident they will continue to bring sustainable employment to the area.  I will take account of the points raised by Deputies Ellis and Finneran and will raise them with the Minister, Deputy Martin.

Comments allegedly made by Omar Bakri Muhammad, a Muslim cleric, activist and publisher, were yesterday put into the public domain by the BBC.  In an on-line debate, Muhammad was asked if Dublin Airport should be a target for a terrorist attack as American troops transited through the facility on the way to Iraq.  He responded by saying, "Hit the target and hit it very hard".It is symptomatic of the lack of priority given to the threat of international terrorism by the Government that the people have learned of this statement through the media channels of another European state.  Our intelligence services receive a tiny amount of funding and are completely under-equipped in terms of monitoring even a fraction of the terrorism-related activity on the Internet.  It is beyond time for the Government to realise that, in certain quarters, Ireland is viewed as a reasonable target for terrorist attack.  As a matter of priority, we now need to put in place the structures to cope with this threat effectively, both in terms of protecting those living in the State from terrorism and ensuring that Ireland cannot be used as a staging post for an attack on another country.While the invasion of Iraq is often quoted as justification for terrorism, we should remember that the 11 September 2001 attacks occurred before this military action took place.  It is clear that a hard-line extremist element has developed which will use every tool at its disposal to radicalise predominately young men to carry out terrorist atrocities.  This was, for example, the case with the London bombings in July 2005.I do not believe that the Government has treated threats of Islamic terrorism with the importance they deserve.  We cannot wait until there is an attack on Irish soil or, more likely, that Ireland is used as a base for an attack on neighbouring countries before action is taken.  The Government pays scant regard to the importance of emergency planning.  I have frequently called for the work of the task force on emergency planning to be underpinned through legislation and for the creation of a single emergency planning body which would report to the Taoiseach.  This is in line with a recommendation from the emergency planning society made to Government in 2003, yet this recommendation has never been acted on.Ireland's emergency response is split between a large number of Departments, State agencies and sub-groups.  Emergency incidents have been simulated but we have no real information about these exercises or their findings.  Even basic and common sense steps to improve security at our airports have not been progressed.  Irish airports lack sniffer dogs to check for explosives.  There is no visible, armed presence at our airports to act as a deterrent and to be in place to respond quickly in an emergency.  Additionally, Ireland has no air marshal training programme.  Given all this, it is not surprising that a survey conducted earlier this year found that 70% of the population did not believe Ireland was well-prepared to cope with a serious emergency.This year, attacks which would have killed thousands of people engaged in transatlantic travel, including Irish citizens among their number, were foiled.  However, even with these developments, the Government seems not to have realised that the tactics of international terrorists have changed.  The focus now is on the body count and on attacks which maximise the loss of civilian life and strike terror into the population.  The civilians in question — their nationality, political allegiance or religion — are of little importance.  Look, for example, at those killed in London in July 2005.  The dead represented every section of the multicultural society that exists in that city — people of all colours, religions and ethnic backgrounds.Omar Bakri Muhammad highlighted the practice of targeting people indiscriminately when he said: "We don't make a distinction between civilians and non-civilians, innocents and non-innocents."  The protection of civilians is the highest responsibility that any Government can hold.  It is high time this responsibility is taken seriously.  We can do this by establishing a single body, as they have in Britain, responsible for national emergency planning.  This body would be under the control of the Taoiseach.  We must also invest resources in our intelligence services.  Currently, €800,000 is allocated to the intelligence services while we spend €3 million on the removal of graffiti.  We must establish an intelligence body comprising all those that have something to bring to it.  This would include the Garda, the military and the Customs and Excise service.  I ask the Minister to examine the possibility of establishing such a body.

I thank Deputy Timmins for raising this matter.In the aftermath of the events of 11 September 2001, the Government moved quickly and decisively to respond to the international security position.  Government structures were put in place to support emergency planning in Ireland and to improve co-ordination across the various existing national emergency plans.  The Government task force on emergency planning was established in 2001 and is the top-level structure which gives policy and direction and co-ordinates and oversees the emergency planning activities of all Departments and public authorities.  It promotes the best possible use of resources and compatibility across different planning requirements.The Government task force on emergency planning is chaired by the Minister for Defence.  It includes Ministers, senior departmental officials, senior officers of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces, and officials of other key public authorities which have a lead or support role in Government emergency planning.  There have been 49 meetings of the task force to date.  Each meeting of the Government task force has, as a standing agenda item, an assessment of the current security threat, which is provided by the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces.  The current advice available suggests that the terrorist threat to Ireland is low.  The figures supplied by Deputy Timmins are not accurate.  They do not take account of the considerable salaries and overheads involved in engaging intelligence and security service personnel in the Garda and the Defence Forces.The State's response to any security alert is primarily a matter for the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I can confirm that the Garda Síochána, acting as our national security service, maintains an up-to-date assessment of the national threat to the State from international terrorist groups through analysis gathered from domestic and international sources.  These threat assessments are furnished to the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and to the Government at regular intervals.  I can also confirm that the Garda Síochána has developed excellent lines of communication and co-operation with police forces and security services in the European Union and further afield.  This ongoing sharing of intelligence enables a rapid operational response to be put in place where circumstances so warrant.One of the roles assigned to the Defence Forces is the provision of aid to the civil power, meaning in practice to assist the Garda Síochána when requested.  The various components of the Defence Forces are active in this regard, providing such assistance as is appropriate in specific circumstances.  Emergency plans and procedures are updated as necessary.  Such additional equipment as is needed is acquired on the basis of identified priorities.  Training and preparation for such events is also provided for in the Defence Forces annual training plan.The most important defence against any attack is, of course, vigilance, detection and prevention by the security forces.  All the necessary resources of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces are deployed to this end.  The total expended on military intelligence is not separately compiled, and it is not considered appropriate to disclose such information.The European Union's counter-terrorism efforts are centred around implementation of the EU strategy and action plan on counter-terrorism, which also includes a strategy and action plan on radicalisation and recruitment in respect of extremist groups.  Ireland, at both ministerial and official level, including in particular the Garda Síochána acting as our national security service, actively contributes to the implementation of these strategies and plans.The Minister for Defence, as chairman of the Government task force on emergency planning, presents an annual report to the Government on emergency planning issues.  This report provides a summary of the main emergency planning issues that have arisen during the year and provides an analysis of each Department's progress across a range of emergency planning areas.The office of emergency planning was established following a Government decision in October 2001 as a joint civil-military office within the Department of Defence.  The office provides a key support role to the Government task force on emergency planning.  It is responsible for the co-ordination and oversight of emergency planning.  The office works with Departments and other key public authorities to ensure the best possible use of resources and compatibility across different emergency planning requirements and to oversee Government emergency planning in general.In 2006, as part of its oversight role, the office of emergency planning met with 14 Government Departments.  Each of these Departments has assured the office that it is addressing its emergency planning responsibilities and has the appropriate plans and response arrangements in place to address large-scale emergencies.  At all times the lead responsibility for specific emergency planning functions remains with the relevant Government Departments.  When an emergency occurs, the appropriate emergency plan is set into operation with the relevant Department taking the lead in its implementation.  The approach continues to be that such responses must be characterised by effective management of all aspects of emergency planning and by a high level of public confidence in all the response arrangements.  The Minister for Defence is satisfied that the current legislative and funding arrangements are adequate to meet our emergency planning needs.  However, the position is being kept under constant review.

The recently launched "Gateways Investment Priorities Study" aims to provide renewed impetus to the development of the nine Gateway locations identified in the NSS.  Gateway development involves not just physical infrastructure but also the development of labour force participation, the enterprise and economic base, skills and R&D.  The enterprise development agencies under my Department and FÁS were closely involved in preparing this report and they will be key partners in implementing its recommendations.Enterprise Ireland has set itself three broad objectives with regard to its regional focus. First, to drive the growth of innovation-based start-ups in locations throughout the country, second, to develop existing client companies in all locations, and third, to facilitate entrepreneurial development and the development of the enterprise environment in local and rural communities.IDA also has a strong role to play because of the mobilizing and energizing effect that new investments can have in a region.  The impact of new inward investment can be seen in many towns over recent years, for example, Pacificare and Pramerica in Letterkenny, MBNA in Carrick-on-Shannon, Guidant in Clonmel  Kostal in Mallow, Cordis in Cashel, M.S.D in Ballindine, Abbot Diabetes in Donegal, Servier in Belview and Arklow, U.S.C.I. in Ballinasloe and Toucan in Sligo.IDA Ireland is currently in the process of developing a number of high specification, regionally distributed, strategic industrial sites to help the regions compete for high-value projects in both the biopharmaceutical and ICT sectors.A total of 46 new investment projects, out of the 71 supported by IDA Ireland in 2005, are locating outside Dublin. Over the past six years the new job gains associated with Enterprise Ireland clients have shown strong growth in the regions.  In 2000, 54% of employment gains were in EI client companies located in all regions outside of Dublin.  By 2005, 65% of employment gains associated with Enterprise Ireland client companies were located in regions outside Dublin.I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by the development agencies are and will continue to bear fruit in terms of a more equitable distribution of investments and jobs.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	618	The eligibility requirements and terms and conditions of employment for the position of Labour Inspector do not provide for competence in minority languages. While Inspectors come into contact and engage with migrant workers in the course of investigations a substantial portion of the Inspectorate's time is allocated to the detailed examination of employment records and compliance with a substantial corpus of employment rights legislation generally. The generality of investigative work undertaken by Labour Inspectors does not require that they be competent in a variety of languages. Where the need for interpretation services are required, such as in the taking of statements from employees or the translation of documents, the Inspectorate has adequate access to a panel of competent individuals who can provide the services necessary in a broad range of languages.The Employment Rights Information Unit (ERIU) of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment produces a range of materials including information leaflets and booklets that provide a condensed and simplified version of the large corpus of Employment Rights legislation that is currently on the Statute Books. With particular regard for the needs of workers from overseas the Department has translated key Employment Rights information into nine languages and made this available both in leaflet form and on the Department's website.The existing staff complement of the Labour Inspectorate of the Department comprises 31 Inspectors and some 7 administrative support staff. The number of Labour Inspectors under this Office will be progressively increased from 31 to 90 by end-2007, as part of the initiative provided in "Towards 2016" to increase the staffing resources of the Employment Rights Bodies generally.This Department is in consultation with the Department of Finance in relation to the filling of the new Labour Inspector positions. I expect that the necessary arrangements and selection processes can be progressed between now and end year with a view to assignments being made from the second quarter of 2007.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	619	I propose to take Questions Nos. 85 and 149 together.The persons in respect of whom details have been supplied could, in accordance with Section 6 of the Payment of Wages Act, 1991, present a complaint to a Rights Commissioner. The Rights Commissioner may, following examination of the facts and if he/she considers that the complaint is well founded, order the employer to pay appropriate compensation. Complaints must be presented to the Rights Commissioner Service within six months from the date of the contravention or in exceptional circumstances such further period not exceeding six months as the Rights Commissioner considers reasonable. The enforcement of any such order outside the jurisdiction of the State would, of course, be problematic.Alternatively, the persons involved could take civil proceedings against the employer within the latter's jurisdiction. In such proceedings the unpaid wages would be considered as a simple contract debt.The option of seeking assistance from the Irish and European representatives of the PGA might also be worth pursuing given the latter's responsibilities for the organisation and hosting of this year's Ryder Cup.Finally, the persons involved may wish to contact the Private Security Authority, which in accordance with the Private Security Services Act 2004, is the statutory body with responsibility for licensing and regulating the private security industry in Ireland.There are no proposals to introduce specific legislation to regulate non-Irish firms who employ people during sporting and entertainment events. A comprehensive body of employment rights legislation, which does not distinguish between Irish and non-Irish based firms, is already in place. The Deputy will be aware, however, that a number of legislative commitments in the employment rights area arising from the Partnership Agreement "Towards 2016" are being progressed at present. All measures which will have the effect of enhancing existing provisions and arrangements insofar as compliance, enforcement and redress are concerned will be considered in the context of the preparation of this legislation.I am also committed to building on the existing contacts between the industrial relations institutions, relevant Departments and the social partners and their UK and EU counterparts, with a view to promoting greater co-operation on workplace issues.  Such co-operation and dialogue will be grounded both in the context of developments in their respective labour markets and in the light of EU developments, including in the context of social dialogue at EU level.

The resources of FÁS are available to all redundant workers.  FÁS provides workers with information and advice and places workers on training programmes, which often lead to further employment.In order to improve its customer service in making payments under the Statutory Redundancy Payments Scheme, this Department introduced on 31st May, 2005 a new user-friendly on-line redundancy applications system. This quicker and more efficient system has proved to be a success and the take-up rate of this on-line facility by customers has increased from an initial 12% to 52% at present.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	621	The Framework Programme is the main instrument through which the EU's research policy is implemented. The Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) has been designed to build on the achievements of its predecessor towards the creation of the European Research Area and carry it further towards the objective of developing the knowledge economy and society in Europe.  The Budget for the FP7 Programme is €50.5 billion for the period 2007-2013.The Programme has always been an important element in the internationalisation of Irish research.  It has enabled academic and industry research groups to work with their peers across Europe and derive the benefits associated with collaborative research. In monetary terms, this activity has injected some €200 million of additional European funding into the Irish research system over the lifetime of the previous Programme FP6 (2003-2006).  Ireland's Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation (SSTI) has set a national target of €400 million for FP7.There is a very close alignment between Ireland's goals for science and research and those of the European Union.  As such, FP7 will be a critical component in delivering on the targets set out in our national strategy for STI, which covers the same timeframe.Ireland has made a major input into shaping FP7 and we are satisfied with its overall structure and content.  Collaborative research, which will provide funding to facilitate transnational research partnerships and, the Marie Curie actions, which will provide support to encourage the mobility of researchers across Europe, will continue to form the bulk of the new Programme.   We have played a lead role in pushing for simplification to make FP7 more attuned to the needs of industry and we were successful in ensuring the inclusion of the 15% target for SME participation in collaborative research.FP7 also provides for new initiatives such as the European Research Council (ERC) which will support Europe's top researchers to undertake frontier research based on a European-wide competition for funding, This new programme will complement SFI initiatives and programmes which are focused on building a base of world class research in Ireland.Today I officiated at our national launch of FP7 and it is now in the hands of researchers and companies to exploit the opportunities available.  All participants in the Programme have to compete for funding — there are no funds allocated to Ireland per se.  However, in order to help researchers and companies in Ireland to join partnerships and compete for funding, I have put in place a new national support structure that will provide practical assistance to help potential participants.  The main elements of the support structure include: a key feature of the strengthened support structure is the appointment of a National Director for FP7, Dr. Imelda Lambkin, who will head up a dedicated FP7 Office to be based in Enterprise Ireland.  This FP7 Office will support the work of our network of 30 National Contact Points and will act as a first port of call for newcomers to the programme.  It will ensure that a co-ordinated and coherent approach is adopted across all of the components of FP7 so that researchers and companies are fully aware of all relevant opportunities; the development and promotion of a coherent and easy to access range of funding mechanisms to support applications to the programme from Ireland and the promotion of measures to support all island collaboration in the programme.The support network will be resourced in all years from 2007 to 2013 using public monies channelled by Government Departments to the agencies and organisations involved.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	622	The number of inspections which have been carried out by the Labour Inspectorate in respect of compliance with the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 in 2005 and 2006 was 481 and 2,818 respectively.While no prosecutions were initiated under that legislation in 2005 or 2006 the Deputy should be aware that the primary objective of the Labour Inspectorate in cases where breaches of employment rights legislation have been detected is to seek redress for the individual or individuals concerned in terms of ensuring immediate compliance and rectification of any such breaches and, where these breaches have resulted in an financial loss to workers, to effect payment of any arrears due. In this regard over €1 million in arrears has been recovered to date in 2006 from employers arising from National Minimum Wage and other statutory minimum wage inspections by the Labour Inspectorate.The Labour Inspectorate will initiate prosecutions, where appropriate, in cases of failure to effect compliance or rectify breaches detected. However, the number of prosecutions initiated or the number of successful prosecutions is not an effective indicator of either the incidence of breaches or the effectiveness of Labour Inspectorate enforcement.The Deputy should be aware that statutory minimum rates of pay for certain sectors, for example Construction and Agriculture, are provided for under Employment Regulation Orders and Registered Employment Agreements, which are also enforced by the Labour Inspectorate.Earlier this year the Labour Inspectorate undertook a targeted campaign, which included a focus on National Minimum Wage compliance. This focused campaign has substantially increased the number of inspections/visits carried out under the National Minimum Wage Act in 2006.I can assure the Deputy that the inspection of compliance with the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000 and with other statutory instruments and agreements which provide for minimum rates of pay is a priority objective within the Labour Inspectorate. Routine and targeted inspections of compliance within all sectors, including the construction sector and the mushroom industry in which statutory minimum rates of pay are provided for by Employment Regulation Order and Registered Employment Agreement respectively, are important elements within the Inspectorate's programme of activities.

In the meantime, and as soon as the Director has been appointed and an Advisory Board put in place, I propose to establish this Office on an interim basis.The Public Appointments Service is managing the recruitment competitions for the positions of Director of, and Legal Advisor and Accountant in, the ODERC. The deadlines for applications for these posts have passed and the associated selection processes will shortly be underway. Arrangements in respect of the filling of other senior management positions within the ODERC are well advanced.The necessary funding for the Office will be provided in the context of the 2007 Pre-Budget Estimates which will be published this week.Subject to continued progress on recruitment and other arrangements I hope to be in a position to announce early next year the establishment of the Office on an interim, non-statutory basis. Work has already begun on the preparation of the Employment Rights Compliance Bill which will, among other matters, establish the Office on a statutory basis.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	624	In September, 2006, the company in question announced a reduction in its employment with the removal of 200 temporary positions from its Waterford plant.  The full services of the Industrial Training agency FÁS are available to  these employees.  The jobs in question are not permanent positions and the company continues to employ over 1,500 permanent people.On 27 October, 2006, I announced that a French company would be investing €115 million in establishing a pharmaceuticals ingredients facility at Belview which is located on the border of Waterford and Kilkenny.  A total of 155 new jobs will be created in this facility.  The real significance of this project is that the French company is the first company to locate in the Belview site.  Belview is a key strategic site developed by IDA Ireland to attract a cluster of cutting-edge multinational pharmaceutical companies to the South East.  This is a very promising beginning.On 12 October, 2006, Waterford County Council organised a Conference entitled "Invest in Waterford" which was held in Dungarvan.  On that occasion, the Secretary General of my Department launched a new website to promote County Waterford as a prime business location for a range of sectors including retail, healthcare, bio-pharma and pharmaceuticals, shared services and tourism.  The website also seeks to attract people to return to the county to work.Earlier this year, I announced the extension of the Enterprise Ireland Community Enterprise Centre Scheme.  Under this Scheme, Dungarvan Enterprise Development was approved for €300,000 towards the construction of a new Centre.  Enterprise Ireland is also involved in the Interagency Forum which was established by the Waterford County Manager last year following job losses at the Dungarvan Crystal Plant.  In this regard, support has been provided for an Economic Development Executive and this position was filled at the end of last year.I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued will continue to bring about investment and jobs for the people of Waterford.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	625	IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI) to Ireland and its regions.  For a number of years now the Agency has been very successful in marketing Ireland to overseas investors and we continue to win a disproportionate share of available investments relative to our size and population.The level of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Ireland, relative to the size of the economy, is one of the highest in the world. At the end of 2005 there were over 132,000 people employed in 1,010 IDA supported companies. These include many of the leading companies in information technology and communications, life sciences, international services, engineering and financial services.The challenge for IDA Ireland now is to sustain, embed and grow these investments and to entice new investments. In responding to this challenge IDA Ireland is focusing on the development of its employment base into high technology, high value added and high skill functions, including not only high-end manufacturing, but also areas such as high-end services and R&D.Ireland has re-invented its value proposition for inward investment over the past seven years, recognising changes in global conditions and in our own circumstances. Today's investments are characterised by their leading-edge nature, in terms of technology, such as in Amgen and Intel, or their market innovation, such as in eBay and Google. They are increasingly reliant on a highly skilled workforce. They require an agile, flexible and responsive operating environment.Ireland has now established a reputation globally as a location for advanced manufacturing, sophisticated business services and, increasingly, for leading research and innovation. Each of these areas will be of critical importance to our continuing success.In order to support this continued success, IDA Ireland has adopted a series of interlinked programmes of work, the main elements of which are as follows:Concentrating more resources on helping to underpin the competitiveness of existing overseas companies in Ireland, by encouraging and supporting existing clients to move up the value chain into higher value products and services and into higher order functions, such as R&D;Seeking out niches of business in which Ireland can carve out world market leadership;Developing new networks and relationships to work towards developments in new areas such as strengthening links between business and third level institutions and other research centres with a view to increasing innovation;Pursuing high quality new FDI that is in keeping with the competitive characteristics of the Irish economy today.I am satisfied that the policies and strategies being pursued by IDA Ireland are the most appropriate ones to attract and grow foreign direct investment in the country which will, in turn, maintain and grow sustainable, quality employment into the future.

The recommendations of the 2001 Taskforce were implemented.One of the recommendations in the 2005 Report of the Expert Advisory Group was  that a follow up survey on workplace bullying, similar to that commissioned for the 2001 report, be conducted as soon as practicable to establish a baseline from which the effectiveness of the new structures and processes would be measured. This Department has commissioned the ESRI to carry out this survey, which is currently ongoing.  It is expected that the survey will be completed in early 2007.  I have already given a commitment to publish the results of the survey.In the meantime, I have asked the Health and Safety Authority to update the 2002 Code of Practice on Workplace Bullying (one of the recommendations of the 2001 Report) and bring it in line with the 2005 Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act. I expect that the Authority will be in a position to publish a draft of the Code of Practice very soon as part of the statutory requirement on consultations with the public. I also expect to receive the Code from the Authority early in the New Year for approval under the 2005 Act.

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	628	I consider that the failure of the EU Employment Ministers to reach agreement on the politically sensitive draft EU Working Time Directive at their Council on 7 November 2006, was a missed opportunity to bring a consensus approach to EU working hours. A better opportunity will not arise again for some considerable time as Germany, Slovenia and Portugal have signalled that they have other priorities during their respective upcoming Presidencies of the EU.Despite big efforts over the course of the last five Presidencies and in particular, the heroic efforts of both the Austrian and current Finnish Presidencies, agreement foundered on the issue of the ending of the "opt-out" clause allowing workers in some Member States to work beyond an average maximum of 48 hours per week. The UK, supported by some of the new Member States, were opposed to a definitive end date for the "opt-out" clause as proposed by France, Italy and Spain.While Ireland does not avail of the opt out, we saw the Finnish Presidency proposal as a pragmatic and workable compromise which would have protected the health and safety of workers without compromising the competitiveness of enterprises. Despite the flexibilities on offer in the compromise, blocking minorities in opposing camps prevented agreement.The initiative now lies with the European Commission in its role as guardians of the EU Treaty to decide whether or not to take Infringement Proceedings against 23 out of 25 Member States, who it says are in breach of the Directive following recent ECJ Rulings in the Simap and Jaeger Cases.However, given the political sensitivity of the Directive for Member States, particularly in relation to the provision of healthcare services, it is not yet clear as to how the EU Commission might approach Infringement Proceedings should they choose to pursue this option.

On 31st May 2006, the OPW commenced the tendering process by seeking expressions of interest from developers in relation to the design, build, finance and maintenance of new office accommodation and car parking for the Department in Carlow.On completion of this stage, a short-list of developers will be drawn up from whom tenders will be invited.  Following the tender evaluation process the preferred tenderer will be requested to seek suitable planning permission.  On obtaining this, the OPW will formally award the contract and construction will commence. The OPW expect construction to begin late in 2007 and the construction phase may take up to 24 months.In order to accommodate staff who wish to move earlier than the projected building completion date, officials of my Department, in consultation with the Department of Finance and the OPW, as well as decentralising staff and Business Units, are progressing an earlier move to Carlow, subject to securing high quality temporary accommodation.  I expect this option to allow for the movement of approximately 80 decentralising staff to Carlow during the second quarter of 2007, on a voluntary basis.The number of posts in Business Units decentralising to Carlow, as at 10th November, is 280. Having regard to the agreed staffing transfer protocols governing decentralisation, my Department has approached all General Service staff who expressed a first preference before 7th September 2004 i.e "Priority Applications" for relocation to Carlow through the Central Application Facility.Officials in my Department have analysed the "Two to Ten" priority applicants — those who before the 7th September 2004 deadline identified Carlow as their 2nd or subsequent choice. In addition, given that there still remains a deficit in some grades, my Department has assessed the post September 2004 CAF applicants, in line with Department of Finance policy.My Department currently has 109 Carlow-bound applicants assigned within the Department, with a further 74 Carlow-bound applicants yet to be assigned to the Department. None of the required 250 staff have been decentralised to date. It is hoped to have all decentralising posts filled in sufficient time to ensure that staff are adequately trained in advance of the move to Carlow.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	630	I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 and 117 together.I have provided funding of more than €30m to the County and City Enterprise Boards this year.  This represents an increase of nearly 8% on the allocation provided in 2005. In addition to the Exchequer funding provided, the CEBs have an increasing flow of funds available to them from repayments of refundable grants provided in earlier years.  It is estimated that some €3m has been available to the CEBs in 2006 from this source.I believe that the level of funding available to the CEBs is adequate and appropriate at this time and that it enables all CEBs to fulfil their function and their remit in maximizing entrepreneurial development in the micro-enterprise sector throughout the country. The CEBs play an extremely important role in the development of indigenous enterprise in Ireland and it is my intention that an appropriate level of financial support for all CEBs will continue to be made available.  I am confident that the level of funding available is sufficient to enable any CEB support any good quality projects that may present.In determining the allocations for individual CEBs, my Department adopts a systematic approach to ensure the maximum degree of objectivity and equity of treatment.  This approach involves the provision of funding on the basis of a standard initial allocation to each CEB as well as an additional allocation that is determined mainly by population but which also takes account of issues such as local unemployment trends, capacity to spend, existing commitments and regional spread.  Furthermore, my Department works closely with the CEBs throughout the year to ensure that the available funding is utilised to the maximum extent possible.  This can involve funds being reallocated from Boards that are not in a position to spend their full allocations to Boards that have a demand for additional funding. This exercise is taking place at present as Boards are now in a better position to determine actual requirements to year-end.

The Bill is currently with the Parliamentary Counsel's Office for drafting and I expect it to be published by the end of this year. I hope to bring the new legislation before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the first half of 2007.The proposed legislation will update the existing Control of Exports Act, which dates from 1983, and will ensure that Ireland's export controls are in line with best international practice.  In this regard, the new legislation will include, for the first time, provision for the regulation of arms brokering activities in Ireland and by Irish citizens abroad. This will enable Ireland to fulfil its obligation under the EU Common Position on Arms Brokering, which requires Member States to take all the necessary measures to control brokering activities on their territory.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	632	I propose to take Questions Nos. 98 and 120 together.The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions has not yet completed work on the "Fourth European Working Conditions Survey", referred to in the Deputies' questions. The Foundation published its "first findings" on 7th November last and the full report is due to be published in February 2007.I understand that the survey, which was conducted in 2005 covering nearly 30,000 workers in 31 countries, shows that bullying or harassment, violence or the threat of violence, and various forms of discrimination all contribute to psychological ill-health and stress. Around 5% of workers reported having experienced some form of violence, bullying or harassment in the workplace in the previous 12 month period. In general, exposure to violence and threats of violence was greater in northern Europe, with higher than average levels reported in the Netherlands(10%), France and the UK (9%) and Ireland (8%).These figures certainly give cause for concern. It would appear that an issue to be addressed is "attitude of employers to increasing workplace violence." To address this, I am advised that the National Workplace Health and Wellbeing Strategy, which is due to be published in early 2007, will recommend a more proactive role by employers in minimising the risk of violence to employees.In addition, I am also advised that the Health and Safety Authority intends to carry out  inspections in relation to violence in the healthcare sector in 2007. Already, the Authority has published general guidance on the prevention of violence at work and specific guidance on the prevention of violence in healthcare as well as  for the cash in transit industry.I look forward to publication of the full report  by the European Foundation and following its publication, I will ask the relevant agencies under the aegis of the  Department to have regard to its findings in the development and implementation of their programmes of work.Finally I might also mention that a survey completed in Ireland in 2001, and which I am now having updated by the ESRI, revealed that 7% of workers experienced bullying in the previous 6 month period.

However, I understand that a significant proportion of the requested material now being sought is incorporated in the material recently supplied to Deputy Ryan by Enterprise Ireland following the Deputy's Parliamentary Questions, numbers 406, 407 and 408, of the 17th October.I am also aware that senior Enterprise Ireland officials are to meet with Deputy Ryan on November 17th and a comprehensive briefing of Enterprise Ireland's Research and Development activities will be provided at that meeting.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	634	I propose to take Questions Nos. 100 and 154 together.As I and other Ministers have indicated to similar questions in the past, Ireland has not signed nor has it any plans to ratify the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and Members of their Families, which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 1990.  This is also the position of other Member States of the European Union.This Convention is a complex and wide ranging one, which has been examined by a number of Government Departments.  I understand that before Ireland could consider ratifying it there would need to be significant changes across a wide range of existing legislation, including employment, social welfare, education, taxation and electoral law.  Moreover, many of the issues addressed by the Convention would have a European Union dimension.  This would also complicate any proposed ratification by Ireland of it, if our European partners were to continue to refrain from ratification, as they seem likely to do.My responsibilities relate to economic migration and employment protection policies and I would emphasise that I am committed to many of the ideals and aspirations which the Convention endeavours to advance.  In particular, I am fully committed to the prevention of exploitation of migrant workers and to ensuring that all workers benefit from the full range of our employment rights protections.In this respect I would point out that this range of protections has been added to by the Employment Permits Act 2006.  The Act provides a number of new important protections for migrant workers including: the granting of the employment permit to the employee, rather than the employer; the employment permit containing a statement of the rights and entitlements of the migrant worker, including that the employee may change employment through the application for another permit by a new employer.Finally, I would also stress that the provisions of the new Social Partnership agreement "Towards 2016" contain a new employment rights compliance package for all workers, which includes new legislation as well as the establishment of a new Office for Employment Rights Compliance.

TI, which operates under the aegis of the Office for Science and Technology, is charged with ensuring coherence in activating the enterprise elements of the SSTI.The counterpart of TI in the higher education area of the SSTI is the Higher Education Research Group (HERG).  The terms of reference of HERG and its institutional membership have been agreed and it will hold its first meeting shortly.The 2007 work programme of the Advisory Committee for Science has been approved and is ongoing.A National Director for the 7th EU R&D Framework Programme has been appointed as has the network of national delegates and national focal points.  The Framework Programme was launched at national level earlier today.For the most part these might be termed the implementing structures of SSTI.  Their work programmes will address in a complementary way the realization of the objectives of the SSTI.  In addition, the InterDepartmental Committee on SSTI has been reactivated to drive all aspects of the strategy.  The InterDepartmental Committee  reports in turn to the Cabinet SubCommittee on SSTI so there is both administrative and political oversight of delivery of the different strands of the Strategy, and scope for its review on an ongoing basis.

Of these 9,139 failed to attend.  More recently, during the period January to July 2006 (the last period for which full data is available), 22,251 persons were referred to FÁS under this process.  Of these 4,590 persons on their responsibility did not attend on the scheduled date.  FÁS reports to DSFA in respect of each person referred.  Every case of failed attendance is examined by DSFA and, in these circumstances, a person's continued entitlement to welfare payment may be reviewed.The effectiveness of the National Employment Action Plan Preventive Strategy was independently reviewed last year by Indecon Economic Consultants.  The overall findings were positive and the report concluded that the NEAP had resulted in significant savings to the Exchequer and had contributed to maintaining the low level of unemployment.In response to the findings of the report the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, FÁS and the Department of Social and Family Affairs have developed and agreed an Action Plan.

Responsibility for gender equality matters generally is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.Further to the debate in the House on Parliamentary Question No. 14 of 11 October 2006, the Companies Registration Office have informed me, based on a very preliminary scan of names of company directors, that it appears that about one-third of directors of Irish registered companies are women.

Kilkenny. To date a total of 62 people (11 HSA staff, 41 Civil Servants, 10 Public Servants) have expressed an interest through the Central Application Facility (CAF) process in transferring to Thomastown.In advance of decentralising to Thomastown, in August 2006 the Authority established an interim office in Kilkenny city. Fifteen staff, including staff recruited for the REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals) strategy, have recently relocated to that office in advance of moving to Thomastown. In addition, future staff, who will be recruited for the REACH strategy, will also be based in Thomastown. All staff that move in the interim to the Kilkenny office will transfer to Thomastown when the premises there are completed.The Authority currently has approximately 110 specialist staff. 7 have applied to CAF to decentralise to Thomastown in addition to all newly recruited Dublin based Inspectors, including those recruited for REACH, referred to above, who are ultimately contracted to move to Thomastown.The Authority has been advised by OPW that as the site procurement is in the final stages, the current timeline for availability for occupancy is late 2008.

At present, all of the Department's websites and online services are available via Reach.  These services include database and register searching, downloading official forms, and document searching, downloading and browsing.  Expenditure on the integration of these specific services has been incurred by Reach, with my Department providing appropriate links and information on its electronic services.In the case of the Companies Registration Office, circa €4,000 has been spent to date on the implementation of a Business Validation Service which will be integrated with Reach. It is estimated that the full cost of this system will be in the region of €10,000.  It is not envisaged that my Department will spend any other funds on integrating services with Reach Services.My Department will continue to offer all of its electronically available services through this portal.  Should further integration be required, my Department remains committed to developing the necessary interfaces to allow this to happen.The integration of services between Reach Services and agencies under the aegis of this Department are day-to-day operational matters for the agencies concerned and not ones in which my Department has a direct function.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	640	I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 141 together.The opt out in Council Directive 93/104/EC of 23 November 1993 concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time is an opt out from the average maximum 48 hour working week.  The Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, which transposed the above Directive into Irish Law, does not contain such an opt out provision and the Government does not intend to avail of this opt out in the future.Following the European Parliament's First Reading of the draft Working Time Directive, the European Commission issued a Revised Proposal — COM (2005) 246 final  — on 31 May 2005.This Revised Proposal, which took account of some of the amendments proposed by the European Parliament, has been the subject of detailed discussion at the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council on 4 occasions in the interim, culminating in last week's Council under the current Finnish EU Presidency.The ending of the "opt-out" clause, allowing workers in some Member States to work beyond an average maximum of 48 hours per week, continues to be the main obstacle to reaching a compromise agreement that would be acceptable to all 25 Member States. At last week's Council, the UK, supported by some of the new Member States, were opposed to a definitive end date for the "opt-out" clause as proposed by France, Italy and Spain.We saw the Finnish Presidency proposal as a pragmatic and workable compromise which would have protected the health and safety of workers without compromising the competitiveness of enterprises. Despite the flexibilities on offer in the compromise, blocking minorities in opposing camps prevented agreement.Ireland will fully implement the provisions of any amending Working Time Directive, ultimately agreed by the Council and the European Parliament. Ireland does not avail of the opt out at present and does not intend to do so in the future, regardless of any opt-outs that might be offered or given.

The arrangements and timelines for shortlisting and final selection are being finalised at present by the Public Appointments Service and it is anticipated that the selection of a candidate will be made by end year at the latest.The conditions of employment for the position provide for current reduced PRSI and standard PRSI salary scales ranging from €113,070 to €129,483 and from €119,023 to €136,295 respectively. While entry will generally be at the minimum of the appropriate scale an appointee who possesses qualifications and/or experience additional to the eligibility requirements which would be of special value to the position of Director may enter the salary scale at a point above the minimum of the scale.Where the appointee is already a serving Civil Servant, the entry point will be either existing salary plus accrued increment or the minimum of the appropriate scale, whichever is the greater, subject to the maximum of the scale not being exceeded.The Scheme of Performance Related Pay which operates in respect of positions at this level within the Civil Service and other standard conditions of employment for Civil Servants will also apply to the position of Director.The total expected cost to the State in 2007 of employing the Director for Employment Rights Compliance, including employer's PRSI and other outgoings, will be approximately in the range €160,000 to €200,000.

In accordance with these procedures the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment, along with a Minister of the UK Government, is responsible for appointing the Chair of InterTradeIreland. The statutory process for appointing the Chair of the Board of InterTradeIreland is set out in the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999, as amended by the British-Irish Agreement (Amendment) Act, 2002.The Members of the Board of InterTradeIreland are also appointed in accordance with the interim Ministerial decision- making procedures. In accordance with these procedures the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment, along with a Minister of the UK Government, is responsible for appointing the Members of the Board of InterTradeIreland. The statutory process for appointing the Members of the Board of InterTradeIreland is set out in the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999, as amended by the British-Irish Agreement (Amendment) Act, 2002.Arising from the Good Friday Agreement, 1998, the British–Irish Agreement Act, 1999, established six North/South Implementation Bodies including InterTradeIreland. The Board of InterTradeIreland ordinarily consists of twelve Members, six of whom are nominated by the South and six by the North. There are currently eleven Members on the Board of InterTradeIreland. 
As a result of the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly in October 2002, the North/South Ministerial Council cannot meet. As a consequence the British-Irish Agreements have been amended. The amendments provide that during the period of suspension of the North/South Ministerial Council, the British and Irish Governments take joint decisions, when appropriate, on matters relating to InterTradeIreland and the other North/South Implementation Bodies.County Enterprise Boards (CEBs)The CEBs are established as companies in accordance with the Companies Acts.  The appointment of Chairs of the CEBs is governed by the Memorandum and Articles of Association of each Board.  At the First Meeting of the Board following each Annual General Meeting the Directors elect from amongst themselves a person, other than a Local Authority Representative, to be Chair of the Company and of the Board of Directors.  In the absence of the Chair at any meeting of the Company or the Board, the Members present shall elect from amongst themselves a person to act as Chair of that meeting. Section 10 of the Industrial Development Act, 1995 granted the CEBs formal statutory recognition. Each CEB operates as a company limited by guarantee and has its individual Memorandum and Articles of Association, Manual of Accounting Procedures and an Operating Agreement with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.The appointment of Board Members of the CEBs is also governed by the Memorandum and Articles of Association of each Board.  The Membership of each Board consists of representatives from a number of categories — local authority elected representatives, Farmers’ organisation representatives, ICTU, IBEC/CIF, the State Development Agencies and persons involved in small business, community organizations or local economic development.  Where a Member from one of the above categories ceases to be a Member of the Board, that Member shall be replaced by a new Member from the same category as the former Member.

The funding provided by Enterprise Ireland and the County and City Enterprise Boards in the form of grants, refundable aid and equity participation provides an important source of finance to many SMEs.  In addition, Enterprise Ireland actively promotes the availability of venture capital in Ireland and, earlier this year, I approved funding of €175m for venture capital that is projected to leverage venture capital funding of some €1 billion over the next decade.Furthermore, the HALO Business Angel Partnership which is managed by the Dublin Business & Innovation Centre (BIC) and supported by the Cork, Waterford and Galway BICs, is designed to encourage and facilitate the provision of informal investment in enterprises by Business Angels, typically high net worth individuals who wish to invest in early stage companies with good growth potential.  This partnership is being supported financially by Enterprise Ireland and InterTradeIreland.Finally, my Department is currently researching the possibility of the financial institutions accessing loan guarantees from the European Investment Fund that would enable them to expand their lending to small enterprises.  This initiative is being taken in response to a recommendation of the Small Business Forum earlier this year.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	644	I propose to take Questions Nos. 110, 145 and 207 together.The Groceries Order was abolished on the 20th March 2006.  Recent CSO figures show that the prices of products previously covered by the Groceries Order fell by 0.7% in the seven-month period from April to October.  However, food prices have been fluctuating during the past 12 months and while we are seeing a downward trend in some grocery prices, the Consumer Price Index also shows an increase in the price of fresh meat and fish, products which were not covered by the Groceries Order. During the same seven month period prices of products not covered by the Groceries Order rose by 1.5%.  Overall the price of Groceries Order and Non Groceries Order items decreased by 0.2% in the same period.The Order was in place for 18 years and, in that time, it fundamentally altered the structure and composition of the grocery trade.  It was abolished primarily because it allowed wholesalers and suppliers to determine minimum retail prices charged to consumers, thereby seriously constraining competition in the market.I have always maintained that we should not expect to see fundamental changes in the sector in the short term following the abolition of the Order.  This is because there are many factors which impact on prices of groceries in our shops. The lack of competition caused by the Groceries Order was only one such factor. Other factors include production costs, labour costs, interest rates, overheads, international exchange rates and so on.Having said that, some multiples are beginning to pursue competitive pricing strategies and this appears to be having a positive impact on competition in the market.  So while I believe that consumers are seeing some benefits from these price reductions, I expect that the real benefits will only be felt over time as price competition increases at retail level.Following the enactment of the legislation which abolished the Groceries Order, I asked the Competition Authority to review and monitor developments in the grocery sector in light of the new regulatory environment.  Since removal of the Order, the Competition Authority has received no complaints of anti-competitive behaviour in the sector, nor has it seen any evidence of such behaviour.  Nonetheless, the Authority's monitoring of the sector is on going but I understand they believe it is too early to reach any conclusions.In April 2007, one year's worth of post Groceries Order data will be available for analysis.   Thus by mid 2007 the Competition Authority intends to publish an analysis of developments in the sector focusing on pricing trends, market structures and barriers to entry.In addition, my own officials are keeping a close eye on developments in the grocery sector and in the past months have brought many issues to my attention, including:the strong growth showing in the convenience store market segment which comes despite predictions in some quarters of difficulties for this sector following removal of the Groceries Order,the recognition by one convenience chain that the removal of the Order has not materially affected its operations and leaves it well positioned to "challenge for further growth in the post Groceries Order market environment",monitoring of monthly CSO figures which I have referred to earlier.  The CSO has expanded it figures to include a detailed sub-index of prices of goods previously covered by the Order and those products not covered by the Order,a Report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business on the grocery trade in the UK, which my officials are examining and I will respond shortly to the Committee with views on this Report.My Department also maintains close contact with interested parties and industry stakeholders and is available to meet with such parties at any time.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	645	I have not made any representations to the European Commission in relation to the proposed acquisition of Aer Lingus by Ryanair as for the purposes of the EU Merger Regulation, the Irish Competition Authority is the competent authority responsible for regulating mergers and, accordingly, I have no function in mergers, other than media mergers.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	646	The Personal Injuries Assessment Board has received thirty six thousand cases since it was established.  I understand from the PIAB that six thousand of these were settled up-front from the outset, nine thousand cases were settled between the parties during the PIAB process, over five thousand assessments have been made, and an estimated four thousand cases are heading into litigation, although not all of these will necessarily go to a full hearing.  Of the five thousand, three hundred and nineteen assessments which have been made to 3rd November 2006, four thousand, five hundred and ten have outcomes, in other words these are cases where all parties have accepted the award or where one or more party has rejected an award (the remainder of the cases are awaiting a response from some or all of the parties).  Of these cases where the outcome is known, one thousand, six hundred and fifty eight have been rejected, representing a sixty percent acceptance rate.This leaves twelve thousand cases which are currently in the PIAB system.  Seven thousand five hundred of these are in the assessment phase, and I am assured by the PIAB that they will all be dealt with within the statutory time frames.  The balance of cases is awaiting documentation from one of the parties or a decision from the Respondent to consent to process or not.The Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 provides that the Board must ensure that assessments are made within a period of nine months beginning on the date on which it receives the respondent's consent to assessment, or in circumstances where it appears to the Board that it would not be possible or appropriate, because of the particular circumstances of the claim concerned, to make an assessment within the nine month period, the period for making an assessment may be increased to fifteen months.  I am advised by the PIAB that ninety three percent of assessments are made within the nine month period; the remaining seven percent are assessed within a further six months as allowed by the legislation (these would normally be cases where a stable medical prognosis is not available in nine months).The PIAB has assured me that it has the capacity to deal with the volumes of cases on hand and projected to come before it.  Currently seventy-two staff are employed by the Board.  This is expected to rise to eighty-five by year-end.  In addition, the Board outsources claims preparation and helpline services to a contracted service centre, which provides flexibility and the capacity to expand processing volumes quickly to meet increased demand.  Based on statistical and actuarial trends, the PIAB has projected annual volumes of cases rising to twenty five thousand per annum, forty percent of which are expected to be resolved between the parties following contact with the PIAB, twenty percent are expected to head into litigation (but not necessarily to a Court hearing), and the remaining forty percent will be assessed by the PIAB.To date the PIAB has paid legal fees in respect of judicial review of €92,913.99 in 2004, €265,542.73 in 2005 and €25,811.41 in 2006, and has paid legal fees in respect of commercial, contractual and operational advice of €64,506.97 in 2004, €141,924.36 in 2005 and €190,696.82 in 2006.  The PIAB does not make awards in respect of the legal costs incurred by the claimant and respondent in respect of claims.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	647	I would refer the Deputy to the reply I made to similar Questions put by him on 7th February, 2006.The ability of Irish companies to successfully market and sell overseas is critical for the success of the Irish economy, particularly in the rapidly evolving international marketplace. In this connection, there has been a very creditable performance recently on the part of Irish exporters in a difficult trading environment against a background of global economic slowdown and rising oil prices.  The Irish economy has absorbed the effects of the increased energy prices remarkably well and has managed to remain competitive in international markets.The latest trade figures released by the Central Statistics Office indicate that Irish merchandise exports increased by 3% for the seven-month period January-July 2006 relative to January-July 2005. This is a robust performance and well in line with our main competitors. Exports to the UK have kept pace relative to last year which is again a good performance.  Elsewhere, exports increased by 7% to the United States, by 5% to Germany and by 9% to Belgium, relative to the same period in 2005.The EU continues to increase in importance as an export market, consistently accounting for 62% of all Irish exports.  The latest CSO figures also show that, in almost all cases, exports to the ten new Member States have been increasing, with Poland showing the largest increase at+33%, or up by €50 million in value terms.Enterprise Ireland is the agency with responsibility for the development of the manufacturing and internationally traded services sector.  In 2005, Enterprise Ireland clients won 733 new customers, distributors or partners in export markets in 2005. In addition, 157 client companies established an overseas market presence during the year, 187 companies entered new export markets and 74 clients were first-time exporters.My Department and its agencies continue to encourage Irish companies to undertake increased levels of investment in research, to use more technology in product development and to encourage more innovation across all sectors of the economy. This will help firms produce improved value added products and services, and in the longer term lead to longer lasting and higher quality jobs. In order to develop fully and optimise true potential, Irish companies must also develop the capability to win international sales and establish international presence in core markets.  This of course, requires the ability to market successfully overseas.Following on from the recommendations contained in the strategy review  —  "Ahead of the Curve" — Enterprise Ireland has put in place an International Selling Programme to increase the number of sales professionals within the agency's client companies. The Programme is aimed at companies that are currently exporting and seeks to develop their current and long-term sales strategies.In addition, both myself, and my colleague, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Micheál Martin, T.D., have been active in leading trade missions, in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland, to a range of markets. Most recently, Trade Missions were led to South Africa, Canada and China, in each of which approximately 30 Irish companies participated.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	648	It is not possible to determine the number of jobs which have relocated to lower wage economies, nor can the number of posts awaiting relocation be identified. The offshoring of lower value-added functions is, however, part of the reality of modern global manufacturing for a highly developed economy such as Ireland.There are a variety of differing and complex factors which might influence a decision to relocate all or part of a firm's functions. In addition to relative wage rates and other cost factors, these may include business takeovers, consolidations and changes in product or market focus.  While offshoring can contribute to job losses for firms in some sectors, productivity gains achieved through offshoring also represents an opportunity to develop higher end manufacturing and related activities domestically.Ireland no longer operates as a low cost location for investment: our strengths and competitive advantages have changed. Our economy is now characterised by high output and productivity, together with high returns to labour in the form of wages, salaries and better living standards. Higher technology and services enterprises are replacing low technology production, which in the past was the predominant source of economic output. The fact is that since 1999 overall employment has grown by 26.9%. We now have over 2 million people in employment, with historically low levels of unemployment.My Department and the enterprise development agencies are continuing to work to ensure that Ireland remains an attractive place to do business. In that regard, we are making significant efforts to enhance our framework competitive conditions, and to promote new areas of competitive advantage, such as developing our R&D base as elaborated recently in the new Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation.  We are also continuing to pursue policies to promote lifelong learning and up-skilling to improve labour market flexibility and, where necessary, ensure that appropriate training supports are provided for workers in sectors that are no longer competitive, to help them find alternative employment.Our priority remains the creation of high quality, sustainable employment, driven by companies with higher profitability, that are more technologically advanced and prove a better fit with the competitive characteristics of our economy, and that are consequently less likely to move on the basis of simple cost influences.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	649	Open and fair competition is one of the central keys to a successful economy.  A visible effect of competition is that companies that compete to win business and to increase market share will reduce prices, provide enhanced service and variety, and generally become more responsive to the needs of consumers. Another benefit of competition, and the one that is less visible, is the fact that competition drives companies to cut their costs and find more efficient and productive ways of doing business.The promotion of competition in the economy requires an effective legal framework.  Strong competition legislation contributes to our competitiveness by penalising anti-competitive and anti-consumer behaviour, and by protecting the competitive process in all sectors of the economy.  The 2002 Competition Act consolidated, reformed and modernised previous legislation relating to competition policy and merger control and the Irish Competition Authority is one of the most empowered, pro-active and successful enforcement agencies of competition law in Europe.The Government also recognises that restrictions on competition arising from regulation can impose substantial costs on the economy and have adverse effects on the international competitiveness of Irish business.  In this regard the Government is committed to addressing sectors where barriers to entry or restrictive practices exist.  Our commitment to better regulation stems from the recognition that if State regulation is excessive in quantity, or is of poor quality, then it will be an unnecessary burden on economic and social activity. By minimizing regulatory barriers, we can make it easier for entrepreneurs to avail of business opportunities and to enter markets, and we can achieve greater efficiency and choice for consumers.Strong competition legislation is only one regime within which businesses operate. The Government has stepped in as needed in order to develop effective regulatory structures and practices in areas of regulatory failure.  In the Company Law area the government has taken several initiatives to improve the regulatory infrastructure, by, for example, setting up the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority. In both cases, existing regulatory structures were not working or not working well enough. Reform was necessary.  And reform has been accomplished.  Business regulation in the field of company law feeds into improvements to our national competitiveness, through high standards of corporate governance and brings about a stable and predictable environment in which entrepreneurs can establish businesses, investors can invest, creditors can lend and the interests of the employees, consumers and other stakeholders are protected.  Low standards of corporate governance cause serious damage, not just to the immediate victims of the misconduct — the investors, creditors, employees and pensioners of scandal hit companies, but to confidence in the operation of markets and with follow-on damage to whole economies.Commercial regulatory regimes are just one part of the picture.  The Government is very conscious of the need to control costs in order to maintain competitiveness. As part of the new Social Partnership agreement, Towards 2016, the Anti-Inflation Group has been re-activated to help exert downward pressure on inflation.  Forfás, under the aegis of my Department, have published research such as the Statement on Prices and Costs, and are due to publish further work in this area over the coming weeks.  Many other factors influence the cost of doing business in Ireland, for example the cost of energy. Energy costs are predominantly a global issue, as they are driven primarily by oil prices. The development agencies under my Department are monitoring the issue of energy costs and the impact of such costs on the overall competitiveness of companies.To the extent that a regulatory change is identified as being necessary to foster competition, to improve competitiveness and reduce cost bases, such change will be considered and effected if warranted.

Work has already begun on the preparation of this legislation which will also address a number of other commitments provided for under "Towards 2016", the new Social Partnership Agreement.A Working Group on Compliance, which was established in the context of social partnership negotiations, and which comprised representatives of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs, reported in March, 2006 on the potential for co-operation and collaboration between the three organisations and the legislative changes which would be required to facilitate joint investigations. This report will inform the legislation now under preparation.Finally, "Towards 2016" also provides for the deployment of the Labour Inspectorate on a regionalised basis. Proposals in this regard are being prepared at present and will be finalised following the appointment of the Director of the Office for Employment Rights Compliance. The proposed regionalisation of the Inspectorate will facilitate enhanced liaison with local and regional offices of both the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs and support the effective and efficient working of the proposed Joint Investigation Units.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	651	I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 127  together.On the 26th of April 2006, the Labour Court made a recommendation regarding the redundancy terms for Irish Sugar workers at the Mallow plant.  The recommendation provided that redundancy should be 5 weeks' pay per year of service, where a week's pay would be defined as actual finishing salary, excluding overtime, plus statutory redundancy entitlement, plus a bonus payment for an orderly wind-down.  The Court issued two clarifications in May, but these failed to achieve a resolution to the dispute.The Labour Court invited the parties to return to the Court with a view to resolving the dispute. However, the company rejected the Court's invitation. I very much regret the decision taken by the company in this regard.The Labour Court issued a third clarification of its Recommendation on the 17th of October 2006. The company has indicated that it is not prepared to alter its offer.  Similarly, the trade unions have not changed their position and are not prepared to accept the company's existing offer.My colleague, Minister Micheál Martin, has met with representatives of both the trade unions and the company and urged them to resolve their differences and to avail of the dispute settling machinery of the State, as necessary.  I have also met with union representatives to discuss this matter. The National Implementation Body has also worked with the parties concerned to seek to identify an agreed procedure to resolve the issue in dispute.Ireland's system of industrial relations is, essentially, voluntary in nature and responsibility for the resolution of industrial disputes is a matter for the parties involved.  The system of industrial relations in Ireland is designed to help and support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences, rather than imposing a solution on the parties to an industrial dispute.Where the Labour Court operates as an industrial relations tribunal in trade disputes, its recommendations are not enforceable.  In such cases, the Court hears both sides and then issues a recommendation setting out its opinion on the dispute and the terms on which it considers the dispute should be settled.  While these recommendations are not binding on the parties concerned, the parties are expected to give serious consideration to the Court's recommendation.  As the Labour Court is a Court of last resort in the industrial relations process, it is expected that the parties come to the process in good faith and, consequently, are prepared to accept the outcome of the process, namely, the Labour Court recommendation.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	652	I understand that a scheme supporting "Young Innovative Companies" has been in operation in France since 2004. While I am not aware of a specific EU Programme or proposals for a new type of company under the general title mentioned by the Deputy there are a range of initiatives proposed under the Commission's Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme 2007-2013, which includes a module for early stage financing for SMEs. The Programme overall will operate under the auspices of the European Commission and will take effect from 2007. I understand that funding for innovative companies, such as high potential start-ups (already eligible for funding under Enterprise Ireland Programmes) or the type of company supported by the French initiative, may be made available through financial intermediaries such as banks which may compete for funding schemes operated on behalf of the Commission by the European Investment Fund (EIF). The EIF operates under the aegis of the European Investment Bank.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	653	Under the merger provisions of the Competition Act, 2002, proposed mergers require regulatory clearance from the Competition Authority.  I have no role in this process, other than in the case of "media mergers".Following the announcement from the Competition Authority that it had incorrectly calculated the legal deadline before which it was required to issue a determination under the mergers provisions of the Competition Act, officials in my Department entered into correspondence with the Authority's Chairperson, Mr. William Prasikfa.  I am satisfied with the explanation offered by the Chairperson and I continue to have the utmost respect for and confidence in Mr. Prasikfa and the Authority itself.  The Authority has informed my Department of the various reviews it has carried out on foot of the error and of the measures it has put in place to ensure such an error will not happen again.The Authority Chairperson appeared before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise and Small Business on 25 October 2006 and he has offered a full explanation and apology to that Committee.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	654	International oil and gas prices are the main drivers of electricity prices in the country. We are price takers when it comes to buying fuel for electricity generation and are subject to the same fossil fuel cost pressures experienced by SMEs in other economies. In addition, economic expansion and a growing population makes it imperative that our generating and electricity network is both modernised and strengthened to meet the growth requirements of the economy. €2.8 billion is being invested in network improvements that will provide Ireland with one of the most modern and reliable electricity distribution systems in Europe. These costs are reflected in the prices all users pay for their electricity.Despite increases in international energy prices that have seen oil rise in price from around $20 a barrel five years ago to today's $60 level, the economy has proved resilient. Economic growth was over 5% last year and is expected to be over 5% again this year. At the same time manufacturing employment, a sector exposed to international cost pressures and comprising many SMEs, has been expanding for the first time in many years. The latest CSO manufacturing employment data shows that jobs in the sector grew by 5,200 in the year to last June.The enterprise agencies under my Department have very active programmes to help companies become more competitive and productive across all aspects of their operations. The agencies also monitor the effect of costs on business. In addition Forfás has recently undertaken a comparative study of the Costs of Doing Business in Ireland.Enterprise Ireland's range of supports to help indigenous SMEs are making a big difference to the efficiency and productivity of its client base. For example the impressive €1.275 billion increase in new exports recorded by EI's clients last year is real evidence how our broader enterprise policy is helping SMEs.The recently published Green Paper on Energy identifies many of the key issues and challenges which we face in energy policy and among many other issues, proposes a target of 20% improvement in energy efficiency by 2020. This Green Paper consultative process provides a framework through which any necessary decisions or reform will be made including those impacting in the medium and long term on cost competitiveness, sustainability and security of supply.Finally, sustainable Energy Ireland vigorously promotes and advises on energy efficiency through a range of programmes and is eager to provide its knowledge on energy conservation and cost control to the SME sector.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	655	The Deputy will be aware that I published the general scheme of the legislation to establish the new National Consumer Agency in August this year. Since then my Department has been working in close co-operation with the Attorney General's office in relation to the legal drafting of the Bill.  It is my intention that the Bill will be published before the end of the year and that it will be debated in the Oireachtas early in the new year. Accordingly I expect the Agency to be operating on a statutory basis during the first half of 2007.Notwithstanding that the Agency is not yet established on a statutory basis, the NCA has been operating on an interim basis since June 2005. In that time the Agency has been very active in articulating the consumer's case and in promoting greater awareness of consumers' rights. A total of €3m has been allocated in my Department's vote to support the activities of the Agency in 2006 and the recruitment of 7 additional staff has been sanctioned to assist the Agency in this regard. I am satisfied that these additional resources will help to ensure that the Interim Agency can continue to forcefully advocate the consumer's cause until the statutory Agency assumes its full remit.With regard to Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, the Bill will provide for the transfer of the Director's functions to the new Agency. The financial resources of the Director's office, which are provided from the vote of my Department, will also be redirected to the NCA. In terms of the existing ODCA personnel, it is envisaged that these staff, who are employees of my Department, will be assigned to the new Agency when it is established. The Bill will allow that, for a period of two years after the establishment of the NCA, ODCA staff can seek to transfer their employment to the new Agency if they so wish. Alternatively during that period staff can opt to return to the Civil Service. Additional staffing resources for the Agency, over and above those approved for the ODCA, will be the subject of discussions with the Minister for Finance.

Section 34 of the Competition Act, 2002 requires the Authority to enter into formal co-operation agreements with the regulators and I can confirm that such agreements are in place.  The Authority currently has agreements with the following bodies:Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI)Commission for Electricity Regulation (CER)Commission for Aviation regulation (CAR)Director of Telecommunications Regulation (COMREG)Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs (ODCA)Health Insurance Authority (HIA).The purpose of these agreements is to ensure the efficient use of resources and to improve co-operation and co-ordination of work between the Authority and the various bodies in the performance of their respective functions in so far as they relate to issues of competition between undertakings.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	657	Between 16th to 19th October, 2006, in my capacity as Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment, I paid an official visit Canada at the head of an Enterprise Ireland-sponsored Trade Mission.The main purpose of the Trade Mission was to promote Ireland as a source of world-class products and services in Canada, and also to highlight the growing economic links between the two countries. At company-specific level, it had the objective of raising the profile of selected clients and enhancing their relationship with local customers. Canada is a well-developed market of 32 million people, offering significant opportunities for increased sales growth for Irish exporters. It is the 7th largest economy in the world, is English speaking, has no trade barriers and offers a low cost gateway to the North American market place. As such, it offers unique opportunities for Irish exporters seeking to create new markets for their products.A total of 32 companies participated on the Trade Mission, 23 of which were from the Republic and 9 from Northern Ireland. The companies involved on the Mission were representative of all sectors, including software and services, industrial, healthcare and consumer products. The Trade Mission played an important role in introducing these Irish companies to exporting opportunities in Canada, and in raising the awareness of Ireland among the Canadian business community.  In this, it will also be greatly assisted by the opening of Enterprise Ireland's Toronto office, which took place during the course of my official visit.In terms of the objectives set out for the visit, the Trade Mission was deemed a great success. During the Mission, contracts were signed between Irish suppliers and Canadian customers, totalling €32 million.  In addition, another Irish company signed an investment contract worth €7 million.  Over 500 meetings were held between the Irish participants and  potential and existing customers.During the course of the Trade Mission, I addressed two major business networking events in Toronto and Montreal, which were organised by Enterprise Ireland and at which approximately 400 people attended. During the opening ceremony for Enterprise Ireland's new office in Toronto, at which I officiated, separate contracts were signed by several Irish companies.In all, a total of 11 signing ceremonies were organised for companies throughout the locations visited. In addition, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between BioLink Canada and the MaRS organisation on Biotechnology, and a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between Enterprise Ireland and the National Research Council of Canada, (IRAP) on mutual cooperation and development in the area of Technology Transfer between Irish and Canadian SME companies.The cost of the Trade Mission was approximately €110,000 — this included flights and logistical activity support to achieve Mission objectives, including evening networking receptions and dinners. The cost also included related activities such as signage, local fees, including local transport and hotel costs.During my visit, I separately met Ms Sandra Pupatello, the Minister for Economic Trade and Development in the Ontario Government, Mr. Maxime Bernier, Minster for Industry in the Canadian Federal Government and Mr. Gary Lunn, Minister of Natural Resources in the Canadian Federal Government.  We discussed a range of political issues and measures to strengthen the trade and economic links between Ireland and Canada.I want to pay a warm tribute to my own officials and the staff of Enterprise Ireland for their hard work and dedication over the three days of the trade mission which took in engagements in the cities of Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	658	I propose to take Questions Nos. 130 and 144 together.I am aware of recent media publicity concerning the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  The PIAB has received thirty six thousand cases since it was established.  I understand from the Board that six thousand of these were settled up-front from the outset, nine thousand cases were settled between the parties during the PIAB process, over five thousand assessments have been made, and an estimated four thousand cases are heading into litigation, although not all of these will necessarily go to a full hearing.This leaves twelve thousand cases which are currently in the PIAB system.  Seven thousand five hundred of these are in the assessment phase, and I am assured by the PIAB that they will all be dealt with within the statutory time frames.  The balance of cases is awaiting documentation from one of the parties or a decision from the Respondent to consent to process or not.The Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 provides that the Board must ensure that assessments are made within a period of nine months beginning on the date on which it receives the respondent's consent to assessment, or in circumstances where it appears to the Board that it would not be possible or appropriate, because of the particular circumstances of the claim concerned, to make an assessment within the nine month period, the period for making an assessment may be increased to fifteen months.  I am advised by the PIAB that ninety three percent of assessments are made within the nine month period; the remaining seven percent are assessed within a further six months as allowed by the legislation (these would normally be cases where a stable medical prognosis is not available in nine months).The PIAB has assured me that it has the capacity to deal with the volumes of cases on hand and projected to come before it.  Currently seventy-two staff are employed by the Board.  This is expected to rise to eighty-five by year-end.  In addition, the Board outsources claims preparation and helpline services to a contracted service centre, which provides flexibility and the capacity to expand processing volumes quickly to meet increased demand.  Based on statistical and actuarial trends, the PIAB has projected annual volumes of cases rising to twenty five thousand per annum, forty percent of which are expected to be resolved between the parties following contact with the PIAB, twenty percent are expected to head into litigation (but not necessarily to a Court hearing), and the remaining forty percent will be assessed by the PIAB.The success of the PIAB represents a good news story for consumers who can now have their claims processed much more quickly, and will receive the same level of awards as made in the Courts without the trauma of litigation.  The average time which it takes PIAB to assess cases is 7.2 months from the date of consent.  Under the previous litigation based system cases took 3-4 years to be settled.  Ninety three percent of PIAB cases are assessed within nine months, the remaining seven percent are assessed within a further six months as allowed by the legislation (these are cases where a stable medical prognosis is not available in 9 months).  In addition, a large number of cases have been removed from the Courts system, freeing up the Courts to deal with other matters.As is the case with all agencies under my remit, my Department is in regular communication with the PIAB, and continually reviews with it the effectiveness of its operations.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	659	I propose to take Questions Nos. 131, 138 and 150 together.I announced on 24th October 2006 that the Government had decided to continue to require that nationals of Romania and Bulgaria apply for work permits in order to participate in the Irish labour market, on these countries' accession to the EU on 1st January 2007, but that preference would be given to them over nationals of non-European Economic Area countries.These arrangements will be kept under on-going review and will be assessed comprehensively before 1st January 2009, when the second phase of the transitional period will commence.I also indicated on that occasion that the Government was informed in its decision by the very significant inflow of labour migrants Ireland had experienced since May 2004, when nationals of the EU 10 Member States were allowed to participate in the Irish labour market without work permits.  The views of IBEC and ICTU were sought and received in writing and the position of other Member States on the issue were also taken into account. The Government felt that on this occasion, it was appropriate to take stock, be cautious and concentrate on addressing the integration needs of those who had already come to live and work in Ireland.As regards the possibility of employment in the black economy and of exploitation, my Department is, as part of the Towards 2016 Agreement, putting in place a range of employment rights compliance and enforcement measures to combat these.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	660	I propose to take Questions Nos. 132 and 133 together.The Employment Equality Act 1998 as amended by the Equality Act 2004 places an obligation on all employers in Ireland to prevent harassment in the workplace.  The administration of this legislation is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and, more particularly, the Equality Authority. Persons who consider themselves to be the victims of harassment may bring a claim to the Equality Tribunal.The responsibilities of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment relate to compliance with employment rights legislation.  I am, nevertheless, aware of the ESRI Report on Migrants' Experience of Racism and Discrimination in Ireland. The Report describes the subjective experiences of racism, discrimination and exploitation in respect of a random sample of employment permit holders and asylum seekers. I understand that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has already stated, in response to the publication of the ESRI Report, that his Department is developing integration strategies through the National Action Plan Against Racism and the existing equality framework with a view to combating racism and creating an intercultural society through interaction, equality of opportunity, tolerance and respect.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	661	The latest position regarding this matter is that my Department is examining the issues involved in conjunction with the Department of Finance.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	662	In the national partnership agreement, Towards 2016, ICTU and IBEC agreed to make a joint recommendation to Government by 1 September, 2006 on a new minimum wage rate to be effective from 1 January, 2007.  In the event that no agreement was reached, either party could refer the matter to the Labour Court.As no agreement was reached between ICTU and IBEC, ICTU has referred the matter to the Labour Court asking that the Court examine the national minimum wage and make a recommendation to me on the matter.  In accordance with the terms of the National Minimum Wage Act, 2000, the Court is currently engaging in a consultation process as part of its examination of the application.As provided for in the minimum wage legislation, the Labour Court must consult with such persons, including representatives of employers and employees in the private and public sector, as it thinks appropriate in undertaking its examination of the minimum wage.  If the Labour Court is satisfied that general agreement is reached between the parties as to an appropriate minimum wage, it will recommend the rate agreed.If, on the other hand, agreement is not reached between the parties, the Labour Court may still make a recommendation on a new rate but in doing so the Court shall have regard to the movement of earnings of employees, relevant exchange rate movement and the likely impact on employment, unemployment, inflation and national competitiveness.The Act requires that, before declaring a new minimum wage rate, I must take into account the impact the proposed rate may have on employment, the overall economic conditions in the State and national competitiveness.

In that regard, the Commission made application to the European Court of Justice on 15th April 2005 against Ireland under Article 226 of the EC Treaty.  A decision in this case is expected very shortly.  The drafting of legislation to give statutory effect to a public lending scheme is currently in preparation and my intention is to have legislation, dealing with the issue of public lending, published by year end 2006.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	667	As the Agenda for the Council has not yet been agreed by COREPER, I am not in a position to give details of the content of the Agenda. However, it is expected that the Competitiveness Council meeting scheduled for Council of 4th and 5th December 2006 will deal with policy areas such as competitiveness, innovation and better regulation. In addition, it is likely that the Council is expected to discuss a number of legislative items.I have not sought to have any specific items raised on the Agenda. However, I will be making my views known on the individual agenda items as appropriate and in accordance with Ireland's interests.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	668	The Science, Technology and Innovation Strategy outlines (Paragraph 7.6.2) the four priority areas identified for collaborative research and consequential knowledge transfer between Ireland, Northern Ireland and the United States: Nanotechnology; Sensors; Cystic Fibrosis; Diabetes.  Respiratory Disorders have been suggested as an additional area for collaborative research.Knowledge transfer is the process of engaging, for mutual benefit, in the generation, acquisition, application and making accessible of knowledge to enhance material, human, social or environmental well-being.  Knowledge transfer for commercial benefit represents a specific sub-set of this broader concept. The  immediate challenge in enhancing the capacity for knowledge transfer within the US/Ireland Partnership is to stimulate capabilities, infrastructure and relationships with the objective of identifying, developing  and executing joint research projects of interest in all three jurisdictions.This initial phase of cooperation is being facilitated, for example, through dedicated workshops for experts and institutions (nanotechnology, cystic fibrosis) to identify the likely themes and areas of mutual, complementary interest for projects, the identification of Principal Investigators or lead scientists interested in such collaboration (diabetes), and the mapping of R&D activities underway on the island (sensors).The intention is these connections and developing communities of knowledge will facilitate the emergence of trilateral research teams to prepare integrated research proposals and compete for funding in appropriate competitions agreed by the three jurisdictions.  Part of the infrastructure development is to establish clarity about the terms and processes of such competitions and work is also in train towards this end.This ongoing structured approach will, in time, lead to realisation of the deeper aspects of knowledge transfer, including commercialisation.

The cost to the State of the six case-studies of individual firms, on attitudes to regulations affecting them, will be €14,520, inclusive of VAT.  The case studies involved single interviews with representatives of the companies designed to elicit broad perceptions about regulatory impact.The second study is a pilot study on how the "Standard Cost Model" (a method of costing the administrative cost of complying with regulations) could operate. The consultants are conducting a detailed study into two regulatory requirements ie the annual return to the Companies Registration Office and Unit Price Labelling.  The cost of the pilot study has been agreed at €151,719 including VAT.  A maximum of €7,000 may be added to cover expenses.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	670	The information contained in this OECD report is based on 2003 data.  The situation has changed significantly since then.  However, I agree that the training of those in employment is crucial to competitiveness.  The fact that the majority of the 2020 workforce are already working reinforces the need to upskill and progressively develop the competencies of those in employment.A recent report of the National Competitiveness Council also indicates that, while Ireland is close to OECD averages in terms of labour market training, there is a need to focus more on the training needs of those in employment.  Investing in lifelong learning for those in employment has to encompass the respective roles of employers, individuals and the State.  The primary responsibility for training workers rests with employers and individuals themselves. However the State supports training for particular groups where necessary, especially for the low skilled and more disadvantaged in the labour market.The importance of training the existing workforce will be reflected in a national skills strategy that is being prepared by my Department.  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs is finalising research to inform this work.  The conclusions of that research will shortly be available.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	671	I have read — and I would like to say with a great deal of interest — the recent report on research done by Dr. Collette Darcy of the National University of Ireland, Galway and Dr. Thomas Garavan from the University of Limerick, which provides an insight into employees' experience of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.The Tribunal is an independent statutory body which is required to adjudicate on a range of issues and grievances which could broadly be regarded as coming within the sphere of industrial relations.  The current membership of the Tribunal comprises a legally qualified chairperson, 31 vice chairpersons with legal qualifications and a total of 72 members whose numbers are equally representative of employers and trade unions.The research finds that about 95% of the Tribunal's workload is concerned with unfair dismissal cases.  The research also bears out representations which I have received about the perception that the Tribunal's proceedings are becoming ever more legalistic in nature, and not, as envisaged, a place where the ordinary person could turn when faced with a perceived injustice where they could have their voice heard in an informal and relaxed setting.I am particularly taken aback at the view which has emerged from the report that there is a difference in compensation awarded to those who had legal representation and those who did not.  Even though the researchers state in their report that they did not set out to capture information regarding respondents' representation, I am concerned that there would be a perception out there that either the Tribunal's proceedings or its findings would be dependent on legal representation.I intend to ask the Tribunal for its formal response to the research, before deciding what action may be appropriate.

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	673	The current Chief Executive of the Health and Safety Authority was originally appointed by the Board of the Authority for a 5-year term.  When that term expired on 16th September 2006, he was offered and accepted a further 1 year contract.The appointment of a Chief Executive is a matter for the  Board of the Health and Safety Authority in accordance with the provisions of Section 39 and Schedule 6 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005. I understand that the Chairman of the Board consulted with the Chief Executive before his reappointment and I have given my consent to the reappointment in accordance with the 2005 Act.I also understand that the Board has decided, with the agreement of the Chief Executive to terminate his employment contract. The Board will immediately be putting arrangements and procedures in place to recruit and appoint a new Chief Executive of the Authority.I want to pay tribute to the Chief Executive for his contribution to the safety, health and welfare of the workforce of the country and his outstanding service as a public servant. The Department will make every effort to ensure that all contractual and financial obligations are honoured.I am also quite satisfied that the independence and integrity of the Health and Safety Authority remains at the very highest level and is not compromised by the departure of the Chief Executive.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	674	I would like to refer the Deputy to the following Schedule which contains the prosecution and conviction information requested from 2002 to 30 October 2006.  A significant change has taken place over the years in the nature of the court proceedings resulting from investigations by the Health and Safety Authority. In the first decade of the Authority's existence (1989-1999) all health and safety prosecutions were heard in the District Court.In recent years the Authority undertook a review and upgrade of its criminal investigation procedures with a view to sending files to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration for trial on indictment.No data is available on the numbers of investigations by the Authority where alleged breaches of the legislation were encountered by the Authority's Inspectors but which did not proceed to a prosecution.  In many of these cases the Inspectors would have exercised their discretion under the Safety, Health and Welfare legislation to issue prohibition or improvement notices.  However, in general terms, files will only be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions where, on the basis of the evidence collected during an investigation, there is prima facie evidence of the commission of an offence.YearType of ProceedingsTotal Heard% of total Cases heard summarily and on indictmentDismissals etc.Convictions (%)Probation of Offenders Act appliedFines

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	675	On the 13th September 2006 Enterprise Ireland (EI) signed the lease for a single site Dublin office in the East Point Business Park.  The agency plans to have completed the move to the new office by the end of December 2007.  Currently, Enterprise Ireland occupies four office locations in Dublin, primarily as a result of the amalgamation of various state agencies over a number of years into a single organisation to support indigenous enterprise. The lease on two of these buildings will expire in Quarter 4 2008 necessitating the move to a single site. The East Point building will accommodate all of EI's currently Dublin based staff of approximately 600.From an operational perspective, occupying four separate locations in Dublin was sub-optimal especially for an Agency mandated to provide a range of services and expertise across several critical business functions in a holistic fashion. Crucially, having all Dublin based Agency staff in one location will enable Enterprise Ireland to further deliver on one of its most important new initiatives, the creation of integrated teams of staff with complementary expertise to service client companies.  Locating Dublin based staff in a single location will significantly increase the level of collaboration within the organisation which will enable Enterprise Ireland to deliver a more effective service to client companies.To facilitate moving to one Enterprise Ireland office in Dublin, EI has taken a normal commercial 25 year lease on two office units in East Point. The lease has in-built break clauses and a clause to enable the Agency to sub-let space, if required, to meet its on-going accommodation needs. The break clauses demonstrate the fact that EI remains focused on delivering on the Government's decision to relocate 300 EI staff to Shannon.Enterprise Ireland, working closely with the Office of Public Works (OPW), has identified, but not yet acquired, a preferred site for the construction of a new HQ building in Shannon.  The preferred site is a 13-acre site owned by Shannon Development.  In co-operation with Shannon Development and the OPW, the site was valued and a feasibility study carried out.  It is not possible, at this stage, to say with certainty when the full move of Enterprise Ireland's HQ will take place.  Influencing factors regarding the timing of the move to Shannon include the level of interest in the Shannon location expressed by CAF applicants and suitable transfer arrangements being established.  In the interim, Enterprise Ireland is to relocate its Regional Development Headquarter activities to Shannon. These activities will include the existing Shannon Development activities relating to indigenous enterprises and support functions and the new Enterprise Ireland County Enterprise Board Co-ordination Unit.Also, from January 2007, Enterprise Ireland will be responsible for the development of indigenous industry in the Mid West Region. This will involve the transfer of a number of Shannon Development staff to Enterprise Ireland. EI plans to establish interim office accommodation in the region, to accommodate both the Shannon Development staff and EI HQ staff, by mid 2007. Between the EI staff moving to Shannon and the transfer of Shannon Development staff to EI, there will be approximately 70 EI staff located in Shannon by mid-2007.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	676	The food processing sector is Ireland's single largest indigenous industry.  It plays a critical role in the continued growth and success of the Irish economy, contributing an annual output in excess of €18 billion, and direct employment of 54,000.  Job losses have been experienced in the food sector in recent times due to a variety of circumstances, including the availability of lower cost imports from third countries. However, despite operating and trading in a very competitive global economy, the Irish food and drinks processing sector continues to exhibit steady growth.  In 2005 the sector achieved export sales of €7 billion.  Irish food manufacturers are continuing to expand their operations, and invest in research and development and world-class production facilities, in order to remain competitive on the global market.  The recent announcement of an investment of €180m by Irish speciality foods company Cuisine de France, is a case in point.  The investment will lead to the creation of a 42,600-sq.m purpose built centre of excellence, incorporating an R&D centre and state of the art food manufacturing facility.  The facility will lead to the creation of 130 new jobs, 5 of which are specific to Research and Development.Enterprise Ireland is focused on helping to develop world-class companies by increasing competitiveness through increased productivity and innovation.   Particular emphasis is being placed on growing and emerging sectors such as functional foods, ready meals, indulgence or luxury products, as well as products designed to satisfy the health and well-being agenda.  Continuous innovation and investment in R&D is directly contributing to export growth in the food sector. The announcement in 2005 of plans to develop facilities such as the Glanbia Group's innovation centre in Kilkenny, as well as the Dairygold Co-operative Society's applied food sciences R&D centre in Mitchelstown, and the announcement this year by Dawn Farm Foods to establish a state of the art meat science centre in Naas, are indicative of the strides being made to establish Ireland to the forefront of food research and innovation.Earlier this year my colleague Ms Mary Coughlan T.D., Minister for Agriculture and Food, announced a development fund for the dairy sector. The fund is designed to improve efficiency and add value to the dairy industry and will help to further develop a modern, competitive, innovative and market-focused food sector in Ireland. The investment will include some €100 million of Government grant assistance. This scheme will be managed by Enterprise Ireland.  Enterprise Ireland will continue to actively encourage its client companies in the food sector to innovate, grow and engage in export markets through a range of support programmes.  Enterprise Ireland, together with organisations such as Bord Bia and BIM, will work to help ensure continuing gains in productivity, competitiveness, innovation, sales and exports in the food sector.

The HSA allocation for 2007 has not yet been published.  The Authority currently has a sanctioned staff complement of 185 comprised of inspectors, professional specialists, administrators and clerical support staff.   Included in the 185 sanctioned posts are 21 for the proposed new EU Regulation on Chemicals (REACH).  The Authority has 110 inspectors involved in the inspection and enforcement function.  I am confident that the Authority has adequate resources to fulfil its programme of work.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	678	The administration and evaluation of Enterprise Ireland's productivity improvement fund is a day to day matter for the agency itself, and not one in which I am directly involved.  The productivity improvement fund (PIF) was launched in May 2005.  The initiative is primarily aimed at encouraging client companies, of both Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development, to undertake investments in capital equipment, technology acquisition and training projects.  It is envisaged that productivity improvement projects, approved under this fund, will assist recipient companies in increasing exports, or establishing a base from which they can develop their exports.Since the productivity improvement fund was launched in May 2005, 147 companies have been approved funding totalling €29.178m.  In 2005, 39 companies were approved funding totalling €8.533m.  In 2006, to date, 108 companies were approved funding totalling €20.645m.  The €29 million approved by the fund has resulted in leveraging investments of €55 million from companies, bringing the total projected spend by companies to circa €84million.  Under the PIF scheme, companies have two years from the date of initial letter of offer, to start drawing down the grant. Since the launch of the scheme, 21 companies have had payments made to them, these payments amounted to €1.660m.  The following table outlines payments and approvals made to companies under the scheme in 2005 and 2006.  The companies who have been approved funding to date have committed to undertaking projects that will be implemented over a two year period.

My Department has only a medium sized canteen in Davitt House and a very small canteen in Kildare Street.  As already indicated in replies to recent questions on this matter, the tea, coffee, sugar and other products served in those two canteens are not confined to Fair Trade products.  However, I can confirm that both canteens have introduced Fair Trade products for sale or are in the process of doing so.  I have again asked that consideration be given to the enhanced sale of Fair Trade tea, coffee, sugar and other products in my Department's two small canteens.As regards the agencies under the control of my Department, you may wish to know that last June my Department wrote to all of the agencies involved drawing attention to this issue and asking, on my behalf, that consideration be given to the enhanced sale of Fair Trade products in the canteens, cafeterias or restaurants of those agencies.  The replies received by my Department indicate support for this initiative and the majority of the agencies involved have indicated that they have introduced Fair Trade tea, coffee, sugar and other products for sale in these canteens, cafeterias or restaurants or are in the process of doing so.

EU Council Regulation (EC) No. 2200/2004 introduced a system of prior surveillance import licensing on imports of certain textiles and clothing originating in the Peoples Republic of China.  This Regulation took effect on 1 January 2005 and ran until 31 December 2005.  On 1 February 2005, in accordance with EU Commission Regulation (EC) No. 117/2005, a system of prior surveillance import licensing was introduced on imports of certain footwear originating in the Peoples Republic of China.  This system was applicable until 31 January 2006.Both of these Regulations were in force throughout 2005.  Their expiry in December 2005 and January 2006 accounts for the decrease in the number of import licences issued in the current year.

Ireland is in breach of the above Directive by virtue of the rulings of the European Court of Justice in the SIMAP and Jaeger cases which determined that "working time" includes time spent "on call" at the place of employment including, the rest time element of such "on call" time.  The definition of "working time" in the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, which transposed the above Directive into Irish law, does not provide that time spent "on call" in the place of employment is "working time".The SIMAP and Jaeger rulings also determined that when an employee does not receive the 11 consecutive hours daily rest and 35 consecutive hours weekly rest stipulated in both the above Directive and in the 1997 Act, that equivalent "compensatory rest" should be provided immediately after the end of the working period.  Ireland is out of line with this ruling in the sense that the relevant legislation provides for the granting of equivalent compensatory rest in an "adjacent time frame".  However, given the political sensitivity of the Directive for Member States, particularly in relation to the provision of health care services, it is not yet clear as to how the EU Commission might approach Infringement Proceedings should they choose pursue this option.

The number of Labour Inspectors under this Office will be progressively increased from 31 to 90 by end-2007, as part of the initiative to increase the staffing resources of the Employment Rights Bodies generally.My Department is in consultation with the Department of Finance in relation to the filling of the new Labour Inspector positions.

This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,060 (or 19%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The induction of 280 new Garda recruits to the Garda College on 6 November, 2006 has resulted in a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,137. The Garda Budget now stands at €1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.I have been further informed that the personnel strength (all ranks) of Ballinrobe Garda Station as at 31 December, 1997 and 14 November, 2006 was 7 and 9, respectively, representing an increase of 2 in the number of personnel allocated to the Station during that period.Garda management state that every effort is made to fill vacancies that have arisen as a result of promotions/retirements during each allocation of newly promoted/attested Garda personnel.Garda management further state that the situation will be kept under review and the needs of Ballinrobe Garda Station will be fully considered within the context of the overall needs of Garda Stations throughout the country.I should add that it is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs.  Garda management state that such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.

Castleconnell Garda Station forms part of the Henry Street Garda District. The personnel strength (all ranks) of Henry Street Garda District as at 31 December, 1997 was 204 and the comparable strength of that District today, 15 November, 2006, is 280.

These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs.  Garda management state that such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.I have also been informed that Castleconnell Garda Station is open to the public from 10am to 1pm, Monday to Saturday. Local Garda Management do not view the extension of the opening hours at Castleconnell Garda Station as an effective way of improving the overall policing service in the Sub-District. In this regard, Garda management state that the extension of the openings hours at Castleconnell Garda Station would necessitate the employment of additional personnel on indoor administrative duties who may be more effectively employed on outdoor policing duties.

Resident in this context means residence for which the applicant had the permission of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and where such permission was not granted for the purposes of study or seeking asylum.  Generally speaking, reckonable residence is calculated from stamps in applicants' passports and from Departmental and Garda records.On examination of the individual's application for a certificate of naturalisation, it was determined that he did not have five year's residence at the time of lodging his application, having gaps in his residency for the period November 2001 to December 2002 and for the month of November 2004.  Consequently, he did not have the necessary reckonable residence in order to qualify for naturalisation.  A letter to this effect first issued to him on 19 April 2005 and was the subject of some communication between the applicant and staff in the Citizenship Division of my Department.I have noted the Deputy's letter of 1 September 2006 in which he submits copies of work permits on behalf of the person in question which cover the gaps in residency.  The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, as amended, is quite specific as to how residency is reckoned for the purposes of naturalisation and while the work permits demonstrate that the person in question was authorised to work in the State during this time, the fact remains that he resided here without the necessary permission.The onus is on the individual who requires permission to remain in the State to keep this permission up-to-date at all times. It will be open to the person in question to submit a fresh application once he satisfies the statutory conditions applicable at that time.

In the circumstances, it is not the intention of the Revenue Commissioners to look for temporary accommodation in Newcastle West.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	695	Under Section 664 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, there is an exemption from income tax in respect of the first €12,000 of annual leasing income where the leasing is for a period of not less than 5 years and in respect of €15,000 where the leasing is for a period of not less than 7 years. The exemptions are available to lessors of agricultural land aged 40 years or over or to those who are permanently incapacitated by mental or physical infirmity from carrying on farming. In Budget 2006  I announced an increase in the annual exemption limits from €7,500 to €12,000 for leases between 5 and 7 years duration and from €10,000 to €15,000 for leases of 7 or more years duration. In addition, in order to provide for situations where land is leased along with entitlement to EU Single Farm Payments, I also announced that rental income arising from such entitlements would qualify for the relief with effect from 1 January 2005. These improvements were provided for in section 12 of the Finance Act 2006.These tax exemptions apply only in respect of leases to qualifying lessees. In this context, "qualifying lessee" specifically excludes from the scope of the relief any leases made between closely connected relatives. A person is connected with an individual if that person is the individual's husband or wife, or is a relative, or the husband or wife of a relative of the individual or of the individual's husband or wife. A relative in this context is defined as meaning brother, sister, ancestor or lineal descendant.This restriction covering leasing to closely connected relatives is a standard anti-avoidance measure and such measures are common throughout the tax code.  It should also be noted that there are already very generous stamp duty and capital acquisitions tax reliefs available in the case of permanent transfers of land between family members, such as  by gift or sale. For all these reasons, there are no proposals to provide an exemption from income tax for rental income from farm land leases entered into between related persons.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	704	I propose to take Questions Nos. 186 and 187 together.As the Deputy is aware, a review of tertiary paediatric services undertaken by McKinsey & Company on behalf of the Health Service Executive (HSE) advised that:The population and projected demands in this country can support only one world class tertiary paediatric hospital;It should be in Dublin, and should ideally be co-located with a leading adult academic hospital (i.e. should be within a practical walking distance of such a hospital); andIt should also provide all the secondary (i.e. less complex) hospital needs of children in the Greater Dublin areaThese secondary services should be supported by strategically-located Urgent Care Centres.When the report was published, each of the Dublin paediatric hospitals (including The Adelaide and Meath Hospital, incorporating the National Children's Hospital) expressed strong support for the development of a single paediatric hospital, and emphasized the need for early decisions in relation to its location.  Paediatric Consultants expressed their willingness to move to the new hospital regardless of its location.Following extensive examination, discussion and consultation, a joint HSE/Department of Health and Children Task Group recommended that the new national tertiary paediatric hospital should be built on a site to be made available by the Mater Hospital.  This recommendation was accepted by the Board of the HSE and was subsequently endorsed by the Government at its meeting on 8th June.  The Government mandated the HSE to move forward with the development of the new hospital and its associated urgent care centres.The Taoiseach, the Minister and the Chief Executive Officer of the HSE met with representatives of Tallaght Hospital, including Archbishop Eames, in June to discuss a number of issues, including the implications for the National Children's Hospital of the Government decision to endorse the development of a single national tertiary paediatric hospital at the Mater Hospital.  In a letter to the Archbishop following the meeting, the Taoiseach gave an assurance that the Government wishes to see Tallaght Hospital thrive on a sustainable basis as a particular focal point for the involvement of the minority tradition in the healthcare system and as a key health provider to an expanding local population.A joint HSE/Department of Health and Children Transition Group has been established to advance the development of the national tertiary paediatric hospital.  Among the key items to be addressed are the definition of a high level framework brief for the new hospital and the determination of the range of services and location of the associated urgent care centres.  The Group will have consultations with relevant stakeholders, which will include representatives of the National Children's Hospital at Tallaght.To date, no decision has been taken in relation to the range of services to be provided at the National Children's Hospital at Tallaght in the context of the development of the national paediatric hospital and the associated urgent care centres.  I understand that the Transition Group is in the process of contracting external assistance in relation to the preparation of the high level framework brief for the new hospital, including operational policies for the proposed urgent care centres.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	709	A review of tertiary paediatric services carried out by McKinsey & Co. on behalf of the Health Service Executive recommended the establishment of a single tertiary paediatric hospital in Dublin, co-located with a leading adult academic hospital.  Subsequently, a joint HSE/Department of Health and Children Task Group was established to advise on the optimum location of the proposed new hospital.The Task Group's report was submitted to the Board of the HSE on 1st June last, and its recommendation that the new paediatric hospital be developed as an independent hospital on a site to be made available by the Mater Hospital was endorsed by the Board.  At its meeting on 8th June, the Government also strongly endorsed the recommendation.I am satisfied that the Task Group undertook a rigorous and robust examination of the key issues in arriving at its recommendation.  The Group consulted widely with international experts in arriving at its recommendation, and gave in-depth consideration to the key issues of access, governance, clinical values and site suitability.A joint HSE/Department of Health and Children Transition Group has been established to advance the development of the new Hospital.  Among the key items to be addressed are the definition of a high level framework brief for the new Hospital and the determination of the scope and location of the Urgent Care Centres.I recently met with representatives from Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children and was told that the hospital has commissioned its own report on the issues relating to the location of the National Paediatric Hospital.  I understand that the joint Transition Group received a copy of the report and that a meeting between the Group and the Crumlin representatives has taken place.I understand that the Joint Transition Group is in the process of contracting external assistance in relation to the development of a high level framework brief for the new hospital, and that the tender documentation for the contract specifically requires the report commissioned by Our Lady's Hospital to be taken into consideration in the preparation of the brief.

Planning permission for the development of the Fishery Harbour Centre was received in late 2005.The cost of providing the new harbour facility is estimated at between €50 and €60 million depending on final scheme selection and tendering.  In 2006, €300,000 is provided for further design and €300,000 for site investigation to progress the development.  The project is currently at detailed design stage.  The final Phase 3 marine site investigation commenced in July this year and is approximately 50% complete to date.  The remainder of the site investigation will be completed during Spring/Summer 2007.  A contract has been awarded for hydrographic survey work, which is likely to be completed by the end of 2006, subject to weather.  Tender documents are currently being prepared for a Cost Benefit Analysis.A decision on funding of this project will be made in due course in accordance with the guidelines for Appraisal and Management of Capital Expenditure Proposals in the Public Sector, taking into account the amount of funding made available for fishery harbours, with particular reference to the National Development Plan 2007–2013 and overall national priorities.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	714	I propose to take Questions Nos. 197 and 198 together.The Government is deeply concerned by the situation in the Occupied Territories, and especially by the rising toll of death and destruction in Gaza. I have unreservedly condemned the deaths of 18 civilians, including women and children, in the shelling of Beit Hanoun by the Israeli Defence Forces on 8 November. I have called very clearly for an immediate end to all violence. This includes the Israeli military operation in Gaza and the firing of rockets on Israel from Palestinian Territory.The meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Brussels on 13 November strongly deplored the Israeli military action in Gaza and the unacceptable military operation in Beit Hanoun. The Council emphasised that any military action should not be disproportionate or in contradiction to international humanitarian law. The Government and our EU partners have regularly reminded all parties of their obligation to protect civilian lives. We have stated clearly that Israel has a legitimate right to defend itself against attack, but not at the expense of the lives and welfare of innocent civilians.The violence of recent months, in the Occupied Territories, Israel and Lebanon, underlines the urgent need to revive a credible peace process in the Middle East. There can be no military or unilateral solutions to the Israeli — Palestinian conflict. The Government has been active in direct contact with the parties, with our partners in the EU, and at the United Nations in arguing strongly that the only way forward for the Israeli and the Palestinian people is the negotiation of a viable two-State solution. The EU strongly supports the continuing efforts of President Mahmoud Abbas to negotiate the formation of a Palestinian national unity government. The Council on 13 November stated that a government with a platform reflecting the Quartet principles and allowing for early engagement would be a partner for the international community in re-launching the peace process.The Government and our EU partners will remain actively engaged in the search for a lasting, peaceful and just settlement. The immediate priority must be to relieve the humanitarian situation in Gaza and the West Bank. The EU, and Ireland bilaterally, have significantly increased assistance to the Palestinian people this year, and we have called for the immediate resumption by Israel of withheld tax and customs revenues. We also continue to seek the release of the captured Israeli soldier and of Palestinian legislators detained in Israel, and the re-opening of the Gaza crossing points.It is essential that all parties demonstrate urgently that they are ready to act on their obligations under the Quartet Roadmap, and under international law. The Council has consistently called on Israel to desist from any actions that threaten the viability of an agreed two-State solution. Of particular concern are the continued expansion of settlements, the demolition of Palestinian homes and the construction of the separation barrier on occupied territory. The EU has also made it clear that it will not recognise any changes to the pre-1967 borders other than those agreed by the parties.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	715	At the present time, an employee is entitled to receive a statutory redundancy lump sum on being made redundant up to the day before his/her 66th birthday.Traditionally, the upper age limit for eligibility for redundancy payment was the same as the pensionable age within the meaning of the Social Welfare Acts. In 1971 the upper age limit was 70, in line with the then old age pension age of 70. This was revised downwards by the Redundancy Payments Act 1979 to 66 years, which was the new pensionable age set out in the Social Welfare Act.The Redundancy Review Group Report of July 2002, which produced recommendations for the up-dating of statutory redundancy Legislation, considered that increasing the upper age limit of 66 for redundancy qualification purposes would not be a priority in the short term if resources were scarce.The Group recognized however that the labour force is becoming older and that participation in the labour force by older people (if desired) should be facilitated. Accordingly it was recommended that consideration should be given in the medium term to removing the age cap or raising the age cap in conjunction with similar changes to Unfair Dismissals, Equality and Social and Family Legislation as recommended by the Equality Authority.On 18th July, 2004, the upper age limit of 66 for bringing claims under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2001, was removed by the Equality Act 2004.However, the Unfair Dismissals Acts will not apply to dismissed employees who, at the date of dismissal, had reached the normal retirement age in that employment, i.e if it is the policy in an employment to retire employees at a certain age, then the new provisions would not apply.The removal of the age cap of 66 for statutory redundancy is being considered in the context of new legislation which is being prepared to give effect to certain commitments in relation to exceptional collective redundancies and Unfair Dismissals arising from "Towards 2016".
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	716	The Business Regulation Forum was established by me in November 2005 and has met ten times to date. Its Terms of Reference are to advise the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on any changes necessary to ensure that existing or proposed regulations, impacting on business, meet the criteria set out in the White Paper "Regulating Better".The Forum has initiated a number of actions, as follows, designed to give "hard intelligence" about regulations affecting the business sector, the perceptions of the sector and the burdens imposed:The Forum is examining 40 submissions that it received in response to a public call.A consultant was been contracted to map the main regulations that impinge on six selected companies.A pilot study has been commissioned to measure the administrative cost to business of providing the annual return to the Companies Registration Office and of legislation regarding labelling.I understand that the Forum intends to issue a progress report to me before the end of 2006 based on their consideration of the activities outlined above.In addition to the work of the Business Regulation Forum my Department, as well as other relevant Departments and Agencies, is following up on the recommendations of the Small Business Forum, which included measures to address the administrative burden on small business.  In this regard legislation is currently before the Oireachtas, to raise the audit exemption thresholds applying to small companies in respect to turnover and balance sheet to €7.3m and €3.65m. respectively. The existing thresholds are €1.5 and €1.9 million respectively.  This will remove the compulsory annual audit costs from the very large number of companies qualifying from the enhanced exemption level.The Company Law Review Group (CLRG) has almost finalised its work on the preparation of the General Scheme of the Heads of the Companies Consolidation and Reform Bill and I understand that it expects to report on its recommendations shortly.  The Bill will introduce a greatly simplified legal framework for corporate activity.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	717	The Personal Injuries Assessment Board has received thirty six thousand cases since it was established.  I understand from the PIAB that six thousand of these were settled up-front from the outset, nine thousand cases were settled between the parties during the PIAB process, over five thousand assessments have been made, and an estimated four thousand cases are heading into litigation, although not all of these will necessarily go to a full hearing.  Of the five thousand, three hundred and nineteen assessments which have been made to 3rd November 2006, four thousand, five hundred and ten have outcomes, in other words these are cases where all parties have accepted the award or where one or more party has rejected an award (the remainder of the cases are awaiting a response from some or all of the parties).  Of these cases where the outcome is known, one thousand, six hundred and fifty eight have been rejected, representing a sixty percent acceptance rate.This leaves twelve thousand cases which are currently in the PIAB system.  Seven thousand five hundred of these are in the assessment phase, and I am assured by the PIAB that they will all be dealt with within the statutory time frames.  The balance of cases is awaiting documentation from one of the parties or a decision from the Respondent to consent to process or not.The Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 provides that the Board must ensure that assessments are made within a period of nine months beginning on the date on which it receives the respondent's consent to assessment, or in circumstances where it appears to the Board that it would not be possible or appropriate, because of the particular circumstances of the claim concerned, to make an assessment within the nine month period, the period for making an assessment may be increased to fifteen months.  I am advised by the PIAB that ninety three percent of assessments are made within the nine month period; the remaining seven percent are assessed within a further six months as allowed by the legislation (these would normally be cases where a stable medical prognosis is not available in nine months).The PIAB has assured me that it has the capacity to deal with the volumes of cases on hand and projected to come before it.  Currently seventy-two staff are employed by the Board.  This is expected to rise to eighty-five by year-end.  In addition, the Board outsources claims preparation and helpline services to a contracted service centre, which provides flexibility and the capacity to expand processing volumes quickly to meet increased demand.  Based on statistical and actuarial trends, the PIAB has projected annual volumes of cases rising to twenty five thousand per annum, forty percent of which are expected to be resolved between the parties following contact with the PIAB, twenty percent are expected to head into litigation (but not necessarily to a Court hearing), and the remaining forty percent will be assessed by the PIAB.To date the PIAB has paid legal fees in respect of judicial review of €92,913.99 in 2004, €265,542.73 in 2005 and €25,811.41 in 2006, and has paid legal fees in respect of commercial, contractual and operational advice of €64,506.97 in 2004, €141,924.36 in 2005 and €190,696.82 in 2006.  The PIAB does not make awards in respect of the legal costs incurred by the claimant and respondent in respect of claims.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	718	The retail sector forms a key part of the Irish economy both in terms of the people it employs directly and the jobs it provides in the associated manufacturing, supply and distribution sectors.  The retail sector is very important to the Irish consumer and, indeed, the consumer is vital to the retail sector.This Government sees competition as the life-blood of a vibrant economy and we are committed to removing unwarranted constraints on competition in all sectors of the economy and placing the consumer at the top of the policy agenda.  Consumers and businesses alike, regardless of size, benefit from the protection of Competition law.  Competition law prohibits two types of behaviour:collusion which has the object or effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition, andabuse of a dominant position.Irish competition law is currently governed by the Competition Act 2002 and the Competition (Amendment) Act 2006 and is enforced by the Competition Authority which is an independent statutory body.While some operators in the retail sector might feel uneasy about the additional competition generated by the multiples, I am pleased to see that many small players have faced up to this competition by investing further in their operations and by opening more new stores.I have no plans to introduce a regulator to represent the interests of small independent businesses as I believe our current level of competition legislation and regulatory regime is more than adequate to foster a competitive economy where both small and large business can operate.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	719	The issue of job creation is a day-to-day operational matter for the industrial development agencies and relevant County Enterprise Boards, and not one in which I have a direct role.IDA Ireland informs me that it continues to market South County Dublin, including Tallaght and its environs, as a potential location for new foreign direct investment (FDI), in order to secure new investment and additional jobs for the region.IDA Ireland's strategy for the Dublin area is to attract and expand major FDI projects.  South County Dublin is well equipped to compete with other areas for potential foreign direct investment, with superb infrastructural facilities at Citywest and Grangecastle, and a third level Institute of Technology at Tallaght.Sectors such as pharmaceuticals, provide high value employment.  The pharmaceutical company Wyeth Biopharma has established the world's largest biopharma campus facility in Grangecastle, with an investment of €1.8 billion.  The company currently employs 1,100 highly skilled people.  Wyeth continues to recruit and will eventually employ 1,300 at the facility. Grangecastle is within easy commuting distance of Tallaght.Last year the Japanese pharmaceuticals company Takeda Pharma Ireland Ltd completed construction of its facility at Grangecastle.  This is a significant and important investment from a leading company in Japan, and will highlight Ireland as a key location for other Japanese investors in the future.  The project will create approximately 60 high quality jobs upon completion.Enterprise Ireland (EI) encourages and supports companies adopting new technologies, which will add value to their products and services and help them to compete on world markets. Since the beginning of 2003 Enterprise Ireland has approved over €9.8m and made payments of over €7.7m in support of development projects for indigenous companies in South County Dublin.EI is also actively involved with the provision of infrastructure to facilitate business development and employment, and has provided funding for the development of Community Enterprise Centres in South Dublin such as Brookfield, Bolbrook and Killinarden. These centres provide incubation space for start-ups and micro enterprises, and also provide ancillary services such as training, mentoring and customised courses to address the needs of the local clients.Also EI supports the development of business incubation workspace as part of its on-going commitment to fostering links between Colleges and industry, and has provided €2.54m towards the development of incubation space at the Tallaght Institute of Technology.  It is anticipated that graduates from the college or members of research teams based in the college will be to the forefront in using the centre, and in creating new jobs, particularly in the high tech sectors.The South Dublin County Enterprise Board is pro-actively involved in the development of indigenous enterprise, and provides a source of support for small businesses in the region, including the Tallaght area.  To date in 2006, South Dublin CEB has paid out circa €400,000 in grant assistance to businesses based in South Dublin.  These grants and other related financial supports have assisted in the creation of 56 jobs in the region.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	720	I would like to refer the Deputy to the following Schedule which sets out the fatality numbers and rates per 100,000 workers in the periods referred to.Over the period 1990-1995, there was an average fatality rate in the sector of 11.5 per 100,000 workers.  By comparison, the rate was 8.6 per 100,000 workers for 2000-2005.A specific breakdown for employment in the Construction Sector is not available before 1994 and, accordingly, an estimated figure of 90,000 is used for those years.  In respect of non-fatal accidents in the construction sector only limited data is available.The numbers of non-fatal accidents (resulting in injury requiring more than three days absence from work) reported to the Health and Safety Authority for each of the years 2003, 2004 and 2005 were 1,117, 1,514 and 1,677 respectively. The level of accidents reported to the Health and Safety Authority, however, only shows part of the picture. For example, the Central Statistics Office Quarterly National Household Survey for 2003 and 2004 shows non-fatal occupational accident numbers of 5,300 and 5,820 respectively.Taking account of a construction workforce of 200,600 in 2003 and 227,400 in 2004, the respective non-fatal accident rates per 100,000 workers were 26.2 in 2003 and 25.0 in 2004.  These figures are contained in the Summary of Fatality, Injury and Illness Statistics 2004-2005 published by the Health & Safety Authority earlier this year.The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 1995 were introduced, inter alia, to transpose into Irish law Directive 92/57/EEC relating to temporary or mobile construction sites. Those Regulations represented the first change to Construction Safety Regulations in 20 years and shifted the emphasis onto those who procure, design and manage construction for the first time.Through the recommendations of the tripartite Construction Safety Partnership, the 1995 Regulations were replaced by the updated Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2001 and amendment Regulations 2003.Following further detailed examination by the Health and Safety Authority, including wide-ranging consultation with relevant interests, I signed the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 504 of 2006) during September and they came into operation on 6 November 2006.The new Regulations will build on design and management requirements introduced in earlier regulations and also on the duties related to construction work set out in section 17 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005.Modern contractual arrangements have informed the regulations for Clients and Project Supervisors.  Timelines are now set out for Project Supervisors to be in place.  Phase-in provisions are provided for projects in motion before the regulations took effect on Nov. 6th.  Safety Advisers must now be in place during construction where more than 100 people are at work on site.  This provides an additional level of supervision for large, potentially complex projects.Other new additions for Contractors include requirements for the use of Explosives and for Road works.  Visibility aids will also be required for vehicles on-site, by May 6th 2008 for existing plant and by May 6th 2007 for new plant.  These upgrades arise from research, which shows an increase in vehicle related accidents as the industry becomes more mechanised.  The range of Construction Skills Certification Schemes is also extended to include additional courses such as signing and lighting at roadworks. This new extended range of courses will be available 18 months after the Regulations came into effect.Regulations 80 to 123 of the 2001 Regulations relating to lifting appliances and lifting equipment remain in operation for the time being until they are replaced by proposed separate Regulations.As recognised in my Department's Regulatory Impact Analysis on the 2006 Regulations, this latest phase of legislative action in this area is a further development arising from the tripartite Construction Safety Partnership with an emphasis on client and management issues.  The 1995 Regulations and the substantive amendments in 2001 and 2006 put in place a regime where all construction and civil engineering projects must be planned, managed and carried out in a safe manner. There have been significant improvements in health and safety performance in a number of areas since 1995, particularly in the area of falls from a height, where a steady reduction in associated deaths has occurred.199019911992199319941995Construction Sector Total71210111013No. employed in sector (Q4)90,000*90,000*90,000*90,000*91,50096,600Fatality Rate per 100,000 workers7.813.311.112.210.913.5*Estimated.200020012002200320042005Construction Sector Total172221201623Construction Workers141821161521No. employed in sector (Q4)178,100185,400191,300200,600227,400253,200Fatality Rate per 100,000 workers7.99.711.08.06.68.3

This strategy will address the effectiveness of employment and vocational training programmes, and will involve developing supports to the open market employment of disabled people in both the private and public sectors for this category of workers.In 2006 the total budget provision for FÁS vocational training and employment services amounts to almost €68 million, including a budget of over €47 million for specialist training providers.As at end October, 2006 the numbers of disabled people in FÁS programmes were as follows:Specialist Training Providers1,336Community Employment4,996Supported Employment2,000Wage Subsidy Scheme288Total8,620Responsibility for rehabilitative training and sheltered workshops falls within the remit of the Department of Health and Children.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	722	The tabular statement shows the number of new full time jobs created in enterprise agency assisted companies by broad economic sector over the period 1999 to 2005, as well as the number of job losses (full time) over the same period. In addition the statement also shows the most recent CSO data showing total numbers in employment at Quarter 2 of each year by sector.  Comparable data for the period 1979-1985 is not available.In terms of the wider economy, the CSO data indicates that there are an additional 428,000 people in employment at quarter 2 2006 compared with the same quarter in 1999. The major increase in jobs growth over the period has occurred in the Services sector. In this Ireland follows the trend of the employment growth in services evident across most developed countries.  An additional 120,000 or so are employed in Construction Industry while the numbers employed in Financial and Other Business Services has increased by 78,000. Irish employment growth in services outperforms that of most competitor countries and indeed this country has become one of the leading world exporters of services.Over the same period approximately 127,000 jobs have been created in manufacturing by agency-assisted firms.  While some 140,000 jobs were lost in the sector over the same period, it should be noted that many of these losses were in areas of low cost manufacturing. The new jobs created in the enterprise development agencies' client companies in the last number of years are mainly concentrated in high-value added, knowledge-based companies, which offer greater security in the face of intense international competition.Ireland no longer operates as a low cost location for investment: our strengths and competitive advantages have changed. Our economy is now characterised by high output and productivity, together with high returns to labour in the form of wages, salaries and better living standards.Our priority remains the creation of high quality, sustainable employment, driven by companies with higher profitability, that are more technologically advanced and prove a better fit with the competitive characteristics of our economy, and that are consequently less likely to move on the basis of simple cost influences. In that regard, we are making significant efforts to enhance our framework competitive conditions, and to promote new areas of competitive advantage, such as developing our R&D base as elaborated recently in the new Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation.  We are also continuing to pursue policies to promote lifelong learning and upskilling to improve labour market flexibility and, where necessary, ensure that appropriate training supports are provided for workers in sectors that are no longer competitive, to help them upskill and if necessary find alternative employment.1999200020012002200320042005TotalsAll Sectors37,68544,60430,07626,56223,66126,03826,553215,179Manufacturing23,14526,10317,67715,64914,74814,79015,063127,175Financial Services2,2732,3541,4632,1681,2192,3381,67713,492International Services11,14615,0209,8807,3836,5587,8928,55466,433Other Services1,1211,1271,0561,3621,1361,0181,2598,0791999200020012002200320042005TotalsAll Sectors-21,315-20,812-33,359-35,342-31,567-27,133-24,174-193,702Manufacturing-17,771-16,089-25,136-24,740-22,455-18,349-15,913-140,453Financial Services-275-442-1,036-1,022-1,035-686-910-5,406International Services-2,506-3,609-6,507-8,422-7,145-7,103-6,643-41,935Other-763-672-680-1,158-932-995-708-5,908Source: Forfás Business Information System.1999 Q22000 Q22001 Q22002 Q22003 Q22004 Q22005 Q22006 Q299 V 2006% ChangeAll Economic Sectors1589.11671.41721.91763.91793.41836.21929.22017427.926.9A-B Agriculture, Forestry & Fishing137.3132.9122.5124116.6117113.7114.5-22.8-16.6C-E Other Production Industries307.7309.5318.1305306.1300.6294.2288.5-19.2-6.2F Construction142.1166.2180182.2191.4206242.4262.7120.684.9G Wholesale and Retail Trade222.5235.2247.8246.8251.6260.2266.9284.461.927.8H Hotels and Restaurants102108.1103.8104.2114.4107.8111116.314.314.0I Transport, Storage and Communication96.2101.3111.1111.7112.1113.2118.2120.724.525.5J-K Financial & Other Business Services194.6210.8217.1228.9227.1237257.1267.372.737.4L Public Adminstration & Defence74.578.481.390.692.489.598.2105.130.641.1M Education100.6102.8103.8111.3116.1117.9123.1135.63534.8N Health120.3133144159.3169.9177188201.280.967.2O-Q Other Services91.493.392.499.895.7110116.4120.629.231.9Source: CSO Database Direct.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	723	The following is a list of all employee protection legislation enacted by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment over the past seven years and the main provisions of each piece of legislation:  Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Night Work and Shift Work) Regulations 2000 — S. I. No. 11 of 2000.  The purpose of these Regulations is to give effect, in respect of night workers and shift workers, to the safety and health protection provisions of Article 9 of EU Directive 93/104/EC of 23 November 1993 concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time. Inter alia they require employers, who employ night workers, to carry out — for the purposes of the maximum hours of night working permitted under sections 16(2)(a) and 16(2)(b) of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 (i.e., the Act by which the main provisions of the Directive have been implemented domestically) — an assessment of the health and safety risks attaching to the work of night workers whom they employ with a view to determining whether that work involves special hazards or a heavy physical or mental strain. They also require employers, whose night workers become ill or exhibit symptoms of ill-health as a result of performing night work, to re-assign such workers to day work suited to them whenever possible.These Regulations also revoke and replace the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Night Work and Shift Work) Regulations 1998 (S.I. No. 485 of 1998).  Their purpose is to avoid possible confusion as regards the application of the provisions of Regulation 6 of S.I. No. 485 of 1998 to night workers (Regulation 7 of these Regulations refers).  The Regulations do not involve new obligations or conditions not intended in the 1998 Regulations.Organisation of Working Time (Records) (Prescribed Form and Exemptions) Regulations 2001-S.I. No. 473 of 2001.  The main purpose of these Regulations is to require employers, pursuant to the Organisation of Working Time Act,1997, to keep: (a) a record of the number of hours worked by employees (excluding meals and rest breaks) on a daily and weekly basis; (b) a record of leave granted to employees in each week by way of annual leave or in respect of a public holiday and payment made in respect of that leave; (c) a weekly record of the notification of the starting and finishing times of employees.The Regulations also require that an employer keep a copy of the statement provided to each employee under the provisions of the Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994.   The Regulations also provide for exemptions subject to certain conditions, in relation to the keeping by employers of records of rest breaks and rest periods of employees under the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.Organisation of Working Time (National Day of Mourning) Regulations 2001 — S.I. No. 419 of 2001.

No. 817 of 2004.  These Regulations transpose the provisions of Council Directive 2000/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 2000 concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time in relation to transport workers other than (a) workers performing mobile road transport activities as provided for in Directive 2002/15/EC and (b) mobile staff in civil aviation as defined in the Annex to Council Directive 2000/79/EC of 27 November 2000.  The effect of the transposition of Directive 2000/34/EC is to apply the maximum average working week of 48 hours to mobile and non-mobile transport workers covered by that Directive.In addition, these Regulations prescribe that persons employed in the activities specified in Regulations 6 and 8 of these Regulations shall be exempt from the application of sections 11, 12 and 13 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 which deal respectively with daily rest, rests and intervals at work and weekly rest, subject to being granted adequate rest or equivalent compensatory rest. Such persons shall also be exempt from the application of section 16 of that Act which deals with nightly working hours.Organisation of Working Time (Inclusion of Offshore Work) Regulations 2004. These Regulations transpose the provisions of Council Directive 2000/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 2000 concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time in relation to offshore work which means work performed mainly on, or from, offshore installations (including drilling rigs), directly or indirectly in connection with the exploration, extraction or exploitation of mineral resources, including hydrocarbons, and diving in connection with such activities, whether performed from offshore installations or a vessel.  The effect of the transposition of directive 2000/34/EC is to apply the maximum average working week of 48 hours to offshore workers covered by the Directive.In addition these Regulations exempt employees engaged in offshore work from sections 11, 12, 13 and 16 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 which deal respectively with daily rest, rests and intervals at work, weekly rest, and maximum nightly working hours.European Communities (Safeguarding of Employees' Rights on Transfer of Undertakings) (Amendment) Regulations 2000 (S.I. No. 487 of 2000).  These Regulations were revoked and replaced by S.I. No. 131 of 2003 as follows: European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003 (S.I. No. 131 of 2003).  These Regulations protect the rights of employees arising from an employment contract in the event of a transfer of a business or part of a business, in which they are employed, which entails a change of employer.Carer's Leave Act 2001.  This Act provides for the temporary absence from employment of employees for the purpose of the provision of full-time care and attention to a person requiring it and to protect the employment rights of those employees during such absence.Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001.  This Act introduced procedures for resolving industrial disputes in situations where it is not the practice of an employer to engage in collective bargaining negotiations and where the internal dispute resolution procedures (if any) normally used by the parties concerned failed to resolve the dispute.  The Act was introduced in conjunction with S.I. No. 76 of 2004 — Code of Practice on Voluntary Dispute Resolution.Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004.  This Act enhanced the effectiveness of dispute resolution procedures put in place by the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001.  The Bill also introduced a prohibition on victimisation of employees who are members of a union, managers discharging their managerial functions and other employees in the context of a dispute where collective bargaining arrangements are not in place and to provide for a procedure to deal with complaints of victimisation.  The Act was introduced in conjunction with S.I. No. 76 of 2004 — an enhanced Code of Practice on Voluntary Dispute Resolution and in conjunction with S.I. No. 139 of 2004 — Code of Practice on Victimisation.S.I. No. 8 of 2006 — Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice on Access to Part-Time Working) (Declaration) Order 2006.  The introduction of a Code of Practice on access to part-time working accords with the principle of minimising the potential for indirect discrimination in relation to part-time working and introduces positive measures to eliminate obstacles and barriers and encourage greater participation in employment on a number of grounds, as set down in the Employment Equality Acts 1998-2004.S.I. No. 139 of 2004 — Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice on Victimisation) (Declaration) Order 2004.  This code of practice provides for a procedure to deal with a complaint of victimisation of an employee, as defined in the Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004.S.I. No. 76 of 2004 — Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice on Voluntary Dispute Resolution) (Declaration) Order 2004.  This is an enhanced Code of Practice on Voluntary Dispute Resolution and replaces the Code of Practice on Voluntary Dispute Resolution that was introduced in the year 2000.  It introduces time scales to the procedure for the resolution of industrial disputes in situations where it is not the practice of an employer to engage in collective bargaining and it was introduced in conjunction with the Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004.S.I. No. 17 of 2002 — Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice detailing Procedures for Addressing Bullying in the Workplace) (Declaration) Order 2002.   This code of practice acts as a guide for employers, employees and their representatives on effective procedures for addressing allegations of workplace bullying by setting out a formal and informal procedure for addressing such grievances.S.I. No. 146 of 2000 — Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice on Grievance and Disciplinary Procedures) (Declaration) Order 2000.  This assists in the resolution of disputes relating to grievance or disciplinary matters by setting out guidelines on the application of grievance and disciplinary procedures and the promotion of best practice in giving effect to such procedures.S.I. No 145 of 2000 — Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice on Voluntary Dispute Resolution) (Declaration) Order 2000.  This sets out the voluntary procedure for the resolution of disputes in situations where collective bargaining did not take place. Was replaced in 2004.National Minimum Wage Act 2000.  This Act introduced a National Minimum Wage for the first time in Ireland.  Low paid workers benefited from its introduction, particularly women, young people and part-time workers.National Minimum Wage Act 2000 (National Minimum Hourly Rate of Pay) Order 2000.  This Order sets the national minimum hourly rate of pay at £4.40 and also sets out the monetary allowances for (i) full board and lodgings, (ii) full board only and (iii) lodgings only, which may be included by an employer in calculating the national minimum hourly rate of pay of an employee, not exceeding those specified in the Order.National Minimum Wage Act 2000 (Commencement) Order 2000.  This Order appoints the 1st day of April, 2000 as the day on which the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 comes into operation.National Minimum Wage Act 2000 (Prescribed Courses of Study or Training) Regulations 2000.   This Order prescribes the criteria a course of study or training must satisfy in order that an employee undergoing such a course and who is aged 18 or over, shall be paid in accordance with section 16(1) of the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.National Minimum Wage Act 2000 (National Minimum Hourly Rate of Pay) (No. 2) Order 2000.

This Order sets out the Code of Practice detailing procedures for addressing bullying in the workplace.Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act 2001.  This Act provides that a part-time employee shall not be treated less favourably than a comparable full-time employee in respect of conditions of employment including pay and pensions. In order to invoke the anti-discrimination provisions in the Act, the part-time employee must find a full-time comparator with (a) the same or associated employer or, (b) where (a) does not apply, as specified in a collective agreement or, (c) where neither (a) nor (b) applies, in the same sector or industry. In the case of (a) and (c) above, the part-time employee and the comparable full-time employee, must perform the same work or similar work or work of greater or equal value.The only way the employer could avoid granting the part-time employee equal terms with the full-time employee in the above circumstances, would be, if he or she had objective grounds for treating the part-time employee less favourably than the comparable full-time employee.Under the 2001 Act, a ground shall not be regarded as an objective ground for the purposes of the Act, unless it is based on considerations other than the status of the employee concerned as a fixed-term employee, and the less favourable treatment which it involves for that employee, is for the purpose of achieving a legitimate objective of the employer, and such treatment is appropriate and necessary for that purpose.Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work Act) 2003.  This Act  provides that a fixed-term employee shall not be treated less favourably than a comparable permanent employee in respect of conditions of employment including pay and pensions. In  order to invoke the anti-discrimination provisions in the Act, the fixed-term employee must find a permanent comparator with (a) the same or associated employer or, (b) where (a) does not apply, as specified in a collective agreement or, (c) where neither (a) nor (b) applies, in the same sector or industry. In the case of (a) and (c) above, the fixed-term employee and the comparable permanent employee, must perform the same work or similar work or work of greater or equal value.The only way the employer could avoid granting the fixed-term employee equal terms with the permanent employee in the above circumstances or granting a service related benefit in the above circumstances, would be, if he or she had objective grounds for treating the fixed-term employee less favourably than the comparable permanent employee.Under the 2003 Act, a ground shall not be regarded as an objective ground for the purposes of the Act, unless it is based on considerations other than the status of the employee concerned as a fixed-term employee, and the less favourable treatment which it involves for that employee, is for the purpose of achieving a legitimate objective of the employer, and such treatment is appropriate and necessary for that purpose.The Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 also provides in relation to an employee who enters on a fixed-term contract of employment before the commencement of the Act — on 14 July 2003 — that if that employee is employed continuously on such a contract of employment for three continuous years, his or her contract of employment can only be renewed one more time on a fixed-term basis for up to one year and that if it is renewed again after that, it is deemed to be a contract of indefinite duration — unless the employer has objective grounds for renewing the contract of employment again on a fixed-term basis.In addition, the 2003 Act provides in relation to an employee who enters on a fixed-term contract of employment after the commencement of the Act, that if that employee is employed on such a contract of employment for four continuous years and the contract is renewed again after that, then it is deemed to be one of indefinite duration unless the employer has objective grounds for renewing the contract of employment again on a fixed-term basis.In 2003, a amendment to the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984 under a provision in the Redundancy Payments Act 2003 enabled the existing arrangement for processing claims for payment in lieu of notice under the Insolvency Payments Scheme to be streamlined and output to be increased.  The effect of this amendment was to allow employees covered by the Insolvency Payments Scheme to claim their minimum notice entitlements without first having obtained an award from the Employment Appeals Tribunal. That, in turn, freed the EAT to take on more cases under other legislation.  As a result of the amendment, In most cases, all the main claims could be processed together following the amendment, speeding up payments to employees.The Redundancy Payments Act 2003 was commenced in two phases viz (1) The Redundancy Payments Act 2003 (Commencement) Order 2003 brought the new enhanced levels of redundancy into being on 25th May, 2003 i.e. two weeks pay for every year of service between 16 and 66, plus a bonus week. Hitherto, the rates were much lower — a half a week's pay for every year of service up to 41 and a weeks pay for every year of service over 41. (2) The Redundancy Payments Act 2003 (Commencement) Order 2005 implemented on 10th April, 2005 the remaining provisions improving statutory redundancy pursuant to the Redundancy Payments Act 2003. This mainly involved simplifying the legislative basis of the Redundancy Payments Scheme and cleared the way for the Department's new on-line System for processing statutory redundancy employee lump sum and employer rebate claims. The system went "live" on 31st May, 2005 and has proved to be a major success, with 52% usage in October 2006.(3) In addition to these two benefits resulting from the 2003 Act, the Redundancy Payments (Lump Sum) Regulations 2004 increased from €507.90 to €600 the ceiling on weekly gross pay which must be taken into account when calculating a statutory redundancy lump sum entitlement.In 2005, a set of regulations — the European Communities (Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency)) Regulations 2005 — extended the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984 to cover employees in Ireland of companies that have become insolvent under the laws of another Member State. The Regulations also added a number of existing employment rights-related awards to the Act.The Employees (Provision of Information and Consultation) Act 2006.  This act came into operation on 24 July 2006 and implements EU Directive 2002/14/EC of the 11 March 2002 and provides for the establishment of a general framework setting out minimum requirements for the right to information and consultation of employees in undertakings with at least 50 employees.   It introduces a new era of information and consultation in Ireland and marks an important development in the history of Irish industrial relations.The intention of the Act is to ensure that information and consultation is provided by employers systematically, so that employees are able to acquire an informed understanding of the challenges faced by the business.  Timely information and meaningful consultation are prerequisites for the improved adaptability of Irish workplaces, which is vital to meet the challenges created by the globalised economy.A list of the 36 pieces of occupational safety and health or dangerous substances legislation administered and enforced by the Health and Safety Authority, which were made over the past 7 years and which are currently in force, is set out below.  In the context of a response to a Parliamentary Question, it would not be possible to detail all the benefits arising. However, the overall thrust and objective of the legislation is encapsulated in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, which I brought into operation in September 2005 which updated, repealed and replaced the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989 and, together with appropriate Regulations, Codes of Practice and guidance material developed under its ambit, provides a modern legal framework to guarantee best international practice in regard to health and safety in Irish workplaces.The Act aims at striking an appropriate balance between imposing duties, encouraging better consultation at workplace level on occupational safety and health matters, providing for an improved focus on better prevention systems and practices and the possible application of increased fines and penalties, where warranted.Legislation ListOccupational Safety and HealthSafety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 (No. 10 of 2005)Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 (Commencement) Order 2005 (S.I.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	725	My belief in the long-term sustainability of high wage or salary employment is based on the realities of recent economic growth and employment expansion.  Ireland's success has been based not only on attracting highly skilled, high value-added and well-paid jobs and investment, but in retaining them.  Currently we have both a competitive and comparative advantage in attracting foreign investment such as the Digital River European Headquarters in Shannon and the new indigenous QUMAS research and development centre in Cork. These companies have chosen to invest here because their shareholders and managers know that we have the economic environment and infrastructure to support businesses based on technological excellence and sophistication.This type of investment is not footloose, nor necessarily influenced by the headline advantages of lower cost locations. Complex manufacturing, regional headquarters operations or advanced support service companies set up in Ireland because the long term advantages of so doing make compelling business sense. These companies have stronger strategic connections with the economy — an economy that has many more competitive attractions in human capital, research ability and productivity opportunities that far outweigh the simple cost advantages of other investment locations.We are by no means immune from global competition. This is why we must continually work on maintaining our competitiveness and developing our comparative advantages.  The strategic advantage of investing for long term growth in Ireland is clear to many. It will become unambiguous as my Department's Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation, invests significant resources and delivers different ways to help enterprise research new products and bring them to market faster than possible in low cost competitors. This is just one of the major initiatives that this Government is taking to protect the economic and employment prospects, that sound policies have delivered over the past decade.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	726	The following table sets out the position in relation to full-time job gains and job losses, in agency assisted firms in County Kildare over the period 2001-2005.  It is not possible to provide details of the skill levels attached to either the job losses or gains.Over the past five years, IDA Ireland's focused strategy for Kildare has been to promote the county as part of an integrated east region, with access to a population base of 1.5 million people.  IDA Ireland's strategy for County Kildare is to:Progress the development of a knowledge economy;Encourage increased co-operation between foreign direct investment; companies and third level institutions in the county;Work with the existing client base in the county to expand its presenceProvide modern property solutions with supporting infrastructure;Work with Local Authorities and relevant infrastructure providers to influence the delivery of appropriate infrastructure to the county, for example the new Millennium Park, Naas which is comprised of 3 modern 40,000 sq.ft advance office buildings, available for marketing to inward investors.To support this strategy, IDA Ireland is working closely with educational institutions in the county, to develop the skill sets necessary to attract high value added employment to the county. IDA Ireland is also working with FÁS to provide guidance in developing the skill sets needed by those already in the workforce who are interested in upskilling.Kildare has in recent years attracted some world class manufacturing companies such as Intel, Braun Oral B and Hewlett Packard. IDA Ireland is also working to attract the International Services, Software, Financial Services and Pharmaceuticals sectors and in recent months IFS (a financial services firm) has established a facility in the Millennium Park, Naas.In terms of job creation, Enterprise Ireland activity is focussed on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs in manufacturing and internationally traded services companies who are setting up new High Potential Start-Up Companies, the retention and creation of new jobs in existing companies and in enhancing the innovation capability of Ireland at a national and regional level through supporting research in companies and third level institutions. Since the beginning of 2003, E I has approved over €12m in support to companies in Kildare to help them grow their sales and exports and improve innovation and new product development in order that they can compete on world markets.New companies — now leaders in the consumer products market — have been established and have created new employment. The consumer foods sector in particular, has shown rapid growth over the last number of years, reflecting significant changes in eating habits and an increase in demand for convenience foods. The announcement in January 2005 by Green Isle Foods of a major €22.6 million expansion investment in the county, supported by Enterprise Ireland, is well underway and is expected to lead to the creation of 130 new jobs.The announcement in May 2006 of a €28 million investment by Dawn Farm Foods Ltd. in Naas, County Kildare, supported by EI, relates to the development of a State-of-the-Art meat science innovation centre, together with significant investment in R&D and additional capital investment. Overall, 100 new jobs will be created, increasing employment in Dawn Farm Foods to 580 by 2011.  In addition, the number of dedicated R & D personnel in the company will double from 15 to 30.Full-time jobs20012002200320042005TotalJob gains6891,0269841,0989634,760Job losses-1,205-902-879-813-485-4,284Net change-516124105285478476Source: Forfás Business Information System.

#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	730	The table provides details of the ten countries from whence most Irish imports have come in each of the past five years (i.e. between the years 2001 and 2005.)  From the table, it can be seen that during the period 2001-2005, with the exception of Singapore which has dropped out of the list and the significant rise of China, the list of the top ten import markets has largely remained the same.This table provides details of the total value of imports from the 10 main import markets.  From this table, it can be seen that, the total value of imports from these 10 countries is essentially at the same level in 2005 as 2001.  However, when one considers the effect of the time-value of money in the interim, the value of imports coming from the 10 main import markets has in fact fallen.One significant factor in this development is that the total value of imports from Great Britain fell from €19 billion in 2001 to €13 billion in 2003, and has now risen again to €16 billion in 2005.  Apart from the gradual shift away from over-reliance on the UK as our main trading partner (in 1960 75% of Irish exports were destined for the UK, now that figure is at 18%), the dramatic reduction in imports from and exports to Great Britain may have been influenced by what is referred to as a VAT Carousel Fraud, which resulted in export figures being significantly inflated.  (This did not result in significant loss of VAT to the Irish Exchequer, but resulted in VAT evasion abroad, particularly in the UK).Elsewhere, import values from our other main import markets, USA, Germany and France remained largely the same.  The value of imports from Northern Ireland remained consistent at just over €1 billion per annum during this period. It is notable that the value of imports from China increased significantly during this period, from just under €1 billion in 2001 to €3.7 billion in 2005.  However, there has been a corresponding increase in the value of Irish exports to China during this period also.No.200520042003200220011.Great BritainGreat BritainGreat BritainGreat BritainGreat Britain2.USAUSAUSAUSAUSA3.GermanyGermanyGermanyGermanyGermany4.ChinaChinaJapanFranceFrance5.NetherlandsFranceChinaJapanJapan6.JapanJapanFranceNetherlandsNetherlands7.FranceNetherlandsNetherlandsChinaSingapore8.NorwayNthn.

#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	731	The table provides details of the 10 main export markets for each of the past five years (i.e. between the years 2001 and 2005.)  From the table, it can be seen that the 10 countries listed have consistently been our most reliable markets for exports over the past five years. Although there has been some slight shifting in the ranking order, the 10 largest export markets have remained the same.Of particular note is the fact that since 2003, the USA has replaced Great Britain as our largest export market.  This is due in part to the strategy of reducing over-reliance on the UK market for Irish exports in favour of diversification to other markets such as the EU, USA and global markets. (in 1960 75% of Irish exports were destined for the UK, now that figure is at 18%). However, the reduction in exports to Great Britain may also have been influenced by what is referred to as a VAT Carousel Fraud, which resulted in export figures being significantly inflated.  (This did not result in significant loss of VAT to the Irish Exchequer, but resulted in VAT evasion abroad, particularly in the UK).The trend in recent years has been for Irish exports to increase incrementally, year on year. Figures released by the Central Statistics Office, recently, show that in the first seven months of this year exports increased by 3% relative to the same period last year.  CSO figures for year end 2005 showed that exports had increased by 5% over 2004, while the figures for year end 2004 showed an increase of 3% relative to 2003.  The evidence shows that Irish exporters are continuing to perform well in a difficult trading environment caused by the global economic slowdown and the recent hike in oil prices.  I have no doubt that, when a global recovery takes place and oil prices fall back to their pre-crisis levels, Irish exporters will be well placed to take full advantage of the improved economic circumstances.No.200520042003200220011.USAUSAUSAGreat BritainGreat Britain2.Great BritainGreat BritainGreat BritainUSAUSA3.BelgiumBelgiumBelgiumBelgiumGermany4.GermanyGermanyGermanyGermanyFrance5.FranceFranceFranceFranceBelgium6.NetherlandsNetherlandsNetherlandsItalyNetherlands7.ItalyItalyItalyNetherlandsItaly8.SwitzerlandSwitzerlandSwitzerlandSwitzerlandJapan9.SpainSpainSpainJapanSwitzerland10.JapanJapanJapanSpainSpain
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	732	The latest data from the Central Statistics Office (QNHS) indicate that there were an additional 88,000 people in employment in Quarter 2 2006 compared to the same period in 2005.  Data in respect of agency-assisted enterprises are compiled by Forfás on a once yearly basis and therefore the latest data available are for 2005. In that year 26,553 new full-time jobs were created in enterprise agency-assisted firms across all sectors.It is not possible to specify precisely how many of these jobs can be classified as high value added. However, the trend in recent years has seen higher technology and services enterprises replacing low technology production. Many of the job losses that have occurred in manufacturing in particular over the last few years have been in low cost manufacturing processes while the new jobs created in the enterprise agencies' client companies are mainly concentrated in high value-added, knowledge-based companies, offering greater security in the face of intense international competition.Activities in areas such as Pharmaceuticals, Bio Pharmaceuticals, Medical Technologies, ICT, Globally Traded Business, and International and Financial Services will continue to provide opportunities for high value added jobs. For example, in the last five years there was a 21% increase in employment in the Medical, Precision and Optical Instruments sector, while over the same period employment in the Textile sector fell by 51%.Services activities have become the primary source of employment growth in developed countries including Ireland. Indeed, Ireland has become one of the leading exporters of services. Between 2000 and 2005 the contribution of Services increased from 21 to 34 per cent of total exports. Computer Services, other Business Services and Finance and Insurance are the most significant growth sectors. Again, jobs in these particular areas of the services sector tend to be higher value added and high wage ones.Enterprise policy is being actively focused towards creating conditions that will make possible a sustained shift to higher skilled, knowledge-intensive activities in which internationally tradeable services and advanced manufacturing expertise will be an important contributor to economic growth and sustainable high-quality employment.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	733	Competitiveness is a remarkably broad policy area constantly under review and consideration both in my Department and across the Departments of my Government colleagues.  Several activities are directed at identifying and improving our competitiveness.Recently the National Competitiveness Council (NCC) published its Annual Competitiveness Report (ACR) with its presentation of international benchmarks of competitiveness. I look forward to the next publication from the NCC, its annual Competitiveness Challenge that will use the results of the ACR to suggest policy options to strengthen competitiveness. This presents on an annual basis reminders of where we need to focus attention to maintain and improve upon current levels of competitiveness.  I will bring this report to Government so that its policy suggestions are given the widest circulation to Ministers and their policy advisers.My Department is currently working with Groups associated with implementation of important enterprise reports such as that from the Small Business Forum and the Enterprise Strategy Group.In addition to this, the Business Regulation Forum is working to identify disproportionate administrative burdens that may impede competitiveness.  In addition Forfás produces a range of research on issues affecting competitiveness that helps inform and guide policy innovation and thinking across my Department.Numerous other activities by the various enterprise development agencies under my Department are underway. These operational programmes are helping individual enterprises in Ireland maintain competitiveness in a fiercely demanding market, develop their capacity to build their businesses and extend their ability to profitably export to a growing number of international markets.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	734	I propose to take Questions Nos. 219 and 220 together.The National Competitiveness Council recently published a Statement on the Costs of Doing Business in Ireland. The Statement outlines the key findings of research assessing the cost of doing business at four locations in Ireland — Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick. These locations are compared with international centres in both developed and developing economies, including Bangalore, Boston, Budapest and Copenhagen across a range of 8 sectors such as biopharmaceutical manufacturing, engineering and funds administration. The data are for one period only — January 2006 — but will be updated in two subsequent reports in 2007 and 2008, which will allow for comparisons over time.As many observers would expect, labour costs (59%) dominated firms' business costs.  These were followed by property costs (11%), utility costs (9%) and transport costs (4%). However as the analysis mentions, the research excludes other business input costs such as equipment or raw materials. These can be significant in some sectors, such as biopharmaceutical manufacturing and food processing.It should be noted that, while the cost profiles of selected firms in the study will not necessarily be representative of all firms in the sector, the analysis by the NCC shows that labour costs, taxes and transport costs are competitive when compared with benchmarked locations in the EU-15 economies or in the Unites States. Furthermore labour costs in manufacturing are marginally more competitive than in the services sectors, compared with other EU-15/US cities. This underlines the competitive position of a large part of our economy.The NCC Statement identifies utility costs, particularly electricity and property costs as having the potential to weaken competitiveness, but the analysis points out productivity is the key determinant of competitiveness. In relation to energy utility charges, these are for the most part driven by international cost pressures on fossil fuels and the need to modernise and strengthen our energy infrastructure.The Government's Green Paper on Energy Policy sets out a vision, with clear targets and timelines, for making the economy less reliant on imported fossil fuels by building our capacity in indigenous renewables. In relation to other costs such as telecommunications and waste, the forthcoming National Development Plan will play a significant role in investment in these sectors to address their competitive impact on enterprise.Regarding productivity, my Department's enterprise support agencies provide an extensive range of programmes to help companies address either specific competitiveness challenges or the productivity and efficiency of their entire business functions. These include initiatives in technology acquisition, innovation, research and development, management capability and strengthening export capabilities. The joined up strategic links between our education and business sectors as set out in my recent Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation exemplifies a new approach to building both national and enterprise competitiveness in a globalised world.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	735	I propose to take Questions Nos. 221 to 224, inclusive, together.The Department is fully committed to addressing the needs of those with disabilities, and furthering the policy of mainstreaming services to help them play a full and active part in Irish society. The Sectoral Plan of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment under the Disability Act 2005, outlines the Department's key initiatives in promoting equal opportunities for disabled people in the labour market, which includes the development of a Comprehensive Employment Strategy for disabled people.The key pillars of this strategy are:enhancing the effectiveness of employment and vocational training programmes for disabled peoplefurther developing financial and other supports to potential employers and disabled employees, andfurther developing measures to promote the continued employment of workers who acquire a disability while in employment.In line with current mainstreaming policy, disabled people are encouraged by FÁS to apply for training and the appropriate supports are put in place to meet their particular individual needs.  If the disabled person cannot meet the requirements of mainline vocational training, with supports, then the individual is referred to Specialist Training Provision contracted by FÁS.  The Specialist Training Provider will then carry out a functional assessment to determine whether the person would be able to undertake vocational training, or would require rehabilitative training under the Department of Health and Children.The current extra supports that would be available in FÁS Specialist Training Provision for a person with an acquired brain injury would include psychologists, remedial teachers, social skills instructors, job coaches and an individual holistic assessment of needs.  I would like to commend the work of the groups working in this area, many of whom I have met personally, including the Irish Association of Supported Employment, Brí and Headway. Indeed, I understand that FÁS are currently considering a proposal from Headway for a pilot scheme in this area.I wish to declare that I have a personal interest in this issue through having a family member who has an acquired brain injury, and who may benefit from vocational training and/or employment provision.

Rather, it has a number of facilitators who provide a range of services for people attempting to rejoin the labour market.  A key role of the facilitator is to focus on the support programmes available to those seeking work, to identify their needs and to seek to engage them on a progression path towards employment and self reliance.The announcement referred to by the Deputy was in the context of the Government proposals to support lone parents, subsequently published in a discussion paper in March 2006.  As the Deputy is aware, the discussion paper proposes the expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents; the extension of the National Employment Action Plan to focus on lone parents; focused provision of childcare; improved information services for lone parents and the introduction of a new social assistance payment for low income families with young children.As co-ordination of this cross-cutting initiative will be crucial, the Government has instructed the Senior Officials Group on Social Inclusion to draw up an implementation plan to progress the non-income recommendations in tandem with the development of the legislation required in my Department to introduce a new payment scheme.Work on the development of this implementation plan is under way.  Issues including access to childcare support, education, training and activation measures are being actively considered by the relevant Departments and Agencies.  It is envisaged that my Department's facilitators will play a key role in the operation of the implementation plan within my Department.

Following a review of the arrangements for administering the scheme, it was decided that services should in future be provided through my Department's network of Local and Branch Offices.  The primary aim of providing services at local level is to improve customer service by reducing claim processing times through closer linkage with the local investigative officer network and by providing more direct local contact for lone parents with the Department's employment and educational support services.My Department currently processes new applications for one parent family payment (OFP) at 39 Social Welfare local offices.  The process to move the stock of claims currently administered in Sligo to Social Welfare Local Offices commenced during 2006.  The average time from date of claim to date of award for one parent family claims for unmarried claimants was approximately 14 weeks in 2003, 16 weeks in 2004, 9 weeks in 2005 and 8.5 weeks in 2006 to date.

In the case of Kilbeggan Preservation and Development Association (KPDA), my Department is satisfied that the agreed staffing of the project for 2005 was for 1 Manager and 2 full-time equivalent staff. FÁS has confirmed these numbers to my Department.  Given that this project is an income earning tourist attraction it is open to the project to fund additional positions from its tourism income.  My Department is ensuring that the project is funded on the basis of the above numbers.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	746	A herd number is an administrative arrangement designed primarily for the purposes of disease control under the disease eradication schemes, which involves the allocation of a number to a herd as provided for under S.I. No. 276 of 1999  (European communities (Identification and registration of bovine animals) Regulations, 1999). The traditional term "herdowner", which required the nomination of one person in respect of the herd in the 1989 TB Order, has been replaced by the term "keeper" which is defined in Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 as any natural or legal person responsible for animals, whether on a permanent or on a temporary basis, including during transportation or at a market. In effect, the "keeper" is the person who is to be the initial point of contact in regard to animal inspections, testing, identification, records etc. to sign movement documents passports of animal(s) and to be deemed legally responsible for the day to day care and welfare of the animals. The keeper also has responsibility to notify the database of animal births, deaths and movements, to keep the herd register and to sign certain documents such as the animal passport when the keeper takes possession of an animal.My Department, as a matter of policy, when issuing a herd number registers one individual person as the "keeper" of the animals. The designation of more than one person as "keeper" would lead to general confusion, possible denial of responsibility, duplication of communication to all named parties, difficulties in supply of identification tags and documents and difficulties in prosecutions, all of which could delay immediate action in relation to the prevention of the spread of animal disease and the protection of animal welfare.The registration of a person as keeper does not infer ownership of the lands or animals in the herd. When multiple persons, a company, or an institution wish to register an interest in the herd number, they are registered as "herdowners" and are asked to nominate the keeper.  Irish national legislation on the TB eradication programme has, since its inception in the 1950s, required the nomination of a single responsible person when more than one person is involved with the herd. In a recent effort to align Department computer systems, to regularise records and to bring the terminology more into line with the EU regulations, in cases where multiple persons had been recorded and no single person was nominated as keeper, my Department issued a request to farmers to nominate one person as keeper for the herd.With regard to the position of persons who have a beneficial interest in the herd but who are not registered as keepers, such persons may register their interest in the herd as "herdowners" through Form ER1.1 and, accordingly, qualify for payment under the various schemes implemented by my Department. In this regard, I should emphasise that the "keeper" role is classified as a non-financial role and payments are made to "herdowners" rather than to "keepers".In the event of the death of a person registered as herdowner and not as keeper, the same requirements that arise in cases where persons have an interest in the herd or in any payments due from the Department will apply.  In the event of the death of the nominated keeper who also has an interest in the herd, the same rules will apply. In addition, where a keeper dies, those persons remaining in the role as herdowner will be required to nominate a new keeper or, if there is no extant registered herdowner, the estate will be required to nominate a keeper to be responsible for the animals in the herd in relation to dealings with this Department and for the day-to-day care, maintenance and welfare of the animals.In view of the fact that this policy has been in place for many years, I have asked my Department to have it reviewed.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	747	My Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students which are administered by the Local Authorities and the Vocational Education Committees.The Higher Education Grant Scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. Generally speaking, students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for maintenance grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means and nationality.The decision on eligibility for third level or further education grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC. These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired.The Third Level Student Support Schemes were extended to provide maintenance grants to eligible students pursuing approved full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration (pursued in a university or a third level institution which is maintained or assisted by recurrent grants from public funds) in other EU Member States with effect from the 1996/97 academic year. The extension of the Schemes at that time did not include courses at postgraduate level or to courses outside the EU and, accordingly, there is no grant aid available under the schemes for students pursuing studies outside of the EU.However clause 7.3 of the Higher Education Grants Scheme 2006 and the Vocational Education Committees Scholarship Scheme 2006 provides that where grant-holders, as part of their approved course, are required to attend foreign university courses for a period of up to one year, a maintenance award may continue to be paid where the period abroad does not affect the normal duration of the approved course.If the Deputy has a particular case in mind and provides more detailed information in relation to the case the matter can be examined further.

The School Support Programme will bring together, and build upon, a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage.The process of identifying primary and second-level schools for participation in the SSP was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the Inspectorate.As a result of the identification process, 840 schools were invited to participate in the SSP. These comprised 640 primary schools (320 urban/town schools and 320 rural schools) and 200 second-level schools.  A review process has been put in place for urban primary schools included in Band 2 of the School Support Programme where there is evidence that the level of disadvantage is of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in Band 1.The review is operating under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review. The closing date for receipt of review applications was Monday 25th September, 2006.Review applications must be evidence-based and based on the variables and reference dates used in the identification process for the SSP.  In the case of schools seeking a review, applications must relate to data on the relevant variables included in the ERC survey of May, 2005 and to the reference date of 30th September, 2004.A completed application for review from the school indicated by the Deputy was received in the Social Inclusion Unit of the Department on 20th September 2006 and a formal acknowledgement has issued to the school.  It is anticipated that the review process will be completed shortly.

Each class can cater for up to 7 children and the children have access to a speech and language therapist.The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through the local special educational needs organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special needs supports, including applications for the establishment of special classes.Responsibility for enrolment to these classes rests with the individual school authority.  The Deputy will also be aware that the provision of therapy services and the recruitment of speech and language therapists to support pupils in these classes is a matter for the Health Services Executive (HSE) and funding is provided to the HSE for such purposes. The extent of service provided to these classes is a matter for the HSE.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	756	On the 1 February 2006 the Minister for Health and Children and I published the report of the Fottrell Working Group on Undergraduate Medical Education and Training. Among the recommendations of the Fottrell Group was that a graduate stream of entry to medicine be introduced and that all graduates of honours Bachelor degree programmes should be eligible to apply.It is anticipated that the Higher Education Authority will shortly issue a competitive call for proposals to provide the new graduate entry programme, with a view to additional places being provided on this programme from 2007.  It has been decided that graduate entry will be open to graduates of all disciplines. The provision of a graduate entry stream is an important development in reducing pressures on aspiring medical students who until now have effectively had one chance of entry, based on their Leaving Certificate performance. This will allow students to make a decision to enter medicine at a more mature age and should result in a more diverse range of entrants into the profession.No decisions have been made on the level of tuition fees for the graduate programme, as this will form part of the overall outcome of the competitive call for proposals.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	757	My Department provides a range of supports to second level schools to enable them to cater for students with special educational needs. The supports in question include remedial and additional teaching support, special needs assistant support and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment.With effect from 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has taken over key functions from the Department of Education and Science in relation to special educational provision. The NCSE was formally established as an independent statutory body on the 1st October 2005 under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2005. The Council acts under the broad policy direction of my Department but has the resources and the remit to play the leading role in the delivery of education services to children with disabilities/ special needs.The provision of speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and other health related supports is a matter for the Health Service Executive. However, the NCSE co-ordinates with the health services, schools and other relevant bodies regarding the provision of education and related support services to children with disabilities/special needs.The responsibilities of the NCSE include the following: deciding on applications for additional teaching support in respect of children with disabilities with special educational needs at second level; deciding on applications for special needs assistant (SNA) hours; processing applications for school placement in respect of children with disabilities with special education needs.The precise model of provision made available at second level will depend on the assessed needs of the pupils involved. Some pupils are capable of attending ordinary classes on an integrated basis with additional teacher and/or special needs assistant support. In other cases, placement in special dedicated classes or units attached to the school may be the more appropriate response. Such special classes operate at significantly reduced pupil teacher ratios. Students attached to these special classes may be facilitated in attending ordinary subject classes on an integrated basis wherever possible.The NCSE, through the local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) will process the relevant application for resources and inform the school of the outcome. It is important to note that in the case of decisions on additional teaching and SNA support, the SENO will outline the process to the school and parents, where appropriate, and will at the end of the process outline the basis on which the decision was made.The NCSE has confirmed that additional teaching resources have been granted to the school in question to cater for the special educational needs of pupils enrolled, including the pupil referred to by the Deputy. An application for assistive technology for the pupil in question has also been received and is currently being processed by the SENO.I am confident that the advent of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-11-15 00:00:00	Prelude	760	I propose to take Questions Nos. 250, 252 and 253 together.In law, the preparation of the Register of Electors is a matter for each local registration authority. It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register.In April 2006, I announced a package of measures to assist local authorities in their work on preparing the 2007/8 Register. This included a commitment to provide additional ring-fenced financial resources to support local authorities' own spending in respect of the register campaign; I advised authorities that a contribution of some €6 million can be made available in this regard. An initial allocation of some €3 million, based on the number of households in each local authority area, was made available in July to local authorities for registration work; details of allocations are set out in the following table.I am satisfied that the implementation by local authorities of the measures which I announced in April has resulted in the most extensive electoral registration campaign in decades. However, the process is not finished. The Draft Register of Electors has been published by all local authorities and is available for checking up to the 25 November in council offices, libraries, Garda stations, post offices and on-line at www.checktheregister.ie.  Local authorities must publish the final Register of Electors for 2007/8 on 1 February 2007. Summary data from all local authorities regarding the Draft Register have been compiled by my Department and are also set out in the following table.As indicated above, people have up to 25 November to make claims for corrections to the Draft Register. While it has been suggested that this period should be extended, I am not convinced that there is a need to do so, particularly given the level of public attention now being given to the registration process, and the alternatives that are already available for people to get on the register.  Should a cogent case to extend the period involved be made by any local authority, which has the primary responsibility in this area, I would of course give detailed consideration to the matter, taking into account the relevant legislative provisions.Local AuthorityDraft Register 2007/2008 Total ElectorsDraft Register 2007/2008 Dáil ElectorsGrant for Electoral Register Purposes€,000City CouncilsCork82,15280,525100Dublin325,323314,105421Galway43,78140,75149Limerick32,78131,98944Waterford23,23923,00936County CouncilsCarlow38,97638,05335Cavan49,25348,51043Clare83,74781,48679Cork286,617280,112245Donegal115,638114,488104Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown148,382145,320149Fingal157,191145,788142Galway125,348123,736105Kerry110,923107,715101Kildare123,491120,633118Kilkenny65,97365,03360Laois48,71048,25843Leitrim22,64022,08521Limerick96,73195,70189Longford27,13226,52424Louth92,24089,45578Mayo96,85895,47592Meath102,576101,70297Monaghan40,99640,06139North Tipperary47,79846,98547Offaly53,04052,19247Roscommon46,91245,85642Sligo49,11448,40446South Dublin163,338157,831171South Tipperary60,39259,65562Waterford47,51847,08843Westmeath59,79158,90754Wexford101,23499,44889Wicklow84,60782,95585Totals3,054,4422,979,8353,000
