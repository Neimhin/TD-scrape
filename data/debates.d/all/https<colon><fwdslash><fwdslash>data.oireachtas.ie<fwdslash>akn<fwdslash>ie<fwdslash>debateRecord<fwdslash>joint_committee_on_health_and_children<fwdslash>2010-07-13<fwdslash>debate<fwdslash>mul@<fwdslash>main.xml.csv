If you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  I am sure this will not be necessary but I shall continue.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such as way as to make him or her identifiable.  Members are advised of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.I welcome the officials from the Department of Health and Children and the HSE to the meeting.  I ask Ms Teresa Cody to proceed with her presentation and followed by Dr. Dymphna Kavanagh, clinical lead on oral health, HSE.  The presentations have been circulated and members have had an opportunity to read them.  We will take a group of questions thereafter.  We have allocated about an hour for this discussion and I hope that will suffice.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss the position on the implementation of the recommendations of the Oireachtas joint committee reports on orthodontics.  I am also grateful for the opportunity to inform the committee on other relevant policy developments.I am joined by my colleague from the Department, Peter Henshaw, and colleagues from the HSE.  My colleagues from the HSE include Dr. Dympna Kavanagh, who was recently appointed interim clinical lead for oral health, HSE.  She will update the committee on orthodontic service developments.  Also present are Mr. John O'Brien, HSE west, Ms Gretta Crowley, HSE south, Dr. Marie Cooke, consultant orthodontist, HSE south, and Ms Mary FitzPatrick, Dublin Mid-Leinster.Since our last meeting with the committee in early 2007, members will be aware of the sudden and rapid change in the position of the public finances.  As the committee will also be aware, health spending accounts for approximately 27% of all Government spending and it was therefore necessary to examine this expenditure as part of the Government's strategy to restore the public finances.  Due to the position of the public finances, the Government had to take action to reduce and curtail expenditure in several dental and oral health related areas.  It has reduced expenditure in the State adult dental schemes.  In addition to this, in an effort to achieve sustainability in the costs of delivering public services, a moratorium on recruitment in the public sector has also been introduced.The Department recognises the delivery of oral health services needs a policy context.  In this regard, since our last appearance before the committee, the Department and the HSE have been working to develop a new national oral health policy document.  This process has involved critically examining the many challenges and issues facing the dental sector.A core policy group, which includes representatives from the Department, the HSE and Professor John Clarkson, Professor Emeritus, Trinity College, Dublin, was established to drive the development of this policy.  The main issues addressed in developing the new national oral health policy are a revised regulatory regime, including a new dentists Bill, the integration of oral health in the wider health care delivery system, including enhanced synergies with health promotion, children's health, and primary care.  In addition, this policy will also examine oral health services for people with disabilities, those in long-stay care and services for older people.While the draft policy will focus on patient issues, it is also intended to address the competition issues raised by the Competition Authority in its report on the dental profession.  The draft policy will also consider the issues of manpower planning, specialisation and skills-mix, including recognition and the possible future expansion of the role of auxiliary dental professions such as hygienists, dental technicians, orthodontic technicians, orthodontic specialists, and the identification of appropriate training needs.  We are working to finalise the policy document which should be available later this year.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I am the newly appointed oral health lead.  My own background is as a dentist and, more particularly a dental public health consultant.  My remit in this post will be to develop a strategy for the effective and efficient delivery of HSE dental services, including the delivery of specialist services such as orthodontics.The HSE is moving dental services towards an integrated care model.  Appropriate care will be provided in appropriate settings with the simplest care provided in a local setting.  The most complex and specialist care will be provided in a regional or, for very complex care, in a national service.Several issues needed to be addressed in oral dental health services.  A national system of governance and audit must be put in place to ensure appropriate and quality standards and outcomes.  There must also be a skills-mix where appropriately trained dental professionals, matched to the complexity of cases in a variety of care settings, are made available to ensure ease of access, best value for money and quality of care in all settings.  A more integrated approach to oral health care is also needed with joined-up care in which an overall and holistic approach to dental treatment is taken.A substantial number of treatments have been provided and completed since 2007.  I have already submitted to the committee figures relating to the increase in the numbers of people in receipt of dental services.  A substantial budget is also available for these services.I am recommending orthodontic services be provided across primary, community, secondary and tertiary care services and care should be provided at the lowest level of complexity nearest the patient.  This should depend on the complexity of the case, the setting and resource including the skill of the providers.  The assessment of waiting lists and treatment of those children, when growth is beneficial, so that an easier, less complex and shorter intervention is necessary will be a priority.  In other words, the earlier we provide treatment to children with assessed need, the better the clinical and psychological outcomes for that child.  There would also be a better chance of influencing growth patterns and of compliance with necessary treatment regimes.The expanded index of orthodontic treatment need guidelines has been in place in the HSE since 2008.  Persons in categories of 4 and 5, the most severe categories, are currently entitled to HSE care.  These guidelines are now taught in dental schools as part of the undergraduate curriculum.  Also, many primary care dental surgeons have had the opportunity to be up-skilled in the salaried services to enable appropriate referral.While both these initiatives have been excellent, it is important we go to the next stage.  I am proposing a reduction of the assessment waiting list, removing some parents' concern that their children may not be eligible for care despite waiting a long time for further assessment.  A pilot implementation programme will allow us to learn lessons for full implementation and allow us phase out the waiting list in a controlled and managed way.This initiative will also enable the prioritisation of children who will benefit most from early intervention.  Those who would benefit more from later intervention will also be prioritised.Other characteristics should also be taken into account such as a patient's medical history, social history, special needs including behavioural and phobic issues, benefit from early or later intervention and the complexity of treatment needed. Such holistic approaches have been piloted in Britain and elsewhere with considerable outcomes.We have moved forward with our strategy of putting specialists and consultants in place.  It is now timely to assess if we should put a further support in place for these specialists and consultants.  By supporting a better primary care system and building on previous initiatives, we will not replace the strategy of specialists and consultants that is in place, but rather by putting in a support structure of primary care dental practitioners providing services to some of the more simple and less complex cases, in many cases this will prevent orthodontic conditions from worsening.  This means, in effect, that a child will not have to be compelled to be treated by a specialist or consultant down the line, if there is much earlier intervention with much simpler treatment.As alluded to by my colleague, in the longer term we should like to look at the possible impact of skill mix such as orthodontic therapists, but the first priority is to look at the influence and impact of the primary care team approach in dental practice being more involved in care.  The benefits of this holistic approach, skill mix and team working only become apparent when the outcomes are clearly measured using an overall oral care plan approach.  In simple terms each child may have several different team members, from a consultant to a specialist to the general dental care practitioner involved in his or her care, but these individuals will be working to a single plan.  A single clinician will have clear clinical oversight.  Rather than the old fashioned concept which was the norm in dentistry before, of simply delegating tasks and patient treatments to another professional, this is a much more holistic and a different type of approach.  Clear clinical audit is essential right from the start.  There is good practice in the country already, but we want to build on that and have it as a national system.Moving on, I want to talk somewhat more about the waiting list initiative.  I want to highlight the fact that in some cases there have been particular reasons for backlogs to occur, particularly in the south, and we can talk about this later.  A backlog has occurred there because of the unexpected death of an orthodontic consultant, and this was an extra service burden.  A new consultant has been appointed, however, and will take up the post shortly, so hopefully the problem will be alleviated in the future through adherence to the strategy.  In other areas the waiting lists have been affected by the recruitment moratorium.A system has been put in place to track waiting lists and quality initiatives nationally.  This has gone a certain way in that we looked at the overall times for waiting lists.  However, we need to refine the collection of the data because it is not clear and transparent from the existing information what the different categories of patients are.  Some of them have very severe classifications and it is clear that those children are being prioritised in some areas.  Indeed, their waiting lists are not long.  In many cases they are only waiting six months or a year, at most, before intervention.  That is masked by many of the other categories of patients on the waiting lists.  The data, then, need to be more clear and transparent.I am proposing that we look at a service waiting list initiative, particularly around the treatment assessment.  It is important that waiting lists are clinically validated to ensure that those who will benefit most from early intervention will be assessed first and treated early.  It is also important that those children who will not benefit to the same extent are clearly identified and pulled out separately from the waiting lists.  The initiatives will be piloted and evaluated, and will only be rolled out in a phased manner from the lessons learned.  It is important, too, that we look at a closely monitored support system that might be put in place, where general dental practitioners would have a more active role in providing services.Finally, the publication of the national oral health strategy in the future will facilitate us in the development of the specialist services, at national, regional and local levels.  I am also recommending that within the HSE we should reactivate the original orthodontic review group that put forward the recommendations.  However, I want this broadened.  I want to see whether oral surgery, maxillofacial surgery, special care dentistry and other specialist services can be involved in that orthodontic review group.  In the event, it would be a specialist review group, with primary care having a very strong voice as well, so that we could have a much more holistic approach as regards the development of oral health services.

#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I thank the witnesses for their contributions.  I was a member of the two previous committees that made the proposals in regard to the service.  The witnesses have covered some of it in a general way.  Before I go into that, however, on 3 March 2010, Fine Gael tabled a parliamentary question in the Dáil as regards the then state of orthodontic waiting lists, country-wide, and it has not yet been responded to.  I have a copy of the question here, incidentally.  It was Question No. 146 on 3 March 2010 and we have not yet received an answer to it.  I wonder whether the HSE will give us the information now, or is there any reason why it has taken so long?  If I did not ask it now, we would not get it at least until the autumn, because the Dáil has now risen.With regard to the guidelines for orthodontic treatment, the witnesses will recall that it was recommended the index should be changed and replaced by the index of "orthodontic treatment need" immediately, on a national basis.  I wonder whether that has taken place.  I gather from what has been said that persons classified as grades 4 and 5 in terms of the severity of their need for treatment should be then removed from waiting lists and given the requisite orthodontic treatment.  I gather that grades 4 and 5 patients are still on waiting lists, despite the recommendation.The issue of the training of orthodontists came out very strongly at those meetings and has arisen since.  It has been recommended to the committee that the Minister should implement training measures as a top national policy, to ensure internationally accredited bodies are given proper recognition.  This recognition would then facilitate an increase in the number of qualified orthodontists.  Has that taken place?  Reference was made to the training programme provided by a number of orthodontists in the former mid-west health board area, which was stopped, and it was recommended that it be reinstated immediately — this was 2002 and 2005 — with the requisite academic supports, as a means of further increasing the supply of trained orthodontists.  That has not taken place, and it was a key recommendation of our committee at that time.Would the witnesses not accept that if this was implemented, the present waiting lists of around four years in the Limerick area, would be considerably reduced?  In fact if was to be introduced at present it has been suggested to us that the waiting lists could be eliminated in seven months, if there was full implementation of the training programme, which the committee looked into very carefully and satisfied itself as to its standards.  It was agreed that it could treat many more patients without increased cost to the HSE and each trainee could actually take 500 children off the orthodontic waiting lists.  Why has that opportunity not been taken up?Some of us are suspicious that vested interests might have a role to play here.  If a great many patients are removed from the orthodontic waiting lists, there will be less private work to be done.  I know that the HSE has purchased at very high cost orthodontic treatment in the private sector, and surely there would be a considerable training pool in the event of the introduction of the system the committee was happy to endorse on efficiency and safety grounds, which is being operated in many other countries.We suggested funding for specialist training places should be restored in the event of the State having to provide funding for orthodontic trainees who should be required to commit to the public service upon graduation.  Obviously, that did not happen.  If the finance was not available, the committee was of the view that on completion of their training trainees should commit to the State service for a period of time to return the value of any costs incurred.We said five additional oral surgeons and five maxillofacial surgeons should be appointed without delay to compliment orthodontic treatment services.  What has happened in that regard?The delegates can take a number of questions and avoid mine or pick those of them that they wish to answer.  That is the way the committee works, but we will be scrutinising the Official Report to read the responses received.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I welcome the delegates.  I welcome, in particular, the appointment of Dr. Kavanagh because the appointment of an interim oral health lead, if that is the correct term to use, has been promised for some time.  It is very important that the position has been filled.I take heart from the presentation made today.  It is very positive and strong and shows an intention to bring about change, which is very welcome.I was not a member of the previous health committees, but I have read the transcripts and received a lot of correspondence from Dr. McNamara in Limerick, in particular, whom we all know at this stage.  I take heart from some of the comments made by Dr. Kavanagh in her presentation and would like to tease them out a little, following on from Deputy Neville's questions, because one of the issues was the appointment of a lead clinician, which has been achieved.  There are issues surrounding training, waiting lists, the methodologies to be used and how we ensure the available expertise is fully used, not just those who have been trained in the country but also those who have been trained outside it.  That is the campaign Dr. McNamara has been leading for many years, something with which Mr. O'Brien will be familiar, as he is an official with whom we all worked in the old Mid-Western Health Board.  He is also very familiar with the background to the issue.At the bottom of page 5 of her presentation Dr. Kavanagh states: "It is timely to assess if the introduction and assessment of a different approach in some areas supporting the personnel already in place and building on previous excellent initiatives should be put in place".  Can I take it that the training programme which Dr. McNamara and others implemented to successfully treat a lot of patients through the orthodontic service is now an accepted part of what is provided in this country?I received a reply to a parliamentary question.  I am not sure when I tabled it, but I received the reply on 23 March.  It did not refer to figures, which is what Deputy Neville sought, but to a progress report on what was happening.  It read:The specialist orthodontists trained in the UK all returned to work in the HSE in return for sponsorship of their training.  The issue of cross-jurisdictional training pathways is no longer as significant as the HSE is not currently sponsoring any postgraduate orthodontic students in the UK.Can I take it from that answer that there is no longer a conflict in terms of the training provided in the dental hospital and the United Kingdom in terms of what is right and wrong?  We need to get rid of this from the system.  We need to ensure those who need dental and orthodontic treatment receive the best possible treatment in the fastest possible time, which is why I am encouraged by what has been said, in referring to the use of the primary care system integrated with the follow-up system and ensuring it happens at the best possible level of service and those with more complex needs will be assessed and receive treatment early, rather than placing everyone on the same waiting list.  That is what I understood Dr. Kavanagh to say.  If I heard her correctly, that is what she proposed.  I would like to hear specifically when that will be achieved.  Dr. Kavanagh said there would first be a pilot programme.  How long will that take?  Where will it take place?  She suggested there might be centralised waiting lists in order to ensure those who most need treatment will not be kept waiting and that there will be standardisation across the country.  I ask her to clarify whether there will be centralised national or regional waiting lists and how this will impact on the service.We all want to achieve the best possible service.  There have been huge issues and conflicts, beyond which we want to get.  As a committee, we also want to ensure that in getting beyond these issues we will use all of the expertise available in the country, including that of Dr. McNamara and the scheme he has piloted.  I want to ensure that service will be part of what will be provided in the future.
#MargaretConlon	unknown-#MargaretConlon-party	unknown-#MargaretConlon-dob	unknown-#MargaretConlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I welcome the delegates and thank them for their presentations.  I also welcome the appointment of Dr. Kavanagh.  I agree with a lot of what she said.  It all makes perfect sense when we are sitting here and listening to her, in particular her comments on the need to develop a holistic approach.  The habits children learn early in their lives stay with them.As a relative newcomer to the committee, I find that when I meet different groups from the HSE, they are all doing a great job within their own areas, but there is a huge lack of communication within other disciplines.  I refer, in particular, to the importance of primary care centres and how well the system will work.  There is a need for a greater level of communication between public health nurses, dentists, doctors and all the other disciplines involves to ensure this happens.I share Deputy Neville's concern about the information we have not received on waiting lists, that is, the numbers involved, and waiting times.  There are huge variations throughout the country.  We need to tease this out a little more to determine why that is the case.  A delegate referred to a case in which the consultant had died.  However, there have to be other reasons there are huge waiting lists in some areas of the country, while a very efficient service is run in others.  I will give one example.  I understand that under the school dental scheme children's teeth are assessed in second, fourth and sixth class.  My daughter finished fourth class this year and there was no note, word or mention of a dental check for her.  I am fortunate.  We visit the dentist every six months.  However, there are others who are not in a position to do this.  If one is referring to the need for early intervention, the children concerned have missed out and it may be another two years before they receive another opportunity.  Are dental clinics run throughout the summer when the schools are closed to make sure as many as possible of those in fourth class are checked?  It is a huge concern because if there are problems, they need to be detected early.  If they are not, they will become a bigger problem later in their lives.The other question relates to the number of dentists, the number in training and the numbers who will qualify this year, who I assume will be used in the service.  I am aware of moratoriums and so on but if there are waiting lists, we must do whatever is possible to ensure they are reduced as soon as possible.My last point is in respect of costs for orthodontic treatment.  Deputy Neville referred to the private work.  Many people, me included, are paranoid about their children's teeth.  While I probably did not get the treatment I should have received when growing up, I am conscious that they get the best possible treatment and if they need orthodontic work that it is done.  There are people who are not in a position to do that and they may fall between two stools.  One considers going private and the cost of the private work, and the differences in costs North and South, and in some other countries where people are going.  I had a case two weeks ago of a person trying to get a passport because of a dental appointment.  That is the reality.  While these clinics and orthodontics are, I am sure, reputable, one does not know, but people take the risk.  If the treatment is not available here at an affordable cost, what are people supposed to do if that is the choice they face?  Perhaps the delegation can provide some clarity on those issues.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I welcome the delegation and especially Ms Gretta Crowley, with whom we work all the time.  I have listened to Dr. Dymphna Kavanagh's outline of what is intended in the area of orthodontics and the entire dental service.  The service has been a disaster up to now.  It would great if what is being proposed comes to fruition but it seems like Valhalla to us listening to it.  I cannot let the meeting pass without mentioning Ian Dowling who, for many years, fought for and provided an exceptional service in Cork under very trying circumstances and also Ted McNamara who lobbies us continuously but always in the interests of others.   That is something one has to take on board when people are determined in their campaign on behalf of others.  We all respect him for his efforts.If I heard correctly, another orthodontist has been appointed to the HSE for south Cork and will take up the position shortly.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	9	Yes.  The second consultant is in post.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	10	That is very good.  Until now, we have had a consultant orthodontist in Cork North Lee, Ms Gretta Crowley.  Mr. Ian Dowling's substantial list was transferred in its entirety to Ms Crowley.  The list in North Lee was even more substantial because there had been an additional waiting time of a year and a half with no consultant orthodontist in place.  At this point we are talking about a five-year waiting list for the combined lists.  I understand the lists will be split again because a second consultant is in place but what will be the waiting list now for Cork North and Cork South Lee?  I presume Dr. Kavanagh's proposals for downstream upskilling will be put in place.In regard to people with special needs, because of the need for anaesthetists and anaesthetics in the majority of cases, with one clinic per month and only two patients dealt with, the waiting list is five years.  These are not people who can go to the private sector.  It is an entirely different cohort.  People with an intellectual disability can go to a private dentist but because of their additional needs they usually have to be dealt with in a very specialised clinic.  What will be done about that?   Will additional clinics be available for emergencies.  If the waiting list is five years there will be emergencies.In the event that one or two of the consultants in place must take time off, is there any facility to replace that person, even for a short period?  That was the difficulty in the past.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I thank Ms Cody and Dr. Kavanagh for their presentations.  I wish Dr. Kavanagh every success in her new post.  What is the number of orthodontists and the distribution of same and are some areas well served and other areas not well served?  When it comes to Dublin North-East, we have a problem.  Very often the figures appear exceptionally good for Dublin North-East but when separated out for Dublin, they look bad for Dublin North-East.  For example, when the home care packages were introduced the figures looked extremely good but when we analysed them they were all in Dublin.On the issue of budgetary constraints, how will the orthodontic service in Ireland deal with the whole question of better value for money.  How much of the savings will be effected through better value for money rather than reducing the level of service?  What analysis has been done on productivity in the different areas?  There appears to be a variation in the return on investment in terms of productivity in some areas more than others.  What is being done to identify best practice, and ensure it is implemented, and find ways and means where that can be better value for money?  It may be related to the amount of time staff spend travelling to outlying districts.  When resources are scarce it is important to try to effect as much saving as possible through better value for the money that is being spent.In regard to the criteria and the categories one to five, categories four and five are taken as the most serious.  Dr. Kavanagh referred to the oral health needs and the overall needs.  One of the areas not always considered is the psychological implications for some people of having teeth out of place which may not fit into category four or five.  Is any account being taken of that in the review of needs given that it is a serious issue for a small number of young teenagers, who are very embarrassed because of the condition of their teeth, who do not fit into category four and five but they need to be addressed.My final question is on the orthodontic review and the whole question of oral health.  I have been informed that an increase in oral cancer is being detected by some dentists.  Is that an issue?
#BobbyAylward	unknown-#BobbyAylward-party	unknown-#BobbyAylward-dob	unknown-#BobbyAylward-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I welcome the delegation and thank it for its presentation.  The focus is on the new national oral health strategy, which is welcome and sounds good on paper but I hope that is the case when it is rolled out, and that there will be an end to waiting lists.  It is all about primary care and early intervention at an early age.Like my colleague Deputy Condon, however, I would be worried about people who have been missed over the years because while children might be assessed early, they do not get treatment until they are 15 or 16, when their teeth have developed.  There are many children and worried parents who are anxious to get access to treatment but who cannot afford it.  Will the new strategy help those people?  Orthodontic treatment is very expensive.Early intervention and primary care are vital, it should go without saying.  The old adage, a stitch in time saves nine, is right in this case.I am from the south east.  Why is the waiting list in my region longer than in the rest of the State?  Is it because of the consultant who died?  I am glad to hear the new consultant has been appointed.
#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I welcome the delegation.  I wanted to mention Crumlin and Tallaght, the areas serviced by the HSE in Old County Road.  My attitude to dental care and, indeed, to my own teeth, can be traced back to the Old County Road health centre.  It was half a century ago but it was there I learned what I should do about my own teeth.  It is important to make that point in supporting the service, that is where young people learn about dental care.Since I served on the health board, I have been aware that orthodontic treatment was a problem.  I know from Old County Road that about 90 patients every three months are sent for further assessment and treatment to St. James's Hospital.  The problem then arises that the assessment is done quickly but the treatment does not happen quickly.  There is not a month where I do not have representations from people lamenting that delay.It is important we get the message across about dental care.  We should also stress that when children have problems, they should be assessed properly and treated.  I have difficulties accepting the criteria for the delivery of treatment because we have all seen cases where people seek the HSE service but are told they do not fulfil the criteria.  They go to an expensive private practice that then tells them differently.We should support the service.  There are constraints, with those on medical cards not getting service, another appalling vista.  I am not ambushing the witnesses but we are saying to young people that they should be careful about their teeth but then failing to deliver a service.  That is the challenge.

It displayed an admirable ambition to improve a system that needs radical change.  We wish them well and will assist and encourage them in their work.Deputy O'Hanlon mentioned the complement of dentists and orthodontists working in the public system.  How many of them are there, how many vacancies are there and how is the public sector recruitment moratorium impacting the system?  Following the death of the consultant in the south, how long does it take for the HSE to fill such a vacancy?Members have alluded to the cost of treatment here and the significant numbers now travelling abroad to access treatment.  While one would expect treatment across the Border to be of a high standard, what about who travel to other European countries?  It is one thing to go for initial treatment but what happens if something goes wrong?  What is the follow-up care like?We have seen the HSE acting effectively and forcefully to deal with the cost of medication in the system and have seen the confrontations it has had with the pharmacy sector.  What is the HSE doing to drive down costs in dental services?  On average, how many consultations would a HSE dentist have in one day?Having had discussions with Dr. McNamara, it would be remiss not to refer to the training programme he has devised.  The passion he has for his profession and the capacity he displayed to deal speedily with the waiting list system are admirable.  Is the course he has plotted reflected in the system Dr. Kavanagh is putting in place?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	26	The index of treatment need was also raised.  It has been introduced nationally since 2008 and all areas are now participating, with children being assessed in accordance with the index of treatment need, with the top two categories, the most severe categories, currently entitled to public HSE care.  The introduction of the five categories means there has been an increase of 24% in the number of children eligible for care.  It varies in different regions but it has opened up entitlement for children instead of restricting it.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	27	What is the waiting list for categories 4 and 5?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	28	When I spoke about having more clarity around waiting lists, some areas put category 5 lists as separate and those waiting lists, the most complex and severe, are generally seen within six months to a year.  In other areas they are not listed separately, an initiative I want to look at.  It is crucial that those children are pulled out separately and looked at.  As part of that complex, I will ask the clinician to comment on it.  There is also a particular category of patients where it is not in their best interest to see them early, we must stand back, and I would argue that they should not be part of the overall waiting list.  It does not make the waiting list transparent.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	29	When talking about patients with growth deficiencies or anomalies, many of them must finish growing at 18.  We keep them under review so they come back and we track their growth.  Some children, even when they reach the age of consent, may decline treatment.  The majority of those patients would be those for facial surgery, orthognathic surgery, which ties in with our oral maxillofacial surgeon.  Some of these patients are sent to us at age eight and we know at that age they will have a large bottom jaw, for example.  We keep track of them and at 18 invite them to visit the oral maxillofacial surgeon and put the treatment plans to them.  The majority then make their own decision.Some patients with growth anomalies or syndromes benefit from earlier surgery so those patients are not put on the waiting list, they are treated when they are ready.  It is the same with children with cleft lip and palate.  There are different stages of treatment for them: age nine for bone graft, orthodontics in their mid-teens and then potentially facial surgery when they have completed their growth between 17 and 19.  They go on a waiting list technically but come off almost straight away.  They are closely tracked.  They are my high priority patients.We want a national approach to children with cleft lip and palate.  We must sit down and consider them in addition to those with special needs.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I emphasise once again that there must be greater clarity on the interpretation of that waiting list.  It is not just a block waiting list, and that is what the initiative is about: putting in place different categories so the list is clearer and less worrying for people looking at it.  They will be able to see why clinicians are waiting and where the problems lie.  In some cases there are problems but we want to address and target them by putting the initiative in place.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	31	About 10% of our waiting lists, as we are currently counting them, fall into that category at any one time.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	34	The Deputy asked specifically where the pilot would be carried for the initiative.  We have an agreement with the integrated service area in the mid-west that the pilot will take place there.  The local consultant has been involved in discussions on it.  That is an area where I am concerned about the waiting lists, so it is important to look at some of the early intervention in other parts of the country.  We estimate that 26% of children on the waiting list may benefit from that early intervention.  We could see similar results in the mid-west, then look at the prioritisation on the waiting list to achieve real numbers.I am not familiar with the previous training scheme but if it had a primary care element, it was about primary care, intervention and support.  This is about supporting the specialists and consultants in place, it is not about replacing them; that is the distinction.  It is not about doing the same work because they are trained to do a particular type of work.  It is work that is completely within the general dental practitioners' capacity, although there must be some upskilling and we will look closely at that in a clinic audit of outcomes.  It is a good way forward and with the support of the mid-west managers, the ISA, and the local consultant we are optimistic about the pilot in the mid-west.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	35	I re-enforce Dr. Kavanagh's point.  I support the initiative in the mid-west.  We met the consultant and he is happy that the initiative is under way.  It is not quite the same scheme as 11 years ago but the consultant is satisfied with our thinking.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	36	I am not happy that the recommendation from two committees in 2002 and 2005, that the training programme provided by a number of orthodontists in the former Mid-Western Health Board area should be reinstated immediately, has been ignored.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	37	I attended at least one of those committees and fully supported the recommendations at the time.  There was an issue about getting accreditation and achieving recognition here and elsewhere.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	39	I am well aware of that and they are still working with us.  We are trying to address the situation at present.  We have discussed that fully with Dr. McNamara.  I am confident we can make a serious impact now in the mid-west with the waiting list.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	40	With regard to the question about the number of trainees, and how many clients they take off our waiting list, in the Cork programme, the postgraduate programme had its first intake in 2006, when four students were placed on the programme.  They were sponsored by the HSE with a commitment to enter employment.  As part of the programme, each student took on 125 clients for treatment over the three year programme, so the postgraduate training programme took 600 patients off the waiting lists.  They qualified successfully in 2009, with a number of treatments to finish, because orthodontic treatment can take a long time.  We decided, in conjunction with the postgraduate training school, that it would be better for those students, who are now employees of the HSE, to complete those treatments.  They spent one day a week when they started with the HSE completing the treatments.  The fact that a fifth of their working week was taken up in that way impacted on their ability to take on new clients but we felt it was in the best interests of those clients at that point in their treatment.Four more students were then taken in.  Because of the increase in supply in orthodontists, no sponsorship was offered to these four students but they undertook the programme anyway.  Those four students are now taking on another 125 patients each from the waiting lists in the HSE south-west region.Our four postgraduate qualified students are now employed in the HSE fulfilling their sponsorship requirements.  Our initial plan for those students was that they would tackle the waiting lists, which were extensive.  They commenced with us in October and then, unfortunately, on 10 October, Dr. Ian O'Dowling passed away, much to our surprise.  It was a tragic event.  He was prolific in his work and he had a caseload of approximately 600 clients, who we had to take over for transfer.  In that regard, we had to assess all of the clients, arrange for their transfer and take those transfers over.  Those clients have been distributed to the consultant and the specialist orthodontists.  In the interim, we had employed two additional specialists, and we have employed now a total of six specialists for HSE south, that is, Cork and Kerry, which is a significant increase on what we had.  They have taken on the clients.On caseloads and waiting lists, we would expect that every year a specialist would have approximately 350 persons in treatment.  Obviously, the treatment goes on over a two to three-year period and we would expect them to finish out approximately 150 cases per year.  Each of the specialists this year took on approximately 60 of the transfer clients and some of them were allocated to the consultant based on the complexity of the case.  They have taken on 60 transfer clients each this year.  We expect that they will have completed that treatment by the first quarter of next year.  Each specialist is expected in 2010 to take on approximately 100 new clients off our waiting list — because they have taken 50 transfers.On our strategy, we also managed to replace the late Dr. O'Dowling.  I fully appreciate that it takes the HSE a long time with the recruitment process, but we were very luck in this instance.  Ian died in October and his replacement consultant took up post in February of this year.  Obviously, he was working in another area, and he is tailing off his treatments in his former place of employment and building up his caseload with us.  He is currently with us three days a week and he has a two-day commitment to finish out his clients so that the other part of the HSE is not disenfranchised by our good fortune to place him.That is a very significant investment in HSE south west.  We are spending a total of €4.25 million and we have 37 persons employed in the orthodontic service at present.  That includes: two consultants, six specialists and a number of dentists, and the nurses and the associated staff.  That is our strategy for dealing with the waiting list and that is our expectation.It will take us some time to get through the waiting list but we are making progress.  We had a bit of a set back because of Dr. O'Dowling's untimely death, but we are confident in our strategy and we fully agree with Dr. Kavanagh's approach of trying to get the functionals in early and treated.  One of our issues is the longer one is on a waiting list, the more complex one's treatment becomes.  We are kind of caught up in that trap at present but we are beginning to address that.  We are fairly confident that we will address our waiting lists and get back to the best practice standards for early assessment, intervention and treatment.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	41	I want to answer Deputy Conlon's question on the current school services where they go in at second, fourth and sixth classes.  There must be a change in our policy.  That policy was developed in 1988 originally, and then further developed from the dental action plan in 1994.  We need to update that action plan.  Early intervention, much earlier assessment of children, is necessary for all the reasons to which we have alluded which means that instead of starting seeing them at second class, we need to have an overall policy change.  That involves putting our heads together, not just around orthodontics and the specialist services, but a huge involvement from primary care, and including the contractors involved, to see what is the best for the population and to look forward at pulling back.  It is all about earlier intervention and seeing what are the interventions that will be of most benefit to children going forward.  Alluding to that, I do not want to just keep focusing on those three classes, because we want to look at children's policy and the context of primary care delivery in a very different way.It was discussed in the appointment of oral surgeons and oral maxillofacial surgeons as well.  That is crucial.  That is why I do not want to have it be an orthodontic review group.  That is why I specifically said that when we are looking at policy, we look at it as specialists so that instead of appointing ever more orthodontists and specialists — currently, we have 44 whole-time equivalents of specialist orthodontists in place and we have a further seven whole-time equivalent senior dental surgeons in orthodontics, and a further two dental surgeons specifically around orthodontics and almost ten consultant orthodontists available — into the orthodontic service, it is now timely for us to stand back and say, in fact, to support those specialists and consultants who are currently in place, it may be more important that we now move forward into appointing more oral surgeons and maxillofacial surgeons and different specialists and consultants to support them, and different services in that regard.  Ms FitzPatrick may wish to comment on the whole-time equivalents.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	42	On the number of persons in training at present, there are two post-graduate students about to commence their third year training in Dublin and there are two first-year postgraduates due to commence training in Dublin this coming autumn.  The two postgraduates who are going into third year have been sponsored by the HSE and have committed to a pay-back period of four years under their sponsorship agreement.  The two new post-graduates are not being sponsored by the HSE.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	43	I have a short question, which really leads into the next session.  The delegation, in particular, Dr. Kavanagh, referred to primary dental care quite a bit in terms of how the services will be reorganised, etc., and also in terms of the schools in response to Deputy Conlon, but we are about to have a session on circulars that have been issued and limitations on dental interventions that are allowed, under both the medical card scheme and the PRSI scheme.  I might address my question to Ms Cody.  Will there be flexibility on the part of the Department of Health and Children and the HSE to permit the kind of developments in which orthodontics wants to engage, with the primary level being very much involved in the simpler treatments and also in the referrals?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	44	We will be working closely with Dr. Kavanagh and the HSE on developing the orthodontic services and oral health policy generally.  Dr. Kavanagh referred earlier to our need to develop issues in skill mix and that will be an area which will be addressed in the oral health policy.  We will be working closely together on those areas.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	45	Those circulars that have been sent around might need to be reviewed in that regard, and in many other ways as well.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	56	Can I make a comment on that?  One of the difficulties with recruiting consultant orthodontists into Ireland is that it is a personal reason to move to an area.  I did all my training in the UK non-sponsored.  We do not have a training programme in Ireland and there is not one north of the Border either.
#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	57	They had one in Limerick, Deputy Neville stated, and it was abolished.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	58	No, I am referring specifically to consultant orthodontists.  There are a number of Irish citizens training in the UK at present who may express interest.  That is the way it tends to work at this point.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	59	From a management perspective, orthodontics is a matter in respect of which I have had a particular interest for a number of years.  We are obliged to work under the recruitment moratorium.  While it is an exempted post, there are other restrictions in terms of the numbers of clients.  It is a struggle for all of us because a nurse could leave tomorrow and that could prevent something from happening.  We do prioritise.  I brought it this far and we managed to have the consultant replaced.  We are lucky in that cross-cover will be provided by the second consultant to replace that.  We have six specialists plus the other staff working in the service at present.  Personally, I will be doing everything possible and using whatever means that are available to me — in the context of the Government moratorium on recruitment into the public service — to ensure that we have adequate strategies in place for replacement.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	60	I would hate the position to revert to where it stood previously.  It is obvious that we are going to make progress and I would hate to see a reversion in the future.  I would like a reply to my question with regard to people with intellectual disabilities and anaesthetists.

I am still not clear on what they stated in respect of staffing levels.  It was stated that 63 people are working as specialists, in some way or other.  Are there vacancies within that cohort of 63 which have not been filled?  Are there other general dentists in the mix or is that the entire cohort of staff at present?  With regard to caseloads, what number of people will a typical HSE dentist see at his or her clinic?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	62	Is the Chairman referring to specialist orthodontists?
#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	63	How many people will, on average, be seen by dentists who operate in HSE clinics each day?  We will not have an opportunity to deal with a number of the questions that have been asked on this occasion.  We will correspond with our guests and send to them copies of the transcript of these proceedings.  Perhaps they can write back to us and address some of the questions to which I have referred.  We are operating under severe time constraints today.  Perhaps our guests could wrap up on the points I have raised.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	64	There are approximately 44 whole-time equivalent specialist orthodontist posts across the country.  In common with other areas, difficulties arise when staff go on unexpected leave.  That results in our being obliged to transfer cases to other clinicians, which slows matters down in respect of removing people from the waiting list.Essentially, there are 12 consultant orthodontists operating in posts across the country.  That is a significant number when one considers that if somebody is commencing orthodontic treatment and receives a new cohort of patients, he or she will see 13 patients per day, five days a week for a six-week period.  That is the start-up position.  After that, they might see 20 or 22 patients.  It depends on the mix of cases that come before them.  If they are carrying out simple procedures such as those relating to archwire changes, these might take ten minutes to complete.  If they are doing bondup procedures — that is, putting in place braces on the top and bottom teeth — these will take an hour at a time.  The position varies depending on the complexity of the case.

Before we begin, I advise that by virtue section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2010 witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  I am sure this will not be necessary but I shall continue.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such as way as to make him or her identifiable.The association's paper has been circulated. I apologise for running over time but the subject matter is important.  The committee would like to hear Mr. Hourihan's executive summary, following which members will have a number of questions.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	67	I will introduce my colleagues.  Dr. John Nolan is a dentist in Glasthule, County Dublin, and he participates in the medical card scheme; Dr. Jane Rehehan, chair of our public dental surgeons group.  She works in Blanchardstown, Dublin, and supervises the administration of the medical card scheme in north-west Dublin, Dr. Billy Davis, a dentist in Dublin and president of the association, and Ms Clare Dowling, an official with the association.This scheme is essentially there to benefit the elderly and those with severe medical conditions and it is important that we see the scheme as being essential to avoid people being left in a situation where they are relying on a diet of jam and toast.  The typical profile of patients is female, over 40 and wearing dentures, very often with poor diet and gum disease.  I ask that members try to imagine if in the morning they lost their teeth what that would mean in terms of not being able to eat, converse, smile or talk to people.  The scheme has the benefit of tipping the balance between a healthy lifestyle and ostracisation and poor health.I am sure the committee does not want me to labour the recent background and history but, to summarise, the scheme has worked successfully for a number of decades.  The HSE has now decided at 24 hours notice to effectively restrict the scheme to emergency cover only for 1.6 million people.  We believe this will cause chaos, hardship and confusion to patents.  In our summary, we detail that on pages 13 to 32 and if I were to ask that members only read one section, I would ask them to read the evidence given in the first tab where we give a sample of the experience of a number of dentists.  We are now seeing the denial of treatment to cancer patients, special needs patients, the elderly, patients requiring dental checks ahead of major surgical operations, patients with acute infections and many others dentists believe fall into high risk circumstances.  That is graphically illustrated in the examples we give.Clearly, it has implications for the 1.6 million people and their families and for dentists.  It also has implications for children and special needs patients.  I listened with interest to the previous discussion and I am fearful there will be a spillover in regard to the availability of care for children with special needs.  We have evidence in our submission of the cost benefit.  It is a value for money scheme.  Not only is prevention cheaper than short-term savings; this is an extremely cost efficient, value for money scheme.  The fees paid to dentists are controlled by the State.  They are half of what dentists charge ordinarily privately for most of the major treatments so there is no question it is a good scheme, which should be kept.  The damage being done now is profound and will cause untold hardship for the very people who most need the assistance of the State.The scheme operates on the basis that eligible persons are provided with routine dental treatment.  That would comprise pain relief, preventative care such as cleanings and fillings, emergency care, which would be extractions or root canal treatment, and denture and denture repairs.  It does not give me pleasure to remind the committee that the last time we were here we warned of the possibility of the rationing of dentures.  Unfortunately, we are now seeing that come to pass and it is quite despicable that the very people who most need the assistance of the State are now being punished in addition to cutbacks to the PRSI scheme.  It is important to point out that the people who hold medical cards have rights and entitlements under the Health Act 1970 and that these rights extend to include dental treatment.  Therefore, there is every possibility that people may choose to go to the courts to vindicate their rights.  There has been an increase of more than 300,000 in the number of medical card holders since 2005.  However, in the recent budget the Government decided to restrict spending to 2008 levels, despite the fact that in the past two years alone, we have 270,000 more people whom the HSE wants treated.  The funding in 2008 was obviously sufficient for 2008, but now when we have more than a quarter of a million extra — 270,000 more people — the HSE thinks the service can still be provided with 2008 funding levels.Committee members are aware that the PRSI scheme, which benefits more than 1.5 million people, has been restricted to examination only.  Therefore, in the history of the State, we are seeing an unprecedented onslaught on dental services.  Unlike medical general practice, the State offers no assistance to dentistry.  Dentists fully fund their own service and what little support the State offered up to now has disappeared in one fell swoop, in one budget.  We are now beginning to see the consequences of that.  The text of the infamous circular, which was issued at the end of April, is detailed on pages 10 and 11 of our submission, but I will not go through it now in any detail.  Suffice to say, it essentially restricts treatment to emergency circumstances only.  To compound matters, there has been no definition given of emergency cover and the content of the circular is as ludicrous as it is vague.  We never got a commencement date and there is no definition or guidance as to what constitutes an emergency or the procedures to be followed.  Legal proceedings have been commenced and two dentists have secured an injunction, confirmed by the Supreme Court, entitling them to operate the scheme which had been agreed over many years.The consequences of the recent changes are that more than 1.6 million people will be denied routine treatments, including fillings, extractions, dentures, denture repairs and treatment of gum disease.  Hospitals, HSE clinics and services for children with special needs may well become overcrowded, because the HSE continues to be statutorily bound to provide cover or dental treatment for these people.  However, it now refuses to fund it, despite agreements it already has with dentists.  Besides the health cost, there is a serious financial cost for a particular group, elderly people over 50.  This situation is detailed in our presentation.  We estimate that a person with no natural teeth will face an additional annual bill of more than €232, while somebody who retains some of his or her teeth is likely to face an annual bill of €412, despite the fact these people are entitled to free dental treatment from the State as medical card holders.  Other socially disadvantaged patients will also lose out.Evidence of the impact of the recent changes can be seen in dental surgeries.  Twelve months ago, dentists with medical card patients would have seen from 15 to 20 patients a day, but that number has now reduced to two or three patients a day.  The damage in terms of patients' dental health will not become apparent for some months or years and problems that are only minor in nature now will become serious.  This applies in terms of dental health and the economic cost of treatment.  We present examples of likely outcomes from page 17 onwards of the presentation.  As can be seen, the people who are paying the price, in terms of their health, are the most vulnerable.  They are people in their 80s, people with rare medical conditions, people on Warfarin, people with special needs, people who require a dental check-up prior to major invasive surgery, people who require significant periodontal treatment, patients in psychiatric institutions who have been refused treatment and patients who are routinely denied dentures.  We are aware of 84-year-old patients who have been denied clearance for dentures.  We have seen nervous patients who require IV sedation being denied treatment.  We have seen patients who require a certificate of dental fitness prior to surgery being denied treatment.  We have seen cancer patients who require surgery being denied treatment and people with diabetes and severe dental diseases denied treatment.This is happening in a climate where HSE staff have been given no guidance on how to deal with the situation.  No operational guidelines have been issued and no definitions of emergency treatment have been provided.  We are seeing nothing less than chaos in dental surgeries throughout the country.  This is not fair on patients, on dentists or on anyone who has anything to do with the system.  Dentists are being compromised and the HSE approach is unsafe, unworkable and unethical.  We have serious concerns, which are shared by other parties, that dentists are ethically compromised by this whole approach.  No provision has been made or no definition provided for emergency circumstances.  Patients are being denied treatment and their functional ability to eat and speak is clearly affected, which causes unnecessary pain, suffering and embarrassment.  In response to a parliamentary question, the Minister for Health and Children gave a definition of an emergency for the purpose of approval of a denture and said it was pretty much linked to the functional ability to eat and speak.  However, no definition has been issued to the system at large with regard to dentures or any other treatment.  There is absolute chaos in the system.On page 27 of our presentation, we provide a summary of criticisms made by four principal dental surgeons who have responsibility for the medical card scheme.  Prior to Dr. Kavanagh's appointment — which we welcome — they were the only people to whom the HSE turned for advice on this scheme.  A circular attached in the appendices of our presentation demonstrates that just two months after this unilateral change, there is nothing less than absolute chaos in the system.  Patients are not being treated, but being put on waiting lists and left in distress, while dentists are equally distressed because they are unable to treat them.  The procedure to obtain approval of requests for treatment is not feasible because the resources are not there to cope with it.  The situation previously was that dentists could proceed with certain routine procedures, but had to obtain prior approval for more elaborate treatments such as dentures and root canal treatments.  Now, prior approval is required for every procedure.  Members can imagine the administrative chaos this causes.  No guidance is being given and dentists must ring up to obtain information.  The HSE does not have sufficient dentists to treat those requesting treatment.  Our worst fears never envisioned the chaos that exists.The change in practice has an impact on dentists' incomes and dentists with a heavy reliance on medical card holders are seeing a significant reduction of up to 80% in their monthly income.  I have been informed that some dentists will have to close their practices and have no doubt this will happen.  This will compound problems for medical card patients, who will have to travel further for more limited services.  The changes also have an implication for services provided by dentists employed by the HSE to treat children under 16, the provision of the school screening programme and the care of special needs patients.  Cork Deputies are well aware of particular problems in this regard and the four-year waiting list for special needs patients, which is outrageous.  This problem will get worse and will spread throughout the country.I would like to reassure the committee that the dental services scheme is a cost effective scheme that provides value for money.  The National Consumer Agency carried out a survey of fees recently which demonstrated that fees paid to dentistry through medical card patients are only half the fees charged to private patients.  Therefore, the scheme provides cost effective treatment and, as we say, prevention is cheaper than cure.  Some of the committee members may recall that in regard to PRSI we commissioned a cost-benefit analysis which showed that the cost to the State of maintaining this scheme was between two and three times the cost of operating the scheme.  Equally, to abolish the scheme, as we have seen with the social welfare scheme, there will be greater costs in the short term as well as in the medium and long term.Since the budget, we have sought and suggested negotiations and meetings with the Minister for Health and Children.  We have suggested that supplementary funding be arranged and we have had no response, good or bad, to that suggestion.  Instead, what happened on 26 April is that the HSE issued a circular with 24-hour effect and we are now seeing the consequences.  From reading the parliamentary questions, I know the Deputies are now beginning to get constituents knocking on their doors——

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	69	No, they do not get answers, no more than Deputies get answers to their questions from the HSE.  Unfortunately, the people who are knocking on the Deputies' doors are only a fraction of the total number of patients attending surgeries who have been denied treatment by the HSE in a very callous and cynical manner.We are not oblivious to the fact that savings will have to be made.  The pity is there was not a willingness to sit down as we had suggested immediately after the budget to explore ways in which savings could be made.The committee should use its powers to prevail upon the HSE to set aside this circular and to see what can honestly be provided to medical card holders.  On one side of the equation, people have medical cards and they are entitled to treatment by the HSE.  The HSE has a statutory obligation to provide that treatment and it is not happening.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	70	I thank the Irish Dental Association for its presentation.  The words, "crude" and "chaos" are used.  I fail to understand why the HSE, unilaterally and without any consultation, would cut the services at the level it cut them.  I can understand that savings have to be made.  We all accept that.  However, the daily number of medical card dental patients is down from 50 to 20 to two and three.  This indicates how the situation has changed.We all accept that oral health is very important.  We were told that as children.  Now there has been an intervention which counteracts that statement.  We were all told about the importance of preventative work in oral health but this policy seems to have been abandoned.I refer to a young woman suffering from major psychiatric illness who was refused gum treatment by the HSE, despite the fact that she spent the past six months in a psychiatric hospital.  Her teeth were fine before admission but now she needs six fillings and gum treatment and according to the new guidelines she can only have two fillings and no provision for swollen, bleeding gums.  How does one respond to that?  I refer also to the case of a 17-year old girl who requires five fillings prior to commencing orthodontic treatment at Cork Dental Hospital.  She was advised by the hospital to have the fillings done prior to treatment.  This was clearly documented as a clinical necessity but it was not approved.  The HSE did not accept that it should be done for a girl who is 17 and awaiting orthodontic treatment.  Considering the waiting lists for orthodontic treatment, she must be in a serious condition.  I have another example of a 73-year old woman who needs three fillings replaced.  She has Parkinson's disease and tends to fracture fillings, thus the need to replace them.  She was refused treatment.  How can one answer this?  Has the service really deteriorated to that extent?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	71	Yes.  Will I respond to that question now?

#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	73	Yes.  The Minister and Professor Drumm will be in attendance this afternoon and I will raise it with them.  That is the best we can do at the moment.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	74	It is a pretty sad and sorry situation.  It seems that the balancing of books has taken priority over the needs of patients.  It is not just in the circular.  I have read the two appendices, the two letters from the four lead principal dental surgeons, one letter dated April and the other dated June.  They are saying there is no engagement with them on the situation.  A decision was made at senior level in the HSE, without any discussion with the clinical lead dentists in the four regions, not to mind the dentists themselves.  They are not even told the guidelines for an emergency and yet they are the people who must decide whether a case is an emergency.  This circular needs to be withdrawn and there needs to be proper engagement on the needs of patients.  I cannot imagine the kind of pain that some people are suffering and the associated problems.  I have read about the woman who lost a tooth from her denture and she was told that this is not a priority or an emergency so she has to live with a gap in her teeth.  I refer to people in pain and those needing operations.  I refer to a case of a person requiring cancer treatment but who needed dental treatment first.  The cancer treatment had to be delayed because approval was required for the dental treatment.  This is a crazy situation.  We all read the examples in the presentation.  I was struck by one from a dentist who stated that a patient came in at 5.30 p.m. on a Friday with two broken front teeth as a result of an accident.  The person could not reach the surgery earlier because he or she had no car and had to get a bus.  The dentist was concerned that he would not be able to get anybody to approve the treatment because it was after 5 p.m. on a Friday evening.Deputy Neville is correct that we are being told all the time and again this morning that early intervention and preventative work is meant to be the policy throughout the health services.  Clearly, in this case, it is not being implemented.  People are being put in a situation where their treatment is happening later than is appropriate.  The Irish Dental Association is here today but my primary concern — and I am sure that of the dentists here — is the patients, the people who are not getting the service they need.  We have to get through to the HSE and the Minister this afternoon to ensure that this issue is not just left to high-level people trying to control budgets while there is no engagement at the real level, between the people deciding on budgets and those administering and implementing the patient care.  Members of the committee must make our voices strongly heard on this issue.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	75	I thank Mr. Hourihan for his presentation.  I share his concern.  I never want to see a patient in need of treatment, particularly urgent treatment, not receive that treatment.  There is a difficulty in finding solutions to the problem. The main difficulty has always been there, sometimes worse than other times, that we do not have sufficient money to do everything we would like to do.  This has always been an issue in the health service in particular.  We are spending 27% of the total budget on health services in the current year.  That is €15 billion.There are competing priorities because every group we meet identifies gaps in the service it provides, which need to be filled.  The difficulty is to work out how one deals with the competing priorities.  The State is responsible for those depending on the health service's own dental service, namely, the contract it has with the Irish Dental Association and the dental service of the Department of Social Protection.  The first issue is whether it is possible to get better value for the money spent.  I am interested in hearing the views of witnesses on the matter and what their priorities would be as they are at the coal face and they can see the opportunities.  It is obvious that funding is not available to address all the outstanding issues.The suggestion was made to drop the circular.  There is merit in what was said about discussions with the Health Service Executive and perhaps with the Minister and officials in the Department to see how we can ensure maximum efficiency is received by patients for the money being spent.  Like my colleagues I would be glad to raise the issues the witnesses have addressed with the Minister in the afternoon.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	76	What strikes me about the two presentations we have heard today is that it is like Alice in Wonderland.  It means what one wants it to mean or what one thinks it means.  On the one hand we have an excellent strategy from the first delegation which tells us that oral hygiene in its holistic form is essential to our health.  I read an article in recent months which indicated that one of the major contributors to heart conditions is bacteria that are allowed to develop in one’s mouth.  That shows the importance of oral hygiene.On the other hand dentists are probably the only group to which people do not willingly go.  It is not like plastic surgery.  People are not going because they want to.  The representatives of the Irish Dental Association know what I am talking about.  They are the one group of medics where one does not walk out of the surgery with a prescription that will keep one happy for the next month.  It is a case of immediate treatment which most people do not like, possibly because more than anything else one cannot see what is being done.  One goes because it is necessary or because one is in such pain that one has no option.  This is not a service people abuse.  Two of the fundamental steps forward in terms of health care in this country in recent years were choice of dentist and choice of doctor.  For people who could not afford it themselves, those were the two major steps forward in terms of health care and social development in this country.  It is a retrograde step for that to be removed.  We should not allow it to happen.  The witnesses were dead right in their presentation.  People on medical cards probably need dental care more than anyone else, yet it is limited.No reference was made to a case study about which I am very worried which relates to a young woman whom I know who suffers from a dry mouth.  Until I met her I did not know that one's saliva keeps one's teeth healthy.  Her teeth are in constant need of maintenance as a result.  She is now being told that she can only avail of a limited service.As Deputy O'Hanlon indicated, we will raise the matter in the afternoon but the purpose of the meeting should be to find solutions.  I am amazed to hear that each particular treatment must be approved either before or after it is carried out.  I accept the Irish Dental Association desperately wished to negotiate with the Department of Health and Children but most general practitioners work on a fee per patient basis as opposed to a fee per treatment.  Would dentists be open to discussing the matter with the Department in terms of the delivery of service to people with medical cards?This is probably the one service that will not be abused in terms of people going to see their dentist every Monday morning.  That is not quite how it works.  It is outrageous to remove it, especially in light of all the evidence which tells us that good oral hygiene is good for one's health.  We hear about primary care centres and the programme that was outlined to us today is fantastic.  However, on the practical side, when it comes to the poor, a service that could keep people healthy is being withdrawn.  The witnesses will have unanimous support from this side.
#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	77	I will be very quick.  I also welcome the delegation.  This is an important meeting.  I do not know why I differ from Deputy Lynch in that I am always happy to go to my dentist.  I went to the same dentist for decades until the poor man died.  I met him first on O'Connell Street and then he moved to Tallaght.  Some may remember Dr. Walsh.  I have been attending the Glenview dental practice in recent years.  It is important we attend dentists.  I must be careful how I phrase this.  My granddaughter cannot figure out why all my teeth are in place.  I always give credit to the example that was given to me.It is a pity we are restrained by the system in the sense that we cannot have a delegation, the Health Service Executive and representatives of the Department of Health and Children in the same room.  If that were the case we could challenge the perceptions.  I am sometimes cynical when we hear a presentation that mentions the word "chaos" so often but from my contacts with the service I know the delegation is correct.  People might be worried about my saying that from the Government benches but I am not a bit worried because that is what I hear.  I am approaching an age where I feel strongly about the issue.  Other colleagues have made the point that we all accept that adjustments and cuts must be made but I cannot get my head around this one.  The lack of communication and consultation is clearly an issue.  That is something local dentists talk to me about.  I am pleased the Irish Dental Association has appeared before the committee.  I hope the Chairman will advise us on how we should proceed.  I do not know whether we will ambush Professor Drumm on the issue later today but a strong message should come from the committee on the matter.
#MargaretConlon	unknown-#MargaretConlon-party	unknown-#MargaretConlon-dob	unknown-#MargaretConlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	78	I also welcome the delegation.  I do not wish to cover the same ground.  I share the delegation's concerns.  I spoke at the previous presentation on the concerns I have about children in particular who might fall through the cracks and not be able to avail of early intervention, which they should be able to, the damage that causes and the problems that result down the line.  That is a major concern for me.I appreciate and accept that books must be balanced, savings must be made and we must get better value for money.  I do not see how all of that can happen without meaningful consultation and engagement.  The delegation has indicated a willingness on its part to engage.  There is an onus on the Health Service Executive and the Department to facilitate the engagement.  How else will the problems be rectified and a plan put in place to ensure we have an efficient and effective service where those who need treatment get it?  At the same time I am mindful of the fact that there is not an infinite amount of money and savings must be made.  Like my colleagues I would be delighted to raise the matter in the afternoon when the Minister and Professor Drumm are present.
#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	79	The delegation can hear the strong support from committee members for the case that has been made.  We hear many presentations at this committee but very few that have been put together as well as this one.  The document is very useful to us.  It is fortuitous the delegation is present this morning in that we are to meet Professor Drumm and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, this afternoon.I echo the remarks of Deputy Conlon and others to the effect that when one considers the budget for the dental treatment services scheme, €63 million, which sum is set at the 2008 level, one assumes that active engagement would have taken place with the Irish Dental Association after the initial decision to determine how value for money could be achieved.  While the HSE has many major achievements to its credit, one of its great failings is the failure to communicate with the groups with which it must communicate to achieve results.  We will have to raise that this afternoon.Deputy Lynch referred to costs, which subject we raised with the last deputation before us.  Pharmacy costs have been lowered and dental service costs need to be lowered.  They will not be lowered if there is no engagement with the Irish Dental Association.  Has the association ideas on how this could be achieved?Mr. Hourihan stated the cost of dental treatment for medical card holders is 50% of the cost for the public.  Even at that, the figures compare adversely in this jurisdiction in respect of an individual being treated privately.  People are travelling out of the country for treatment.  What is the profession doing to lower costs in order that people will not be crossing the Border or going to Romania or elsewhere for surgery?  What is it doing to allow us to be sure of the standards that apply and that follow-up care is guaranteed?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	80	I will address that and a few of the other comments.  To anticipate what the HSE will say to the members on the lack of engagement, I believe there is a deliberate policy on the part of the HSE not to engage with professionals' representatives.  From legal proceedings, I know its argument tends to be that it intends to consult after introducing a circular.  That is not an acceptable answer and I anticipate that is what members will hear from the HSE this afternoon.With regard to costs, professional fees for dentists were reduced last year.  There is another exercise in this regard taking place at present.  The fees paid to dentists for medical cards, which fees are set by the State, are well below those paid in Northern Ireland.  While a medical general practitioner receives an average of €50,000 to €60,000 towards his running costs before a patient walks in the door, no such support is made available to dentists.  Dentists, when setting fees for private patients, must cover their costs.  They have no support from the State.  The running costs in the Republic are €100,000 greater than——
#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	81	Is Mr. Hourihan talking about the ancillary supports for clerical and administrative staff, IT equipment and so on?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	82	Yes.  Members have all been in a dentist's surgery and will know it is not simply a matter of going in and sitting on a chair.  There is very elaborate and expensive equipment in addition to disposables and other materials.  My colleagues would be better able to speak about this.The running costs in the Republic are €100,000 greater than in Northern Ireland.  The State offers no support, although it rightly does offer it to medical doctors.  The fees paid for medical card patients are well below those paid in Northern Ireland.  When talking about medical card patients' treatment and fees, it is important to understand that, whatever one may feel about private fees, for which there is an explanation, the issue to which I refer does not arise.Deputy Rory O'Hanlon asked about the solution.  The short-term solution will either involve considering the range of treatments provided or examining the fundamentals of the existing scheme which involves entirely free provision.  The medium-term to long-term solution involves capitation, to which Deputy Lynch referred.  The international consensus on dentistry is that the ideal solution would involve a blend of capitation and fees per item.  Capitation encourages prevention.  It is correct that there is no possibility of the money being anything other than well spent because it is only provided for treatments provided.The medium-term to long-term solution, which could be effected even sooner, is probably a blended system.  When the HSE and the Department indicate they are prepared to talk to us, I have no doubt that will be part of the agenda.  The more immediate solution is to consider the range of treatments and the basis on which they operate.  It is completely dishonest on the part of the HSE, in addition to being insulting and completely unprofessional, to write a circular without even consulting its own dentists or talking to dentists at large.  One will note there have been no notices to the public advising it as to its current entitlements.  Honesty on the part of the HSE, in addition to willingness to talk to us, is the first requirement if the problem is to be resolved.  There are steps that can be taken in the medium to longer term and I have no doubt they can be worked through.

We have indicated that if the HSE suspends the circular – it can be a suspension rather than a complete withdrawal – we will be happy to meet it.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	100	No, we are talking about a different landscape now.  Last year the PRSI scheme applied, as did the medical card scheme.  In a city practice, perhaps 30% of patients are PRSI patients, 20% to 40% are medical card patients and the remainder are private.  In inner city practices, 60% to 70% of patients may have medical cards.  These practices are being decimated.I am one of the beleaguered clinicians trying to make sense of the chaos and I welcome the sympathy of the committee.  We have signed a contract to treat medical card patients on the basis of the fees we agreed.  We have no argument with that.  Naturally, we were hoping to improve the scheme because developments in dentistry since the inception of the scheme in 1994 have greatly improved dental health.  We now are faced with a situation in which we have received a circular telling us that we may only treat patients in emergencies.  However, we do not know what constitutes an emergency as its definition has not been described to us.  We must contact someone like my colleague, Dr. Renehan, who is a public dental officer, to get approval for this.  As we sometimes cannot get such approval, what should we do in that situation?  We are on the ground, know what we must do and know what is best for the patient but are being prevented from so doing by this arbitrary circular.  This pertains to the most beleaguered section of society.  While I acknowledge the landscape has changed in the past two years in that the number of medical card patients has increased dramatically and the funding is not available, all we have to do is to negotiate and come to some sort of arrangement to get these poor patients out of this beleaguered position.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	101	Like my colleague, Dr. Nolan, I welcome the understanding and empathy evinced by members.  They obviously are meeting patients and know what is happening on the ground.  If I may expand a little, I am a principal dental surgeon and am responsible for the running of public dental services in the area of Dublin north-west.  It is an expanding area with many young children and has a considerable elderly population.  I am responsible for 34 contracted dentists and, at present, approximately 42,000 patients have medical cards.  In my experience of being a manager in the area, the dental treatment services scheme, DTSS, has been a wonderful scheme that has worked for the patients.  Each medical card patient has been able to walk into one of those 34 dentists to receive either basic routine care or emergency care.  In my role as principal dental surgeon monitoring the scheme, I saw all the approvals that came from the practitioners.  The money was well spent, any queries that needed to be made about taxpayers' money were monitored and I hope I did the duty charged to me.  This scheme was very well run and there was no fat in the system.  It is very difficult to find savings from a scheme that has been well operated and that has served the public well.  Moreover, I am impressed by the type of bona fide work that was done in many cases by many of my practitioners outside of the scheme.When the Minister for Finance announced in early December 2009 that funding for the DTSS was going to be reduced to the 2008 level of €63 million, all my colleagues throughout the country immediately began to put together proposals.  By mid-December, we had drawn up proposals as to how the savings could be made from a clinical perspective.  While we were not happy with this, we were considering some treatments that could be prioritised.  Early in January, the four lead principal dental surgeons formally approached senior management within the HSE and much engagement took place.  Meetings were held, proposals were made and documentation was drawn up.  We worked closely while conscious that time was ticking away and that we were not being listened to.  We were getting to April and still were getting no response, despite asking senior management.  When we met the Minister on 1 March 2010, we asked when the changes would be made.  To our frustration, on 26 April our private practice colleagues received a circular telling them what the cuts in the DTSS would entail even though we, as managers of the service who had engaged, received no communication.  To date, I still not have been written to in this regard.I do not know what the circular means because it did not reflect any of the discussions or engagements my colleagues had with senior management.  The documentation received by members today reflects two of the letters that were delivered to senior management.  Although I also could provide several more letters or e-mails that were sent to local health office managers or regional directors of operations, at present we continue to try to work within the circular but are unable to do so.  We have been asked to budget for an allocation of €63 million this year.  I checked this morning before appearing before the joint committee and to date, €59.3 million has been spent.  This system is about to collapse.  Were my colleague to ring me to ask whether he can examine a traumatised tooth this afternoon and were I to give approval, would he be paid?  If he will not be paid by the primary care reimbursement scheme, PCRS, should he approach me to ask for payment?My public dental service, which has eight dentists working in it, has been top-sliced and has many vacancies on foot of the recruitment moratorium.  I am working with a skeleton staff in an area where the number of children attending school classes is increasing in volume and in which we are unable to get to the routine service.  We cannot get to our second, fourth and sixth classes.  We are closing clinics over the summer to try to save money.  I was told during a telephone conference this week to make contingency plans as the HSE is running out of money and from now on I would be handling the medical card patients.  This will result in 42,000 patients visiting my eight dentists who cannot perform their own service.  For example, we cannot get to special needs patients.  With respect to my colleagues who appeared earlier, I only caught the end of their presentation.  While I am impressed that they are putting together an orthodontic presentation, the children have had cavities.  They need extractions, to have their teeth examined and prevention.  They need to have me talking to their teachers to get the healthy lunch policies running.  Why am I straightening decayed teeth?  It is a nonsense and this is in a shambles.My point is that the managers within the service still are prepared to engage.  I have attended today's meeting in my representative role as president of the Irish Dental Association's public dental surgeons' group but the real matter is that, this afternoon, I will return to the chaos and frustration involving the patients and my colleagues but I have no answers.  I am failing to carry out my job because I am not getting any help from senior management.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	103	If I may, I will echo Deputy Lynch's comments that the mouth is not an isolated part of the body but is part of its whole.  Oral health is a very important part of general health and one often sees things in the mouth that act as an indicator of what is going on in the rest of the body.  This must be borne in mind.  Deputy O'Hanlon mentioned things we would like to do.  We have come a long way from things we would like to do and it is about what we must do.  In this context, we must get a system that works.  Members have heard about all the things that are going on and this is something that must be done and that cannot be put off.

The joint committee is grateful to the witnesses for raising this matter with them, which members will continue to pursue as best they can.

#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	105	I welcome the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and the chief executive of the Health Service Executive, Professor Brendan Drumm, for a discussion on important health issues.  Before we begin, I advise them that, by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2010, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or persons or entity by name or in such as way a to make him or her or it identifiable.I welcome our guests.  I am conscious that this is probably the last time Professor Drumm will appear before the committee.  Members will have valedictory comments to make, but perhaps they will keep them until the end.  We have a number of important issues on the agenda and I want to stick as rigidly as possible to the schedule agreed in advance.  The Minister will make an opening statement for approximately five minutes and will be followed by Professor Drumm for a further five.  We have agreed that Professor Higgins will provide a synopsis of his paper on reconfiguration issues in the Cork-Kerry region which has been circulated to members.  We will take questions on his contribution first.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	106	I am pleased to appear before the joint committee and will try to abide by the Chairman's request that I speak for five minutes.Every developed economy that wants to provide a quality health service for its population is facing financial challenges.  Notwithstanding this and comparing like with like, we needed to reduce the HSE's budget in 2010 by €1 billion from the 2009 figure.  This posed a major challenge.  Some €650 million of the €1 billion is accounted for by pay reductions for staff, while the balance is accounted for by the reorganisation of services and value for money considerations.  It is estimated that the reduction in the cost of pharmaceuticals to the health care system, combined with last year's reforms, will save more than €300 million in a full year.Health service reform is guided by two factors, the first of which is quality.  We have established the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, and the current environment is one in which standards and outcomes govern where and how something happens.  I am pleased by the considerable improvement in cancer outcomes.  The recently published data for the 2002-06 period show an improvement of 10% in breast cancer outcomes on the data for the previous period, a significant improvement by any standard.  The same level of improvement applies to lung, prostate and other cancers.  We are in a period when standards and regulation drive health reform.In addition to HIQA and the setting and enforcement of standards, the patient safety commission and my Department are preparing legislation to introduce in 2012 the licensing and accreditation of health providers, beginning with acute hospitals.  This will address a major deficit in the regulatory framework.  We have also fundamentally changed the manner in which health professionals are regulated.  The Medical Council, the health and social care and the pharmacy professions are regulated in a modern context in which professionals are required to maintain their skills.  Competence assurance is a statutory requirement for all doctors in Ireland.  The regulatory bodies are governed by a lay majority which inspires public confidence and the confidence of the profession.Given the resource limitations, it is always a question of deciding on priorities.  We must ensure we continue to drive for value for money, not only in the manner in which we provide services, but in where they are provided, be it at hospital or community and primary care level.  The HSE's national service plan for this year requires it to provide more hospital services on a day case basis and reduce the number of admissions from accident and emergency units to hospitals by 33,000, which will be done by providing access to diagnostics and so on.  The greatest transformation is in the move to primary, continuing and community care, as the majority of health needs can be met at that level.As members may know, the outcomes of the resource allocation group were published last Friday.  The group makes interesting and radical suggestions on how to allocate resources.  Sometimes we spend a considerable amount of time debating how we can raise resources.  Of more significance is the question of how resources are allocated.  I hope to take the group's strong recommendations to the Cabinet for a decision in the autumn.  I look forward to engaging with the committee on the report, a fantastic piece of work by an independent group chaired by Professor Frances Ruane.I will limit my comments at this stage and will be delighted to take questions on specifics later.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	107	A number of questions have been asked, most of which have been responded to in writing, but I will comment on a couple of them.Medical and GP-only medical cards have proved to be significant issues for the committee.  As indicated previously, staff working in the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, which handles the €2.7 billion spent on demand-led schemes have been implementing plans to accelerate the delivery of services and reduce administrative costs.  In the few months since we last appeared before the committee considerable progress has been made.  The staff respond to the approximately 850 calls received each day in an average of 13 seconds.  As members might have seen in the media recently, we have launched the on-line medical card-GP visit card application service.  Applications for full cards made through this facility are being responded to and cards can be issued within 15 days if all of the necessary information is provided.  This is a major improvement on the traditional approach, in respect of which there could have been a wait of six to 12 weeks.  The public can still make inquiries and apply for cards through their local health offices if they choose to do so.  However, nine out of every ten applications are straightforward and the on-line process is suitable.  It is interesting that in the system's first three weeks of operation there were more than 3,000 applications, approximately 50% of which were made outside normal hours.  This shows the appropriateness of our approach.The second major issue is that of services for people with intellectual disabilities which has been topical recently.  The annual HSE budget for disability services is €1.5 billion, of which approximately 80% goes to disability service providers in the voluntary sector.  The recent media coverage of services for people with intellectual disabilities has shone a light on how these services are provided through multiple service providers and the costs involved.  During 2009 we introduced new service level agreements with service providers, strengthened our relationship with these organisations and clarified their responsibilities.  We will shortly be convening a working group which will, in the light of tightening budgets, examine how these service are delivered and how the many service providers might be able to introduce more streamlined processes to ensure they can maintain and increase front-line services.  Approximately 280 organisations are involved.  The group needs to examine opportunities for merging organisations, removing duplication of back office functions, reducing management structures and amalgamating and rationalising services relating to transport, estates management and maintenance.  These changes are never easy and will create many challenges for the staff and managers working in that large number of organisations.  However, such changes have been under way in many parts of the health service in recent years.  If we can work constructively with the voluntary sector, the changes will present opportunities to ensure a more efficient use of the resources we are spending on these services.As the Chairman mentioned, this is the last time I will appear before the committee as CEO of the HSE.  I can speak for my colleagues in taking the opportunity to thank members for the way in which they engaged in this process.  I say a particular word of thanks to the Chairman, as this is often a difficult environment in which to chair proceedings.  Without being patronising, he has dealt with us fairly at all times.  This is appreciated.  While our exchanges have been challenging, it is important that we be held accountable.  I have always asserted that we should try to give as much information as possible at these meetings.Many health services across the world are facing the same challenges, namely, how does one provide more with less money, a question raised by the Minister.  There is widespread acceptance internationally that the hospital dominated model of care, a model on which we were focused a number of years ago, is neither desirable for patients nor sustainable.  "Sustainable" is a word I often used when starting out.  More and more countries are focused on integrating hospital and community-based services to provide a more seamless journey for patients.  This is a significant undertaking for Ireland and every other country, but we are well advanced along the road.  Everything we will do now will be about integration.  At a practical level, this means that, starting from the point of contact with a GP, therapist, consultant or home carer, all services will be funded as a single service.  Prior to this, hospital and community services were always competing interests.  A single source budget can make a major difference and is already doing so in parts of the country in which there are integrated services.  When integrated services are provided, we find that even the staff are generally much happier in terms of their capacity to work for the good of the patient rather than protecting competing parts of the organisational structure.  This could never have been achieved under the old model of providing more hospital beds or putting more people into hospitals.The focus on integration applies equally to modernising personal social services.  Areas such as child care have presented major challenges.  There have been many arguments about whether they should even be provided through the health service model.  If we do provide for proper integration with proper primary care team structures at the front line, this is an ideal structure in which to provide personal social services.Today thousands of GPs and HSE staff are providing high quality care for almost 2 million people through primary care teams.  During the coming years the range of services they provide will expand.  We had to start from somewhere.  They will continue to grow and become excellent one-stop shops in communities throughout the country.  This could never have been achieved overnight; it will constantly evolve.  As part of our programme to improve services for people with mental health difficulties, we are also aligning the provision of community mental health services to a greater extent with primary care teams.  This is another major change for those who work in our organisation in terms of how they do their work.Hospital reconfiguration is always challenging but must take place if we reconfigure services.  To be fair, leadership has been shown, not only by clinicians and managers in reshaping services, but also by many political representatives in local areas.  It has been very constructive in terms of our capacity.  Yes, we have had battles about changes to local services, but politically, people have been constructive in engaging with us, discussing our data and, where possible, helping to explain these to local communities.  Thanks to the significant leadership shown by many local clinicians and managers, we are reshaping hospital services.  The reconfiguration which includes making it easier for community-based professionals to link directly with hospitals and for hospitals to link directly with community services is improving access, quality and convenience for patients.  It is taking us in a direction that a few years ago we would never have thought possible.  Two of the more advanced areas are Dublin north-east and the mid-west.  In the mid-west, with the reconfiguration of services and the creation of a medical assessment unit in Limerick, we have seen a reduction in the number of acute medical admissions.  In fact, the medical assessment unit only admits 16% of the patients it sees.  We have also seen the establishment of three community intervention teams as part of that reconfiguration, as well as state-of-the-art cardiac intervention services and intensive care centres.I give full regard to the development of clinical leadership which has been essential in driving change in the health service — health services across the world constantly struggle without it.  People such as Professor Higgins are critical in driving change in health services.  Significant change can be achieved, not only by doctors but also by nurses, therapists and others leading change.  For the first time ever in this country — certainly for the first time in a long time — we have clinical leadership that can bring about that change.  It would have been hard to imagine in 2005 that we would have so many clinicians who are active and willing in driving change and who even appear in public to defend it.  The implementation of this change can be an example internationally.We have had to work in a tightening financial environment and I am glad to say we have been able to reduce costs by €1 billion, while still increasing the services we provide.  We are providing care for more people than ever before with less money.  The building blocks are in place and the HSE is driving what I hope is unstoppable progress towards a fully integrated system, which is the only way forward.  The system must be high performance in terms of quality and safety — in fact, quality, safety and effectiveness tend to go together.  Actual performance measurement is now central to what this organisation does.  Again, this is a major step forward.  It will no longer be a case of providing funding for those who shout the loudest.While solid progress has been made, it would be naive in the extreme for me to believe we do not still have a long way to go.  New work practices must be bedded down in a difficult financial and HR environment.  However, there is now a groundswell of support among professionals for our goal of achieving an integrated and predominantly community-based health care system.  Coupled with the current roll-out of integrated service areas across the country which will empower local ownership, clinical leadership and decision making to areas the size of one to two counties, the HSE can deliver the high quality and consistent service the public deserves.  We must remain focused on the need to build a service that is sustainable and designed, first and foremost, to deliver an optimal service for service users, rather than providers.  Equally, we must continually and urgently challenge the rate of progress and the motivation of those who resist progress.  Real change requires absolute tenacity and does take time.  The quick fix approach can no longer be acceptable.  For years we wasted huge resources on maintaining a 1950s model of care which seems at times to be still much loved by some professionals from a bygone era.Ireland is now much more advanced than most countries in developing an integrated health care system.  It will be at least another five years before the integrated model of care is fully embedded.  Sticking with the change agenda is the vital challenge.  There is no doubt that in another five to ten years another change programme will start because medicine is a dynamic process.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	109	I will try to provide a synopsis of my report.  I was asked to take up the post of director of reconfiguration in early 2009.  It was not a post I had sought and I was reluctant, despite what Professor Drumm said about clinicians stepping forward, to take up the offer, as it was a very public role.  There was one key thing, however, that gave me the courage to step forward.  When I asked whether I would have access to expertise that would not normally be available, including expertise in business, academia and health, which would allow me to take on the role knowing I would be able to consider some of the challenges afresh and from a different viewpoint in finding solutions to the problems, I was told there was support for that concept and I was introduced to a group which was already in existence.  It was a group of individuals who were offering their help and expertise in a way that would be useful to the health system.  I expanded its membership to include a broader range of experts, particularly from education and health, and the group's first meeting was in September 2009, at which we worked on the terms of reference and decided to meet five or six times a year.At the time of our first meeting the management structure in the region was changing fundamentally and it took a number of months for us and the new regional management team to clarify how we would work together.  However, we have done this and established the group in consultation with the new regional management team, with the regional director of operations joining the non-executive advisory board.  We were able to agree a mechanism for the group to play a non-executive advisory role which would feed into the structural and reconfiguration agenda.The terms of reference of the group are clearly outlined.  I emphasise that this is not a decision-making body.  It has not played a role in deciding where services should be provided or what services should be provided in a particular hospital.  However, it does allow us, as I said, to draw on its members' experience in areas such as change management, cultural change within large organisations and staff motivation, important components of what we need to achieve within our region.No member of the group receives any remuneration.  The members do not receive any payment for the work they do or the advice they give; they do not even receive travel expenses.  From our point of view, the fresh ideas and new thinking that they bring are important.  I would emphasise that they are only one part of the consultation process that we have undertaken in HSE south, Cork and Kerry.  We have a reconfiguration forum that meets fortnightly that includes all the clinical directors, hospital managers, community services, general practice and the university.  We have almost 40 sub-groups with 500 members of staff involved in those sub-groups, including a patient advocate on every group.The consultation we have undertaken has been unprecedented.  I would particularly point to the work that we have done in far west Cork in terms of meeting community groups, not just through the normal streams, but through the Irish Farmers Association, Irish Countrywomen's Association, town fetes, secondary schools and primary schools.  We have engaged with the population that we serve.  This group is one element in what we are doing.  It provides an outside expertise.  It is a group with real experience.  I put on record my thanks to them for the contribution they have made to date and for giving of their time and expertise in what are difficult times for everyone, and they are all busy persons.  I am grateful for the contribution they have made, and I think they will continue to make an important contribution as we go forward.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	110	I welcome the delegation.  I was just saying before they came in that I hope no one outside this room gets sick this afternoon because it seems all of the experts are in here.Despite the fact that most times we meet Professor Drumm it is usually in a confrontational arena, on my own behalf I thank him for the contribution he has made over the past number of years.  I am sure there have been times when, like ourselves, he asked himself why he got involved in this at all and, equally, there were times when he had great satisfaction.  We appreciate his contribution, although we may not often say so.I return to the question I have been asking since this process began.  When will we see the rehabilitation of HSE south?  There is a process in place in terms of how we will provide that, but I will link that to St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital.  That site was earmarked originally for a rehabilitation structure.  It is ideally situation, as Professor Drumm will be aware.  There is plenty of space, with 36 acres, and it does not suffer from the confines of other campuses in the city.  Are we going to see that?  When will it happen?  I do not think any other campus in the city is better suited.In linking that in, one of the matters I put down here for question is orthopaedic services in Cork as they will be delivered.  We have already had a meeting with Professor Higgins — everyone on that side will be aware of that — and we made these views clear to him as well.  In this particular case, it is not simply a matter of being opposed to change or movement.  People are quite genuine when it comes to the moving of the orthopaedic services, which is the heavy cutting and lifting end of surgery, into the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital.  In the South Infirmary-Victoria, there are approximately 60 parking spaces of which 40 are for staff and on any given day there is approximately six available to the public.  I inquired, and that is my information.  Any time I have ever visited anyone in the hospital I have had to park a half-mile down the road.  How are we going to get those who have had the heavy-lifting stuff done — I refer to specialised hips, knees, legs, etc. — and who come out in wheelchairs to get into cars which are half a mile down the road?  Is the HSE telling me that it will put in a shuttle service?  It is the wrong location for that service and the ideal location is where it is at now.  Of course, the HSE would have to put in all the different ancillary services.  St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital should be about orthopaedics and rehabilitation.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	111	I apologise that I will not be able to stay and I must leave again shortly.  I take the opportunity to thank Professor Drumm for his service for the past five years and wish him well in his new role.I just want to make a few quick comments about what the Minister stated, particularly about the cancer statistics which are very welcome but, of course, unrelated to the cancer strategy as they predate it.Medical cards, their delivery and the access of people to them, are still a major problem, but no doubt Deputy Connaughton will address that in a more comprehensive fashion.  I would ask Professor Drumm why it has taken five years to start rationalising the HSE when, in fairness, he identified problems very early on.  Would he agree with many — certainly it is my party's view — that child care should go to an agency other than the HSE?There are more cancelled operations, there is an increase in the number of delayed discharges, which is up 70%, and there are more people lying on trolleys.  On these statistics, the reality for people is not the same as the picture often painted by the HSE management or the Minister.  The snail's paced development of primary care, and the fact that there are fewer beds and no corresponding increase in primary care capacity to meet that, is, as far as I can see, a self-defeating circle.There are specific questions I would like to ask.  Lest I forget, the third question I tabled is No. 25, to ask the Minister to provide an overview of savings identified by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, on foot of instruction by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  I am told that the Department of Health and Children will provide a response to this question but I do not see any said response and I have not received one of which I am aware, nor have my policy research people.  The Minister might address that because it seems to be a fairly important question to answer.I will point out a number of matters.  The hospital budget has overrun by €112 million in five months.  Can I ask about that, and about the Daughters of Charity and the disability respite situation?  Can the Minister assure us that there will be no loss of respite?When will we see, in the case of cystic fibrosis but also in a general sense, a transplant authority, which is essential?Could the Minister give us an indication of her views on the termination of the medical card scheme and the new tiered card system recommended in the ESRI report?  Specifically, could she tell us whether or not she was aware of this group's recommendation vis-à-vis charges as it was rammed through the House last week without a single contributor from Fianna Fáil or the Greens?  This expert group states that this will have a detrimental health impact on those on the medical card scheme.It is important to note that tomorrow is the fifth anniversary of the co-located hospital announcement as the new fast-track mechanism for extra for the health service, and yet we still have not a sod turned or a brick laid, not to mention a bed.  Would the Minister or, more importantly, perhaps Professor Drumm, give us some indication on the plans for a reduction in bed numbers in Merlin Park Hospital, particularly in orthopaedics, etc.?  I am sure Deputy Connaughton will be more than happy to expand on that with him.I refer to the cervical cancer vaccine.  When will it be rolled out?  I advise the Minister to avoid referring to the pilot project relating to 20 schools as representing the roll-out.  When can we expect the screening programme relating to bowel cancer to begin?Have the plans to involve pharmacists with regard to the flu vaccine been advanced?  What is the current position in respect of such plans?  Is the Minister in a position to provide an update on maternity hospitals, particularly in the context of the misdiagnoses of miscarriages?  When will the relevant report be issued?Will the Minister confirm whether planning permission has been granted in respect of the project relating to the national children's hospital?  How long will it take to complete this project?  Is the funding relating to this project available or will its successful completion be dependent on a large proportion of voluntary donations?  The position with regard to such donations is clearly uncertain at a time such as this.

I hope their presence will finally kill off the rumour that we are on holiday.  The work we are engaged in today is important and someone must put that point across.I wish to be associated with the warm welcome extended to the Minister, Deputy Harney, Professor Drumm and their teams.  In the event that we do not have time to do so at the conclusion of proceedings, I pay tribute to Professor Drumm.  I hope the praise he is going to receive today will not upset him.  The offering of such praise probably represents a departure from the norm.  Professor Drumm has always attended meetings of the committee and engaged with members.  I am aware, from personal experience, that when something has been asked of him, he has generally delivered.I welcome Professor Drumm's reference to the Chairman, Deputy Ó Fearghaíl.  We have wanted to state for some time that the Chairman has been particularly fair to us.  We have been afraid to comment on this matter in the event that we might get him into trouble.  I say "Well done" to the Chairman.Deputy Kathleen Lynch referred to Cork on a number of occasions so I presume that means I can refer to Dublin and, in particular, Tallaght, where I live.  I put down a number of questions for today in respect of the future delivery of children's services in the Dublin region, the need to restore confidence in Tallaght Hospital and the question of primary care in the Tallaght area.  I appreciate the replies I have been given in that regard.Deputy Reilly already referred to the future delivery of children's services.  It is clear that Tallaght Hospital is an important element in the strategy in this regard.  I will continue to seek guarantees that if the project at Eccles St. proceeds, funding for the urgent care centre in Tallaght will be front-loaded.  That is extremely important.I challenge the view expressed in respect of overnight beds.  This remains an issue in Dublin and the surrounding region.  As this is the last occasion on which Professor Drumm will come before the committee, I ask that he comment on this matter of which he has some experience.  The need for overnight beds at the new facility in Tallaght remains compelling, particularly in the context of the proposal to move the maternity unit in the Coombe Hospital to Tallaght.  Will Professor Drumm and the Minister comment on the up-to-date position on the subject of maternity services moving to Tallaght?The four Deputies who represent Dublin South-West recently had the opportunity, through the good offices of the chief executive of Tallaght Hospital, to meet the master of the Coombe Hospital.  The latter came across as extremely enthusiastic and excited with regard to the prospect of the transfer of services.  I am seeking guarantees in this regard, particularly in view of the massive young population in Tallaght and the need for maternity services there and in the overall catchment area.  It is important that we continue to exert pressure in respect of this matter.In recent times, Tallaght garnered much publicity in respect of doctors' letters and X-rays.  I do not intent to rub it in but these were issues of concern.  GPs and patients in the catchment area were extremely unhappy about this matter.  When will Dr. Maurice Hayes's report be forthcoming?  The four Deputies who represent the constituency had the opportunity to meet Dr. Hayes and were extremely impressed with regard to the work he is doing.I was disappointed by the bad news that emerged in recent days to the effect that Professor Kevin Conlon will not remain as CEO of Tallaght Hospital.  He is the fifth CEO to work at Tallaght Hospital since it opened 12 years ago.  He has made real progress in the past six months.  In all the meetings we have had with him, he referred to the future and was very enthusiastic about developments at the hospital.  It must be remembered that the hospital does not cater only for Tallaght.  Its catchment area stretches all the way to Carnew, on County Wicklow's border with County Wexford.  I lament the fact that Professor Conlon is leaving his position and I take this opportunity to pay tribute to him.  Has the HSE interacted with the board of Tallaght Hospital in respect of what will happen next?  I hope the board will be encouraged to advertise publicly for the position to find someone who will, in conjunction with the HSE and the Department of Health and Children, work to maintain the progress that has been made at the hospital.Earlier today, the committee met representatives from the Irish Dental Association to discuss the dental treatment services scheme and dental care for medical card holders.  I do not intend to ambush our guests in respect of this matter and I am sure they have seen the relevant documents.  One of the statements made at this morning's session was to the effect that the HSE's actions in respect of this issue have caused chaos, confusion and hardship to patients and that the Irish Dental Association believes this suffering was entirely avoidable.  Will our guests comment on that matter?Speakers referred to the Irish Pharmacy Union, IPU.  I do not want to rake over the coals relating to past issues, I am merely seeking confirmation that relations between the HSE and the IPU are now good and that both are now working satisfactorily on behalf of communities.Along with Deputy Neville and Senators Prendergast and Mary White, who are present, I am a member of the Sub-Committee on the High Level of Suicide in Irish Society.  I am sure the three members to whom I refer may mention this but it is important that our guests, in the context of their remit, should continue to stress that suicide prevention remains a core principle and that it should continue to be examined by the sub-committee to which I refer.I wish Professor Drumm well.  Perhaps he will pass on to his successor the news that the joint committee looks forward to meeting him.  We hope Professor Drumm's successor will be just as helpful as he has been.

In such circumstances I ask that members confine themselves to contributions of two to three minutes each, if possible.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	114	I thank Professor Drumm for his past co-operation and wish him well in the future.I echo Deputy O'Connor's comments on suicide.  Last year, the number of suicides increased by 25%.  Recently published figures indicated a rise from 424 in 2008 to 527 last year.  We are aware that the real figure is much higher but I do not wish to engage in an argument on that matter.  As I stated in the Dáil in recent times, research indicates that in times of recession the incidence of suicide, attempted suicide and self-harm tends to increase.  As a result, there is a need to allocate further resources to try to limit the pain experienced by those who commit suicide and their families.  The level of self-harm increased by 5% last year, while the number of attempted suicides also rose.There have been cutbacks in respect of this area.  However, I put it to our guests that it is a special area in respect of which a response must be made.  A new need exists in this area as a result of our changed circumstances.  I have stated on numerous occasions — and I wish to avoid being overly repetitive — that predictions relating to an increase in the number of suicides last year as a result of the recession have been realised.  I put it to our guests that there is a case for not reducing the resources relating to suicide prevention.  All of the NGOs which operate in this area have been subjected to considerable cutbacks and an argument also exists for not reducing their resources further.The independent monitoring group recently published its report on psychiatric services in the context of the implementation of the recommendations in A Vision for Change.  It is not acceptable that little substantial progress was made in 2009 in implementing the strategy.  These are not my words; I am paraphrasing the report.  The group especially raised the lack of clarity around a new assistant director for mental health, the lack of authority around this post and the emerging clinical management administrative structure of the HSE, which is totally unacceptable.  The new assistant director of mental health is a top class person.  I have known him for some time and the committee has met him.  There is enormous potential in giving him the opportunity to do what I believe he has the ability, will and energy to do.The monitoring group expressed frustration and confusion about the constantly changing management structures in the mental health service.  It stated that it is difficult for the newly appointed executive clinical directors to carry out their tasks when there is an absence of clarity about their precise role and their relationship with the clinical directors and the management structures of the HSE.  It is another damning indictment that the group found an absence of mental health leadership.  It criticised the revenue allocation for A Vision for Change in 2009, which was not delivered as promised.  It states, "Without this, it is difficult to see how the HSE and the Government can achieve their objective to implement A Vision for Change in full".  It criticises the continuing drop in relative expenditure on mental health.  In 2009, expenditure was 5.3% of total health funding, which reflected a continued relative increase in recent years.  This is the tone of the full report on the delivery of A Vision for Change.  I also understand 1,000 staff have been lost across mental health services in the past 18 months.  This was stated by the president of the College of Psychiatry of Ireland, Dr. Justin Brophy, at a recent conference.  Perhaps the Minister will deal with those two issues.Representatives of the Irish Dental Association, IDA, appeared before the committee earlier.  I ask the officials to read the transcript.  They gave us a full report on the circumstances.  I read into the record some of the examples of what is happening.  A 17-year old girl who requires five fillings prior to commencing orthodontic treatment at Cork Dental Hospital and who was advised by to get the fillings done first was refused.  A 72-year old woman needs three fillings replaced.  She has Parkinson's disease and tends to fracture her fillings, thus the need to redo these fillings.  It was stated as a clinical necessity but it was refused by the HSE.There has been a change in the cost and procedures to obtain visas for non-consultant hospital doctors.  Will Dr. Drumm clarify this?
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	115	I welcome the Minister and the HSE officials.  I pay tribute, in particular, to Professor Drumm and wish him well in the future.  We have had robust exchanges from time to time but he has grown used to that.  I will be robust shortly again but I will begin with a nice question.  What advice will he give his successor?I refer to an issue I raised on a number of occasions in recent weeks, which is the reopening of respite services for people with intellectual disabilities in the mid-west.  I received an e-mail from the Minister for State, Deputy Moloney, last Thursday, in which he stated, "The Brothers of Charity at yesterday's meeting with Minister Harney and myself indicated that they would work with the HSE to ensure this happens." That is, the reopening of the respite house.  I understand the HSE has not engaged with the Brothers of Charity in the mid-west on the basis that officials will not meet its representatives until they say they will reopen the respite house.  We all want the house open but everyone at least needs to sit down and talk.  If I am wrong about this, please correct me but my understanding is the HSE has laid down this prerequisite to meeting with the Brothers of Charity locally.  That house needs to be opened.  The two parties need to sit down, identify where the money is coming from and then address the other issues.  That is my priority at this meeting.  A total of 63 families in the mid-west will not have respite care for four weeks and that needs to be resolved this week.  Will the Minister and Professor Drumm ensure that the obstacles are overcome and the two organisations sit down together and sort this out immediately?There are other issues, one of which is equality in all the regions.  Is the moratorium being applied on the same basis in each of the regions with regard to funding for intellectual disability?  The moratorium alone has cost the mid-west more than €500,000 and I am not sure it is the same in other regions.I welcome the report on resources published last week.  Will the Croke Park deal help?  Will she give an indication of how the measures agreed in the deal will facilitate changing the system and the move towards primary community care and so on?  I appreciate that is a broad question but I would like to her to give an outline.  The report indicated that we have more than enough private beds in our system and, therefore, why she is going ahead with collocation?  It will be five years tomorrow since this policy was announced and not a sod has been turned, as Deputy Reilly said.  What is the point?  Why is the Minister doing it, especially given that more than 1,000 public beds will be closed this year?  We need public, not private, beds.   Question No. 18 on page 13 of the report on national issues deals with the extent of bed closures, ward closures and theatre closures in hospitals across the State.  We did not get a specific answer on that and the reason given was the HSE could not gather the information.  However, is updated information available now?On the dental issue, the committee was informed earlier that €59.3 million of the €63 million allocated for the scheme has been spent.  Is that accurate?  If so, how will the medical card dental service be maintained for the rest of the year?  The IDA representatives also made the point that 270,000 more people are entitled to participate in the scheme than in 2008, yet dentists are being asked to participate on the basis of the amount allocated in 2008.  How can that be done?Is there any news on the paediatric physiotherapist for the mid-west?  The Minister kindly gave me an answer on that but she did not state when the person would be appointed.  What is the position on the sun bed legislation?  I refer to resources for cancer centres.  A problem in Galway was highlighted earlier this week and there have been shortcomings in meeting the indicated timeframes for the various elements of the cancer service.Legal issues have to be addressed regarding thalidomide sufferers but will the Minister meet the groups representing them to address the issues?  HSE officials have visited people's houses but they need to meet the Minister as a group to clarify the issues.  They deserve and need the full support of the State and need it to engage fully with them in terms of the issues they have raised.I have two other questions.  One concerns the dignity of patients, in the context of the victims of Dr. Michael Shine, and the other relates to the survivors of symphysiotomy.  This committee supports both groups in terms of the need for an inquiry.  What progress has been made in that regard?Finally, I asked about the sexual assault treatment units and why the Limerick statistics were not included and received a written response.  There is a sexual assault unit in Limerick, but it is not funded nationally and perhaps that is why it is not included in the statistics.  The statistics should be included if we are to have valid statistics for the whole country.  I ask that this be addressed.
#MargaretConlon	unknown-#MargaretConlon-party	unknown-#MargaretConlon-dob	unknown-#MargaretConlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I welcome the delegation and wish to be associated with the good wishes to Professor Drumm.  I wish him well on whatever path he takes now and perhaps our paths may cross again.I know it is dangerous to lavish praise on somebody, but when I heard Professor John Higgins speak earlier about the non-executive advisory board and reconfiguration in Cork and Kerry, I wondered why we in the north east do not have a Professor John Higgins.  If we had that level of engagement and buy-in from all the stakeholders, many of the troubles we have had could have been avoided.  His experience teaches us that open, honest and transparent engagement with all the stakeholders works.  People respected his clinical experience and bought in to his proposals.  He continues to engage and what is being developed will not be an à
 
la carte  approach where people can pick the bits they like and leave out the bits they do not like.  If only we had an approach like that in my constituency, things might be a little different.I have a number of questions.  I feel passionately about the issues raised by the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association, members of which spoke to this committee.  This small group of people does not face a good outcome, but its members have significant concerns with regard to the treatment and assistance they will require.  Can some consideration be given to providing medical cards for these people to enable them obtain the treatment and assistance they deserve?Representatives of the Irish Dental Association spoke at our meeting this morning.  Can we have some clarification with regard to the consultation and engagement that took place with the HSE, officials from the Department and the dentists?  It seems to me there was a complete breakdown in communication.  This morning, the members of the association indicated they were willing to engage and consult.  That offer must be accepted because it appears from listening to them that problems exist in the system.  The only way these problems will be solved is if people sit down together and thrash out the issues and try to come to some kind of agreement.I have said previously that when people gain access to the system, they find treatment is excellent.  However, access to the system remains a very significant problem.  I will not personalise the issue, but will give an example from my constituency.  A constituent of mine who was diagnosed with stomach cancer six weeks ago contacted me because six weeks on this person has got no further than the diagnosis.  With each week that passes this person's condition gets worse and a major operation is required.  However, the latest news is that there is no bed available either this week or next week.  We talk about prioritising people who need urgent treatment.  As far as I am concerned, this person is a priority, but yet this person must wait.  It is unacceptable that this person must wait so long for treatment while knowing what is growing inside this person's body.  I mentioned this to Dr. O'Hanlon earlier and understand that when he was in practice, that would not have happened.  He and any other GP would knock down doors to ensure this person got attention.  Where are we failing now.  Does the problem occur when patients move on from their GP to the next stage?  There is a logjam that must be sorted out.  The treatment and outcome for such patients is more perilous than if they receive treatment six or eight weeks earlier when their condition is diagnosed.I am also concerned about the recent position regarding day services for elderly people.  The one day a week or a fortnight that many elderly people get in local units is very important from both a medical and social point of view.  However, the rumour is that day services will be cut, because this is an easy cut to make.  The thinking seems to be that two days a week can be cut off, leaving just a three-day service.  This certainly does not prioritise older people.  Many of these people live in rural isolation and depend on the service as it is the only day in the week that they get to meet and speak with other people.  I mention in particular the Darley day care centre in Cootehill and St. Mary's Hospital in Castleblayney.  The people who attend these centres fear their service will be affected.  I have said time and again that we must be proactive and inform people of what is happening rather than let rumours take hold.  That puts us on the defensive.  If we learned nothing else over recent years, we should have learned that the HSE needs to be actively involved in consultation with people in order to stave off the rumour mill.  I know we cannot deal with every rumour, but the HSE must be more proactive.  There was a complete breakdown in communication between it and the Darley day centre in Cootehill.  Service users were told one thing, while service providers seem to have been given different information, thereby creating a dilemma.  My interest in this is not in buildings or facilities, but in ensuring the excellent service that is being provided to people continues, because it has a positive effect on their daily lives.I would like to comment on the situation in Monaghan and the ongoing challenges we face there.  I am concerned by the removal of an emergency ambulance from Monaghan to Castleblayney to deal with some of the difficulties arising from the reconfiguration in Louth.  This will affect the people who live in north Monaghan where the service was working well.  My concern is that the removal of the ambulance will create a dilution of the service.  Monaghan hospital is providing a good rehabilitation and step-down service and is full most of the time.  However, there is room for enhancement of the services it offers.  I would like to see more patients coming back from other hospitals to their home county for rehabilitation.  In the context of rehabilitation, perhaps we should consider a centre of excellence in Monaghan hospital.  We have the expertise, the space and the capacity.  This is something that should be considered as it would relieve pressure in other areas.A CT scanner is now in place in Monaghan hospital.  I have seen it in its room.  Now we need to see it up and running.  It will help reduce waiting lists for people waiting for vital scans.  There is no point in having such a beautiful new machine in a newly decorated room if we do not have the radiologists required.  We need this problem sorted so as to get the scanner working as quickly as possible.

I have some questions for Professor Higgins on his advisory group.  Were advisory groups available to other reconfiguration programmes throughout the country or was it just to Cork?  I am puzzled because reconfiguration is the big buzz word at the moment in all areas of the health services.  There have been marches in support of hospitals and people are very concerned.  Does the group have a secretary, are minutes recorded and is the group subject to freedom of information?  Would it be possible to read the minutes?  I am interested to know what sort of an input they have.  There is also an issue that information may be advantageous to them from the perspective of having a distinct advantage with a discussion about where services may or may not be based.  I ask for clarification of those points.The moratorium on recruitment of staff and the fact that 120 public health nurses positions are vacant is causing untold hardship in the delivery of primary care.  When the Minister was in the Seanad she did not answer any of the questions because of certain actions.  Will it be possible to lift the moratorium on recruitment of public health nurses because their role and the work they carry out cannot be replicated?  It is vital that the timeframe for child development testing and other functions is maintained or else important pointers will be missed.Will the Minister comment on the maternity services at South Tipperary General Hospital and the 40% increase in deliveries?  Will she comment also on the progress of the review of the decision to close St. Michael's psychiatric unit?  I refer to my question about the statement from Mr. John O'Dwyer, the coroner, that nursing homes were transferring patients to hospital when they were near to death.  The Minister responded that she had written to Professor Drumm in March to ask the hospitals to include in the protocol an identification to HIQA of any concerns they may have with regard to inappropriate admission or referral trends identified from particular nursing homes.  Has there been any response?  Would a breach of regulations or standards mean that HIQA could de-register offending nursing homes?  What are the legal implications for those patients in homes availing of the fair deal scheme?  Could this be a protracted process?A review of ambulance services was to be carried out.  Since 2007 I have been raising the issue of the pre-election promise to provide an ambulance service based in Carrick-on-Suir in County Tipperary.  I was expecting that question to be answered on many occasions but as yet it has not been answered.  Is it possible to give an answer to this question?

I wish him a healthy, happy and successful future, wherever that may be.  I commend Professor John Higgins.  It is very refreshing to see the local leadership he is giving in the southern area.  I agree with the Minister in her highlighting of the resource allocation and how it is spent.  In my view, far and away the biggest challenge facing us all is how we are going to provide the level of health service we have whatever about an improved health service in the future.  I recently met a consultant from London who was prescribing a drug, costing £250,000 per year, for a rare form of cancer.  Fortunately, it is a rare form of cancer but this is an example of the challenge we will face.  I would like to see our committee addressing the challenges because it does not matter who is in government, the challenges will be the same.  It would be interesting for the committee to spend more time addressing how we ensure we can continue to provide the current level of service as well as improving it in the future.I wish to ask the Minister and Professor Drumm about value for money, comparative analysis between different hospitals and different disciplines and the unit cost of procedures.  Is there a variation nationally?  What is being done to ensure best practice?I have two questions arising out of Professor Higgins's contribution.  I refer to the role of general practitioners and their relationship with consultants.  In my day, they stayed very separate, there was clear demarcation and the consultant, by definition, was a consultant.  There was integration in so far as there was tremendous communication between consultants and GPs.  It appears to me now that there is not the same level of consultation between them about communications in regard to patients.  I highlight the case referred to by my colleague, Deputy Margaret Conlon.  The issue of GPs working in hospitals is another issue.  It would appear to me there is a very good case for having GPs in accident and emergency departments for a variety of reasons.  First, there is a scarcity of non-consultant hospital doctors.  Second, there is no continuity and it is more difficult at times of the year such as 1 July and 1 January.  Third, GPs have experience.My other question is whether there is a place for health economics in the undergraduate curriculum.  The medical profession in one way or another is responsible for the vast majority of spending in the health services.  From what Professor Higgins has said about business experts being brought into the health service, is there a case for having health economics as part of the undergraduate course all the way though university training?  This would enable doctors to be better equipped to make important decisions on priority and how money is spent.  In my view, this is the real challenge for the future.My final question is to the Minister and relates to the status of this report of the expert group on resource allocation.  What is the next step?

I wish Professor Drumm the very best.  He is probably going back to the other side now to see what has happened while he was here for a few years.  Deputy Jan O'Sullivan asked what advice he would give to his successor.  My advice is to tell him to keep away from politicians and, in particular, Opposition politicians.

Is Professor Higgins involved in the reconfiguration in the south east?  I know he is involved in Cork and Kerry.  Is the model in the Kerry and Cork situation the same for the south east?  There is some disquiet in our area in the four hospitals involved, three outside of Ardkeen hospital.  This report was expected on 1 February and then it was May and then June and now we have been told it might not be ready for another few months.  I ask for an update on the situation.I welcome the report which shows the health system will achieve €1 billion in savings next year and this is to be commended.  I note €650 million will be saved on payroll costs and €350 million on services.  Will this mean redundancies or will this €650 million be saved through the moratorium on recruitment?  I am delighted to see this kind of money being saved.  I just wonder why this was not done long ago.  This saving was achieved in the space of one year and there is still talk of an integrated and better service through the roll-out of primary care.  How did it take us so long to reach this point?  Are the services in place for the roll-out of the primary care programme?  I accept that we have made much progress in recent years.  It is an ambitious target to reduce the number of people accessing accident and emergency services by 33,000 in the next year.  It would be commendable if that target could be reached.  If that were the case we would have better health services.There is a big take-up on the fair deal scheme.  Is finance available for the scheme for this year, next year and the following year?  It is my understanding that the scheme is working a treat and there is much demand for it.I too am concerned about cutbacks to the hours of those involved in the home care service, especially in rural areas where carers and home help are so important in terms of keeping people at home and out of the hospital system.  Cutting back that service would only result in a short-term gain and a long-term loss.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	124	Like everyone else I wish Professor Drumm well.  He had a terrible job but he always approached it with a great degree of honesty.  One cannot ask more of anyone than that.  I assume history will show that to be the case.  He is leaving behind many problems.  I do not know who will be able to solve them but that is what we all, collectively, must try to do.We had a robust discussion on medical cards on two occasions.  In fairness, despite the many shortcomings, in my view as a politician it is easier to get through to Finglas than was previously the case.  I assume if I can manage to contact the centre then so can many others.  I thank those concerned for the work that has been done.  However, I have two concerns.  I tabled a question in the context of the meeting on when all the applications will go directly to Finglas.  The question was not answered, it was side-stepped, but I received a detailed reply of two to three pages on other aspects of the system.On page 4, number 9, there is a gem; it says that 84% of callers now choose to speak directly to a person.  To whom does the Health Service Executive believe they would like to talk?  The reason for that is to get over the Goddamn answering machine.  As people get older the one thing they despise is to be told to press button one or other option up to ten between research and whatever else, one's date of birth and possibly the name of one's dog by the end of the call.  All kinds of useless information is demanded.  All a person of a certain age ringing the centre wants is to speak to someone who knows what he or she is talking about who can deal with him or her in an efficient, affable way.  From what I can see, it appears that is the road the Health Service Executive is going down.  If that is the case then it is the first major step in solving a significant problem.To return to the issue with which Professor Higgins is concerned, I do not know anything about what he is doing in the Health Service Executive south area but I like what I hear.  It was not done in the case of medical cards.  Someone decided that the system would be centralised and the problems were allowed to flow afterwards.  If the engagement that subsequently took place was carried out prior to the decision and if the HSE could foresee the most common problems, especially as people get older, we would not have got into the current mess.  I do not wish to hear from any evaluation officer in the next couple of years that in order to achieve efficiencies there would be a return to the use of answering machines rather than employing a person.  I hope I do not hear that in my time in Leinster House because it would signal a return to the old problems.  That approach simply will not work.What is the status between the local offices and the centre in Finglas?  Is the work to rule ongoing or is it over now?  I would like an indication of the problem areas.  I deal with queries all the time, as I am sure do many of my colleagues.  It appears that if there are no problems with an application it will be dealt with relatively quickly.  The problem arises when something incomplete is spotted on an application and things drag on for months.  I know an 83 year old who is now in a nursing home whose medical card has gone over the review date.  In spite of everyone's best efforts it took two months for the centre in Finglas to write back to get additional information and even when the information was supplied the man still did not receive his medical card.  One can imagine the problems that caused in a nursing home in so far as the visiting doctor and chemist are concerned.  That is only one of many cases of which I am aware.  The matter is a serious one and whatever else the Health Service Executive has done it has not righted that wrong yet.A significant problem exists in Galway at the moment where many are concerned about services being removed from Merlin Park Hospital and put into University College Hospital Galway, UCHG.  There is a need for a Professor Higgins to handle such issues.  Can one imagine how people in Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe feel when they were always told that the centre of excellence was UCHG and that the big operations would be carried out there and the smaller operations that can be done efficiently by smaller hospitals would be carried out in places such as Ballinasloe and Merlin Park?  All of a sudden we find that a fairly big chunk of the hospital at Merlin Park is being put into UCHG where one could not swing a cat.  The Minister knows that.  The hospital is packed.  We are delighted we have a centre of excellence in UCHG but the way matters are being handled makes those in smaller hospitals in the adjoining area fear that the same fate awaits them as happened to Merlin Park Hospital, namely, that all the services will be centralised.
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	125	I am at a disadvantage sitting down.  I would prefer to stand because I feel so passionate and annoyed about the three issues to which I wish to draw attention.  Every time one mentions the latest CSO statistics about the 25% increase in suicide in 2009 compared to 2008, people's brains switch off.  There is no question that suicide does not register with people, those in the media or the Department because if it did, they would do something about it.  Since 2007 the National Suicide Research Foundation has indicated a continuous increase in the number of people deliberately self-harming.  We have a crisis in terms of suicide and deliberate self-harm.  A total of 80% of those who died last year due to suicide were men.  The increase can be attributed to the personal stress caused by socioeconomic circumstances.  Stress affects one's marriage and every other area of life.The State should run an awareness programme on suicide to let people know there is help and that they do not have to keep their problems to themselves.   The Department and the Minister must do something about it.  I produced a document, entitled What We Can Do About Suicide In The New Ireland, and find it very frustrating that nothing is happening in this regard.  Last week's tremendous Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Bill 2009 will help people who are discriminated against because of their sexual orientation.  While we have made considerable progress in that regard, I want to shout about the issue of suicide because everyone switches off when one mentions it.  We need a national campaign such as the one to lower the number of road deaths.  We all know of the tragedy in Donegal the night before last.  That said, there has been a focus on road safety.  Thirty times more money is spent on road safety than on suicide and self-harm prevention.Consider my other policy document, A New Approach to Ageing and Ageism.  On the issue of ageism against older women, I have raised with the Minister many times the fact that women over 64 do not get free breast screening, despite the fact that one is seven times more likely to get breast cancer if one is 65.  Associate professor of gerontology, Des O'Neill, advised me on this when I was doing my research.  There are simple steps I would take if I were in the Department of Health and Children or if I were more important politically.With regard to thalidomide, let me quote a letter I wrote to the Irish Examiner:There is [universal] support, in the Seanad and Dáil, for the campaign of the thalidomide survivors, but this support must now be met with action.  The survivors are owed an apology, appropriate compensation and access to the legal documents of the time.The survivors did not get adequate support as children and they remain in need today.This is an issue that can and must be put right.  I know the wrong done cannot be undone, but justice can and must be achieved.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13733	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	126	I want to speak specifically on the reconfiguration process in so far as it relates to Mallow General Hospital.  I will be brief because I realise there are many questions to be answered today.  I raised this issue on the Adjournment last week and was given an undertaking by the Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Carey, that officials would be in touch with me to organise a meeting to discuss the acute services and the reconfiguration process as it pertains to Mallow General Hospital.I am concerned about the document that is being discussed internally.  It relates to ceilings of care, certain protocols and modelling systems that may be put in place by the HSE.  As a member of the Mallow General Hospital action committee and a representative of the people of Cork East, I believe this will have an adverse effect on the ability of the hospital to deliver acute services.Professor John Higgins states the reconfiguration process is about change management.  We are all in favour of the change that is necessary.  We were given undertakings that there would be no change to acute medical services and that they would be increased.  We were told there may be changes with regard to the delivery of accident and emergency services and acute surgical services.  The document I put into the public domain last week clearly contradicted that.  Trust has broken down.  We bought into a process with Professor Higgins whereby we accepted there would be ongoing negotiations with people such as the group I represent.  When the document came into my possession last week, it threw that process out the window.  Trust must be regained because it has been lost under Professor Higgins and the HSE with regard to the reconfiguration process.Some members may feel the advisory group comprises a wonderful approach that espouses lateral thinking.  However, when a secret advisory group is put in place and people who have bought into the reconfiguration process and who are trying to manage change, such as the people I represent, are not being consulted on that process or the internal document, it makes a mockery of the whole process.  I seek a meeting with the head of the HSE and the people who are in charge of reconfiguration at national and local levels.  That is all I want.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I am not a member but want to put a few points on record.  I wish Professor Drumm all the best in the future.  While I may not always have agreed with him or been as nice as I will be today, I will be as straight as I can with him and wish him well.  I wish well Mr. Magee who is to take up Mr. Drumm's position.  His will be no easy task.My main reason for being present is to bring to the attention of the Minister, once again, the outstanding case of Mr. Neary and the 35 people who still have not been dealt with.  This is not a political issue but an all-party issue that Members want addressed as quickly as possible.We must reconsider how we deal with the issue of suicide, as raised by Deputy Dan Neville and Senator Mary White.  The suicide rate in west Cavan and Leitrim was very serious earlier this year.  There is a need for a full and frank debate on it in the Dáil.I thank my constituency colleague, Deputy Conlon, for raising the issue of the cancer sufferer.  Unfortunately, it is not the only case in the area.  Professor Drumm, his personnel and the Minister must treat this seriously because we do not have sufficient hospital beds to deal with patients in time.  This is very serious.In another case, the treatment of an individual who had the same health problem I had was postponed for a number of days.  Consequently, he passed away for want of a pacemaker.  Addressing problems such as this simply cannot be postponed.With regard to services for the elderly and others, l reiterate what Deputy Conlon said about the Darley day care centre and St. Mary's Hospital.  They have provided a tremendous service and should not be the victims of cutbacks.  Day care services are very important.Drumlin House in Cootehill was mentioned on the radio yesterday morning.  It deals with young people with mental disabilities.  The manager is having serious problems because of cutbacks.The idea of having integrated hospital and community services sounds great but unless the services are delivered on the ground, they will not work.  There are many cases of people being sent home from the rehabilitation centre in Dún Laoghaire without receiving the follow-up treatment they were promised.  This is not acceptable and must be dealt with.We have heard a lot about the reconfiguration of hospitals.  In Cavan-Monaghan we have experience of it.  We were promised we would lose no service until an equivalent or better one was put in its place, but this did not occur.  As for the Cork issue, members should ensure this does not happen in their area because the result of removing services before alternates are in place is nothing short of a disaster and, unfortunately, we have ample proof of that.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	128	I also wish Professor Brendan Drumm well in whatever he does in the future and hope he returns to his primary profession, in which he has great expertise.  I refer to the eighth question on bed closures and note that substantial bed closures have taken place throughout the State, including the Mater Hospital.  Even day services have been cut in counties Cavan and Monaghan.  As this matter has been referred to, I will not elaborate on it but 29 working days have been lost in the Cavan and Monaghan area alone.  As for the management of some of these changes, communication in respect of the closure of the accident and emergency service and acute beds in Louth County Hospital was simply non-existent at that time.  A leaflet was delivered to people's homes seven days later to explain the closure of the accident and emergency service but it did not deal comprehensively with the issue.The ambulance service, which obviously is connected and related because it has been transferred from Monaghan to Castleblayney, is to cover both north County Louth and north County Monaghan.  I suggest this is an impossibility, given the experience following an incident that happened at a football match at Knockbridge, County Louth, which is just a few miles outside Dundalk.  It took one hour for an ambulance to arrive at the scene of the incident.  Clearly, that does not constitute an emergency service and, clearly, there are substantial gaps in this regard.  While I could spend a substantially longer time addressing the issue of north County Louth, I do not wish to limit discussion to it because much broader issues exist.The figures provided to members regarding home help appear to indicate an improvement in the service.  However, they bear no resemblance to reality as reflected in the representations my colleagues and I receive on this issue.  It appears that for every ten minutes' additional time to be given out, ten minutes must be cut from somewhere else.  This is the message I have received from local managers and it reflects my experience.  The witnesses know as well as do I that society has changed.  Population shifts in recent years mean that children do not live as close to their parents as used to be the case and substantial differences arise in this regard.  I note the draft guidelines have recommended 7.5 hours per week.  They envisage taking ten minutes to get an old person up in the morning, 15 minutes to get him or her showered and ten minutes to get breakfast for him or her.  Anyone who believes this to be possible should spend a single morning with a provider of home help and then they would see what the outworking of such times would be.As for symphysiotomy, I note the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists is preparing a report and I seek an indication as to when it may be available.  I do not place much weight on the report because it constitutes self-policing and self-reporting, which are the worst of bad practices right across the board.  While the issue of symphysiotomy must be dealt with, this is not the way to do it.  Nevertheless, the witnesses should advise members as to when the report will be complete.Finally, I refer to Loughloe House in Athlone.  This is an institution about which HIQA made 37 recommendations, none of which included closure.  I repeat that closure was not suggested at all and although 34 of the aforementioned recommendations have been implemented, it appears as though closure of that house will proceed.  I ask the Minister the reason for this.  What is the agenda in this regard?  While I have an opinion as to what is the agenda——
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	129	Does the Deputy refer to Loughloe House?
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	130	Yes.  It is about privatising the service.  I certainly would welcome the Minister's honest reflection on what is the real agenda in this regard.While I have strong views about the health service, I will not take up people's time this afternoon and it is important to allow the witnesses time to respond.  However, I welcome any forum such as this, in which there is some level of accountability in respect of the HSE, because there is none in the Dáil.  Nevertheless, I appreciate the comments made by Professor Drumm in his scripted contribution at the outset in which he stated that he welcomed appearing at this forum.  I acknowledge that I also consider it to be useful and it is a pity that its time is so tight.
#NiallOBrolchain	unknown-#NiallOBrolchain-party	unknown-#NiallOBrolchain-dob	unknown-#NiallOBrolchain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	131	While the Chairman has been lenient in respect of time, I will try to keep within two minutes.  I congratulate Professor Drumm on the work he has done to date and wish him well in the future.  I will try not to repeat comments made by other members and note that the roll-out of the primary care teams nationwide is the most important matter being undertaken by the Minister at present.  As a politician, I would like to be kept up to date with the progress of this process and all politicians nationwide should be kept up to date in this regard.  I concur with the points well made by Deputy Connaughton relating to care versus efficiency of service or the most technically important way of doing things.  Care in the health service is what most people seek.  For example, in the course of the debate between St. Luke's Hospital and St. James's Hospital, the interesting point was made that St. Luke's Hospital is an institution that was put together with love, care and attention.  As it now is moving to a highly efficient institution, St. James's Hospital, I hope its caring aspect will not be lost and one must ensure as much is done as can be done.One area that other members have not discussed is health promotion and preventative health measures.  This is an issue that gets missed out on a lot in this sort of discussion.  Although one is always talking about fixing people who are not well, it is important to try to ensure people stay as healthy as possible.  Consequently, matters such as health promotion, health education and preventative health should never be allowed to fall off the health agenda because the last thing anyone wants is for people to be obliged to enter hospitals when it is unnecessary to so do.  Environmental health is another subject into which it is important to put effort.  I certainly would welcome the roll-out of the national environmental health action plan.  It has not been rolled out and I seek an update as to progress on this issue.  As all members are aware, the next budget is approaching and everyone wishes to ensure those who are most vulnerable are not harmed, in so far as possible.  As for front-line services, a debate on respite care has been ongoing in my native county of Galway but it is incumbent on all members to try to protect front-line services as the primary issue pertaining to health care in the budget.
#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	132	The matters covered have been broad and in the relatively short time remaining, it will be virtually impossible to address them all.  Perhaps the witnesses could revert to the joint committee in writing on a number of the particular issues.  On a personal level, I support the comments made by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan and Senator Mary White regarding the survivors of thalidomide.  Those members who have engaged with the very small number of people affected realise they are fundamentally unhappy with the manner in which the issue has been dealt with by the State Claims Agency.  I suspect there may be very little between what is on offer and what will satisfy many of those concerned.  I ask the Minister to find a way in which to engage on this issue as a matter of some urgency.The issue of medical cards for those with motor neurone disease has arisen before the joint committee a number of times.  It has heard a presentation from the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association and members are highly conscious that a Member of the Oireachtas suffers from that condition.  One matter that was of particular concern to members arose when they heard from the association that some people who had discretionary cards awarded to them subsequently would be subject to a review of that card.  Reviewing a medical card that was offered on a discretionary basis to someone who is not going to get better appears to be putting people under unnecessary pressure.  I again note this matter pertains to an extremely limited cohort of people and appeal to the Minister to find a way, if possible, to deal with it.The issue of dental treatment arose on foot of two presentations to the joint committee before lunch today.  I commend the Minister and Professor Drumm on their attempts to achieve economies and to reduce costs.  They have been highly effective in what they have done in the pharmacy sphere.  This also must be done with regard to dental services.  However, I do not know how this can be done without engagement and if what members were told today is correct — and I believe that all members accepted what they heard — such engagement has not taken place.  It would be preferable to have such engagement first and then decision-making afterwards, rather then having a unilateral decision on the part of the HSE to be followed by a level of engagement.  It seems reasonable that if the allocation was set at the 2008 level of €63 million, it should be possible to function fairly effectively.  Today, however, we have heard about a plethora of people who cannot receive a service because of the way in which the system operates.That 280 organisations are working in the disability field is mind-boggling.  There must be rationalisation.  Each of us has an affinity with some of these organisations and we recognise the value of their work.  Cutting front-line services and making the most vulnerable suffer the most when economies must be achieved is something that would have been done in a bygone age and is not acceptable.  There must be engagement with service providers which in my constituency have taken cuts and been told to live with them.  There has not been the necessary level of engagement.Deputy Conlon referred to a problem with patient care for cancer sufferers.  Like other committee members, I have recently been dealing with young people suffering from eating disorders.  As I told my wife a few evenings ago, I hope nothing will happen to any of our children, but I would prefer if they were diagnosed with a well known illness rather than an eating disorder.  If one has leukaemia or diabetes, at least there is a treatment path to follow, but there is no such path for those who are unfortunate enough to suffer from life-threatening eating disorders.  The battle in which parents and sufferers must engage is often beyond their capacity, given the stresses involved.  We need to do something in this respect.In terms of primary care services, the committee supports wholeheartedly the work the Minister, Professor Drumm and the HSE are doing.  It is the way to go, as the redirection of funding and resources towards primary care services is vital.  Our report late last year or early this year did not belong to any one individual.  There was total ownership by the committee and everyone bought into all of its recommendations.  As a Government Member, I was disappointed by recent comments about the report's proposal on incentivisation.  Our proposal to incentivise the delivery of primary care centres was based on our belief that, if one was to exploit the full potential of the primary care strategy and achieve the optimum benefit for patients, one would need to bring the health professionals together in a single centre.  This could only occur in the current economic climate if there was some form of incentivisation.  It is fundamentally wrong to compare incentivisation for primary medical care facilities which benefits society in its entirety with the faults in the incentives provided to build house and apartments.  There is no comparison between the two.  Having travelled the country to view centres engaging with health professionals, we are convinced there needs to be some form of incentivisation.  We proposed to limit the incentivatisation to one health professional per primary care centre but also to prevent the corporatisation of primary care services, something that is under way.  Will Professor Drumm assure the committee it is not the HSE's policy to co-operate in the corporatisation of primary health care provision?

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	134	It would be a good idea if Mr. Patrick Burke responded to the queries on the medical card since he is our national expert.The issues raised fall into a number of categories, the broadest of which is resources.  We will always operate with limited resources, even during the good times.  The challenges we face are faced by every government in the European Union.  Last week I attended a Council of Ministers meeting.  My colleagues, be they from countries which have health systems funded through taxes such as ours and that of the United Kingdom or that use a different method, are all facing considerable challenges.  Among these challenges are the ones raised by Deputy O'Hanlon.I have been asked how we can afford to provide patients with access to new innovations in medicine which can often be expensive, while maintaining current services.  The only way we can meet this significant challenge is by being innovative in the way we provide services and, as Senator Ó Brolcháin mentioned, placing greater emphasis on health as opposed to sickness.  We will shortly be tabling proposals on alcohol to the Government, given the problems it causes society.  Some 80% of health funding is spent on treating chronic illnesses; therefore, the question is how can we prevent them, identify chronically ill patients and manage them more appropriately.  Recently I met many groups with new innovations in monitoring patients at home through central nurse-led stations.  Intel is working with St. James's Hospital and others on innovative tools to allow elderly people to be monitored in home settings on a daily, weekly or bi-weekly basis or whatever is appropriate.  This is the future, particularly for an ageing society.I intend to bring the findings of the resource allocation group's report to the Government in the autumn for decision.  The strong emphasis in the report is on the procurement of services and the separation of the providers of services from their procurers.  The report is neutral as to where services should be procured, provided they are of a high quality.  It recommends mainstreaming the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, which has a good track record in procuring hospital services and, more recently, nursing home services.  According to our estimates, we have enough money for the fair deal scheme and its application process has speeded up to just two weeks in many parts of the country, although the period remains somewhat longer elsewhere.  We hope to have the timeframe reduced.I will address the issues raised about Dr. Shine, Dr. Neary, symphysiotomy and thalidomide together.  Regarding Dr. Neary, the redress scheme body was chaired by Judge Maureen Harding Clarke who made the report and the Government accepted her recommendation on the close-off date.  It was an ex gratia payment and there is no question of reopening the scheme.  I only want to be honest.  I understand one or two cases were not dealt with because they were outside the terms of the scheme but were dealt with confidentially by the State Claims Agency.I recently asked Judge Thomas Smith to examine the issues concerning Dr. Shine's victims and report to me.  He is due to report in the next couple of weeks.  He started the report in January and engaged with the representatives of Dr. Shine's victims, Dignity for Patients.  When I have the report to hand, I will meet the group again and give it a copy of the report.An independent report on symphysiotomy practices is under way and everyone conducting the inquiry is from outside Ireland.  We asked the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to conduct it, but the independent inquiry team is being led by Professor James Dornan from the United Kingdom and comprises people from Scotland and so on.  We hope to have the report to hand in the latter half of this year.  A case being appealed to the Supreme Court may determine the law also.Regarding thalidomide, there is a great deal of misunderstanding about the role of the State Claims Agency which was not asked to negotiate with the victims of thalidomide, rather it was asked to make an independent assessment for the Government.  Many Governments have been in place since the 1970s when the first settlement was made, but this is the first to reopen the issue.  The State Claims Agency's main recommendation and the main request of anyone I have met is that services appropriate to the victims' needs be provided.  We have accepted this recommendation.  Dr. Paul O'Connell, a rheumatologist at Beaumont Hospital, is involved, while Carmel Buckley, a HSE nurse, will act as co-ordinator for the group.  Dr. O'Connell's intention is to assess everyone individually and make recommendations on each person's need requirements. Our commitment as a Government is to meet those requirements.Another issue the group has raised with me is access to documentation.  I remain open to giving the maximum access.  I have not seen the documentation but we have asked somebody to assemble it, and that is where it remains.  I hope that work can be concluded imminently; in fact, it may be close to being concluded.  I see no reason for withholding any documentation from this group and I would not want to see documentation withheld from any group.  Why would I?  A legal issue has been raised and I am awaiting the Attorney General's opinion on that.  I hope to correspond with the group shortly.

That is my understanding.  I hope to have a report on that imminently.  This matter was on the Adjournment today in the Seanad, where we were dealing with it.
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	137	Yes.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	138	I share the view that there has unfortunately been an increase in suicide rates, particularly among men, and not just young men.  I attended the funeral of a 50-year-old friend in the past two weeks.  There is no doubt the rates of suicide and self-harm show a major correlation with increasing pressure due to unemployment, financial difficulties, family stress and so on.  The Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, has been active in this regard.  I accept that we need to provide more resources, although I am not certain it is just a question of resources.  We hear about many instances in which people will not come forward for any service, whether because of the stigma attached to mental illness or the way we deal with mental illness.  I recently attended a good conference with Professor Drumm in Kerry at which a service user made the point that when one is in the service, everything one does is related to therapy — that is, art therapy, dance therapy and so on.  We need to get rid of the therapy perspective and have a much more normalised service.  I thought that person made a great deal of sense.  The same man may have appeared before the committee on a number of occasions.With regard to the stigma attached to mental illness, a major campaign is under way, led by the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney.  One of the things I had not realised, for example, is that a person applying for a visa to visit the United States must state whether he or she has ever been mentally ill.  There is major stigma associated with mental illness and that feeds into the problem of reluctance among people, particularly men, to come forward for services.  It is a journey we have begun in terms of trying to make services more appropriate.  That is why primary care is so important.Senator Prendergast asked me about the psychiatric unit in Clonmel.  Everyone in the House signs up to great plans such as A Vision for Change, but when it comes to implementing them on the ground it is a case of "Not for me."  The reality is that in Clonmel one is five times more likely to be admitted to an in-patient bed than should be the case.  The number of beds there is totally inappropriate to the needs of the area.  The €10 million under A Vision for Change will be spent on this area to move from a hospital model to a community-based model, to which we have all signed up.  The same applies to long-term care.

It was about the acute psychiatric unit in the general hospital, which is to relocate to Kilkenny.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	140	That is correct.

There is no difficulty with the implementation of A Vision for Change with regard to St. Luke's——
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	142	I am sorry; that is what A Vision for Change is.  There is to be a single service between the two hospitals.  However, we will differ on that.  We have had this debate before and I know the Senator has engaged with the Minister of State in this regard.  I do not know whether Professor Drumm is in a position to comment.  The €10 million plan for community-based facilities in Clonmel is proceeding, and the quicker the better.  This issue is arising around the country as we move towards a community service model.  People want community services but they also want to protect what they have.  The whole notion is to switch care from hospitals to the community and have a much smaller number of acute psychiatric beds in a small number of hospitals around the country.
#PhilPrendergast	unknown-#PhilPrendergast-party	unknown-#PhilPrendergast-dob	unknown-#PhilPrendergast-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	143	It was just that there was no clarity about how the decision was arrived at.  There was no problem with A Vision for Change and closing St. Luke's.  It is the acute unit in the general hospital that is the problem.  There was no review of how the decision was arrived at and announced by Mr. Pat Healy.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	144	With regard to long-term care, HIQA produced a report on Loughloe House, and a number of the recommendations can be implemented, but some cannot be implemented without a new build, which is difficult in the current environment.  What concerns patients and their families is the quality of service.  It is possible to have a high-quality service in the region — although I accept some people will have to move outside Athlone, which is unfortunate — but the reality is that it is not possible to make that building fit for purpose.  Many of our longer-stay facilities, unfortunately, are old workhouses — although I know this is not one of them — and they are just not fit for purpose.  The sooner we can have people housed in appropriate accommodation, the better.When we move on to the licensing of hospitals, we will have the same issues.  When it comes to enforcing standards, we all know what the consequences are.  Private sector nursing homes have closed too.  That will be the future.  If facilities in the public or private sector cannot meet the standards we expect for older people, we must either have them refurbished to meet those standards——

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	146	No, they have not, actually.  I had this discussion only last week with representatives from the area.The great benefit of the Croke Park deal is that it will allow us to move staff from hospitals to the community.  We do not have budgets for additionality and sometimes when we want to do something new or different it is a question of obtaining additional resources to make that happen, which leads to a great deal of duplication.  One of the main things we need to do in the public health service is to move staff from hospital environments to provide services in a community setting.  The agreement facilitates that.  It also provides for flexibility and longer working days, and it gives health managers — whether at local or national level — the capacity to drive the kind of change that is necessary.I see great examples of people driving change.  A minor injuries unit of the Mater Hospital opened in Smithfield recently and staff transferred from the hospital to Smithfield.  There were no industrial relations issues and it was handled superbly.  On some days the staff work in the Smithfield centre and on others they work in the emergency department of the hospital.  That sort of flexibility represents the future.  Every time one wants to make a change, one is not facing massive industrial relations issues and that is good for patients.I will let Professor Drumm deal with the issue of dental services.  I know the committee is always convinced by groups that come before it, but we also need to use our critical faculties and challenge things when people come before us.  Dental services here are very expensive even compared to those across the Border.  That is a fact.  I am open to consultation.  Everybody keeps telling me they are open to consultation but they must accept that we have a limited amount of money.  I consulted the Irish Dental Association at a meeting which was, I think, attended by Mr. Burke.We should not confuse the issue of consultation with that of money.  Money is restricted, as it is in virtually every health system across the world for whatever reason.  We have capped the money at 2008 levels; I do not think that is unreasonable in the current environment.  We are already €10 million ahead of where we were last year at the end of June.  I expect to hear that everybody is closing down all over the place; we heard this last year about pharmacies, but there are more pharmacies now than there were this time last year.  We need to be more challenging in our discussions.  If people are interested in coming to the table on the basis of the budget that is there and having a  discussion about how we allocate that budget, I am certainly up for it and I believe the HSE is also.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	151	We have a new two-year visa for junior doctors that will exempt them from the requirement for a work permit to work in our system.  That was agreed recently with the Department of Justice and Law Reform and the Department of Foreign Affairs.Last week, along with Deputy Moloney, I met representatives of the Brothers of Charity and we had a good discussion about respite care in Limerick.  There is a budget of €25 million.  I do not accept that within a budget of that size there would be an issue with €150,000 for respite care.  The organisation has properties in the region that I understand will not be used.  We had a fruitful discussion and I expect that service to be restored as quickly as possible.  I had a letter from Brother Alfred today and I understand the organisation is engaging with the HSE in Limerick — at least, that is what was stated in the letter I received this morning.Everybody would share members' views about people caring for disabled children at home.  We have 5,000 respite places and 42 organisations working in this area.  Of these, 40 do not seem to have an issue, while two do.  The HSE is working with both of these.  We all need to apply innovative solutions.  Those who work in the public sector have had their wages cut this year and the same cut was applied to voluntary organisations because they are generally on a par with people who work in the public health service.Senator White asked about older women and BreastCheck.  I look forward to the roll-out of the screening programme for older women.  I am advised that while the incidence of disease is higher for older women, the number of fatalities is lower, but that is not to say we should not do it.  I would like to see it happen.  The next priority is colorectal screening, which will begin on 1 January 2012.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	178	I am sure that Deputy Reilly does not like repeating himself and neither do I.  Most of the issues were dealt with in the Dáil recently but I will go through them.  I received the report from the resource allocation group on Thursday.  I dealt with the transplant authority during the recent debate on cystic fibrosis.  The HSE is preparing to set up a unit and is currently recruiting the clinical lead for the transplantation programme.  On cystic fibrosis, Mr. de Fraine is here from the HSE and is the person responsible for the cystic fibrosis project at St. Vincent's.  The offer to the new contractor is optimistic and it has 30 days from last week to respond.On collocation, I will repeat what I said in the Dáil.  We are in a very different environment, as far as banking and construction are concerned.  The HSE recently received the application for the Limerick project which clearly has to be evaluated.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	182	The Chairman asked for a synopsis but I may have veered a little from my text.  I want to ensure the text is in the Official Report.
#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	183	Yes, it has been circulated to members here.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	184	It is a considered response.  I understand I was asked to address four items.  Deputy Lynch asked about rehabilitation in our region.  It was the first priority identified by reconfiguration.  Funding was put in place to appoint a locum consultant, who is the first consultant rehabilitation specialist outside Dublin.  That post is linked to the national rehabilitation hospital, in keeping with the national strategy document on rehabilitation.  That post has been progressed to become a permanent post and will set a model for how rehabilitation is provided nationally outside Dublin because until now the only specialist services have been in Dublin.The location of the rehabilitation unit which will follow from that appointment is part of what we are working on in terms of reconfiguration.  I wish to make a specific point relevant to rehabilitation and the question of the orthopaedic hospital, that is, that there is a general recommendation coming from all the subgroups from within the groups we have set up that individual specialties cannot be provided in the future in isolation from a broad base service that gives a broader repertoire of support.  That applies to the orthopaedic hospital.  It cannot exist in isolation.  There is no back-up for general medicine or anaesthetics when one has an isolated set-up such as that.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	185	That will be going too.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	186	I will finish my point.  Likewise, with rehabilitation the subgroup has recommended that it would be better located where there is backup.  One can extend that argument — I will not comment on Cappagh.  In the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital we are now aggregating specialties that are complementary, that overlap and together will provide a significant surgical resource which can be supported by anaesthetics and general medicine and can also deliver efficiencies in terms of throughput and treat more patients.  We have more than 4,000 patients on waiting lists for orthopaedics in Cork and Kerry.  It is a very important service that we have prioritised.With regard to Senator Prendergast's point, we have minutes of the board meetings which have already been made available to the councillors on the health forum and to anyone who has sought them.  It would be reasonable for us to put them up in advance on the website rather than having people seek them, and I am happy to do so.In terms of non disclosure and conflicts I again emphasis that the group is not in the executive line and has no decision making authority, and that is the context in which we will examine the issues of confidentiality and non-disclosure.  It is something on which we will seek further advice.I was grateful for the flattery about what we have been doing but I was also grateful to Deputy Sherlock for bringing reality to the situation.  It is not plain sailing in Cork and Kerry, no more than anywhere else.  Deputy Sherlock indicated with some passion his views on Mallow hospital.  In this regard I want to absolutely clear.  Mallow hospital currently uses approximately 3% to 4% of the hospital budget in Cork and Kerry.  However, it sees a significant number, about 2,000, of selected patients with general medical disorders.  I must be clear about the document to which Deputy Sherlock referred.  It is a draft proposal from a group examining the treatment of patients with acute medical problems nationally.  It is a clinician-led group.The group came to Mallow two weeks ago and met GPs, physicians, anaesthesiologists, surgeons and us under reconfiguration.  We gave it a joint agreed response to its proposals.  It is part of the answer I would give to Deputy O'Hanlon.  The GPs in north Cork were represented in the presentation we made on our proposals to the national group and its draft document.  I will make a general point.  If we have a clinician-led national agenda there must be room for draft documents.  We have to consider proposals.  We welcomed the fact that the group came to Mallow and heard a joined-up, agreed response from all of us and it was taken aback that so many parts of the health system in north Cork could make an agreed proposal.With regard to the services currently in place there is no proposal to remove services until an alternative is in place.  That was a commitment we gave and it stands.  Mallow is part of six hospitals.  They need to function as one hospital system in Cork and Kerry, and we have made clear that we will not withdraw services until alternates are in place.  I want to be crystal clear.  The population we service in north Cork is important to us, just as in west Cork, the city and Kerry.The last point to which I return is Deputy O'Hanlon's point about the role of general practice and its relationship with consultants.  It is a key component in what we are doing to try to re-establish what was in the past a very close working relationship between general practitioners and the specialists to whom they referred patients.  There is work to be done to re-establish the closeness that is now very often only seen in small hospitals.  I accept that as a challenge and we are working on it.  We have almost 40 working sub-groups, all of which have at least one general practitioner, feeding in a general practice perspective to the reform and the reconfiguration of the hospital system.We were asked if general practitioners work in hospitals.  In certain instances, they do.  I wish they worked more, not just in the hospital but particularly in the rural areas where we provide pre-hospital emergency services.  A significant number of general practitioners have expertise and training and an interest in being part of the emergency response, and we want to maintain that.  If there is a gap between general practitioners and the services provided in a hospital, patients can fall into the gap.  That is why we must try to develop national treatment programmes or guidelines — call them what you will — that cross those divides.On health economics, I was the chair of the curriculum committee in UCC medical school for the past two years.  It is one of the areas where we have brought some content into the programme.  The president of the American Medical Association visited Ireland twice in the past two years.  He is at the end of his career.  He made the point that no country can afford to provide all the treatments that are now available to each and every person, but he challenged us, as medics, at the Irish Medical Organisation annual conference to not run away from contributing to the decisions that would have to be made once one accepts that universal rule.  In other words, we are placed to make some hard decisions and we, as medics, should not run away from that.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	188	The Minister has addressed quite a few.  Deputy Reilly raised the issue of rationalisation of the HSE.  Essentially, the HSE has 4,000 fewer persons doing the same work.  It has added developments that Government added in the past five years but it has 4,000 fewer workers than in 2005.  It has also operated without a redundancy programme of any kind.  There is not a mechanism other than natural movement and retirement of persons in that situation.  There is no quick-fix to reducing numbers of staff.He asked if child care should be under a separate agency.  That is a Government policy issue.  I mentioned in my opening remarks that it is a considerable broad remit, but if it can be provided, no doubt the primary care team structure, which Deputy Reilly is as aware of as I am, ultimately, is a good mechanism through which some of these services can be provided locally.I have just been given the accident and emergency figures.  We will always have people on trolleys between zero and six hours.  Unfortunately, now people are quoting zero.  It would be a strange hospital that would not have people on trolleys between zero and six hours, and it would be totally wrong.  Such a hospital does not exist anywhere in the world and, certainly should not exist.Yesterday, the following hospitals had nobody on trolleys beyond six hours: Mullingar, Portlaoise, Tullamore, St. James's, Beaumont, Cavan, Our Lady of Lourdes, Clonmel, Kilkenny, Waterford, Wexford, Cork, Kerry, the South Infirmary, Dooradoyle regional, Letterkenny, Portiuncula, Roscommon and Sligo.  If anybody wants to look back at the figures for 2005 and claim that they have not improved, I am happy for anybody to look at that independently and to look at the figures at any stage.He referred to the snail's pace delivery of primary care.  We all would have liked to have seen it delivered instantly.  It is a massive change programme.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	190	In 2005, we took on ten primary care teams over which nothing had happened for quite a while.  We have now moved to a situation where, essentially, we have 1,000 general practitioners signed up to work in teams and doing that.  That is a fairly massive change.  The world has faced the challenge of bringing general practitioners into primary care team structures.  We now have 60 teams building or built, which cover more than 600,000 people in terms of capital infrastructure.  There is an intent.  All that we need going forward were oversubscribed with persons who wanted to be in primary care centres.  We have more than 600,000 people now covered by what is built or being built, contracted and under way.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	191	Being built.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	192	We have come a long way.  The hospital budget overrun of €112 million is much lower than that at the same time in previous years.  We are confident about our budgetary situation.  In fact, the Vote is not over spent.  At this stage of the year our major challenge on hospital budget is in the west.  That means the matter must be taken on board because the rest of the country will not bail out the west again.  We had considerable problems with that previously and there is a significant degree of unhappiness in terms of how other parts of the country have had previously to move funds there at the end of the year to fund overruns that have not occurred elsewhere.  That will be greatly improved upon now that we have an excellent regional director of operations there.  We have also appointed a clinician as the manager of the Galway group of hospitals.  That is a massive step forward for the west.  It is the first time that has been done.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	195	That will be a big step forward.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	197	Deputies O'Connor and Reilly raised the issue of the children's hospital.  It is the priority set by Government in the capital plan.  In terms of the issue of the expense of it, obviously, it is significant.  Obviously, that has come down in the present environment but it is still a significant build.  For anybody who spent any time walking around either Temple Street Hospital, or, to a lesser degree, Crumlin Hospital, there is no doubt that if this project did not go ahead, one would need overnight, on the demands of Amnesty or another body, to spend at least €200 million on Temple Street and at least €100 million to €150 million on Crumlin and end up with a totally unsatisfactory outcome.  In any eventuality, the best option here would be to keep going and there is a significant commitment by the Minister and the Government to that.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	198	Has planning permission been got?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	199	The plan has just been submitted.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	200	It has not been got yet.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	201	The design brief has just been submitted, which is in line with the development board's time lines.  Its time lines are being followed.Deputy O'Connor raised the issue of Tallaght.  There certainly is no plan at this point to have overnight beds.  There is a commitment to building the ambulatory centre. There will be overnight beds in terms of the new maternity hospital for children because for newborns there will be a neonatal intensive care unit as part of that.  On the difficulty delivering on that, Deputy O'Connor is correct that Dr. Chris Fitzpatrick has provided significant clinical leadership in this area.  We hope we can find a way to release the funds, between the existing Coombe site and other savings through the joint merger of shared services with Tallaght, so that this can be advanced.  It would be a significant step forward. Clinical leadership will be vital in this regard.Many members referred to suicide prevention.  As the Minister stated, any funding which can be found must be invested in this area.  Again, however, that is regularly the limitation.Deputy Neville referred to the independent monitoring group on A Vision for Change.  We must accept that every such group has a strong view — in the context of its specific area of competence — and that is to be respected.  It is unfortunate that, in the context of the staff who are involved with implementing A Vision for Change, perhaps more focus was not placed on a balanced view of what is actually being done.  On the capital side: construction on the Letterkenny acute medical unit has commenced; the residential unit at Ballinasloe will be completed at the end of the year; construction on the Clonmel residential unit is due to commence; construction has already commenced on St. Mary's in Mullingar; work is almost complete on child and adolescent units in Cork and Galway; construction has commenced on the Cherry Orchard child adolescent unit; work is just about to commence at Grangegorman; a contractor for project relating to the acute unit at Beaumont Hospital will be appointed before the end of the year; construction has commenced on the project at St. John's Hospital, Enniscorthy; construction on the Limerick acute mental health unit should commence by quarter four; and the design process for the new acute units at University College Hospital, Galway, and Cork University Hospital has commenced.  It is hoped those will all proceed on foot of the sale of lands.  A great deal of work is being carried out and we wish progress in respect of these projects was much faster.With regard to the relationship between the HSE and executive clinical directors, Dr. Justin Brophy is very involved in leading out that process at the postgraduate forum.  The appointment of executive clinical directors in mental health is a positive development and I hope that fact will be recognised.On Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's point, I would be the last man to give advice——

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	203	Yes, I will refrain from commenting.  Perhaps Ms McGuinness will comment on the issue of intellectual disability services in the mid-west.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	204	The question in that regard was whether there has been any engagement or correspondence in respect of such services in the mid-west.  The answer is that there has been.  The Deputy is correct in so far as recent engagement had not taken place.  They were seeking a commitment that the respite service would be restored.  I understand that, as of today, conversations are taking place in that regard.  We hope that respite services will be restored immediately because the budget is sufficient to deliver on that.  Effectiveness and efficiencies can be achieved in other areas.  It is just two services in the country which are stating that they do not have adequate funding to provide——
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	205	I was informed that two meetings were cancelled by the HSE because the representatives of the Brothers of Charity would not provide a commitment in advance of those meetings that they would reopen the services.  Those involved must come together and make a decision on opening them.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	206	I have a copy of correspondence exchanged between the HSE's local manager and the Brothers of Charity in advance of this and not just yesterday or the day before.  The Deputy is correct that local HSE representatives did not want to meet the Brothers of Charity until they gave a commitment to restore respite services.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	207	Has the position changed?  There is no point is setting up a stand-off.  Those involved must negotiate.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	208	Throughout the rest of the country, that is being done.  Commitments have been given that they will restore respite services.  Discussions are taking place today.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	209	Limerick is the only facility that has been closed.  The remainder have not been closed.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	210	Yes.  Discussions are ongoing.  I spoke directly to the manager involved and I will discuss the matter with the Deputy after this meeting.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	211	Will Ms McGuinness direct those involved to meet and engage in discussions?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	212	Absolutely.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	213	I will deal with the issue of medical cards, specifically in the context of the issue of motor neurone disease.  On the previous occasion on which we came before the committee, representatives of the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, were also present.  It would be fair to state that we were not on the same page in the context of where we then stood.  The IMO outlined approximately 17 different issues relating to governance, and so on, which they wanted to be addressed or dealt with before we proceeded further with the roll-out.  In the interim, we have engaged in quite a number of useful meetings with the IMO and have agreed a plan to be implemented in conjunction with GPs during the next three to four months.We are responsible for issuing and reviewing cards.  Between GP-visit and ordinary medical cards, there are approximately 1.6 million cards in circulation.  So the centre is not always aware of whether someone has special needs.  However, GPs are aware of the needs of their patients.  We have agreed with them that they will identify such people and ensure that their cases are fast-tracked.  In instances where reviews are necessary, the process will be simplified.  In the past two weeks we have altered the review process relating to those over 70 and this will now take the form of a simple self-assessment.  This will be on the basis that their means will not change.  Quite a number of things have happened, even in the past two months.There is a balance to be struck between working through the review process and issuing cards.  Such cards are not issued from slot machines.  This year alone we have issued more than 80,000 new medical cards.  We have a multichannel approach.  As the CEO pointed out, we have launched a new on-line application.  In the past three weeks we received 3,500 applications and more than half of these were submitted outside business hours.  That is 30% of applicants during the past three weeks.We also faced a particular challenge in respect telephone calls.  We received approximately 6,000 such calls per day and quite a number of these were made by irate clients and customers who rang on several occasions.  Our first challenge was to deal with this and we put in place a triage system, which contains a number of layers and which directs people in respect of how they might obtain information relating to their applications.  Slowly but surely, we are making progress.  The figure for telephone calls currently stands at 80% and we intend to increase this to 100% in the coming weeks.  If an individual wishes to discuss a matter with an operator, he or she will — as is the case at present — be dealt with in 13 seconds.We are of the view that we have dealt with the issues relating to telephone calls and access.  In the coming three months, and in conjunction with the IMO, we will have addressed all of the outstanding issues and will be in a position to move forward.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	215	No, there are no disputes.  There is a public service agreement in place which provides that the centralisation of medical cards is a key project.  We are moving forward with that project.  However, we want to address the various governance issues that have been identified and we will do so within two to three months.  When they have been addressed, we will deliver the benefits of centralisation nationally.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	217	Absolutely.  That was one of the commitments we gave at the previous meeting, when it was stated that the local offices would act as guardian angels.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	219	When the budget for 2010 was announced in 2009 consultation took place with the Irish Dental Association.  At the relevant meeting, the representatives from the Irish Dental Association were privy to and had copies of our correspondence to the Secretary General in which we set out how we intended to move forward.  I confirmed that in the past two weeks with the CEO of the association.I received a direction from the Secretary General to put in place arrangements to manage the scheme within budget and I immediately began to consult principal dental surgeons.  I engaged with them on several occasions in January, February and March.  On 1 April, I copied a draft of the circular, which we issued four weeks later, to the principal dental surgeons.  On 2 April, I received a sign-off in writing to the effect that I had addressed all of their concerns.  That circular was issued on 26 April.  On that date, I contacted the CEO of the Irish Dental Association to state that I wanted to meet him, within days, to put together teams to work through the implementation process.  I also confirmed to him that we intended to review the operation of the new arrangements on a quarterly basis and that we would take cognisance of any feedback the association or others wished to offer in this regard.In the interim, I have offered, in writing, to meet the principal dental surgeons without either preconditions or prejudice.  However, they have a number of preconditions, the basis of which is that there should be no change, that supplementary funding should be provided or that the money should be taken from elsewhere in the HSE's budget.  These are not things that are acceptable for any meeting.  I do not know the status of this submission to the committee but I know the status of three affidavits I have sworn to the High Court.  Everything I said over the past few minutes is contained in them and much more, particularly the exhibits I talked about and the terms of the circular being signed off on 2 April.  For someone to say was there was no consultation, in light of all that, is pushing it out.  It might be no harm for the committee to have copies of the affidavits because there is useful information in them.
#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	220	It is difficult for the committee to do its business if any group comes before us and makes categorical statements, irrespective of the fact that we outline to witnesses at the commencement of meetings that they have privilege.  Now that we are telling them they have absolute privilege, one would hope that no group would abuse that by putting information into the public arena that is at variance with the facts.  That is something to which the committee will have to return.
#BobbyAylward	unknown-#BobbyAylward-party	unknown-#BobbyAylward-dob	unknown-#BobbyAylward-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	221	As a committee, we also need to use our own rationale.  We have to be able to make a judgment call ourselves.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	225	The HSE is quite willing at any time to meet the IDA to discuss the implementation of the new arrangements.  We are mandated to deliver a service within the 2008 budget.  Fees have dropped since 2008 and we believe we can deliver the same level of service as in 2008.  We have on the record several times indicated our willingness to meet the IDA without preconditions to work through the implementation and to provide clarification.  There are certain temporal clarifications that one cannot put into a policy that deals with a €63 million allocation for a scheme in two pages.  Over the years, policy statements issue and there is always ongoing dialogue and meetings with groups.

Perhaps it is something we need to consider.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	231	Yes, the lead representatives of the people referred to by the Deputy signed off in writing that the circular that issued, a draft of which they had on 1 April, did not change between that and 26 April.  It is an exhibit to the affidavit, which says I had met all of their major concerns.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	238	Over the next three months, the arrangements we have put in place to deal with the 17 issues raised, including for individuals with special needs who may get a letter from the HSE saying their card will be reviewed in three months, are that we will make the GP aware of that in advance.  We have other more constructive proposals which have been received well by the IMO.  The organisation must give us feedback on the specifics but the position is we are moving down the correct road.
#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	239	We will move to concluding remarks but it would be a pity if Mr. de Freine did not have an opportunity to comment on St. Vincent's Hospital.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	240	I will quickly summarise the position on the new ward block.  The plan is to provide a ward block containing 100 inpatient beds plus a dedicated day unit for patients with cystic fibrosis, CF, and other ancillary accommodation.  The recently completed ambulatory block in the hospital provides accommodation that is also for the use of CF patients.
#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	241	Will the 100 beds be specifically for CF patients?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	242	That decision is to be made by the management board.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	244	As I understand it, there is a ten-bedded unit for the day treatment of CF patients and there is a proposal to have one of the five 20-bedded wards given to the use of CF patients but all the beds with the 100-bed complement are to be designed to the same standards.  Four beds per ward will be isolation beds, which will provide an even higher standard of accommodation.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	246	Absolutely.  They are replacement beds to replace existing beds that do not meet current standards within the hospital.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	249	The NCHD issue is not all about recruitment and immigration.  Ireland produced 318 Irish medical graduates in 2004-05.  We will produce 430 EU graduates next year, 542 the following year and the intake last year, which will emerge in four years, was 651.  Ireland's problem with medical graduates going forward will not be a shortage.  This is the most massive increase in intake.With regard to general practice and corporatisation, if anything, it needs to go in the opposite direction because Ireland will have so many of its own doctors looking for work that——

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	251	We will work with any process or incentivisation the Government decides to put in place to get the centres built.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	252	I refer to a number of outstanding issues, which can be addressed in writing, relating to the ambulance service in the north east and home help service.  Can I get an assurance that will happen?
#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	253	We will get a written response.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	254	Is the orthopaedic-stroke unit in Merlin Park Hospital closing or not?  It is a matter of grave concern and I would like an answer before the meeting concludes.  That is not unreasonable.  I also asked about influenza vaccines being administered by pharmacists but that was not addressed by the Minister or Professor Drumm.  I also sought a maternity hospital update and asked about the misdiagnosis scandal and that was not addressed either.There are outstanding issues relating to small groups of individuals who have been seriously affected by our health service and who still seek resolution of their issue.  They include the thalidomide group, the symphysiotomy group and the victims of Dr. Shine, Dignity for Patients.  I also refer to the gross unfairness meted out to patients who suffered at the hands of Dr. Neary.  Purely on age grounds, they will not be compensated, even though they had some of the most serious injuries and insults inflicted on them.  We will have to look at that again.We did not touch on the issue of discretionary cards for the terminally ill.  There was a time when these were nearly automatically provided.  Now, people are being put through the wringer to get them and often have passed away by the time they do.  On a more positive note, both the committee and I visited the primary care centre in Mitchelstown.  This is the way forward.  Professor Higgins has moved his entire ante-natal care practice there, including obstetrics.  The centre is an excellent model that should be pursued elsewhere.  The Minister talks about the national treatment purchase fund, NTPF, in glowing terms.  Last year some €90 million was spent treating 28,000 patients, most of whom did not require major surgery, whereas the North of Ireland cleared a list of 57,000 patients for £36 million.I must mention Loughloe House, which I visited with Senator McFadden.  The quality of service there, as adjudged by the people who use it, was excellent.  The HIQA had reservations about management and staffing levels there, which are matters for the HSE.  However, we have been told the facility is not fit for purpose.  Is it true it is to be modified to turn it into a mental health facility?   When will a decision be made with regard to the move of the Central Mental Hospital to Portrane and the sale of its land?  Will the Minister respond in writing to me with regard to when the decision will be made on that?  What moneys will be raised from the sale of lands this year?Did Professor Drumm say we would have a huge psychiatric unit at Beaumont?  Planning permission for that has been compromised by the proposal for a new co-located hospital there, so how can it go ahead if that is the case?  Perhaps this is an admission by the Minister that we will get a psychiatric unit for real patients rather than pie in the sky.  I would welcome that.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	255	The Deputy should visit the site.  He needs to go out and to look at the hospital.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	256	The co-located hospital impinges on the same site.  Therefore, unless the Minister applied for further planning permission, the original planning permission was compromised.  That I know.Professor Drumm mentioned shorter waiting times of from nought to six hours around the country, but we believe what we see.  We walk into hospitals like Beaumont and see patients lying on trolleys for two, three or four days.  I can attest to that.  The same is true for Drogheda.  He also alluded to 1,000 GPs being part of teams.  These are virtual teams, but we want to see real additional services through new primary care units, as promised nine years ago.I am delighted Mr. Burke has made some changes with regard to the over-70s.  This will make their lot easier in terms of their concerns about their medical cards.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	257	I thank the members of the delegation for their responses.  My main bone of contention is the respite services.  Am I correct in my understanding that Ms McGuinness will ensure a meeting will be held between the HSE and the Brothers of Charity in Limerick to resolve the issue?  Will she assure me they will sit down and discuss the issue, without preconditions?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	258	I spoke to the managers yesterday, but have not had any conversation with the brothers yet.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	259	That is welcome.  I hope the centre will be open before the end of the week.I am speaking on behalf of the Labour Party.  Senator Prendergast raised the issue of the moratorium on the recruitment of public health nurses.  We need enough nurses to ensure the service can be delivered.  I am aware, for example, that developmental tests have been delayed because public health nurses have been so busy, partly because of the administration of the H1N1 vaccine.  Cervical screening is another issue.  I urge the Minister and the HSE to be conscious of these issues.  Senator Prendergast is also concerned about south Tipperary maternity services.The Chairman made a strong defence of the committee's report on primary care and raised the issue of corporatisation.  Our concern is that developers or people with money will build these centres and hire them out to GPs.  That is not what we have in mind.  We feel that people working in the service, whether as private or public health practitioners, should have control of these facilities.  That is my understanding of the Chair's concern with regard to corporate control, although perhaps I should let him fight his own battles.  However, he is fighting the battle on behalf of the committee, which had strong feelings on this issue, right across the political spectrum.  I also welcome the progress made with regard to medical cards because we took on this issue in the committee and took a cross-party position on it.I am concerned about the mention made by the Minister of registration of hospitals before the end of the year.  I am pleased this will happen, but have a concern.  It is very easy for private hospitals to cherry-pick their patients and the issues with which they will deal.  Therefore, it will probably be easy for them to satisfy registration requirements, because they will only do what is profitable and what they can do within the rules.  However, public hospitals must, whether they like it or not, deal with everybody who comes in the door.  I am aware the Minister does not like the word "resource", but can we have a commitment that a public hospital that has a statutory duty to look after everybody in the community will not be disadvantaged in comparison to private hospitals?  Will she assure us that private hospitals will not just be allowed to do all the nice bits while public hospitals are left with tougher and sicker patients?  We need to consider the situation before we end up in a position where we in the Opposition are told that we are not standing up for a quality service.  We want the public health service to be raised to the quality required in order to ensure public hospitals can be registered.Once again, I thank Professor Drumm for his assistance and wish him the best of luck.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	261	I am not in a position to break the moratorium.  The health service must, as part of the public service, meet the numbers required.  There is no ban on recruitment in a particular group.  It is a question of reducing numbers overall, but where there are priorities, the HSE is in a position to address them within the overall numbers, including particular types of nurses.The flu vaccine is mainly administered by GPs.  I favour pharmacists being involved and last week launched an initiative for Boots where, under the patient group directive and beginning this coming winter, it will provide the flu vaccine.  It will be a matter for patients or the HSE, if it wants to procure services, to decide whether to use pharmacists, based on quality and price.  With regard to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, Deputy Reilly will be aware that the Comptroller and Auditor General has looked at its cost base.  Comparing like with like, the NPTF compares very favourably with HIPE.  Deputy Reilly compared NTPF costs with costs in Northern Ireland.  With regard to out-of-hours treatment, we pay €108 million for such treatment for 1.6 million people, whereas in Northern Ireland, treatment for the same number of people costs only £18 million.  Unfortunately, we do not compare favourably with Northern Ireland across many headings in the health area.  We need to reduce our cost base and get it much closer to the kind of costs they have in Northern Ireland.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	262	No reduction in charges for five years.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	263	I have not received any support from Deputy Reilly when I have been reducing costs.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	264	We do our best and support the Minister when it is appropriate.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	265	Even in the Deputy's favourite health system, dental care is restricted.   Everybody understands that money is limited and we must use the money we have to deliver the best possible care we can.On licensing and accreditation, we hope the draft standards will be published by the HIQA this summer and that we will have the heads of the Bill later this year.  We are talking 2012 for the system.  We could not begin it now because hospitals and other facilities need time to prepare.  It will not happen next year.  We are working towards a timeframe of 2012, but will publish the draft heads for consultation.  The HIQA will publish the draft standards this summer.I think I have dealt with most of the issues raised, although I am aware Deputy Reilly thinks I never deal with his.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	266	What about the Merlin Park issue?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	267	Professor Drumm will deal with that.  I would like to pay personal tribute to Professor Drumm as this is his last meeting here.  He has been a breath of fresh air in the public health system.  Unlike many people who ran the health service in the past, he did not complain about resources.  He was driven by quality and the new clinical leadership that has emerged owes a lot to him.  We see the evidence of that in Professor Higgins.  I wish we had a Professor Higgins everywhere in the country.  Perhaps it is his Northern Ireland blood that gives him the stamina for the job.  He is doing a terrific job.  In fairness, there are also many other excellent people in the service throughout the country.  Great clinical leadership has emerged and we all owe a great deal of gratitude to Professor Drumm for the outstanding public service he has given in reforming the health services over the past five years.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	269	My colleague, Ms Laverne McGuinness, will deal with the question about Merlin Park.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	270	Merlin Park hospital is part of the Galway university hospital.  We have spoken about budgets.  Merlin Park and University College Hospital are the hospitals with most over-expenditure in the country at this stage.  As part of the rationalisation to ensure they come back to budget this year, a number of services are being amalgamated.  It is intended that orthopaedic services will be one of the services that could be rationalised at UCH rather than in Merlin Park, in a measure of effectiveness and efficiencies.  Discussions have taken place with clinicians.  A range of other measures will happen over a number of sites, including Portiuncula and Roscommon, as we move forward, in order to bring Galway back in line with the rest of the country.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	271	Will the stroke unit be moved out?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	272	I am not sure about the stroke unit.  I will have to come back to the Deputy on that question.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-13 00:00:00	Prelude	273	There have been many comments about clinical leadership.  The north east made the first start when there was very little clinical leadership anywhere.  It is very important for me to acknowledge the difficulty of that situation.  However, Dr. Colm Quigley, former president of the Irish Medical Council, came to the north east from the south east and Ms Eilís McGovern, the current president of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, did tremendous work on clinical leadership.  Little by little it became possible for locally-based people to take up the mantle.  I refer to James Hayes in Cavan and Cavan-Monaghan has been less problematic in recent times.  I wish to acknowledge the tremendous work of Dr. Dominic Ó Brannagáin in the Louth-Meath area.  I am sure Deputy Reilly will allow me say this about accident and emergency departments.  I acknowledge some of them have had chronic problems but the vast majority have done very well.  Drogheda, in particular, had huge problems.  I do not think any hospital in the country has been criticised more than Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, over the years.  There are many reasons for this.  However, in the past couple of months, there have been no patients waiting on trolleys.  This is due to the tremendous efforts of staff.  I wish to acknowledge this effort on behalf of the HSE.  Clinical leadership has been the cause of this turnaround.I thank the committee members for their comments.

At that time he took on what looked like being probably the most challenging position in the Irish public service.  That took courage and it probably took more courage to stay with the position over the past five years.  It has been very turbulent.  I think history will record that he led the service through significant positive change and the nation owes him a large debt of gratitude.  His successor will have big shoes to fill.  We wish him well but we wish Professor Drumm success in whatever course he decides to follow.  I thank him for his courtesy over the years.
