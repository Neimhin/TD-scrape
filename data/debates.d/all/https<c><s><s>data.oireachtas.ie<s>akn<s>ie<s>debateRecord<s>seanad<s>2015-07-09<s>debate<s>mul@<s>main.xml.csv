#MartinConway	unknown-#MartinConway-party	unknown-#MartinConway-dob	unknown-#MartinConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	2	Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh, and thank you for allowing the Commencement matter to go ahead. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, to the House. This issue is simple. Ballyvaughan in County Clare as well as Fanore and the Burren are among the most unique areas of landscape in the world. The Burren certainly has a unique style in terms of its rock, limestone, mountainous terrain, flora and fauna. Some of the flowers there only grow in the Burren and nowhere else in the world. The Burrenbeo and Burren Geopark projects have had major success. They have won international awards and they are going to win many more awards. These, coupled with the Cliffs of Moher visitor experience and the panoramic coastline that extends all along the coast of County Clare, in particular from the Cliffs of Moher up as far as Ballyvaughan, are our natural resources. They are creating and sustaining jobs in the northern part of County Clare. Meanwhile, a fish farm is being proposed. I do not know very much about fish farms but I have been talking to many people who know a great deal about them and I do not like what I hear. It is the same among the people of north Clare. I do not believe we need this type of investment in County Clare to create jobs. We have ample opportunity to create jobs in the county by promoting and investing in tourism and in promoting our natural resources. We do not need fish farms. It would be more in the line of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to negotiate properly for access to sea waters for the fishermen who go to sea for a living, instead of indirectly encouraging these types of fish farms which, ultimately, will compromise the natural resources we have. I wish to put on the record of this House clearly that I am not in favour of the fish farm, either as it is proposed or as it will be alternatively proposed following downsizing. What we have we need to protect rather than compromise.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	3	I thank Senator Conway for raising this issue which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. In 2012 Bord Iascaigh Mhara submitted an application to the Department for an aquaculture licence for the cultivation of fin fish near Inis Oírr in Galway Bay. The application and its accompanying environmental impact statement are being considered under the provisions of the 1997 Fisheries (Amendment) Act and the 1933 Foreshore Act which provide for extensive consultation with stakeholders and for a period of general public consultation as well. The public consultation stage of the assessment process in respect of the application is now closed and a total of 410 valid submissions were received by the Department. BIM has estimated that one of these production areas could generate over €100 million in exports per annum and create 350 direct jobs. A further 150 jobs would be created indirectly in the service sector, supplying fish feed, netting, transportation and other services. There is always a strict separation between the ministerial duty to promote sustainable development of the industry and the ministerial role as a decision-maker in respect of aquaculture licence applications. This separation of duties is serious and is strictly observed at all times. All aspects of the Galway Bay application are currently being examined by the Department in conjunction with its scientific, engineering, technical and legal advisors. All submissions received as part of the statutory consultation stage of the process and the general public consultation stage will form an integral part of the Department's consideration of the application. The legislation provides for extensive consultation with stakeholders, including Inland Fisheries Ireland, which has responsibility for wild salmon stocks. It is important for all parties to understand that as the application is under active consideration as part of the statutory process it would not be appropriate to comment on the merits or otherwise of the application pending the completion of the formal assessment process by the Department. The application process is governed by legislation and must not be subject to parallel discussions by the Minister or his Department that could be misconstrued in any way as indicating a predisposition by the Department in respect of the application. Of course, no such predisposition exists and the formal assessment process will take into account and evaluate all of the observations received from stakeholders and the general public in respect of the application. Any person submitting a licence application to the Department has an entitlement, in accordance with fair procedures, to have the application fully considered in accordance with legislation. The legislation provides for a possible appeal of the ministerial decision to the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board, the independent authority for the determination of appeals against decisions of the Minister. A draft national strategic plan for sustainable aquaculture development has been published by the Department and is currently the subject of public consultation. It would not be appropriate for anyone to seek to prejudge the outcome of the consultation process or any actions, legislative or otherwise, that might follow from that process. In the meantime, and in the normal way, applications on hand and all new applications will continue to be assessed under the provisions of the existing legislation and licence determinations made in accordance with the legislation. Senators can be assured that the public interest is well protected under the provisions of the relevant legislation and the Minister is mindful of the importance of proceeding fully in line with statutory requirements.
#MartinConway	unknown-#MartinConway-party	unknown-#MartinConway-dob	unknown-#MartinConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	4	I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to take this Commencement Debate matter on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Of course we have to respect the separation of decision-making and so forth as well as the appropriateness of ministerial involvement. However, as I said at the outset the Minister also has responsibility to protect our environment as well as a responsibility to protect our natural resources and tourism industry. His responsibilities lie not only in terms of creating jobs but in terms of sustaining the jobs already in place. I would appreciate if the Minister of State brought these observations to the Minister. We will watch the process with interest.
#HildegardeNaughton	unknown-#HildegardeNaughton-party	unknown-#HildegardeNaughton-dob	unknown-#HildegardeNaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	5	I thank the Minister for attending. I recently had the opportunity to talk to a retired nurse of senior standing who qualified in what was then the regional hospital in Newcastle, Galway, in the early 1970s. She had been there from the mid to late 1960s. The hospital is now University Hospital Galway, UHG, which is located on University Road. It was a hugely informative discussion. She was able to tell me about the lack of specialisation back then and the handful of surgeons and consultants. She thought there were about ten in total. She spoke about the conditions that nowadays require a day case or perhaps an overnight procedure but from which one could have died 40 years ago. She was able to tell me about the much smaller hospital building in a much smaller town and the fact it was effectively run by a matron of fearsome repute. She was also able to list out on a piece of paper, floor by floor, ward by ward, as only a nursing sister can, the number of inpatient beds in University Hospital Galway in 1971. The number was 464, give or take a few. At the time the population of Galway was much smaller and there were a lot fewer surgeons and consultants. Back then the hospital was not a centre of excellence, attracting patients from all over the western seaboard for oncology, cardiothoracic surgery and cardiology, and when patients were not flown there daily from all over Connacht and beyond, from out at sea and the top of mountains for emergency treatment. In the space of 45 years, University Hospital Galway has added just less than 100 inpatient beds to cope with the current need. I accept that medical science has advanced and many people can now be seen as a day case for conditions that previously would have required admission. I also accept that modern health and safety regulations dictate that the number of beds in a given space in the previous time would no longer be acceptable today. Additionally, some people no longer even need a procedure with the advent of new drugs. I will not argue with the nurse on whether her memory is correct on the numbers, but the fact remains and the Minister has seen it for himself that the hospital complex is simply bursting at the seams. It is not just the accident and emergency department, it is the entire complex. I am sure the Minister would acknowledge the staff at the hospital do a wonderful job. The simple issue is a lack of space. The chief operating officer, Tony Canavan, said so himself on Monday. One could ask what is happening at the moment. To make space, the physiotherapy department and other sections are being moved across the city away from the acute hospital to Merlin Park. That is hardly ideal. Basically what is happening there is a daily patch job, a case of getting over the crisis and moving on to the next. For the avoidance of doubt, the blame for the situation cannot be laid at the Minister’s door. We inherited an economy that was broken. We had no money to invest in infrastructure and we still have very little. Even if we had the money, the infrastructure required would take some time to complete. The problem in UHG is a manifestation of years of under-investment and the fact that when investment was made, the result was past its sell-by date when the doors were opened. The current accident and emergency department is hardly in place for 20 years, yet it is completely unfit for purpose. One could ask what we can do. The Government is in office and, money or no money, we simply must plan for the future. I ask the Minister two things: first, to recommit as a matter of priority to getting a new accident and emergency unit with the shell space for a new maternity department included in the capital development programme and, second, to order a comprehensive study of future bed needs, including bed capacity, at University Hospital Galway. The study should include the development potential of the Merlin Park site and also demographic changes that are forecast for the next 30 to 40 years. The development can be fed into the capital programme in the forthcoming years. It should be a long-term plan for the development of the major acute hospital in the west over the coming decades, a hospital that saves the lives of people from Donegal to Clare and Connemara to Athlone. Perhaps in that way we can avoid the fire-fighting that has been a feature of our health system for decades. I know the Minister. He is a straight talker and that is very much appreciated. It is in that spirit that I urge him to consider this request.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	6	I thank Senator Naughton for raising this issue today. First, I recognise that University Hospital Galway is extremely busy, with approximately 66,000 emergency department attendances, 38,500 inpatient discharges and 76,000 day cases every year. A number of construction and infrastructure projects are now under way at Galway University Hospitals, GUH, including the upgrade of the medical gas network and the commencement of enabling works for the new 50-bed acute mental health department. The transfer of acute mental health services to a new, purpose-built unit will facilitate construction of a new radiation oncology project, which is currently in design phase, at the old mental health services site. A significant and welcome construction project, which commenced in May of this year, is the new ward block which will provide 75 beds in single room accommodation. Some of that capacity will replace older wards and some will be additional, to address the inherent bed capacity deficit that exists in Galway. It is anticipated that work will be completed by the end of 2016. Recognising that the loss of 17 beds to commence this building work was unavoidable, 14 additional rehabilitation beds were opened in Merlin Park. In addition, emergency capital funding was approved by the HSE on 30 June to create 30 bed spaces in temporary ward accommodation as an interim measure. The additional accommodation will provide additional capacity and enable more effective streamlining of patients through the acute medical and acute surgical assessment units. The HSE is undertaking all actions possible to expedite the procurement of this accommodation without undue delay. The completion of the hospital's clinical research facility and translational research facility building, which is now operational, is another significant development, facilitating clinical research, while allowing patients access to state-of-the-art treatment. That is a major advancement for the hospital as it has been internationally proven that clinical care provided in a research-intensive environment results in the best patient outcomes. I referred at the outset to the high level of activity which takes place at the emergency department in Galway. As well as working closely with the special delivery unit, SDU, to better manage patient flow through the hospital, GUH has also recruited and allocated experienced general and paediatric nurses and advanced nurse practitioners to the emergency department. When we examine the pattern of patients on trolleys each week, however, it is clear that changes in working practices and better liaison with primary and social care services will help make better use of our facilities and smooth out activity in hospitals. In particular, the provision of short-stay beds in the community, transitional beds, additional intensive home care packages and medical care provided by community intervention teams in patients' homes are essential and welcome changes in activity which mean acute hospital facilities are used by those who specifically require acute medical or surgical care and the use of a hospital bed is less frequently required. I acknowledge that the current physical infrastructure of the emergency department is not fit for purpose and requires investment. The HSE is concentrating on applying the limited funding available for infrastructure development in the most effective way possible to meet current and future needs across the overall acute hospital sector. Limited funding is available for new projects over the next multi-annual period which runs from 2015 to 2019, but I am advised by the HSE that some funding is available to advance the development of the plans to upgrade the emergency department at GUH. I will seek to have further funding for this project included in the 2016 to 2022 capital plan.

My reason for raising the matter this morning was to emphasise the importance of forward planning in University Hospital Galway. Over decades we have had add-ons in dribs and drabs and the hospital is still not capable of dealing with the demands placed on it. We must also consider a plan for the future, taking into account the congested city centre location of the hospital, and examine the potential of a site such as that in Merlin Park, which is under-utilised. A long-term plan is required. People accept that the Minister has no magic wand but it is important we carry out a review and examine the long-term plan not only for Galway but the western seaboard and how the facility can meet the demands of citizens.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	8	The Senator's points are well made in that we are often running to catch up in health care. We are doing exactly the same now with the additional 30 beds for the existing physiotherapy department in Galway which I hope will make the patient experience much better this winter. The additional 75 beds in the ward block currently under construction will be a significant benefit to the area. These beds will be in individual rooms which means the risk of infection such as MRSA and C.diff is dramatically reduced. The hospital group may wish to examine where it sees the hospital in 20 years time and to engage in long-term planning, as the Senator suggests. That work is being done for the Cork hospitals and we have done that work for the maternity hospitals in Dublin, so perhaps there is a case for the hospital group to do some work on where it would see the hospital and what sort of hospital it would have in 20 or 30 years time. The story related by that retired nurse is very true and it shows how much things have changed. More hospital beds were needed in the past because day cases were not the norm and people stayed in hospital for procedures which are performed as day cases now. Also, people could not get home as quickly. Over time, we have needed fewer hospital beds rather than more. However, it is very difficult to predict future trends. American experts who come here say we have too many beds and that we use them inappropriately. For example, cancer centres in America may often have no inpatients because patients stay in a hotel on the campus of the hospital and are treated every day. The number of patients who need to be horizontal in a bed on a ward and nursed 24-7 is actually very low. We may yet find in the future that we do not need as many additional beds as we think.
#MarkDaly	unknown-#MarkDaly-party	unknown-#MarkDaly-dob	unknown-#MarkDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	9	I thank the Minister for coming to the House to deal with this matter relating to Kenmare hospital. This €7 million project was constructed and completed more than two years ago. The official opening was performed one year ago by his predecessor. It is a fantastic new facility for the community. The campaign had been carried on since 1974 when the first of many promises were made about the hospital. Unfortunately, over four decades, many of those promises were not fulfilled. However, the community and the Kenmare hospital action group are delighted that their sustained efforts over those decades have reached fulfilment. Unfortunately, despite the fact we have a 40-bed hospital, not all beds are in use and there is a huge demand for them. We have been in contact with the HSE to ask for the remainder of the beds to be opened but staffing has not been allocated. Will the Minister look into this situation? I commend the efforts of the likes of Una Clinton O'Neill, who is the chairperson of the group, and many others who met all the politicians from all sides to ensure this was fulfilled only to see half the hospital empty. This is not a desirable situation. Ms O'Neill and others were involved in what could be described as tense negotiations before the previous Government collapsed whereby a legally binding letter of agreement was issued by the HSE which ensured that for the first time we had a concrete sign to ensure, despite many years of promises, the hospital would open. I was delighted to be involved in the negotiations with the HSE and Glenbeigh Construction to ensure, despite many promises from 1974 and including 1997, 2002 and 2007 - the list of all the broken promises is too long - we eventually got the hospital. It is half-opened and I hope the Minister will have news as to when all the rooms and the required staffing will be in place.

I am taking this debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who is abroad on Government business. The Kenmare community nursing unit was opened in 2013. It replaced the existing 24-bed residential unit with a new facility which includes 40 residential beds, a mental health day care centre and a new ambulance base for the locality. The new unit provides an improved and enhanced environment for residents in which the strong local tradition of caring for the elderly can continue to flourish. When the stage is reached where an older person can no longer remain at home, the State provides financial support through the nursing homes support scheme for those who need long-term residential care. The scheme aims to ensure long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. The scheme is currently the subject of a review. This review is considering the scheme's long-term sustainability as well as looking at how well the current model of provision is balancing residential care with care in the community and whether this needs to be adjusted to better reflect what older people want. Following registration with HIQA in June 2013, Kenmare community care unit opened on a phased basis, with the first phase being the transfer of the inpatient service within existing resources. The HSE Cork and Kerry community health organisation is carrying out a review of services in the Kerry community hospitals. The review of Kenmare community hospital will consider the requirement for both long-stay and short-stay residential beds. Following this review, HSE management in Kerry will be in a position to consider the viability of opening and funding additional beds in Kenmare community hospital, particularly through funding from the nursing home support scheme. The collection of data for the review of services began on 9 January and concluded yesterday. A preliminary analysis of the data collected to date about short-stay bed availability in County Kerry has indicated that during the months of January to June, there was no evidence of a deficit in the number of short-stay beds available to meet requests for admission to these beds. Kenmare community hospital currently has two short-stay beds vacant. All the long-stay beds in the hospital are currently occupied. A final report on the bed requirements at Kenmare community hospital will be completed and available at the end of this month. The HSE will continue to explore how the additional beds in Kenmare community hospital can best be utilised to meet the needs of the wider community.

I note the issue with regard to the data collected and the fact that two short-stay beds are currently vacant but the real need relates to long-stay beds because that is the function of a community nursing unit. I have information about a person who will need a short-stay bed following a fall at mass last week when it took one hour for the ambulance to show up, but that is a matter for another day. There are 20 long-stay beds vacant but there is a pent-up demand for long-stay beds. I agree that the short-stay beds are a different matter. Perhaps the Minister will examine the issue of the long-stay beds because no staff have been allocated for the nursing unit to ensure the 20 other vacant beds on an entire floor of the hospital can be used.

Figures from the 34 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, countries show Ireland has one of the toughest inheritance tax regimes in the world and Dublin accounts for over half of all inheritance tax paid last year. The current situation of inheritance tax in Ireland shows that there is a clear anti-Dublin bias. The increase in property prices, particularly in Dublin, is generating a massive tax burden for families who inherit homes from their deceased loved ones. In Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown the average price of a three-bedroom house is €500,000. The threshold is €225,000 and the tax rate is 33%. The blow is that in the midst of being overwhelmed by the deaths of their parents, people must pay this tax up front. There should be a dramatic change in the approach to inheritance tax. The threshold should be changed. In 2000 it was €381,000. To be fair, it should be raised to €400,000 and the rate dropped to 20% because 33% is too high. It is ridiculous putting a burden on children of parents who have worked hard and want in their hearts and souls to make sure their children have a good quality of life. They must pay this tax up front. They might have to sell the house to pay the tax and gain nothing from it. It is a very serious issue for everyone but particularly people in Dublin.  The Labour Party Whip, Deputy Stagg, sent a dramatic e-mail to a constituent, saying that he and many others in the Labour Party are totally opposed to the cuts to the one-parent family payment, made by the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, Leader of the Labour Party. This affects thousands of young families.

I have not seen any e-mail from Deputy Emmett Stagg, but we had an extensive debate in this House on the lone parent's allowance. I participated in that debate, as did others, and we are all agreed on the need to ensure lone parents move out of the poverty trap in which welfare dependency has left them. If anyone doubts this, I urge him or her to look at the figures for the risk of poverty status of lone parents. They show that, even at the height of the boom, they were at a vastly heightened risk of poverty because of welfare traps and welfare dependency. What the Tánaiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, is seeking to do in the reforms is to ensure activation measures will be put in place to move lone parents out of welfare dependency-----

I have engaged directly with the Tánaiste, as have my Labour Party colleagues, on the group of lone parents who may suffer adverse consequences as a result of the changes to seek to ensure these consequences will not be adverse in terms of lost income. We are engaging actively with her and her Department on the issue. I understand the Tánaiste is actively engaged in following up on individual cases. I urge any colleague who is aware of individual cases to raise them with her office and the Department and engage with local Intreo offices which are now very much geared towards implementing job activation measures and moving away from welfare dependency. I refer to the Employment Equality (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, Report Stage of which will be taken this afternoon. It is a good day for the Seanad to see the Bill conclude in this House where it was introduced as a Private Members' Bill by me and Senator Mary Moran on behalf of Labour Party Senators. It aims to amend what is a real embarrassment for the country, the continued existence in an unamended form of section 37 of the Employment Equality Act which facilitates discrimination and has a chilling effect for those who are lesbian or gay, particularly teachers who teach in religious run schools.

For that reason, I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that we deal first with No. 68, non-Government motion No. 16, on the Order Paper in my name and those of Fianna Fáil Party Senators and Senator Gerard P. Craughwell. It addresses clearly and logically the position of lone parents and would give Members on all sides of the House an opportunity to engage in the discussion.
#MartinConway	unknown-#MartinConway-party	unknown-#MartinConway-dob	unknown-#MartinConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	38	On 30 June there were two fatalities in County Clare. I understand that in one case the ambulance service had to request the assistance of the fire service. I also understand that as a result of staff shortages in Ennis, paramedics had to be drafted in from other parts of the county which left them compromised in the provision of an ambulance service. In his wisdom, the Minister for Health has announced the establishment of a new national ambulance service. However, given the serious incidents on Monday, 30 June in County Clare, it is appropriate that he request a report on what happened on that day and the level of ambulance cover provided. He should also seek explanations from the National Ambulance Service management for what happened. The position is extremely serious and such a report is required as a matter of urgency. Following on from it, I suggest there be a review of ambulance services in County Clare. I, therefore, ask the Leader to request the Minister to initiate a report and review the ambulance service in County Clare as a matter of urgency.

In today's edition of the Irish Independent the public affairs editor, Mr. Shane Phelan, reports that Ibrahim Halawa has been subject to electric shock torture in an Egyptian prison, according to a submission made by a leading human rights lawyer to politicians yesterday. It is important that this young man be released by the authorities in Egypt and brought back to Ireland. As Members know, his father, Sheikh Hussein Halawa, is the most senior Islamic cleric in Ireland. Ibrahim Halawa has been detained for almost two years. It is very serious that an Irish citizen is being treated in this manner. I know that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Charles Flanagan, is doing his best, as is the ambassador, but their best is not good enough. The State-----

I have every confidence in the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, his officials and our consular staff who are doing everything possible to secure his release. In the past year and a half some 42 visits have been made to him in prison in Egypt.I believe this issue will be resolved through diplomacy. I certainly believe that grandstanding such as we have seen here this morning is not helpful. I would appeal to everybody to work diplomatically and to support the efforts being made by our diplomatic staff to resolve this issue and get this young man home. I want also to speak on behalf of the asthma suffers of this country, some 470,000 people who live with this condition on an ongoing basis. We have the fourth highest incidence of asthma in the world and 60% of sufferers in Ireland have uncontrolled asthma, meaning they are at risk of an asthma attack. One in every ten adults has asthma and one in every five children, which is a frightening statistic. A clinical programme for asthma was adopted in 2011 but, to date, it has gone largely unimplemented. I call on the Government to include the funding for the first phase of this programme in the 2016 budget. It is estimated it would cost some €2.5 million and the priority would be to spend this money in primary care, given the majority of people are treated for their asthma condition by their local GP. I would also like to see a free annual asthma review for each person with asthma. Another issue is that asthma sufferers are paying a very high cost for medication, which is an area that needs to be addressed. At some stage in the future, we should have a discussion with the Minister for Health in the House in regard to the rolling out of the clinical programme for asthma and its funding in the 2016 budget.
#KathrynReilly	unknown-#KathrynReilly-party	unknown-#KathrynReilly-dob	unknown-#KathrynReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	58	Two weeks ago the Joint Committee on European Affairs launched a report, UK-EU future relationship: Implications for Ireland, which specifically looked at the implications for Ireland of Britain leaving the EU. At the time, this launch was mentioned in the House but I want to know when we might have a debate in the House and bring in the relevant Minister to discuss the report. I raise this issue particularly in regard to the cross-Border effects and the implications for the Border region, in particular the economy and local communities. If Britain were to leave the EU, it would significantly change the Border area and we were warned during the committee deliberations of the effects it could have. It would transform the Border into a major international frontier which would be manned by passport checkpoints and customs controls. It is important that we discuss this, not just for those reasons, but because of the implications it could have for the Good Friday Agreement and some of the cross-Border institutions that rest upon that. We all know there are many issues in the North at the minute and the institutions are already under threat. We do not want any further stunting of the progress that has been made in recent years. One issue that is pertinent when talking about the Border is that of funding. The Border region has benefited hugely from EU funding and the agriculture industry has benefited from an all-Ireland approach. There would be significant implications for these areas. I ask the Leader when we will have a discussion on this important matter. I want to ask the Minister what role the Government is playing currently to ensure the country is bolstered against trade, immigration and financial fallout in regard to a potential exit.

I suggest to the Leader that we might have a debate on the issue of taxation more generally, in particular taxation and fairness. I must admit I cannot agree with Senator White. First, inheritance tax is based on value and, obviously, Dublin properties are more valuable than properties outside of Dublin. The other point I would make is that inheritance tax is tax on unearned income and is set at 33% after the €225,000 allowance. Someone can work a couple of extra hours in a supermarket and pay 40% at the marginal rate. I do not think tax on unearned income should be lower than tax where people go out and work in productive employment.

I am very surprised the Senator would raise an issue such as child care and, in the same breath, suggest that people should be able to have tax relief on wealth they do not earn when, obviously, the more wealth they inherit, the more unequal society is. We do not see too many people on social welfare inheriting more than €225,000, and, by the way, it is €225,000 per child. On that point, I would be very happy to have a wider debate on the whole issue of fairness. I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Willie Penrose, on the fact his proposal to reduce the period of bankruptcy to one year was accepted, as I understand it, unanimously by the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality yesterday. I ask that this would be incorporated into law as quickly as possible. We have all seen the desperate situation in this country and the unwillingness of banks to resolve the situation for people. The period of bankruptcy, together with the bank veto, have been identified as two issues which are still delaying the resolution of the serious issue of mortgage arrears. Will the Leader ask the relevant Minister when Deputy Penrose's very welcome proposal of limiting the bankruptcy period to one year will be incorporated into law?

As we know, many ambulances are stood down and are not available when required throughout the country. In my own county of Kerry, two emergency ambulances have been withdrawn over the last four years. We now see situations where patients, including road traffic accident victims, are waiting up to an hour for ambulances to arrive. I ask the Cathaoirleach and the Leader to organise a debate in the House on this situation. I also put the House on notice that we have a motion on the Order Paper in regard to the situation with organ transplants and organ donation. We will be putting an amendment to the Order of Business next week. As we are sitting five days next week, I ask the Leader that we would have the Minister for Health in the House to give a statement in regard to Beaumont Hospital.

Obviously, when the House rises, the situation is not going to be improved. On an important point, the skillsets simply are not there. We know the answer we have been getting, which is that the jobs have been advertised and so on. Unfortunately, the current pay thresholds mean the people have to come in from abroad, if we are going to get them at all. The treatment purchase fund is also an issue we have raised in our motion as it would allow those on the kidney transplant list and the pancreatic transplant list to become eligible for the treatment abroad programme. The most amazing situation dealt with in our motion is that those who are on the transplant list are being instructed to go to accident and emergency, which is hard to believe. These people are very sick and vulnerable to infection. For the HSE and the medical services to be instructing them to go into harm's way by telling them to attend the emergency wards is entirely wrong. They never had to do this before and, in fact, it is the exact opposite of what they had to do and what they should do. I ask that the Minister would come to the House to explain why our transplant patients are being put in harm's way.

We have to rely totally at this stage on the diplomatic efforts being made and led by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. Of course, there is no argument about the inhumane treatment that has been wrongfully doled out to that poor man. We all wish to see him free at the earliest possible stage. It is difficult for one country to circumvent the courts system and what we might think of it, whatever faults it may have, in another country. I am sure that learned legal man, Senator Thomas Byrne, would agree with me. As Senator Mullins has said, the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, is leading well on this issue. Some very inappropriate comments were made on the other side of the House this morning but we will pass over that. On a separate matter, Senator Mark Daly will, no doubt, be glad to hear we will sit four days, rather than five, next week because, as the Leader has explained and I have no doubt will explain again, a Bill will not be ready on Monday.

I am sure Members are aware that yesterday the Irish Congress of Trade Unions decided to oppose the imposition of additional water charges. We are trying to ram legislation through this House which started last night. I ask members to reflect on that. It is opposed by 600,000 members of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I appreciate I am stepping on thin ice when I raise the next issue. The issue of Oireachtas pensions needs to be discussed openly and transparently. When former taoisigh are getting an increase in their pensions while lone parents are being driven into poverty there is something terribly wrong. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate because I am sick of hearing there is a constitutional entitlement and that we are talking about property rights. There were no property rights for public servants when their pay was cut. Perhaps it is time we have somebody in here to discuss property rights and pensions and why pensions are being increased when lone parents are being pushed into poverty.

I understand from reading the newspapers today, particularly the Irish Independent, which seems to be obsessed about pay and pensions in these Houses, that there is some talk of volunteerism. I understand the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, said at the weekend that there could be a legal challenge because of the Lansdowne Road agreement. It is interesting that there has been a deafening silence from the trade unions. We have not heard anything from them. It would be prudent, but it is a matter for the individuals concerned, and it would help to assuage the whipping up of public anger on this issue whenever it comes into the newspapers, if the recipients were to refuse voluntarily to take the increase, which are modest in terms of the overall figures. It would be in the best interest of the public and the county in general if they were to voluntarily refuse to take it. In the context of the Irish Independent, I have spoken to my colleague, Senator Mary White, on this issue because from a male perspective one may not always get it right. I was somewhat disappointed at the photograph that appeared on the front page of the Irish Independent of two hard working Aer Lingus cabin crew shown putting on make-up in advance of the arrival of the Airbus into Dublin Airport. If ever there was a sexist photograph that is demeaning of women this was one of them. Cabin crews work exceptionally hard but to give the impression that they were nothing more than two dolly birds getting their make-on in advance of a plane arriving and being photographed in a national newspaper is unacceptable. I do not think that women, in general, should be shown in such a demeaning manner.  In regard to the Amnesty report and the poll that has appeared in the national newspapers relating to people's attitudes towards abortion, it is important to put on record that the pro-life campaign, in a statement which was not covered by many of the newspapers, revealed that Amnesty International's recent report on Ireland's abortion laws was compiled with the assistance of an international abortion lobby group, called Women on Web, and that not the slightest attempt was made to ensure balance in compiling the report. They failed to consult with women who regret their abortions or those who came under intense pressure from State funded agencies to abort their children with life limiting conditions. The revelation that Amnesty collaborated with the group, Women on Web, in compiling its report completely undermines the credibility of what was produced. It also raises very serious questions about Amnesty's professional judgement for partnering with an organisation that facilitates the reckless and irresponsible importation of abortion drugs into countries such as Ireland, leading to situations where women end up self-administering the drugs without proper medical supervision. I agree with the conclusions of the pro-life campaign group that Amnesty is in fully-fledged campaigning mode on one side of the abortion issue. It is no longer the unprejudiced and even-handed organisation that won the public's trust and respect. I am a member of Amnesty and have been very reluctant to withdraw my membership because of what has happened.

When I and many others in this House, Senator Norris being one, have down through the years raised human rights issues it has been in the forefront when nobody else cared but on this issue it is totally and completely wrong and out of order.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	96	I agree with my colleague, Senator Paschal Mooney, on the matter in regard to Amnesty. When it presented its report to the Joint Committee on Health and Children I decided not to comment on it because I felt that the research provided to the committee was not properly done. I have serious reservations about that report which was presented to the Joint Committee on Health and Children. On the pensions issue, there is a simple solution to the matter, that is for the people who are entitled to the increase to decide not to take it. If Senator Gerard P. Craughwell wishes to write to each of the individuals I am sure nobody is preventing him from doing so. However, there is a legal issue in that the Government cannot pick out one group and decide not to follow through on a prior agreement. That is a legal issue that, unfortunately, cannot be dealt with. It is a constitutional issue and a difficult issue.  May I raise the issue of the drugs problem? I am aware the Minister is attending the Joint Committee on Health as we speak. We had a detailed presentation this morning from a group from Monaghan on the use of drugs by young people. We have a huge problem, no matter where it is, whether in a town, village or city. It is no longer confined to any one area of the country. We need to have a major debate on how to deal with it. The Minister is talking about bringing in new legislation but we all need to be involved, including parents, sports clubs, youth groups, the HSE, the Department of Health and schools. We need to work on how to deal with this growing problem. The figures for 2012, the only figures available to me, show that some 632 people died as a result of drug use in that year. I expect the figures are even higher for 2013 and 2014. More than €109 million is being pumped into this area by the Health Service Executive, but we are making very little progress. We need a major debate on where we want to be and what our plan is for the next five to ten years to deal with this issue. As we know, people are able to order various illegal drugs online and have them posted to them. Children as young as 12, 13 and 14 years are accessing these substances. We have a major problem on our hands and must start dealing with it properly.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	97	I welcome the publication of the European Commission's third report on Ireland since we exited the bailout. In particular, I note the Commission's observation that the standard variable rate charged by banks here is "relatively high". One might conclude, therefore, that the authors are operating under a misapprehension - I am trying to be polite - when they go on to say Irish banks must be given sufficient leeway in setting mortgage interest rates. The Commission has missed the heart of the matter - that the banks have had and continue to have the so-called leeway they need to adjust mortgage interest rates, but they have abjectly failed to do so. The key point in all of this, of course, is that we do not have a normal competitive banking environment. Until we arrive at that point, the banks will continue to take advantage of customers through what I would describe as extortionate variable interest rates. Unfortunately, as I said, the Commission has totally missed the point. That is why we need legislation to compel banks to treat customers fairly. I introduced a Bill some time ago to do precisely that and it is time the Government moved the issue forward. According to the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, the Courts Service is to outsource the collection of fines. The number of people jailed for non-payment of fines last year was 8,140, 775 more than the number imprisoned in 2013 and an increase of 1,400 on the 2011 figure. Last year the Government passed legislation designed to reduce this number, but, as I understand it, it has not yet been implemented. We need to know if and when these measures will come into force. I take the opportunity to express my appreciation to colleagues for the useful debate we had yesterday on Seanad reform. I was rather stunned to discover yesterday morning that the Taoiseach had arranged to have a meeting on the issue involving only the leaders of the parties in the other House. He changed his mind at the last minute, however, and managed to get a few representatives from this House. That was at 7 a.m. for a 7.30 a.m. meeting. Clearly, this issue is not high on his agenda. I hope there will be a change in that regard.

In many cases, they have been unable to drive their vehicles out of council office car parks for several hours after meetings have ended. This is happening not only across Dublin but also throughout the country. In Cork city, for example, council meetings have been interrupted and forced to suspend.

That is absolutely disgraceful and cannot be allowed to go on. In the context of the forthcoming inquiry into the incidents that took place outside the Oireachtas last week, will the Leader bring the matter I have raised to the attention of the Minister for Justice and Equality and also the Garda Commissioner? We have a situation where councillors, elected public representatives working for very small salaries, are being obstructed and prevented from carrying out their functions in the democratic process. That needs to stop. People have lost the run of themselves in their understanding of how democracy operates and, specifically, how protest operates. It is not protest if a councillor is prevented from leaving a meeting at 4 p.m. or 5 p.m., perhaps to go home and finish his or her work for the day. In many cases, as I said, councillors' cars are being hemmed in overnight and they cannot get home. In Cork some councillors live 60 or 70 miles from council offices. I ask the Leader to take up this matter with the Minister.

Many of us - I include myself among that number, from time to time - come in for the Order of Business and speak off the top of our heads on matters that do not pertain to Parliament and legislation, leading to ridicule in the media and confusion among the general public, given the standard of some of the debate, as to why it bothered to save the Seanad. That is a fact and it is something with which we must grapple. The Seanad has a very important role to play in our democracy and it is important that we continue to play that role. We are not doing so, however, if Members simply come in and rattle off what they have seen on the front page of some of the tabloid newspapers. It is unacceptable and the Cathaoirleach and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges should take action. We are all guilty of doing it from time to time, if we are completely honest with ourselves.

It was an issue of general concern to thousands of people. An issue that is of even broader concern to people in this country is that of mortgage arrears. The Government promised two months ago there would be changes to the bank veto and an expansion of the mortgage to rent scheme. Nothing at all has happened on the second point, but we are told legislation will be brought to the Dáil next week, at the very last minute, on the bank veto. In the meantime, 100 repossession cases will be heard in Trim on Monday, following the 100 heard before the court last week. I am sure the position is the same in every county, with multiples of that number in Dublin. Is the Government taking the issue seriously at all? Why did it not push the legislation through and give some hope to people? Ministers seem happy to hold press conferences at Government Buildings to get the headlines out before the issue is forgotten about again. It has not been forgotten, however, by the thousands of people around the country who are facing repossession. Will the Leader indicate whether the legislation is due to be brought before this House before the summer recess? If so, when will we receive copies of the Bill in order that we can analyse it before it comes up for debate?

I heard part of the Minister's interview this morning on Newstalk in which he indicated his proposals to cut the universal social charge by at least one percentage point in the forthcoming budget. It would be helpful if Members of this House who have suggestions to make, particularly on taxation and spending, could play a part in the process in the lead-in to the budget rather than being left to complain after it is passed. As soon as we are back in September, it would be useful to debate the budgetary options facing the Minister and the Government. There was an interesting discussion this morning between Senators Mary White and Aideen Hayden on the inheritance tax issue which is very relevant, particularly for people in urban areas. All of these matters need to be discussed. Money will not be found to solve all of the problems we face; it is a question of considering the political, economic and financial choices to be made. Traditionally, the budget is announced and the analysis of its provisions takes place when it is much too late to do anything about them.I believe we should have an opportunity to make suggestions and put ideas forward before the budget. We could even sit a day earlier in September to have that debate with the Minister for Finance or the Minister of State at the Department of Finance. It would be useful. Perhaps the Leader would reflect on that.

In conjunction with the Web Summit last year, the Surf Summit was held in Sligo and it had approximately 200 participants. This year it is anticipated that up to 800 participants will take part in the Surf Summit on the Wild Atlantic Way. Undoubtedly, Ireland's west coast is now a world renowned destination for international surfers. This will be a major boost to the tourism industry in November both in Dublin and in Sligo and its surrounding counties. I welcome this great news for tourism.

However, while Members of the House must be temperate in the issues they raise, the decision on what to cover is a matter for the media. The media have a poor record. They pick the ludicrous and ridiculous contributions made in the Seanad and report on them. There is no doubt that it makes something of a laughing stock of the House. Last evening was the first anniversary of the 50-day conflict last year in Gaza in which 504 children were murdered by the Israeli Defence Forces. There is a very thought-provoking installation at the Ha'penny Bridge and I recommend that people go to look at it. All of the names of the children killed in that conflict are recorded on white ribbons which are flying from the Ha'penny Bridge. Senator Mooney raised Amnesty International and the poll that showed 81% of people were in favour of a more liberal approach to abortion. Polls can often reflect the opinions of those for whom they are written. I am not sure that it is up to 81%, but I certainly believe the country has moved on a great deal since the referendum in 1983. Since 1980, almost 163,000 women have made that difficult trip to England. It is high time we had a referendum on the eighth amendment and leave it up to the people. Yes, it is a divisive societal issue, as one can see from the various protests held in Dublin last weekend, but we have moved on as a society and the issue should be put to the people in a referendum again. Ten women per week still have to travel to England. The outsourcing of the problem to another jurisdiction is not the proper way to deal with it, so we should grasp that nettle now. I appeal to the Labour Party to push for that referendum to be held. It is Labour Party policy. I also ask the major parties, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, to face up to it. Fianna Fáil has been ducking and diving on this issue and has not committed to a referendum. If the referendum is not to take place during the lifetime of this Government, the parties that will lead the next Government should commit to holding the referendum, regardless of what they think about the issue. It is only right, proper and fair to give the Irish people, after more than 33 years, the right to a say on this issue.

The Leader might recall that in December 2014, I called on the Minister for Health, Deputy Varadkar, to investigate what was, in fact, a second round of accusations against the Saolta University Health Care Group. An information technology, IT, services contract had been awarded to Northgate plc, despite the fact that reports suggested that a Saolta group board member had previously been a consultant with that UK-based company. Indeed, it emerged that Northgate plc was the only company to be asked to bid for the contract, which raised all sorts of questions about the HSE's tendering procedure requirements and whether they were being followed. The Saolta University Health Care Group includes major hospitals in Donegal, Sligo, Mayo, Roscommon and Galway, and it had been in trouble previously for similar reasons. In fact, one member of its board resigned after the first controversy in June last year. The problem is that the HSE is still sitting on a report, which is about the spending of taxpayers' money, more than seven months after I first raised the issue. The report was supposed to be published last December, and there have been articles in the press which suggest that parts of the report have already been seen by people in the media. The articles tend to suggest that tendering procedures were not followed properly and some of the people involved still hold responsible positions in health care in this country. It is not clear whether there will be any accountability on this issue. The fact that the public has yet to find out what is in this report is appalling. Taxpayers deserve to know what happened, whether anything inappropriate or illegal occurred, who was responsible in that event and what steps are being followed.

In particular, I am asking if the Leader could intervene with the Minister for Health and ask him to order the release of the report. The previous Minister for Health said that there would be no further breaches of procurement rules by that hospital group. To maintain public confidence in the management of public money in hospitals, the Minister should direct the HSE to release the investigation report at this point. The potential misallocation of public money is a serious issue and I would be grateful for the Leader's intervention on that matter.

On the general issue of tax, including inheritance tax, if we reduce tax in one area it must be recovered in another area.

We have dealt with the issue on several occasions in the House. Senator Bacik outlined the reforms in the social protection system, particularly the job activation measures. Senators Conway and Daly called for a debate on ambulance cover, particularly in counties Clare and Kerry. Perhaps that could be raised at the health fora which have been set up by the HSE in the various areas. Representatives could raise the matter at the health forum also. With regard to specific issues in Clare and Kerry, Commencement Matters are the only way they can be dealt with in this House. I am sure the Members will avail of that facility.

Once again, the Irish embassy officials will attend. In the meantime, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials in Dublin and Cairo will continue to work actively behind the scenes to do everything possible to facilitate positive progress in this case as early as the circumstances may permit. Embassy officers visited Mr. Halawa for the 42nd time on Wednesday, 24 June. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, met the Halawa family on 4 June. As is the case for any Irish citizen imprisoned abroad, any suggestion of ill treatment in this case has been taken with the utmost seriousness by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and has been raised with the Egyptian authorities, where appropriate. The high level of consular visitation is an important practical tool in monitoring Mr. Halawa's welfare and ensuring the embassy in Cairo is well placed to raise any concerns arising directly with the prison authorities. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has received correspondence from a firm of solicitors in respect of Mr. Halawa's case in recent days and this is currently being considered by the Department. The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and his Department are maintaining extensive contacts with the Egyptian authorities and other international partners with citizens in similar circumstances. Following examination of other similar cases, it is clear that irrespective of any political efforts made by foreign governments, including high-level requests, the other trials have been completed before any political consideration of a possible release by the Egyptian authorities has taken place. In Mr. Halawa's case, the trial is still ongoing, and, while the Department and the Minister continue to maintain extensive contacts with the Egyptian authorities, including at high levels, the precedents examined to date suggest it is unrealistic to expect that any release will take place before the initial trial concludes. It is the Government's considered approach, supported by decades of diplomatic experience in other consular cases and extensive consultation with states that have citizens in similar circumstances, that our current firm diplomatic efforts provide the best means of achieving the twin goals of protecting Mr. Ibrahim Halawa's welfare and securing his release at the earliest possible opportunity.

Senator Reilly raised the question of the impact of Britain leaving the European Union, the joint committee report on the matter and the impact on Border regions in particular. I imagine that is a matter we will be coming back to later in the year. Senator Hayden called for a debate on taxation and fairness. Senator Bradford called for a pre-budget debate on taxation matters as well. We will try to facilitate this with the Minister in September when we come back. Senator Hayden also welcomed the report of the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, which has recommended that the period of bankruptcy be reduced to one year. I wish to reply to Senator Byrne. Unfortunately, he is not in the Chamber, but I will answer his query on in respect of the issue of the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Bill. We will have the Bill before the House next week. That is for the information of Senator Byrne, in particular, who asked about it. Senator Daly raised the question of pancreas transplants. I am unsure whether Senator Daly was in the Chamber yesterday, but the Minister was in the House and dealt with a Commencement debate on the issue, raised by Senator Burke.

Senator Coghlan asked about next week. I had indicated that we would be sitting five days next week but now we will be sitting on four days. We will not be sitting on the Monday now, but we will be sitting Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Senator Craughwell, Senator Mooney and Senator Burke raised the question of political pension restoration. It was this Government which introduced pay cuts for the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and all serving Ministers. Moreover, it abolished State cars for most Ministers and reduced political staffing costs.

I did not interrupt any person. It was this Government which introduced reforms in order that Members of the Oireachtas would not be paid official officeholder pensions while they were still sitting Members. New laws were introduced by this Government and are applicable to all new Members of the Oireachtas, including Ministers. The Government introduced a new single public service pension scheme with a new minimum pension age of 66 years. Certainly, I share the view that it is ludicrous for many of the Taoiseach's predecessors to enjoy pension entitlements that are not much lower than his current salary. That applies to other higher earning public servants' posts as well. I am mindful of the continued high level of pension payments to former public officials during the time of the economic crisis. It was also this Government which increased to 20% the public service pension reduction on pension payments in excess of €100,000. The reductions in the pay for high-level public servants were made under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act. The Government has also decided that members of the current Government and their senior special advisers will not personally benefit from any of the pay increases due in 2016. That is the record of this Government in respect of payments and pensions to officeholders. I note Senator Mooney's points in respect of Women on Web, their support for abortion drugs and the role of Amnesty International in assisting that campaign. I note his comments in this regard. Senator Burke commented on the use of drugs by young people. I believe the Minister is speaking on this issue in a committee at present. It is a sad fact that more than 630 people died in 2012 from drug misuse. Senator Quinn referred to the European Commission third report on Ireland and the Commission views on mortgage rates. The fact is we need more competition in the banking sector. That is exactly what we need. I also note Senator Quinn's point in respect of the fact that more than 8,000 people were jailed because of non-payment of fines. The Government is addressing that and we will have a related Bill before the House next week, the Civil Debt (Procedures) Bill, which will deal with these issues. Senator Landy commented on the disruption of council meetings throughout the country where public representatives failed to gain access or egress from council chambers. That is a deplorable situation. It is a matter which council officials should raise directly with the relevant chief superintendent to address. Sadly, it is a fact of public life now that people who are in public life are harassed going to and coming from meetings. It is a sad fact and a sad day for democracy in the country. Senator Byrne referred to mortgage arrears. The Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Bill will come to the House next week. Senator Byrne also referred to comments made by Members on the Order of Business. I cannot legislate for what people might say on the Order of Business. I would love to be in a position to be able to stop people, but I cannot. We would have liked to have heard Senator Byrne make his comments on Seanad reform yesterday.I compliment all the Members who made representations and the two former Senators, Dr. Maurice Manning and Joe O'Toole, it was a very comprehensive debate on the issue. Senator Brennan welcomed the Web Summit due to be held from 3 to 5 November and outlined the major benefits and the boost for tourism in Dublin and Sligo and other areas. Senator Heffernan reminded us of the anniversary of the children who were killed in Gaza last year - that was a sad and tragic period which needs to be commemorated. There was a call for the repeal of the eighth amendment suggesting that people's opinions have moved on. Senator Mullen disagreed with those comments and raised the question of the Saolta University Healthcare Group and Northgate, calling for the HSE to release the report. Commencement debates were down on that issue in the past and I will bring the matter to the Minister's attention.

Before addressing the content of amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, and amendment No. 19, I hope I may be allowed to make one or two brief introductory remarks. We had an unusual Committee Stage and an unusual journey to get to Report Stage. I appreciate that the rules under which we operate on Report Stage may restrict Senators in the contributions they can make. I want to make it clear that I am more than happy to co-operate with Members in terms of recommitting groups of sections, as has been advised to us as the appropriate procedure, to ensure we can have a full discussion on each and every aspect of the Bill and the amendments I am recommending be made to it. Given the additions I am proposing to the Bill, the Long Title has been amended to reflect these changes, including references to the relevant EU directives, the Pensions Acts 1990 to 2014, the Equal Status Acts 2000 to 2012, the Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2011 and to matters related thereto. The references to the EU directives will be helpful to my Department in its discussions with the European Commission in relation to our transposition obligations - the point being that part of what we are proposing to do is to make technical changes to the existing equality legislation to reflect in specific areas the evolving jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice, our own courts and the Equality Tribunal in equality law cases. That is the context for amendment No. 1. A Chathaoirligh, will I proceed to deal with amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 19?
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	146	Yes. They are all being taken together.

Amendment No. 3 deletes the definition of "Minister" as we do not need this as we are amending existing legislation that already has this definition. In amendment No. 19 we are making consequential changes to the Short Title, collective citation and the commencement provisions. The Title of the Bill will change so that once enacted it will be known as the Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2015. This change is needed as we propose to amend both the employment equality and the equal status streams of equality legislation and to amend relative provisions in the Pensions Acts.

I do not believe there can be any objection to these Government amendments as they are technical in nature and they reflect the change in the nature of the Bill, which I very much welcome as the original proposer of this Private Members' Bill. This is a proud day for the Seanad to see what started life as a Labour Party Private Members' Bill, and what had been worked on by many colleagues, including Senators Power and Zappone both before and since, now become a Government Bill and, hopefully, today conclude its passage through the Seanad. It is also very welcome, as amendment No. 1 suggests, that the Bill will now become broader in focus. The Government amendments, which are reflected in this new Title, and which we are going to debate, will not only make the hugely important and long overdue change to section 37 of the Employment Equality Act but will also make very progressive change in terms of prohibiting discrimination in relation to rent supplement and housing assistance payment in equal status legislation. That is hugely welcome, although it is not at all what was in the original version of the Bill but I do very much welcome it. I believe it will receive a broad welcome. The other provisions, to be inserted by the Government through amendments, on the definition of indirect discrimination, on discriminatory job advertisements, on retirement age issues and on the technical issue regarding EEA nationals and Swiss nationals are all very welcome amendments. I very much welcome them and I welcome the change to the Title to reflect them in amendment No 1.

#AodhanORiordan	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-party	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-dob	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	151	The principal equality directives have essentially the same definition of indirect discrimination. I will quote from the Framework Employment Directive 2000/78/EC, which contains the following definition: "indirect discrimination should be taken to occur when an apparently neutral provision, criterion or practice would put persons having a particular religion or belief, a particular disability, a particular age, or a particular sexual orientation at a particular disadvantage ...".There is more in the text of the directive but that quote captures the key point, and I will quote from this one directive only in the interests of brevity.  The wording of the directives was not followed when the directives were transposed into Irish Law. The words "would put" was replaced with the word "puts", as follows, for example, in section 19(4) of the Employment Equality Act: "Indirect discrimination occurs where an apparently neutral provision puts persons of a particular gender (being As or Bs) at a particular gender at a particular disadvantage in respect of remuneration compared with other employees of their employer." The reason for this is that there was a view at the time the Acts were drafted that the term "would put" could lead to persons taking cases where they did not have locus standi or were not members of the particular ground under which they were claiming discrimination. Therefore, the word "puts" replaces the words "would put".The case law is now clear: to claim indirect discrimination, a person must assert membership of a particular class of persons to whom the Acts apply and must demonstrate actual personal detriment. Speculative or theoretical claims are not permissible. It is proposed, therefore, that the definitions of indirect discrimination in Irish equality legislation be amended to follow precisely the EU definitions. Amendments are required to the Employment Equality Acts, the Equality Status Acts and the Pensions Acts, as is evident from the text of amendment No. 4. Essentially, we are replacing the indicative with the subjunctive. We are bringing our legislation into line with the actual language used in the EU directives but not making any change to the actual law as it is applied in practice. In addition, arising from amendments Nos. 4, 10 and 11, this issue comes up in respect of amendment No. 7. However, as the main issue in that amendment relates to advertising, we will discuss it with the next group of amendments but without my repeating this element of the explanation. The nature of the Equality Acts is such that technical adjustments are required in individual sections that relate to more than one of the substantive amendments I am recommending. I hope, therefore, that Members will bear with me.

#AodhanORiordan	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-party	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-dob	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	154	The group of amendments includes amendments Nos. 5, 7 and 9, but, due to the structure of the Equality Acts, part of amendment No. 8 is also relevant. However, as that amendment mainly deals with a different issue related to the position of Swiss and EEA nationals, it has been grouped with amendment No. 18 with which it will be discussed. We are considering a group of amendments that relate to advertising. Section 10 of the Employment Equality Act 1998 prohibits discriminatory advertisements. Section 85(1)(d) allows the Equality Authority, now the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, to refer a publication or display to which section 10 applies to the director of the Equality Tribunal, soon to be the Workplace Relations Commission, for adjudication and decision. However, there is no provision to allow an individual who considers that he or she has been discriminated against in an employment opportunity to take a case. The Equality Tribunal brought this issue to my Department’s attention, with a request that the current provision be amended so as to allow an aggrieved individual to submit a complaint. The tribunal pointed to a case in which the Court of Justice of the European Union stated: “The fact that an employer states publicly that it will not recruit employees of a certain ethnic or racial origin constitutes direct discrimination in respect of recruitment within the meaning of Article 2(2)(a) of Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, such statements being likely strongly to dissuade certain candidates from submitting their candidature and, accordingly, to hinder their access to the labour market.” The judgment refers to the race directive and access to the labour market. Therefore, the changes to the legislation being proposed include access to vocational training and membership of certain bodies, in addition to access to recruitment and promotion. To ensure the amendments proposed do not allow for what might be termed an “officious bystander” to take a case, that is, where that person may not be a potential candidate for the particular vacancy or membership that may be involved, the approach taken in the drafting of the amendments is to amend sections 8, 12 and 13 of the Act to ensure there is a real connection between the person claiming discrimination and the advertiser.  The definition of the word "advertisement" in section 2 of the Employment Equality Act is being expanded to include a public statement as per the judgement of the European Court of Justice. We are not proposing a similar amendment on the equal status side and this question needs further consideration as the court judgment does not refer to the relevant directive. This is a question that is being examined further in consultation with the Equality Tribunal and, if deemed appropriate and necessary, can be addressed in future legislation, but I do not anticipate that we will have completed this examination in time for our consideration of this Bill.

The conclusion is that it was not necessary to amend section 34(4) of the Employment Equality Act 1998. Section 34(4) states: "Without prejudice to subsection (3), it shall not constitute discrimination on the age ground to fix different ages for the retirement (whether voluntarily or compulsorily) of employees or any class or description of employees...". However, the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union has since established that national provisions laying down retirement ages could amount to age discrimination if they cannot be justified under the specific terms of the directive, in particular Article 6.1. Article 6.1, entitled, Justification of differences of treatment on grounds of age, provides that: "Member States may provide that differences of treatment on grounds of age shall not constitute discrimination, if, within the context of national law, they are objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate aim including legitimate employment policy, labour market and vocational training objectives, and if the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary". The Court of Justice of the European Union has in the course of a series of judgments applied this test to national compulsory retirement schemes. The High Court, the Labour Court and the Equality Tribunal have applied this test in Irish cases. As a result, the text of section 34(4) which seems to give carte blanche to employers to set any age as a retirement age does not reflect the law as it is actually applied. It is, therefore, proposed that it be amended to reflect the law as it actually is, that is, as developed in the jurisprudence. Similarly, section 6(3)(c) of the EEA also requires amendment. Section 6(3)(c) provides: "(c) Offering a fixed term contract to a person over the compulsory retirement age for that employment or to a particular class or description of employees in that employment shall not be taken as constituting discrimination on the age ground". The Court of Justice of the European Union in its case law has also held that the provision of fixed-term contracts on the basis of age constitutes age discrimination and would require justification under Article 6 of the directive.

The Minister of State is going through this rapidly and I am trying to absorb the rationale. His last comments seem to suggest there could be discrimination. Fixed-term contracts seem to be a way of terminating the employment of somebody over the compulsory retirement age. The amendment reads: "...it is objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate aim". Will the Minister of State clarify what this means? The amendment also reads: "...the means of achieving that aim are appropriate and necessary". What does this mean in simple English?

Effectively, there is no discrimination on the basis of age if the offering of the fixed-term contract reflects the practice or the nature of the business over a period of time. It is unusual for a termination to take place in the context of this legislation, but we are effectively transposing requirements from EU directives into national legislation, thus tidying up many things that need to be tidied up. While the thrust of the Bill was actually to deal with employment equality legislation, we are using this vehicle to transpose others in the Bill before the House. I understand from where the Senator is coming. Effectively, the amendment employs legalistic terminology on what is known to be the case already.

The only reason I raise this issue is I am considering the example of what occurs when somebody who has been employed for some considerable time in a particular institution or business exceeds the retirement age and is suddenly offered a fixed-term contract. This seems to suggest, or at least imply, that there is something more to the offer than meets the eye. Is the Minister of State satisfied that the amendment will prevent the offering of discriminatory contracts and that the onus of proof will be on the employer rather than the employee who would have to take a case on age discrimination grounds if his or her contract terms were to be changed once he or she passed the compulsory retirement age? There could be an inference that the employer wanted to get rid of the employee by offering a fixed-term contract.This was a way of doing it and because the law is so strong to simply tell somebody to go this provision could be used as a vehicle to terminate an individual's employment. A fixed-term contract could extend for three or six months. The Bill does not state its length.

It has been a part of my life for the last three years. This was a long and tortuous process and many of us worked hard on a cross-party basis to bring the Bill to this stage. We are now at the heart of the Bill. I am conscious that it has not been possible to have a real debate on the text and options previously because the Government has not been in a position until now to bring forward its proposed amendments to the Private Members' Bill. To fill that gap and to outline the rationale for our proposed approach, I propose to rehearse the history of the Bill. While some Senators will be familiar with the history, it is important that the details be accessible in the Official Report. The Private Members' Bill as published has been examined carefully by my Department and the Attorney General. It may appear that we are deleting and replacing all of the existing text but we are not. There are technical and drafting reasons for the approach being taken to amending the Bill but our conclusion on foot of a lengthy examination is that the Bill as published is largely constitutionally sound. There is a specific concern that the proposed new section 37(1)(c) in section 2 of the Bill as published, which would allow the Minister for Justice and Equality, in consultation with the Minister for Health or the Minister for Education and Skills, to issue direction or guidelines, could constitute an unlawful delegation by the Oireachtas of its legislative responsibilities. Instead of this provision we propose to provide for a list of considerations to be taken into account by employers, as set out in the proposed new subsection (1)(c).The objective is to ensure the bar is set sufficiently high that employers must provide objective justification for any action taken against an employee and must show that the action is related to, and proportionate to, the actual damage to the ethos of the institution and is rationally and strictly related to the employer's religious ethos. The reversal of the burden of proof in the following paragraph (d) is not necessary as section 85A of the Act contains this provision already. On the substance of the Private Members' Bill and the specific amendment, it is critically important we get this right. The existing section 37(1) of the Employment Equality Act, as amended by section 25 of the Equality Act 2004, provides that:A religious, educational or medical institution which is under the direction or control of a body established for religious purposes or whose objectives include the provision of services in an environment which promotes certain religious values shall not be taken to discriminate against a person for the purposes of this Part or Part II if--(a) it gives more favourable treatment, on the religion ground, to an employee or a prospective employee over that person where it is reasonable to do so in order to maintain the religious ethos of the institution, or(b) it takes action which is reasonably necessary to prevent an employee or a prospective employee from undermining the religious ethos of the institution.The provision was previously contained in the Equality Bill 1996 which was referred by the President to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution. While the court held the Bill to be unconstitutional on other grounds, the constitutionality of what is now section 37 was upheld as a reasonable balance between the competing constitutional rights involved. While we can seek to find a new balance, the better to meet the rights of employees, the Supreme Court's decision outlines the need for a balance to be struck. It is not simply a matter of deleting certain elements of the existing Act. We must recognise the right of the religious institutions concerned to prevent the undermining of their ethos and for that reason, I am not able to accept amendment No. 14. It would render the remainder of the amendments apropos section 37 meaningless as they would not link back to paragraph (b). There are going to be disputes and, aside from intervening to an extent that does not potentially raise constitutional concerns, it is unclear how deleting section 37(1)(b) will provide any guidance on how to resolve disputes between employees and employers. It would remain the case that an employer had the right to take action against employees who acted against the employer's best interests and disputes would, following deletion of the existing provision, fall to be resolved in the generally applicable labour relations law. I hope the Senator will accept my rationale. While the provision that is now section 37(1) was found in 1997 to strike a reasonable balance between the rights of employees, on the one hand, and freedom of religion, on the other, there is legitimate concern that, in practice, it has not worked. Primarily its operation is regarded as having a particularly chilling effect on LGBT people in the education system. However, it also affects lone parents and divorcees who are restricted in discussing their private lives with their colleagues in the safety of their staff room. I have more to say on the specific amendments proposed to amendment No. 13, but I will stop there.

I will speak to amendment No. 14.  As the Minister of State said, we are at the heart of the Bill. I acknowledge the extensive work the Government and its officials have done on the Bill, as exemplified by the Report Stage amendments. I understand the Government and the original sponsor of the Bill, Senator Ivana Bacik, are extremely keen to get it right as best we can. Amendment No. 14 is a logical response to amendment No. 13, about which I have very strong feelings, coming from a locus standi of sorts derived from what my spouse, Dr. Ann Louise Gilligan, and I had to face over a decade ago. I welcome her, as I welcome all of the other advocates present from the INTO, the LGBT helpline and GLEN, including Dr. Fergus Ryan and others, but I particularly welcome her because she took a case against the State while she was an employee of an institution managed by the Catholic archbishop. She was effectively outed in the case, by her own choosing, as a married lesbian and at the time section 37(1)(b) was staring her in the face. Amendment No. 14 proposes to delete it. If the Government was to accept it, we would not need Government amendment No. 13.  The section referred to states a faith-based organisation, including an educational institution, is not deemed to discriminate if it takes action which is reasonable necessary to prevent an employee or a prospective employee from undermining the religious ethos of the institution. Could conduct in public which clearly demonstrates that a woman is a married lesbian be reason enough in an educational institution managed by the Catholic archbishop for that institution to take action against her with regard to her employment? Would that action not be deemed to be discriminatory in the eyes of the law? The answer was "Yes" and it is still the answer. Was she afraid? The answer is yes. Did that stop her? The answer is no. However, there should be no fear and no chill factor, as the Minister of State called it. There should be only freedom to live as who we are and to make the choices we make, consonant with who we are, rather than denying who we are. We should place this alongside the freedom to respect an employer's ethos and values, although we may not agree with them. As lawmakers, what should we do to section 37(1)(b) of the 1998 Act in order that such conduct, or other conduct that flows from an employee's identity, is not reason enough for a religious institution to discriminate against that person to protect its ethos? Amendment No. 14 proposes that we delete the offending section from our current law. Many advocates and advocacy organisations have argued for this in the past, but I will put forward my own arguments.  Despite what the Minister of State said, we have still not heard a full response from the Government on why we cannot delete the section. The Minister of State said on Committee Stage and has repeated today that the Supreme Court, in a 1996 judgment, upheld the constitutionality of section 37 because it was viewed as a reasonable balance between the competing constitutional rights involved. He has said that while we can seek to find a new balance, the better to meet the rights of employees, the logic of the Supreme Court's decision outlines the need for a balance to be struck and that it is not simply a matter of deleting certain elements of the existing Act.I still disagree, which is why I am moving this amendment. It is important for the Government to elaborate even more than the Minister of State has done today in order to provide a substantive and reasonable rejection to what so many people in Ireland advocated for to offer absolute assurance to Irish employees working within religious institutions that deliver public services. Once again, I propose that it is more effective to delete existing section 37(1)(b). I will put forward two reasons for this. First, it is because the institution's right to protect its religious ethos is already adequately protected in Irish law. I agree that there is an important balance to strike between the protection of an institution's religious ethos and the rights of an employee to pursue their career without fear and discrimination. However, religious ethos is protected by sections 16, 25, 37(1)(a) and 37(2) of the Employment Equality Act and a number of other laws. Section 37(1)(a) allows an institution under certain conditions to give preference to members of its own faith for a job, promotion or particular duties. Sections 37(2) and 25 permit all employers to treat people differently where there is a genuine and necessary occupational requirement. These sections, coupled with the duties arising from people's individual employment contracts, form an adequate safeguard for the religious ethos of the institution.  My second argument for the deletion of what I consider to be an offensive section in the former Act is the fact that although the Supreme Court found the section to be compatible with the Constitution, which the Minister of State has just said and which I accept, I do not think it is by any means clear that the Constitution as interpreted by the courts requires us to have this exception. Does our Constitution require the additional protections of ethos found in section 37(1)(b)? The Constitution as interpreted in 1996 might have allowed for an exception like this but by no means would the Constitution require it, as far as I can determine. I do not think the court ever said that it was required. As per my first argument, it is already adequately protected. Those are the arguments to delete the offensive section. I believe that it would provide an absolute guarantee to protect the employee while our laws adequately protect a religious institution's ethos. I hope the Minister of State might shed a bit more light on that.

I know the Minister of State will say that his legal advice is that this is not possible. I brought forward the first Bill on this issue in 2012 and I must be honest and say that the legal advice I received was that the best we could do was amend it and that it would not be possible to delete it. I wish we could delete it but I must be honest. I cannot say that I brought forward a Bill that seeks to amend the section and then put pressure on the Minister of State politically to delete it when I had to accept that this may not be possible constitutionally. Our task today is to come up with the strictest possible wording. That is where I am coming from in terms of the amendments I have tabled today. The Government Report Stage amendment is a significant improvement on the previous text and does address some of the concerns I raised on Second and Committee Stages about the fact that the original text did not require any conduct on the part of the employee. It would have been possible for the employer to discriminate against someone or at least to make a case for discrimination solely on the basis of who the person was. That is my most fundamental objection to section 37(1). It is incredibly unfair treatment of people who are very good at their jobs and who just want to be judged on the same basis as everybody else, namely, their performance in the workplace, but who are subjected to unfair discrimination and the fear and threat of facing such discrimination because of who they are - because they are gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, divorced or a single parent. That is repugnant to any sense of fairness and decency and that is the fundamental thing we must change. I accept that the Bill goes so far in respect of that.  The Government amendment now requires that there be conduct on the part of the employee. I have some concerns. We need clarity around some of the issues. It does not define conduct or say that it is restricted to the workplace. It uses the words "genuine occupational requirement" but we are not clear what they mean or even what the ethos of the institution is because there is no requirement to publish the ethos. I have tabled a number of amendments that would deal with those issues and I propose to raise them when we come to discussing amendments Nos. 1 to 11.  I completely understand where Senator Zappone is coming from. My preference would be deletion. In trying to achieve as much as I can, I will push for each of the amendments I have tabled to be accepted. I think they are all reasonable. They are based on solid legal advice from people with expertise in this area and I hope that the Minister of State will go through them one by one as we get to those issues to see whether they can be incorporated into the current wording or not. It is essential that we give people the clarity and comfort they deserve. I know the INTO LGBT group is here with us today and the ASTI has also highlighted the issue of LGBT teachers. It is so that people are free to be themselves in the workplace, get on with their jobs the same as everybody else and not have to carry the fear and misery of pretending to be somebody else, hiding from their colleagues or not being free to be open about their personal lives. I hope we are all together on this issue. I certainly see it as one where we can achieve something on a cross-party, non-party basis. It is not a party political issue, which is why when I published my Bill in 2012, I spoke to the two Ministers concerned before it came to the House and engaged in a lot of lobbying. I have worked with Senators Bacik and Zappone on this issue since then. I hope we will take that spirit of co-operation as we go through each of the issues today and do what we can to tighten up this revision as much as possible.
#IvanaBacik	unknown-#IvanaBacik-party	unknown-#IvanaBacik-dob	unknown-#IvanaBacik-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	212	In welcoming the Minister of State, I should have acknowledged his long personal commitment in respect of this issue and the fact that he was an original sponsor of the Bill when we introduced it in 2013. In respect of amendment No. 14, I echo the words of Senators Zappone and Power. My personal preference without reference to any laws would be simply to delete section 37(1)(b) as well. As Senator Power acknowledged, we have received clear legal advice not just as individuals but in terms of the legal opinion of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, which was published a year ago. I understand that the Government has received advice from the Attorney General that deletion is not possible. I am looking at the words of the senior counsel who drafted the legal opinion for the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission. They stated that removing section 37(1) entirely could constitute a violation of rights of employers and employees to religious freedom. They went on to say that they viewed this option as far too legally uncertain. The last thing we want to do is to open up this important and overdue Bill to legal challenge. Unfortunately, we are in a position where we must amend rather than delete section 37(1), particularly section 37(1)(b). Therefore, we must make sure that the amendment offers as strong a protection against discrimination as possible. In respect of amendment No. 13, which was moved by the Minister of State, I am glad to hear him say that the Bill as published is largely constitutionally sound. Although the Government amendments do extensively change the text of the original Bill, it is clear that the structure of the Bill is maintained and that some of the key principles are maintained within it. As others have said, the amendments significantly improve the Bill and greatly strengthen and enhance protection for employees against discrimination, which is hugely important. Amendment No. 13 strengthens the protections against discrimination both in terms of section 37(1)(a), which concerns more favourable treatment on religion grounds, and, more importantly, section 37(1)(b), which allows employers to take action reasonably necessary to prevent employees from undermining religious ethos.The new test that will be inserted into section 37 if amendment No. 13 is passed is very strong. It sets the bar much higher. I will speak generally on Government amendment No. 13 before we get into the individual amendments to the section. The new subsection (1A) that is proposed to be introduced would change the nature of the current section 37(1)(a) which allows more favourable treatment on the religion ground. The new section 37(1A) would say that where a publicly funded educational or medical institution gives more favourable treatment on the religion ground, that shall be discrimination. It is clearly stated that it shall be discrimination unless it "does not constitute discrimination on any of the other discriminatory grounds, and ... [that] the religion or belief ... constitutes a genuine, legitimate and justified occupational requirement having regard to the institution's ethos". That is a much stronger statement against discrimination. The chilling effect, of which the Minister of State has spoken and of which we are all very aware, is particularly evident in the current section 37(1)(b) which, as I say, allows employers to take action against employees where they are seen to undermine religious ethos. The new subsections (1B) and (1C) dramatically change the position for employees or prospective employees in publicly funded education or medical institutions - schools or hospitals. Amendment No. 13, as I see it, would introduce a new one plus five test for publicly funded institutions. The provisions say that it shall be discrimination where any action of this sort is taken by an employer. It is presumed to be discrimination. The five test is, first, that the action must be objectively justified by the aim of preventing the undermining of the religious ethos. Second, the means of achieving the aim must be appropriate and necessary. In subsection (1C) there is a threefold further test that an employer must get over to show that an action is objectively justified and that the means used are appropriate and necessary and, crucially, in subsection (1C)(a), (1C)(b) and (1C)(c), the action must be rationally and strictly related to the religious ethos of the institution which, effectively, requires an institution to show what its ethos is. It is saying, in effect, that the institution must show how the action it has taken is rationally and strictly related to its ethos. That is hugely important. Second, it must be a response to the conduct of the employee. I think Senators Power and Zappone have referred to this. This is a hugely important insertion, that there is a requirement of conduct rather than just of status. Specifically subsection (1C)(b) says that the action of the employer cannot be a response to the employee's or prospective employee's gender, civil status, family status, sexual orientation, age, disability, race, or membership of the Traveller community. Finally, in subsection (1C)(c), the action of the employer must be proportionate to the conduct of the employee or prospective employee. There is a further threefold test as to how a court or tribunal would measure proportionality, looking in particular at the consequences of the action for the employee or prospective employee, at any other action the employer could have taken and, crucially, the actual damage caused to the religious ethos of the institution. While I understand it is difficult to define ethos or to require institutions to define religious ethos, effectively the combined text of amendment No. 13 would require an employer seeking to justify discriminatory action to put forward a definition of its ethos to justify the action it had taken to prevent an employee undermining its ethos. I think the bar is set so high that it would be almost impossible to envisage a situation in which an employer could discriminate against an employee under this provision, and that is to be welcomed. I accept the Minister of State's point that this is a great improvement on the mechanism in our original Bill, which was simply that directions or guidelines could be issued on the criteria in section 37(1)(b). I think this hugely strengthens it because it sets out this one plus five test by which publicly funded institutions will be judged if they attempt to take action against employees that is discriminatory.

I commend the Minister of State on his amendments although it seems to be an incremental approach. I remember opposing this section strongly when it was introduced by the former Minister, Mervyn Taylor, but I think there should be certain principles enacted and enshrined. It is obvious that State-funded institutions should not be allowed to discriminate at all on the grounds of religion or belief. It would be mad to allow the State to fund religious discrimination against its citizens, which was, in effect, the situation under the original Bill. It is not just gay people who are involved. There is also a question of religious belief and the question of people who are atheist. I am a retired fairy but I am definitely not an atheist, but I think that atheists have rights as well. I remember when we removed the special position of the Roman Catholic Church from the Constitution, so there is no longer any constitutional reason this should be sustained. The State has a duty to be neutral and impartial between religious, non-religious and philosophical beliefs. It has been stated that Directive 78/2000 of the European Union requires member states to allow discrimination on the ground of religion or belief, but this is not the case at all. Article 4 merely permits discrimination if countries want it but it also allows for far wider grounds for religious freedom. I will quote from the record of the Seanad - I think this is Senator Bacik but if I am wrong I am sure she will correct me:We were advised, however, that EU Directive 78/2000 requires a somewhat more conservative approach. Article 4 of that directive gives protection to the right of churches to require individuals working for them to act with "loyalty to the organisation's ethos".and:There is a constraint not only in domestic law but also under EU Framework Directive 78/2000. Article 4 of the directive places constraints on how we can move forward on this, particularly the reference to ensuring "national practice as existing as the date of adoption of the directive". I believe this is based on a complete misreading of the EU directive because what Article 4 actually says is that member states may - and I emphasise the word "may" - provide that a difference of treatment shall not constitute discrimination in certain circumstances. In Article 4(2), "Member States may maintain national legislation in force at the date of adoption of this Directive or provide for future legislation incorporating national practice existing at the date of adoption of this Directive" in certain circumstances. It also reads: "This difference of treatment shall be implemented taking account of Member States' constitutional provisions and principles, as well as the general principles of Community law," and "this Directive shall thus not prejudice the right of churches and other public or private organisations, the ethos of which is based on religion or belief, acting in conformity with national constitutions and laws, to require individuals working for them to act in good faith and with loyalty to the organisation's ethos." It is really a question of "may" and "shall". The European Union directive does not oppose the kind of amendment we were suggesting but it gives freedom for states to provide a difference in treatment and apparent discrimination and so on and so forth, but it is a question of "may" all the time. It does not prescribe that this is what we have to do. To make things even clearer, Article 8 ensures minimum requirements, not maximum requirements, for protecting equality and states: "Member States may introduce or maintain provisions which are more favourable to the protection of the principle of equal treatment than those laid down in this Directive." That gives us carte blanche to go beyond what was being suggested. It goes on to state: "The implementation of this Directive shall under no circumstances constitute grounds for a reduction in the level of protection against discrimination already afforded by Member States in the fields covered by this Directive." Turning to the idea of including atheists in this, the European Court, in a judgment, recognised:[T]he supporters of secularism are able to lay claim to views attaining the "level of cogency, seriousness, cohesion and importance" required for them to be considered "convictions" within the meaning of Articles 9 of the Convention and 2 of Protocol No. 1 ... More precisely, their views must be regarded as "philosophical convictions", within the meaning of the second sentence of Article 2 of Protocol No. 1, given that they are worthy of "respect 'in a democratic society'", are not incompatible with human dignity and do not conflict with the fundamental right of the child to education.While the churches may propose and maintain very rigid doctrinal positions, in a democracy one should consider the behaviour of people, which is instructive in this regard. An MRBI poll conducted in 2012 found that 78% of Irish Catholics follow their consciences rather than church teaching when making moral decisions. This is an interesting finding. What constitutes the church and its ethos? Is it a compendium of doctrinal statements of a particular church or the belief and practice of the majority of people who constitute that church? I am a churchgoer and also attend Roman Catholic churches. I frequently hear priests of various denominations state the church is not Rome or Canterbury but the people. Almost 80% of the people are making up their own minds on questions of ethos.  Implicit in all of this is a distinction between State-funded bodies and bodies not funded by the State. I admit that there may be some small grey areas in this regard but when it is a question of fundamental human rights, the latter should be held to the same human rights standards as State-funded bodies. It is apparent and obvious that the State should not fund discrimination. However, it is also true that it should not tolerate discrimination. I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence.

I wish we could do so. I also wish we were not dealing with the existing education system and Constitution or the reality in which we find ourselves. Yesterday, when I met many of the groups represented in the Gallery, I made the point that the education system perpetuates inequality by its very constitution. Since its establishment, the State has abdicated responsibility for education by outsourcing the education system. It was decided to have a State-funded education system, rather than a State education system. Schools were established and the State placed them out for tender and asked patron bodies to oversee the running of them. I do not like this but it is the reality within which we must operate. Unfortunately, whatever manner or means we employ to regulate this area, it will never be perfect and education will never be as equal as we would like it to be. I meet many deputations who raise the issue of equality in the education system. For example, parents ask why they must baptise children to send them to a local school. I am deeply uncomfortable with the idea of having a number of denominational schools in a given area, with children going into school through different school gates. We consistently separate children on the basis of religion and gender. Moreover, because the education system is fundamentally based on the idea of competition, it is inevitable that children who are more disadvantaged lose out and those who are more advantaged gain.  I fully agree with the approach proposed by Senator Zappone because the current position is unjust. While the Bill focuses primarily on employees, what is the child of a lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, LGBT, couple, a divorcee or a single parent expected to feel in this scenario? I am keenly aware of this issue but what does one do when one is charged with responsibility of legislating within constitutional confines? That is the position in which this Government finds itself and any other Government would find itself. I would love to delete the section, as proposed in the amendment, but I predict that if we were to do so, we would be on the losing side in a case before the High Court or Supreme Court. It is inevitable that a court case will be taken in response to this legislation because that is what people tend to do in these circumstances. This will mean we will be back working off the original section 37, rather than the amended section we are trying to introduce today.  Senator Bacik stated that the mechanism we are trying to insert in the Act would make it almost impossible for any employer to suggest that anyone, on the basis of his or her nature, is undermining anything. By continuing to allow more than 90% of the infrastructure of primary level schools to remain in a religious ethos, we will perpetuate inequality. That is a fundamental reality of the position in which we find ourselves and that position is backed up by the Constitution.  People tell me how wonderful the education system is in Finland and what wonderful literacy statistics it produces. In Finland, there is one school in each school district, which means there are no primary, secondary, boys' or girls' schools. Schools in Finland are like palaces because they reflect the Finnish value system and the beliefs of Finnish people. Regardless of who one meets from the Finnish political system, whether left-wing, right-wing, centre-left, centre-right, far-left or far-right, all of them will tell visiting deputations, and I was a member of one such deputation, that the concept underpinning their education system is equality. Fundamentally, all of them believe in equality. In contrast, the Irish education system is underpinned by patronage and neither the child nor the employee is at its centre. Ideology and the rights of patrons to perpetuate their ethos are at the core of our education system. This approach also impacts on medical institutions.  While we are waiting for a revolution in this area - I will be at the front of it - we must deal with the current constitutional reality. Unfortunately, the constitutional constraints within which we operate mean that the best we can do is raise the bar. Notwithstanding these constraints, what we are doing is no mean achievement. I do not want anyone to conclude that my comments are undermining what the Bill will achieve for people working in the school system or a medical institution who believe they cannot be themselves. I am keenly aware of this issue, having dealt with it myself. While I would love to be in a position to delete section 37, to do so would create an open goal for those who want to do down this agenda and inevitably result in us having to deal with the existing section until we radically overhaul the education system, which could take forever. The European Union is happy for us to constitute our educate system in any way we wish. This is the system we have and I am trying to operate within it.

Many people have offered to pray for me in the past. On a serious note, it is outrageous that any teacher should have to be of a particular religion and that 95% of schools are under religious patronage. As a parent, I fought against this and was instrumental in the establishment of a new multidenominational school to try to break the stranglehold the churches, in particular the Catholic Church, have on our primary and secondary education systems. For this reason, I would be the first to fully endorse the Minister of State's comment that a revolution is required. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to upset the status quo. Many parents who are not believers are proponents of the status quo in faith schools attended by their children and for good reason, namely, their desire not to rock the boat for the sake of their children. A major issue here is the context in which the Bill is being debated.  To address the point about what we can do within the confines of the Constitution and European Union rules, it is clear from a reading of the report of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission that while provisions similar to section 37 are in place in many European Union member states, they do not have the significance they have in Ireland because schooling in these countries is not religious-based. It is a state-based, secular system with a tiny minority of faith schools which are entitled legally to discriminate on a section 37-type model. If one looks at the Dutch, Danish or British legislation, one will see there are similar provisions. It is only in our system section 37(1) has this immense significance for all of us because 95% of the schools are under religious patronage and Educate Together and multi-denominational schools form only a tiny minority. That is the context. I wish it were not like that but one must be realistic. Let me put it this way, as the Minister of State stated, this is no mean achievement. It is 17 years since section 37(1) was enacted. It is 30 years since Ms Eileen Flynn was sacked from the Holy Faith school in New Ross. It is not a mean achievement to overturn the potential for discrimination that still exists in law and that is what this Bill will do.

I fully agree with them. I do not think there is anything in his summation that I do not agree with. I come from a rural part of Ireland where the Roman Catholic Church made a significant contribution to teaching and education. If they were not there, it probably would not have happened at all or it would have been primitive. However, they should not have had to do it and they should not have been asked to do it, and now they should not be doing it. In the town where I live there are three secondary schools even though there is a population of less than 1,000. There is a school population, if one were to combine the three schools, of 500. I am on an amalgamation committee to try and get a community school and we are making significant progress in that regard.

We are debating amendment No. 14, which is the proposition to delete the section instead of the approach proposed by the Government. It is obvious, if nothing else, from the balance of power in the House, that the Government amendment will pass. I have a number of amendments down to the Government amendment to deal with the issues raised by Senator Norris and others and it would be helpful if we could move on to these amendments so that we can debate my proposals on those individual issues and tease them through.

I congratulate the Minister of State on what he has just said. It was an excellent speech and epitomised the core values of this Republic. I was proud listening to him. He explained clearly the difficulties and the way in which he is constrained, but he put his own ideals clearly on the record of this House and I compliment him on doing that. If religion is so cherished by parents, they should teach it to their children. It should not be the responsibility of school. School deals in fact, not beliefs, unless it is treated as cultural artifacts. I say this as somebody who is a believing member of a Christian church. The church is moving as well. I noted in the past few days a statement from a Roman Catholic bishop about the baptism of same-sex couples, making the point that there should not be any discrimination or distinction in the way in which these children are treated and no attempt to embarrass the parents. That is a very significant move forward by the Roman Catholic Church. It is not a church to which I belong but I applaud the bishop for making this position clear. I doubt if that would have happened if there had not been debates such as the debate that is taking place here today.

I thought it was important to put it forward now and to get this kind of response. Our time has not been wasted. I suppose the heart of my questioning there had to do with the question as to does the Constitution, as the Minister of State said, back up what it is that he is doing, as distinct from deleting the provision, or does it require it not to be deleted. I appreciate he has the legal advice and Senator Power has had legal advice. I have had other legal advice. I have read the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission's. Legal advice differs.

#AverilPower	unknown-#AverilPower-party	unknown-#AverilPower-dob	unknown-#AverilPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	231	Amendments Nos. 1 and 3 to amendment No. 13 are designed to remove the distinction in the text of the current wording from the Government between public and private institutions. Essentially, they would mean that the tougher conditions in subsections (1)(a) to (1)(c) would apply to all religious educational and medical institutions with the religious ethos covered by subsection (1) whether they are funded by the State or not. The distinction between State-funded bodies and those not funded by the State is not made in the main body of the Employment Equality Act. Generally, self-funded businesses are not exempted from equality requirements simply because they do not receive State funding. As a general principle, the Employment Equality Act imposes the same obligations on State employers and State-funded bodies as it does on private businesses. The Government's amendment considerably improves the position for those working in State-funded bodies. However, it leaves the existing wording of section 37(1) for non-State-funded bodies.This potentially allows schools and medical institutions to buy their way out of compliance with the tougher requirements and clearly privileges wealthier communities, schools and organisations that are better able to survive without State funding. It is an unjustified distinction that will leave people who work in private institutions, for example private nursing homes which do not receive any funding from the State, without the protection they deserve. It will leave them in exactly the same situation that we are now saying is utterly unacceptable in the context of public employees. They will be left in the same precarious, frightening and uncertain situation and that is not good enough. It is also important to note the distinction between State funded and privately funded bodies is not referenced in any way in article 4 of the framework directive. While there is possibly some logic in holding State funded bodies to more rigorous tests than for those not funded by the State, the mere fact a body is not funded by the State should not give it a licence to discriminate more easily. No institution should be allowed to exclude or treat somebody less favourably on account of, for example, their sexual orientation or civil status. However, that is what is happening here. The new test states that somebody may only be subjected to discrimination if they have engaged in some form of conduct which amounts to an undermining of the ethos, but that test will not be in place for employees of private institutions. Therefore, they will continue to fear that by merely being themselves and merely being open about the fact they are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender or that they are in a non-marital relationship or they have a child outside marriage or about any other aspect of their personality and personal relationships, they will be subjected to discrimination. This is utterly unacceptable. It is unjustified and is, arguably, repugnant to EU law. EU law is, of course, superior to our Constitution. The European directive does not make a distinction between public and private organisations although it does provide for an ethos exemption. The Government has pointed to that exemption on grounds of ethos, but the EU directive expressly states that the exemption should not justify discrimination on a ground other than religion, such as, for example, sexual orientation, age or disability. Nor does the directive provide any basis for a distinction to be made between State funded and non-funded institutions. While it permits more favourable treatment to be made on the religion or belief ground alone, it does so only where by reason of the nature of the activities or the context in which they are carried out, a person's religion or belief constitutes a genuine, legitimate and justified occupational requirement. The Minister of State proposes to leave the wording in section 37(1) that an employer can act if he believes that such action is reasonably necessary to protect ethos and this is the only statement in respect of private institutions. However, the directive goes much further and makes it clear that the test the Department is applying for public bodies, which makes it clear it must be a genuine occupational requirement, should also be applied to private bodies. It expressly says this in the exemption the Government is relying on. It says the exemption can only be relied on where the person's religion or belief constitutes a genuine, legitimate and justified occupational requirement. Therefore, the Government's proposed wording falls short of the requirements set out in the directive. I believe that for that reason it is repugnant to the directive. A European Commission report from 2007, entitled Religion and Belief Discrimination in Employment - the EU Law, by Professor Lucy Vickers of Oxford Brookes University, states that in Ireland too, section 37(1) of the Employment Equality Act contains an exception to the non-discrimination principle for the purposes of maintaining the religious ethos of an institution. Professor Vickers then states that this is broader than is allowed for in the directive, as it does not provide that religion or belief must be relevant to the particular job in question, nor does it limit the exception to discrimination based on the grounds of religion or belief so that it can not be used to justify discrimination on another ground. Elsewhere, Professor Vickers has said that article 4(2) of the directive allows for exceptions allowing religious organisations to maintain a religious ethos and require loyalty of staff to that ethos, but only where such exceptions constitute a genuine, legitimate and justified occupational requirement in regard to the institution's ethos. I have tabled these amendments to ask the Minister of State to look again at this issue. I welcome the fact that we are making improvements in the protection for public employees, but there is a serious gap in the legislation in that sufficient protection is not being provided for those who work in the private sector. This distinction is not made in the EU directive. It will leave people in private institutions, such as private nursing homes, fully private primary schools and other private institutions that would fit under the definition of private body in the legislation, without the protection we are providing for others. That is unacceptable. It would be preferable to distinguish based on the requirements of the role, what the job is, whether working in a private or public context. With this legislation we should be asking what exactly is their role. We should ask whether it is a role that actively involves propagating a religion, such as the role of rabbi, priest or minister. We would accept that institutions, whether public or private, have a right to hire such people based on their religious belief. However, if it is a role that is in no way related to such requirements, such as a gardener in a convent or an administrator, accountant, lawyer, teacher or doctor in a private institution where their job has nothing to do with ministering a particular faith, no institution public or private should be allowed to discriminate against that person solely on the grounds of their sexual orientation, gender, family status or any other inherent personal characteristic.

I do not intend to repeat all of that. However, I mentioned a grey area. I do not think it is appropriate for atheists to teach religion, except in a historical, cultural context. Children always know when somebody is not being true to themselves. I also believe it is a violation of the conscience of atheists to have to teach religion. If I was an atheist, I bloody well would not teach religion. I would simply refuse to do so. I also see the possibility of such situations arising within churches. Obviously a priest will not be hired unless he is ordained. However, priests can move around and can lose their faith. I do not think it would be appropriate for a church to install a rector, vicar, dean or whatever else, if he has publicly stated that he does not believe in God or the divinity of Christ and does not believe in the immortality of the soul. These are three fundamental beliefs of Christianity and if somebody denies them, it is not appropriate that he should be appointed. A case of this nature arose in the Church of Ireland and it had, for the first time in many years, a heresy hearing on the issue. What I would have done in that situation was to allow the person take evensong, take matins, visit the poor, get his wife to or make jam himself, but not celebrate communion or mass because that would be an absurdity as a non-believer. I see certain areas where there should be some discrimination. It is obvious it should be done, because not to do so would constitute a violation not just of children's right to an appropriate and adequate teacher, but also of the rights of a conscientious atheist. If I was an atheist, I would simply refuse to teach Christianity as if it was true. I think it is wrong to teach it if I do not believe it. If I do not believe in God, I will not go around teaching children to believe in God. That is morally reprehensible.

I am anxious to put on record my support for the Bill and my opposition to the amendments proposed.I have followed much of the debate from my office and I have found it very interesting and revealing. Thanks to the operation of the Irish Constitution and the intervention of the courts in their decisions we have a sensible Bill which seeks to reconcile competing aims to do with the rights of employers and those who have funded schools to promote their vision about life and the meaning about life and reality, which is fundamental to the educational enterprise. I speak as somebody who sits on the board of CEIST, an organisation which is a trustee for more than 100 voluntary secondary schools in the country, which do very great work and respect diversity in how they operate and admit. This competes with legitimate individual aspirations. In every workplace, and not just in educational or health facilities, there may be tension between people's legitimate desire to express themselves fully and be themselves fully, and the right of the organisation employing them to promote ideas which are central to its sense of what is good and true and fundamental in life. What is good about the Bill is it requires objective standards for decisions to be made. It is clear from what the Minister of State said that he would like to go in a very different direction to what the Bill actually does. He takes credit for what he sees the Bill as achieving. I support what the Bill achieves. What it achieves is an insistence that any action taken be objectively justified by a legitimate aim and that the means of achieving the aim would always be appropriate and necessary. This is the nub of it. No reasonable person could ever argue with the establishment of a standard like this. I have noticed in debates of this kind an easy recourse to a false dichotomy. We are presented with the alternative of a world where the State decides what values we must all have and what values may be legitimately communicated, the communication of which being a requirement for State funding-----

I have great respect for everybody here but his contributions are normally more to my taste. I felt very grateful for the provisions of the Constitution. Without the protections of the Constitution we would be in a very dangerous place. The Minister of State extolled the education system in Finland. He mentioned in passing that the schools are like palaces, and I certainly agree with him that resources are often a critical issue in securing the equality with which we all would and should agree, but the Minister of State would like a world, and I know from what Senator Conway stated he would also like a world, where the only issues that could be taught in school and the only agenda for schools would be one sanctioned by the State, and frankly that would be a very intolerant world. It would be a vision of education-----

This is not education, it is propaganda, and it is the antithesis of the type of pluralism that should be at the heart of what education is about. Education in the origin of the word means to draw out of children, so respect for the child is and ought to be the most fundamental thing. The ideological misuse of equality to insist on a certain menu of ideas for children is far from respecting children. It should not be necessary for me to remind the Minister of State that the reason the churches have been so involved in the provision of education is because, as Senator Conway generously acknowledged, they were ready and willing to provide education when nobody else was and when the State was not in a position to do so. To go from there to saying that now the State is in a position to provide all of the infrastructure and finance that religious institutions should be banished from education is simple intolerance. I agree with anybody who says it is farcical that 90% of schools should be under the patronage of one organisation. I would like to see an Ireland with generous resources for education. Starting from the principle that the parents, and not the Minister with responsibility for education, is the primary educator of children there should be generous resourcing for education according to the values of families and what they seek for their children. Senator Bacik acknowledged earlier in the debate, and I listened to her say it, that many people who may not be practising believers still seek to perpetuate the system as it is. She suggested this is because they do not want to put at risk their opportunities to have their children educated, but this is ungenerous. I do not mean this in a morally critical sense but it does not do sufficient justice to the range of motivations. Many people who may be agnostic or atheist recognise there is a value system, particularly in the western world according to the Judeo-Christian system, which they want their children to have, whether it is men respecting women, care for the poor or care for the environment-----

It is wrong to suggest there is some kind of mass hypocrisy going on. What is going on is that parents must in some way exercise their right to seek an education for their children and they must not be required simply to obey and only pick from the State's chosen menu. There are balances which must be struck. None of us would support education which would promote the subjugation of women or which would endorse violence. These are real issues in the western world when we think of militant Islam.To pretend that the State is some kind of a protector of civilised values at a time when children's right to life is not guaranteed in the western world and there is massive intolerance, when even Ministers struggle in their use of social media to maintain a level of civility that would be appropriate to democratic debate and to suggest the State should decide everything is a very dangerous thing to do.

I support this Bill. I do not thank the Minister of State for it, but I thank the Constitution and the good sense of our courts.

The separation of children, as the Minister of State described, is not to treat children with any lack of respect or inequality per se. There may be cases, and Northern Ireland comes to mind, where the denominational distinctions in schools could be argued to have contributed to the problem, on which subject one would have a very lively debate, but there can be social circumstances in which one could argue that one needs to bring children from different backgrounds together. I think we all understand that in the context of provision for people of different racial backgrounds and so on. Schools under religious patronage in Ireland have a very good record of promoting that kind of diversity and of respecting it. I have visited these schools and I have been in them but it should not be assumed or implied that it is wrong to have any kind of distinctions in schools according to denominational background or allow preference to be given to people from a particular background in certain circumstances. There is always a balance to be struck. We should be generous in our assumption and assume that if one is dealing with a Protestant school, that is a Protestant school following a Christian ethos, to take the example of Christianity, that teaches and insists on respect for the other, which is core to Christianity. We should not assume that separation is bad automatically. It is how it is done and sometimes it should not be done because of compelling social or political circumstances that might point to the need for greater levels of integration. We should give more credit to the good intentions of educators and to the quality of their work and acknowledge more forcefully and more audibly that people who teach according to a denominational school or Gaelscoil tradition, which operate through a particular appreciation of the Irish language, are also capable of inculcating the exact same level of respect for other people as, for example, an Educate Together or a vocational school.

I agree with the principle that the State should be the leading and main provider and manager of education, but I would not subscribe to the idea that religion should not be taught in schools. I think there is a very significant difference between the Catholic or Protestant churches running a school and teaching religion within it and the State running and managing a school and a religious ethos being taught through religion, be it Catholic, Protestant or of any other religion. That is the structure I would like to see. It is fair to point out that there is a cavalier attitude to the contribution the Catholic Church has made to education in Ireland. As I said earlier, and I thank Members for acknowledging it, and as I am going to repeat-----

It is easy to be cavalier in dismissing the role of the Catholic Church and, in a modern society that espouses equality, saying it should be the role of the State. I take Senator Bacik's point on board but we must remember the State is run by those who have a mandate from the people. That mandate has to be respected.

However, it has had a chilling effect and it does not offer much guidance on the question of what undermining the religious ethos might mean in practice. We do not have any recent case law to guide us. A central feature of the Private Members' Bill in addressing this issue and which, on legal advice, we consider must be retained, is to distinguish between religious institutions run wholly for private purposes and those providing an educational or medical service to the public which is financed by State funding. We are advised that this is an important distinction that must be provided for to ensure the constitutionality of the Bill. There are competing constitutional rights involved: freedom of religion and freedom of association for religious groups, the freedom to establish and maintain their own institutions of various kinds, and the right of employees to be free of discrimination. There is a balance to be struck and the advice available to me, to present it in a positive way, is that the State has a stronger standing and arguably a duty to ensure persons whose salaries are paid directly or indirectly from the public purse are protected and that, in such circumstances, a stronger intervention in the employee-employer relationship than would be appropriate in the case of purely private religious institutions is justified. For that reason, I am unable to accept amendment No. 1 and amendment No. 3 to amendment No. 13. I hope the Senators will accept my explanation and understand we cannot run the risk of the Bill being found to be unconstitutional on this point. I fear that amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 13 would go too far. Are we discussing amendment No. 2?

EU law supersedes our Constitution. That includes the directive I referred to in explaining amendments Nos. 1 and 3. It did include an exemption to provide that member states could continue with previous practices, provided they were in line with EU law and that, in any case, whether the institution is private or public, any discrimination would have to be related to a genuine occupational requirement. The EU directive makes no distinction between public and private organisations. It focuses instead on the role the person performs in the workplace or is applying for. That is more appropriate and it is what EU law requires of us. That is not only my point of view or that of my legal advisers, it was a point made by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, in its report on this legislation. When I introduced this Bill in 2012 the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, decided that instead of accepting the Bill he would request the IHREC to carry out work on section 37, with a view to informing future Government legislation and to consider each of these issues. The IHREC did that and made clear in its report that making a distinction between public and private institutions is not justified. It highlighted EU law in that respect. I do not accept that the justification in the legislation is fair, and more important, I believe it is repugnant to EU legislation. I urge the Minister of State to reconsider it and to accept these amendments. I accept that in particular posts, be they in private institutions or public ones, there are legitimate reasons for religious organisations to insist that somebody holding a particular position share their religious faith. That is fair enough in particular posts but that is the same, regardless of whether the institution is public or private. To make a blanket distinction between organisations and to give some organisations a licence to discriminate and opt out of the tougher test put in place for public bodies because they do not receive public funding is unjustified.

The suggestion that Ireland did not transpose the employment directive properly in section 37(1) has been addressed by the Attorney General in advice to the Department, quoting the text which is relevant here, Article 4.2: Member States may maintain national legislation in force at the date of adoption of this Directive or provide for future legislation incorporating national practices existing at the date of adoption of this Directive pursuant to which, in the case of occupational activities within churches and other public or private organisations the ethos of which is based on religion or belief, a difference of treatment based on a person's religion or belief shall not constitute discrimination where, by reason of the nature of these activities or of the context in which they are carried out, a person's religion or belief constitute a genuine, legitimate and justified occupational requirement, having regard to the organisation's ethos. This difference of treatment shall be implemented taking account of Member States' constitutional provisions and principles, as well as the general principles of Community law, and should not justify discrimination on another ground. I am not seeking to defend the text of section 37(1) but there is no point starting from a false premise. Short of referring to section 37(1) in the text I quoted, the meaning could not be clearer. Article 4.2 was negotiated specifically by the Irish delegation at the time to ensure that the law as set out in section 37(1) would not be altered by the directive and would continue on the basis of a specific protection for its terms. The Commission, as guardian of the treaties, did subsequently institute infringement proceedings in relation to this specific issue and having considered the response from the Irish authorities closed the file on the matter.

That is the test in the EU directive and that is the test the Minister of State is failing to put into this legislation in respect of private institutions. He is applying that text in respect of people who work for public bodies but he is opting not to include it for those who work for private institutions. The directive does not permit that. It does not make any such distinction. The paragraph he has read out does not do that and neither does any other part of the directive permit it. It is important to point out that the exemption negotiated at the time provided that member states “may” make distinctions, it did not say “shall”, “should” or “will”. It provided for exemptions for public and private bodies where a test about genuine occupational requirement could be met but it makes no distinction between public and private bodies. That is not my view alone, it is also the view of the IHREC, which is tasked by the Government, and set up by these Houses to make recommendations on legislation such as this, to get appropriate legal advice and to advise Ministers on it. The IHREC made clear in its report, requested by the former Minister, Deputy Shatter, prior to this legislation, that there is no legitimate reason to distinguish between public and private bodies.

I do not agree with the Senator. My suggestion would be that an individual, privately funded church or congregation of people who have a particular belief system could legitimately take a case on the basis that it is a private institution, privately funded with a particular belief system and therefore is constrained by what we are trying to do here and could potentially win that case.

Amendment No. 2 states that in addition to referring to the institution’s ethos we would also insert a new sub-section:(c) the relevant position of employment primarily involves the propagation of religion, such that the religion or belief of the employee or prospective employee is integral to that position.”.This is trying to move on from distinguishing between bodies on the basis of how they are funded and instead on the basis of the role an individual is asked to play within the organisation. I accept that there are some roles for which it is fair that an institution insist that somebody share its belief. The situations in which that is allowed should be restricted to roles that involve propagating religion, for example, preaching or faith formation, and hiring or promoting a minister, priest, rabbi or imam. In that case it would be ridiculous not to do so but that is not the case when hiring a gardener, an accountant, a nurse or a care assistant in a nursing home. There is no justification to discriminate against somebody in those roles. The Government text does refer to a genuine occupational requirement and inserts a test for an employer to show that religion is a genuine occupational requirement.However, there is a need for greater clarity in the legislation as to what exactly that means. Personally, I do not think that to teach a particular religion a person should have to be of that particular faith. To accept this proposition is to accept that a person cannot get a job as a primary school teacher in this country unless he or she is Catholic because more than 90% of our schools are of Catholic ethos. This means such a person would be restricted to teaching in the small number of Educate Together or other schools that are not of Catholic ethos.

I do not accept that. This remains acceptable in terms of the wording being put forward today by the Government. The programme for Government, to which the Minister of State's party and Fine Gael signed up when they came into office, specifically states that people of non-faith or minority religious backgrounds should not be deferred from training or taking up employment as teachers in this State. The programme for Government commitment did not relate only to LGBT teachers. While I appreciate the moves being made on this aspect, in terms of changing our equality law, the Government appears to have completely abandoned the commitment not to exclude people from employment because of their religion. I think that is regrettable. The amendment I have put forward provides an opportunity to address that and to address the unusual position in Ireland whereby the vast majority of our primary schools and a significant number of our second level schools are under religious patronage. While patronage arrangements must be respected and teachers should uphold the ethos of their schools, which means all teachers at primary level must teach religion, the fact that a teacher is not personally adherent to the same faith as the school should not prevent him or her getting a job or promotion. If teachers are prepared to fulfil the full functions of the posts their personal faith should not be an issue. The National Directory for Catechesis in Ireland sharing of the good news published by the Irish Episcopal Conference states that teachers will be employed on the understanding that they will commit themselves actively to supporting the ethos of the school. At the same time, the school will respect the freedom of conscience of teachers in matters of personal religious belief and practice. I do not believe the two are mutually exclusive. I agree with Senator Norris's earlier comments about atheists. In a free society, people should be free to believe, or not, whatever they wish. Everybody should have the same rights and respect in their personal lives and in the workplace. All I am asking is that we would make clear in the Bill that the fact that a person does not personally share an institution's religious ethos is not a bar to employment. I accept that the provision as drafted provides that the religious ground can only be relied on where there is a genuine occupational requirement but the difficulty brought to my attention by teachers in particular is that this concept is arguable. There is disagreement on it in that some of the patron bodies may well argue that being of the same faith as the school is a genuine occupational requirement. Personally, I do not believe it is if the teacher is prepared to respect the ethos of the school and fulfil all of the functions of their role. I am asking that the Minister of State provide clarity in the Bill in this regard. As I said, my objective in each of these amendments is to seek to improve on the Government wording and to try to give people as much clarity as possible. While the Minister of State may feel these issues are implicit in the legislation I think we should make them explicit.  The INTO, ASTI, TUI and other teacher unions need to be able to go back to their members and clarify that the legislation explicitly provides that the fact that they do not hold the same religious belief as a school in which they work or are seeking to work is not a bar to employment or promotion. It is not sufficient to provide that this may or may not be the case or that a court may or may not accept that. People need clarity on this issue.

With regard to teachers who are atheists but happy to teach religion and prepare children for their Holy Communion, I am not surprised by this. It explains the phenomenon of these children making their first Holy Communion, which does not exist in the Anglican church, dressed up as Cinderella, with fake tan and so on. Of course, this will happen if they are taught by people who do not believe in it. Teaching religion is different to teaching geography or history. We all know that in 1066 something happened and that London is the capital of Britain. There is very little argument about that. One would hardly be able to teach geography if one thought Dublin was the capital of Britain.  Most national schools have a number of teachers. Surely, it is possible even in this day and age to find at least one teacher with a sprinkling of religion to teach the religion class. Otherwise, we should abandon it. I am strongly of the view that having atheists teaching children religion is ridiculous, unless they are teaching it in a historical and cultural context. Children will pick that up. I believe that in many of these ceremonies there is less and less spirituality. Families are spending enormous amounts of money on tawdry trappings, which have nothing whatever to do with the religion. It is perfectly obvious to me that the children are not being properly taught religion and that their parents do not know the first thing about religion if that is how they approach the sacraments.

On the amendment, teaching in a religious ethos school is not just about the teaching of religion. It should run through every subject taught and throughout the entire day. Technically, a teacher in a Catholic school is supposed to teach history, geography, mathematics etc. through the Catholic ethos. This is not only about the teaching of religion. In regard to the programme for Government, our determination was to establish a form of patronage and pluralism. The determination then was to examine the entire infrastructure of the school system in Ireland and the reality of there being 4,000 school buildings in a country with a population equal to that of Manchester. It is unsustainable to have that number of school buildings and so on in a country which, as I say, has a relatively small population in comparison with other countries in the European Union. However, some people did not play ball. They wanted to keep things as they are. In this regard, in terms of influence over children and education, this is the last hurrah for people of a certain mindset. On amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 13, in my mind what it seeks goes too far. We have to accept that under the Constitution religious groups are free to establish their own institutions and can determine that religion or belief of employees is a genuine occupational requirement, even if the teaching of religion is not a direct feature of the particular post. I am unable to accept this particular amendment. This is an issue, and one not only relevant to religious institutions.What about a lobbying group that believes in human rights which has a reasonable expectation that someone working for it shares its belief system? What about someone working for a gay rights group, a women's rights group or a political party? Is it a reasonable expectation that an individual working in such an institution should share its mindset? It is not easy to nail down, which I totally accept. Unfortunately, or fortunately depending on one's point of view, we have to accept that the Constitution is quite clear on this point.
#AverilPower	unknown-#AverilPower-party	unknown-#AverilPower-dob	unknown-#AverilPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	307	I do not wish to overly prolong the debate as it is clear the Minister of State is not going to move on this issue. The Constitution contains competing personal rights to protect the individual such as the right to earn a livelihood, the right to equality and others, which have to be balanced against the right to religious freedom. One right does not necessarily trump all others and all of these issues can be argued. The Minister of State mentioned other countries which have their own form of section 37 and where religious institutions only run a small number of schools. In these countries there is no disproportionate impact on a teacher's right to earn a livelihood because if a teacher does not share the faith system of a particular school, he or she can opt to work somewhere else. There are plenty of public sector jobs where this can be done and only a minority of teachers opt to work in religious schools. Here, it is the opposite. Because of the level of respect afforded to freedom of religion, a teacher's right to earn a livelihood is, in some parts of the country, essentially rendered at nil. There is, thankfully, an increasing number of Educate Together schools, but there are many areas of the country in which all schools are under religious patronage. I do not think the balance is correct, although I accept that the Constitution requires a balancing act.  I understand from where the Minister of State is coming on a personal level but think he has been badly advised. I again ask him to re-examine this issue before the Bill is brought before the Dáil. We have an opportunity to deal with the issue here. The programme for Government did not just give a commitment to seek better diversity in schools, it also gave a very clear commitment that nobody would be prevented from taking up employment because of his or her religious beliefs. That issue is not being dealt with. I appreciate that the Minister of State has been told that it cannot be dealt with but my advice is that it can. I particularly acknowledge the work of Dr. Fergus Ryan who is in the Visitors Gallery. He is an expert in this area and drafted my Bill back in 2012. He has been meticulous in drafting amendments on this issue for the past three years, including the Report Stage amendments. He has put a huge amount of work into researching this issue, from an Irish perspective and the perspective of the relevant EU laws. He advises me that this is possible.  I understand from the Minister of State's reply that he is not going to accept the amendment, a decision which is unfortunate and unnecessary. I will be pushing the amendment to a vote. I ask the Minister of State to review and obtain more advice on the issues involved.

It is only reasonable and fair that those who could potentially be penalised for undermining that ethos be aware of what exactly it is. My objective is to provide clarity on these issues as many of them are open to argument. Different people have different views on what an institution's ethos might or might not be. I note with interest that the Irish Episcopal Conference document to which I referred, Share the Good News, requires Catholic schools to write down their ethos. The directions given to schools in the document are quite detailed and comprehensive, even requiring schools to run courses on their ethos in order to make staff aware of it. If the Catholic church requires schools to write down their ethos, I do not see why there should be an issue with us requiring such documents to be published. It is in the interests of both the employer and the employee that everybody should know where he or she stands. If employees are being asked to respect a particular ethos, they should know exactly what it involves and where the line is in order that they do not step over it inadvertently. Senator Katherine Zappone's amendment essentially seeks to do the same thing.
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	311	On amendment No. 4 to amendment No. 13, if an institution is to draw on its religious ethos to lawfully discriminate against an employee, it is reasonable to require it to define its ethos in writing and to require that the employee or potential employee be made aware of it. If the Government, by its amendments to the Bill, maintains that it is reasonable to keep section 37(1)(b) in order to protect the constitutional provisions on freedom of religion, why is it not equally reasonable to require religious institutions to define their ethos? An employee should be crystal clear on what it is he or she needs to respect and should not undermine. If we have it included in the Bill, it should be required before anybody has to go to court rather than it being done afterwards, an issue to which the Minister of State referred. I cannot for the life of me think why a religious institution would not want to define its ethos in writing and, with confidence, make employees or potential employees aware of it. What might an ethos contain? Should it contain, for example, that one must love one's neighbour as oneself; that it is right and proper to respect the fundamental dignity of every human being; that the meek shall inherit the earth or blessed are those who hunger and thirst for justice for they will be filled?

I am reminded of the G. K. Chesterton quote about Christianity, that it would be great if anybody bothered to try it. Addressing amendments Nos. 4 and 11 to amendment No. 13 together, there is a weight of volumes setting out the belief systems of individual churches and other religious groups. There are theological and practice differences not just between but also within particular denominations. There is a line which we should not cross. The State should not, as a matter of principle, involve itself in seeking to define - even indirectly - what individual denominations do or do not hold central to their ethos. If we want to achieve a genuine separation of church and State - I share this objective with the Senators - we should not start with the State putting a mechanism in place to regulate how religious groups define what they believe in.

It is just common sense that if one is required to comply with something, one should be entitled to know what it is.As I have stated all along, the test for this legislation is whether it gives people the comfort to be free to be themselves and to know where the line is in the workplace, that is, if they are asked to respect something, they know what it is. People should be given sufficient clarity so that they need not live with fear, uncertainty or worry and they can get on with doing their jobs, which is what anyone wants to do, gay or straight, male or female, married or unmarried. The same applies in respect of faith and the other grounds set out in this legislation. This is a straightforward amendment. Unfortunately, the Government will not accept it. It is probably the easiest to accept, given the fact that the Catholic church has placed a requirement on its schools to write down its ethos. I do not know why a teacher or potential employee should not be entitled to see that. For the purposes of this debate, I would like us to move on and get through the Bill, but it is important that we do this properly. People have been waiting a long time for this legislation and today is an opportunity to get it right, tighten its provisions and make it as strong as possible. I have tabled amendments Nos. 5 and 8 to 10, inclusive.

Senator Zappone and I have similar amendments, Nos. 5 and 10, respectively, on respect for an employee's privacy. I have tabled amendments on marriage and freedom of expression because I am concerned that the wording of the Bill is not sufficiently clear. While I appreciate that a certain conduct is required of employees or prospective employees where public institutions, albeit not private bodies, are concerned, this raises concerns about what type of conduct might be covered. In the US, for example, a teacher who was openly out in a religious school for years without any difficulty was discriminated against for getting married or wearing a wedding ring to school. The INTO's LGBT group has expressed concerns about the same happening in Ireland on the back of our beautiful decision in May to change our Constitution and introduce marriage equality. Teachers are concerned that, if a female teacher, for example, wears a ring into her classroom, is asked whether she got married and replies that she and Clare got married over the weekend or during the summer, this may be considered a form of conduct. Could the conversation, the wearing of the ring or anything related to the marriage arguably be a question of conduct? The Minister of State may believe it is not or that such protection is implicit in the Bill, but I am seeking for him to make it explicit, thereby making it clear that, from now on, no one can be discriminated against simply for being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender or for exercising a constitutional right to marry. This is the most basic measure that we are being asked to make, which is why I have tabled an amendment to that effect. I have tabled a further amendment on-----

Clearly, this is a form of conduct, as the Bill does not restrict questions of conduct to the workplace. Could the mere fact of attending a pride parade or being photographed in local newspapers at a pride parade provide sufficient justification for discrimination? The Minister of State may argue that it is implicit in the legislation that this is not the case, but others would argue differently. It is important that we make it clear that it is not an issue. There should be no question of being penalised for exercising the lawful right to freedom of expression or association. Dr. Ryan has drafted my amendments in such a way as for each to start with the term, "Without prejudice to the generality", as regards earlier provisions. This term is frequently used in Government legislation and makes it clear that, although we are inserting specific requirements in terms of the issues that I mentioned, these are not the only situations in which discrimination is prohibited under the Bill and are merely examples. The language has been carefully drafted to make that explicit. My amendment No. 10 is on the employee's privacy. It addresses the concern that, while the Bill refers to conduct, it does not restrict its provisions to conduct in the workplace. Where the line between someone's personal and private lives lies is arguable. I have tabled this amendment to clarify that someone's personal and consensual relationships, be they of a sexual nature or otherwise, with other adults outside the workplace is not the business of the employer. The employee has a constitutional right to privacy and nothing that he or she does in exercising that right within the parameters set out in my amendments should amount to conduct justifying discrimination under the legislation. Each of these amendments is designed to give people as much clarity as possible. I would have preferred to delete this provision. As Senator Zappone argued, it would be easier to get rid of it than to qualify it in so many ways. Given the fact that it is staying, however, the least we can do is restrict it as much as possible and give people clarity around the typical scenarios that have been raised by the INTO's LGBT group, the ASTI and others where teachers are seeking to know whether particular forms of conduct are covered and that they have nothing to worry about. No one wants to wait for this question to be determined by a court. The point of introducing this legislation is to remove section 37(1). It has never been relied on and an employer has never won a case based upon it. Whether something justifies discrimination has always been arguable, but the mere uncertainty and fear about whether people are covered in that regard has kept them living lives of anxiety and self-censorship. Let us give people as much certainty as we can. The Minister of State should accept these amendments so that it is clear that merely being out, married or in a relationship or exercising one's freedom of expression by getting involved in a pride parade or being photographed in the Áras with one's colleagues from the INTO's LGBT group does not constitute grounds for discrimination.

This seeks to add a more airtight character to the Government's tests or criteria whereby religious institutions can justify discriminatory treatment against employees on the basis of their ethos. The amendment is rooted in my efforts on Committee Stage to amend the Bill. I acknowledged that it is the intent of the Government and Senator Bacik to ensure that the employee's right to privacy is adequately protected and that his or her private life is effectively off limits to an objective justification by a religious institution for its discriminatory treatment. Amendment No. 5 would insert a simple and straightforward line in the Government's amendment to the effect that the employer must have due regard to the employee's or prospective employee's right to privacy. With this brief amendment, the Bill would be strengthened considerably so that the Government's efforts to protect freedom of religion could not extend beyond religious grounds into an employee's private life. A religious institution would have too high a bar to meet if it wished to discriminate against, for example, a lesbian or heterosexual woman who was pregnant through assisted human reproduction, a lesbian or gay man who wore a wedding ring, as Senator Power mentioned, or an unmarried mother who was living with her children.If this line were added, a religious institution would have too high a bar to meet if it wished to discriminate against a lesbian or heterosexual woman who is pregnant through assisted human reproduction or a lesbian or gay man who wears a wedding ring or an unmarried mother who is living with her children. To include a requirement to have due regard to the right to privacy in the Bill would be very straightforward as our courts recognise that the personal rights in the Constitution imply that right. It would go a significant distance to ensure that one's identity or the conduct that naturally flows from it would not jeopardise one's employment.

It would be useful to include a specific reference to the employee's or prospective employee's right to privacy to strengthen the already strong test and high bar that I have already referred to as the "one plus five" test. A specific reference to privacy in subsection (1C)(c) would be helpful and cover some of the issues that have been so eloquently described by other colleagues. There is already a good deal of complexity in the amendments proposed by the Government. That complexity is necessary, unfortunately, to the scheme of employment equality legislation. As such and while we must be careful not to insert unduly complex extra amendments, a simple reference to privacy would be useful. I hope the amendment can be accepted.

The reason is that it is vaguely drafted. For example, paragraph (b) states:For the purpose of this subsection, a person's right to privacy includes, but is not limited to, the person’s right to engage in sexual acts with other adults, as permitted by law, and to form and engage in intimate relationships with other adults, as permitted by law.”.  There is nothing to prevent people having umpteen sexual contacts or an orgy with five or six people. Perhaps that is a very modest orgy; let us say 25 people frolicking on the dining room floor. I do not approve of that.

Amendments Nos. 5, 7, 8 and 10 take different forms and address the matter in different ways, but they have in common a focus on the employee's right to privacy. My Department has consulted with the Office of the Attorney General and I am happy in light of the consultation to accept the spirit of the amendments. Comparisons are invidious so I ask Members to forgive me, but in so far as a choice must be made, the style of amendment No. 5 conforms to the crisp and precise style in which the legislation is drafted. It captures the objective of the group of amendments without repeating the detail which I am advised is unnecessary. With the agreement of the House, I propose to accept amendment No. 5. On that basis, the other amendments might not be pressed. I understand I should move a verbal amendment at this stage as the insertion of a new subparagraph (iii) in subsection (1C)(c), which is proposed to be inserted by paragraph (b) of amendment No. 13, will require that the existing subparagraph (iii) is updated to subparagraph (iv). It is a consequential technical amendment arising from the acceptance of amendments Nos. 5 to No. 13. Perhaps the House can confirm its agreement to this change in the version of the Bill as proposed by the Seanad to be published after today's debate. Therefore I propose that in paragraph (c) of subsection (1C) proposed to be inserted by paragraph (b) of amendment No. 13, the existing subparagraph (iii) is renumbered as subparagraph (iv).

Elements of what it seeks to achieve are contained within the text on privacy which we discussed earlier. I signalled acceptance of the amendment from Senator Zappone which is in concert with the broad principle of what Senator Averil Power is also seeking to achieve. Other elements cross the line into territory where the Supreme Court is likely to decide that the text should be struck down. As such, we have to be very careful. No employee is free to act against the interests of or campaign against the values or ethos of the employer. That is a fact that goes beyond considerations of whether the employer is a religious institution. For example, civil servants above a certain grade are not free to participate in politics or campaign on issues of political controversy. A similar situation exists for An Garda Síochána. I would like to be able to give definite advice on where the boundary might lie in respect of a range of possible circumstances but it is not possible to do that. The right to privacy encompasses freedom of expression, assembly and association to an extent but not to the extent that the exercise of these freedoms includes campaigning against and, in particular, visibly campaigning against one's employer or the employer's values and beliefs. While I appreciate the motivation behind the amendment, I am, unfortunately, unable to accept it.
#AverilPower	unknown-#AverilPower-party	unknown-#AverilPower-dob	unknown-#AverilPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-07-09 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	345	I welcome the fact that the Minister is accepting amendment No. 5 which is largely in the spirit of where I was coming from on amendment No. 10 in respect of privacy. However, I am still a little concerned in respect of freedom of expression and what the Minister of State has said about conduct outside the workplace that might be contrary to an employer's ethos. Does that cover someone attending a pride parade or who was openly pictured at the march for marriage prior to the referendum or who canvassed for marriage equality with the Yes Equality campaign? Clearly, it was campaigning on an issue that was against the public teaching of some of our religious bodies, including the Catholic Church. The Minister of State seems to be saying we do not know or are not sure. That is the reason there is still some anxiety among teachers about whether the legislation is going far enough. I welcome the inclusion of the amendment on privacy but I ask the Minister of State to clarify if that expressly includes the issue of marriage and wearing a wedding ring into the school. Privacy outside the workplace is another issue but does it cover somebody publicly speaking about their marriage in a school context and publicly wearing symbols of same-sex marriage in a school when that is against the teaching of the church running the institution? The Minister of State might say that, implicitly, he believes it is, but others would argue that it is not. That is why I was seeking to make those protections explicit. There is a particular argument for doing that in light of the fact that marriage equality is a constitutional right or will be when the vexatious litigation before the courts is concluded. It will be a constitutional right on a par with the constitutional right of freedom of religion. For that reason, it should enjoy a special status and we should be able to give people clarity that no act related to getting married could leave a person in a difficult position with his or her employer. Does the Minister of State believe somebody being open about his or her marriage to a same-sex partner in a school or who attends a pride parade is covered by the legislation?

It represents also the spirit of amendments put forward by Senator Power. I acknowledge the support of Senator Bacik also. Her views on any legal issues are much respected. I also acknowledge the support of the Minister of State's officials. The Minister of State's "no mean achievement" just got better. It is my understanding that the inclusion of a right to respect for privacy of the employee offers a guarantee on some of the matters on which Senator Power is asking the Minister of State to speak.

We must put to rest the concern that somebody's marital status might be a ground of discrimination following this. Even without the amendment on privacy, it is clear from the wording of subsection (1C) that the action of the employer cannot be a response to an employee's civil or family status.We need to allay people's concerns about it. The test is set so high that an employer's actions cannot be a response to a person's marital status, same-sex or otherwise, or his or her status as an unmarried person or any other family status.

Many people who are not married wear wedding rings and sometimes, in particular circumstances, people remove them. It would be inappropriate for a teacher to give a seminar on his or her marriage, whether same-sex or opposite-sex. I do not remember anything like that from any of the schools I went to, ghastly as some of them were. Nobody ever asked a teacher whether he or she was married or asked to hear all about his or her married life. Go away out of that. I do not know what kind of brats we are rearing now.

They feel, when talking about their partners, they have to use non-gendered pronouns, for example a female does not say “she”. A woman might have to put up with intolerable situations such as a well-meaning colleague trying to set them up with their son, a physical education teacher or the guy across the street because she has not been free to say she is a lesbian. We are trying to deal with it. People do not want their private lives to be a matter of formal discussion, debate or instruction in the school. They just want to be free to be themselves in the same way as everybody else. I accept what Senator Bacik is saying in that the mere act of being married can no longer provide justification for discrimination. I accept it is one of the listed grounds. My concern is about the conduct test. The Bill provides that discrimination can be exercised on grounds of religion if the employee's conduct is such that it challenges or undermines the institution. The Irish National Teachers Organisation LGBT group has raised with me the need for clarity. Wearing a ring, speaking about it freely and having a conversation is conduct. Honestly answering a question from a child about why one is wearing a ring and one's partner or spouse is conduct. Whether it is conduct justifying discrimination is the question they are asking. If the Minister of State tells me his legal advice is that it is not, it would provide me with reassurance. My concern in bringing forward the amendment and my advice from Dr. Fergus Ryan, who drafted it for me, is that it would be preferable to make it explicit and that, particularly if the Minister believes the issue is already implicit in the legislation, there is no reason not to make it explicit. Could the Minister of State please give me a reason not to make it explicit and very clear? I do not believe conduct related to conversations about marriage is explicitly provided for, although it is implicitly provided for. I would be more reassured if we were clearer on it.

We are not afraid of something that is not there but are legislating for something that very much is there. We must be very mindful of it. While many school staffrooms are very inclusive places where people can be who they want, not every schoolteacher or medical professional feels the same, and we must ensure the chilling effect, as it has been described, ends. Senator Norris reminded me of a situation in which I was machine gunned with questions about my private life by students in my class who assumed I was gay because I was teaching in a girls' school. Then I got engaged and they saw a photograph of her.

In Sheriff Street, the word "massive" is a compliment. It is very different from Monaghan, where telling somebody their wife or girlfriend is massive has a different connotation. I had to spend a little time explaining that one. I digress. To speak bluntly to Senator Power's reservations, one cannot be seen to have been undermining anything if one answers a question factually. "Are you married?" "Yes, I am." That is not undermining anything, only stating a fact. It is not proselytising, undermining or campaigning. If somebody asks me, as a teacher, if I am running for election, the answer is yes. If somebody asks if I am running for the Labour Party, the answer is yes. If somebody asks if his or her mother should vote for the Labour Party, that is where the line is.

However, this will be without prejudice to the landlord's rights under any rule of enactment regulating the provision of accommodation and to the right of a person providing accommodation to require that rent supplement be paid directly to him or her. HAP is paid directly to landlords under separate legislative provisions, which do not need to be repeated in these provisions. The new "housing assistance ground" is drafted such that it applies only to the provision of rental accommodation, so as to avoid any unintended consequences. However, advertising is expressly captured because of the way in which the definition of "prohibited conduct" in section 2 of the 1998 Act operates. It is absolutely appropriate that a person who is in receipt of a rent supplement or assistance payment and can meet the rent set by a landlord should not be discriminated against simply because of the source of his or her income. We have a serious housing crisis in Dublin city and elsewhere in the State. This is a reform for which my Department can and has taken responsibility. It does not pretend it will solve our housing problems, but it is a small and necessary step in the right direction. I commend the amendments to the House.
