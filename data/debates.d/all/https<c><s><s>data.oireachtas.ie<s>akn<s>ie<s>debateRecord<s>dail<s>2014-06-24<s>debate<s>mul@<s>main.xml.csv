#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	0	Will the Minister outline the appointment process for the vacant permanent post of Garda Commissioner? Last Friday, she made a public comment on it. In particular, will she outline the steps in the process and who the central people will be in the process? Two weeks ago I met representatives of the independent Northern Ireland Policing Board and they said the chairperson and chief executive of the board was assisted by a human resources consultant based in Dublin, whom I will not name, in making appointments.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	As part of our comprehensive programme of justice reform, the Government has recently announced that, in future, the post of Garda Commissioner will be filled by way of an open competition, including with respect to the current vacancy. The comprehensive programme of justice reform also includes the proposed establishment of an independent Garda authority, which I hope to have up and running by the end of the year. These two reforms are among the most significant in the history of the State in regard to policing. The competition for the current vacancy will be organised by the Public Appointments Service. The process will be transparent and will seek candidates of the highest calibre. As previously indicated, it is intended that the competition process will commence towards the end of next month, with advertisements being placed. The fact that the recruitment competition will be an open rather than a purely internal competition means that the recruitment process will take a number of months, so that the final selection will take place towards the end of the year, around the time of the establishment of the new independent Garda authority. I am hearing different views on this. While some people are calling for the post to be filled sooner rather than later, it is important that this process take account of the establishment of the new Garda authority and its intended role in the appointment of senior Garda posts, including that of Commissioner. While the authority’s role in this regard will be subject to careful consideration during the ongoing preparation of the establishing legislation, the fact that the recruitment competition will proceed in parallel with the process of establishing the authority allows an opportunity for the emerging and developing body to inform the recruitment process.

The comprehensive reform programme is being overseen by the Cabinet committee on justice reform and is being further informed by ongoing consultations by both the Government and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality. As part of these consultations, last Friday I hosted a consultation seminar on justice reform in Farmleigh, attended by more than 100 participants, including representatives of the Deputy’s office. The feedback from the seminar will inform the work of establishing the authority and decisions on its role and functions regarding matters such as appointment of senior Garda posts, including that of Garda Commissioner.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	2	I raised this matter in the recent debate on Deputy Ross's Bill. Has the Minister considered the appointment of an interim board before the establishment of the independent policing body? If the Public Appointments Service is running the recruitment process, will its selections be presented to the new, independent policing authority at the end of the year? Will the independent policing authority have an input into the process? If the independent policing authority is to have confidence in the new Garda Commissioner or chief of police, it is reasonable to expect it to be central to the process that identifies such a person. Would the Minister appoint an interim board and acting CEO to assist the Public Appointments Service? What did the Minister mean when she said it would be a transparent process?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	3	By "transparent" I mean that advertisements will be placed internationally and the Public Appointments Service has a very clear process that will be followed in terms of recommendations. The Deputy's question is slightly premature in that the Cabinet took a decision on an independent policing authority, and both processes - the appointment of the Garda Commissioner and the development of the authority - are moving along in parallel. We have yet to develop the precise detail of the legislation that will lead to the establishment of the independent Garda authority. The Deputy's questions were central to the consultation seminar I held last Friday in Farmleigh and to the justice committee's deliberations and visits to Belfast and Scotland. From the way independent Garda authorities are handled in different countries, it is very clear that the process varies in terms of involvement by governments, involvement by policing authorities, the way appointments are handled and the personnel involved. In Farmleigh on Friday, all the stakeholders asked about the role and responsibility of a new Garda authority and its relationship with the Government, the Oireachtas, the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission and the Garda Inspectorate. Towards the end of the year we will, hopefully, be able to move forward with certain elements of the Garda authority, whether appointing a chairman or taking other decisions. We will ensure that, with the way the two processes are developing, there is the potential for the kind of overlap the Deputy describes.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	4	I welcome the Minister's answer. Appointing a chairman designate of the new policing authority should be considered as part of the process, as it might get over the concerns I raised. Below the level of Garda Commissioner there are several vacancies, including assistant commissioner and chief superintendent. The recently departed Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan, had been central in a number of interviews to form panels to fill a number of these vacancies. Bearing in mind where we are going with the independent policing authority and the appointment of a Garda Commissioner, what is the status of these vacancies? I asked this of the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Shatter. On our trip to Belfast and Edinburgh we learned that the independent policing boards are responsible for appointing the chiefs of police and their most senior people. We have vacancies in the most senior ranks of Garda under the Garda Commissioner. Will the interviews already undertaken be set aside? Will we begin a new competition for those vacancies, and who will run it?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	5	I welcome last week's promotions to the ranks of Garda sergeants and inspectors and the Garda Síochána has generally welcomed them.The matter about which the Deputy asked is still being discussed. The same considerations apply as I set out in relation to the development of the authority. There is no decision on that issue right now; it is a matter under consideration.
#PadraigMacLochlainn	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-party	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-dob	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	6	In June 2012 Mr. Seamus Doherty was murdered at his home in Churchill, County Donegal. The family had very serious concerns from the get-go about the investigation by An Garda Síochána. I will go into that matter in more detail in my response to the Minister's reply. My concern is the apparent lack of co-operation from the management of An Garda Síochána in County Donegal with the Garda Services Ombudsman Commission investigation following a complaint from the family.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	My Department had been advised by the Garda Services Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, that issues had arisen last year in obtaining some information from An Garda Síochána related to the investigation of a complaint. It has been further advised, however, that the issue has been resolved and that all relevant documentation requested by the ombudsman commission has been provided. I understand the complaint remains under investigation by GSOC. I have been further advised that a second complaint was admitted by GSOC in March 2014 for investigation by GSOC personnel pursuant to section 98 of the Garda Síochana Act 2005. The Garda Síochána Act 2005 established GSOC to receive complaints from members of the public concerning the conduct of members of An Garda Síochána. The Act stipulates that GSOC is independent in the exercise of its functions and I do not have a role in the processing of individual complaints which are referred to it for investigation. As with the Deputy, I regard full co-operation by An Garda Síochána with the Garda Services Ombudsman Commission as extremely important. It is a matter in respect of which everyone has work to do. As the House has previously been informed, revised protocols were agreed and signed by the chairperson of GSOC and the Garda Commissioner on 23 September 2013 to ensure the highest possible level of co-operation between the two organisations. I met representatives of GSOC yesterday and had a long meeting to discuss the protocols and other issues. Progress is being made. I have also agreed that new legislation should be introduced regarding GSOC and I hope to introduce it in the House before the summer recess with the co-operation of the Deputy and Deputy Niall Collins.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 More recently, in response to the findings made in the Cooke report, the Government has agreed that the proposed new Bill to reform the workings of GSOC will further clarify and strengthen the provisions relating to the preparation and implementation of protocols relating to co-operation between gardaí and GSOC. Once the Bill is enacted, compliance by gardaí and GSOC with agreed protocols will be obligatory under statute. It is my intention to publish the Bill shortly with a view to consideration by the Oireachtas before the end of this term.
#PadraigMacLochlainn	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-party	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-dob	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	From my dealings with the family of the late Mr. Doherty, I understand his body was found in the early hours of the morning of 17 June 2012 in the bathroom of his home. There were signs of an assault on his body and the bathroom scene suggested a struggle. There were various items and water on the floor and it was clear that something had taken place which gave cause for concern. However, it took three days for a murder investigation to commence. There are all sorts of questions mark over the preservation of the scene, the questioning of witnesses and the people in the house and procedures. There were serious concerns from the get-go not only among the family but also in the wider community. When GSOC sought to investigate the matter initially, it did so pursuant to section 94(5) of the 2005 Act, which provides for a supervised investigation. It had to change the nature of the investigation owing to the lack of co-operation. The lesson is that in moving forward there must be full co-operation from An Garda Síochána with GSOC to allow public confidence to be restored.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	The Deputy is absolutely right in what he has said. I am informed that An Garda Síochána states it has made full disclosure and is co-operating fully with all requests from GSOC with regard to these investigations. When I hear the Deputy speak about the horrific details of the murder, my first thoughts are with the family and the terrible situation they have had to face.In terms of the issue raised, the Guerin report investigated 12 cases and made a number of points about how gardaí investigated serious cases. Mr. Guerin made a number of recommendations and I have asked the Garda Inspectorate to take that part of the Guerin report, examine the points made and make any necessary recommendation. The interim Garda Commissioner said An Garda Síochána was examining the report and that implications arose from it, on which she intended to act. I have also asked for the Garda's response to the report.
#PadraigMacLochlainn	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-party	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-dob	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	I thank the Minister for her approach to this issue. I am conscious that she is new in the Department and that this is a fresh start. Later this year we will look at legislation to strengthen the powers of the ombudsman and make them clear. Deputy Niall Collins alluded to the meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence with the ombudsman in the North and the PSNI board. What is clear is that the ombudsman in the North has clear legislation covering its powers, full discovery and the co-operation it expects to receive. There has been a history of Garda senior management procrastinating when it comes to co-operating with the Garda ombudsman. In the case of the murder of Mr. Seamus Doherty in County Donegal and other cases, there must be no doubt that full co-operation in a timely fashion is expected in order that the Garda ombudsman can do its job speedily and have the full confidence of the public that it has the power, ability and resources to get to the bottom of allegations.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	I regard full co-operation from An Garda Síochána with the Garda ombudsman as extremely important. When the Cooke report was published, I said working together and sharing information needed more than protocols or legislative change. It is also about a change in culture. There must be learning on both sides. We want to see an oversight body going about its work with full co-operation from An Garda Síochána. That is in its interests and in the long run such co-operation is to its advantage and ensures citizens have faith in the force and will work co-operatively with it. Lessons can be learned on both sides. There are outstanding issues in regard to full co-operation in a timely way from An Garda Síochána. What the interim Garda Commissioner said recently about the level of co-operation she expected between the two bodies was an important first step.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	I ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to justify the presence of large numbers of gardaí at peaceful community protests against the installation of water meters in Dublin and elsewhere, particularly in the light of the fact that the austerity programme that gave rise to water meters and water charges has been totally discredited and now has no mandate following the recent elections.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	The installation of water meters has given rise to protest action by individuals and groups opposed to the introduction of water charges. Legitimate, peaceful protest as an expression of a particular viewpoint has its place in society. There is no argument with this, but there are other, equally legitimate, rights that must also be protected. The right of a person to go about his or her lawful business and make a living free from unwarranted interference is one such right. Where the exercise of these rights raises the possibility of a breach of public order, it is the responsibility of An Garda Síochána to act to prevent such breaches.It is important that the House be aware that the gardaí were present in the area on the day in question to maintain public order and enable workers to go about their lawful business. Their presence was also required as a result of makeshift and illegal water connections having been installed. Such unauthorised work could have compromised the water supply in the area. The Garda presence facilitated the contractors in carrying out the necessary work to prevent this risk. I am informed by the Garda authorities that after this work was completed the gardaí withdrew from the area. It is for An Garda Síochána to take the necessary measures in regard to such matters, having regard to the public interest including the need to uphold the rule of law and ensure the safety of the public. However, I am sure the Deputy will agree that there is no reason both the rights of the protesters to protest and the obligations on An Garda Síochána where public safety is concerned should necessarily be in conflict. On some occasions the gardaí are placed in a difficult position, but I have no doubt they would also receive criticism if they decided not to police such events and if persons engaged in lawful employment or members of the public were prevented from going to work or, worse, were endangered or injured, accidentally or otherwise.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	In many parts of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and other areas around the country, ordinary householders and taxpayers have been peacefully protesting against the installation of water meters, because they know that these are the tools by which the Government is to impose yet another austerity tax upon them. These people have been forced to carry so much already, as part of the bailout of bankers and bondholders. This was a huge issue at the local and European elections. The policy of Fine Gael and the Labour Party was flatly rejected and the moral right is entirely with the householders and those protesting, yet the Government is using the Garda to try to force this development on people. Is that not the case? I put it to the Minister that at a time when many people complain that they cannot get a garda when they need one in emergency cases, perhaps a case of domestic abuse or some other issue, this is a scandalous waste of public resources.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	I put it to the Deputy that the installation of water meters is being carried out on behalf of Irish Water in accordance with what is a statutory responsibility and a democratic decision. Clearly, all citizens are entitled to peaceful protest and I would affirm that right, but rights come with responsibilities. Equally, if people have the right to protest, there is a responsibility not to breach the law. I am not sure whether the Deputy would stand over the danger of compromising the water supply in the area. If that is what has happened and if the gardaí were there to ensure proper water meters were installed, they were supporting Irish Water in carrying out their statutory duty and responsibility. I thought the Deputy would not support efforts that prevent working people from getting on with what they were being paid to do in those circumstances and in similar circumstances around the country where they are installing water meters.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	16	I put it to the Minister that she is coming at it from the wrong angle completely. The fact is that this new water tax, which will be a huge burden on families - the Taoiseach said the so-called full cost recovery will be €580 per household - is a tax too far and there is outrage about it. Fine Gael and the Labour Party learned that in the campaign for the recent elections. Therefore, this tax and the means employed to implement it have no democratic mandate and no moral authority. That is why citizens all around the country are objecting to it. The Government should end the policy of water tax and metering. This is a waste of taxpayers' funds which should go instead to fix the pipes, where there is huge leakage, rather than to send gardaí into communities to enforce a tax that is discredited before it even begins.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	17	Clearly, the Deputy is giving his opinion on the tax, but I am speaking about the role of gardaí in the maintenance of public order, if there is a threat to it. Of course, people have a right to protest, but, equally, others have a right to go about their work in installing water meters and doing the job Irish Water is obliged, under statute, to do. That is precisely what was happening on the day in question. In the opinion of senior officers responsible for the deployment of gardaí, the numbers deployed were proportionate to the level of threat posed. I am sure the Deputy does not object to the actions of gardaí in ensuring during the recent spell of good weather that we did not have a repeat of what happened on the beaches in Dublin last year.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	18	Is the Minister comparing residents to vandals?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	19	Gardaí took the appropriate steps to maintain public order, rightly so, and they have been praised for so doing. I put it to the Deputy that they were taking the appropriate steps in the context of the incident referred to.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	20	The Minister cannot compare residents and taxpayers with vandals.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	21	I am seeking an update on the progress made in the implementation of the recommendations made in the Guerin report. We have a good understanding of the primary conclusion made in the report, having discussed it in the House, namely, that Sergeant Maurice McCabe was completely vindicated. We are awaiting the terms of reference of the forthcoming commission of investigation. There were a number of other recommendations made in the report, while a number of specific actions were flagged. I ask the Minister to update us on the issue.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	22	As the Deputy said, we have had an opportunity to discuss the Guerin report in the House and consider some of the wide range of issues addressed. These issues are complex and deep-rooted, ranging from high level issues such as oversight, change management and the role of whistleblowers to local administration and internal communication, as well as matters of basic policing, performance and human resources. I have been reviewing the conclusions and recommendations made in the report. The Government agreed to a set of measures in response to the report. We are establishing a further commission of investigation as recommended in it. This will be an independent inquiry headed by a senior judge. On foot of the publication two weeks ago of the Cooke report, the Government will now proceed to finalise the terms of reference of the commission which will generally be in line with those recommended by Mr. Guerin in his report. He made a number of recommendations, particularly with regard to the cases that merited further inquiry. I intend to put a resolution to the House to establish the commission during this Dáil term. I have already stated in the House that I have asked for an independent expert review of the performance, management and administration of the Department of Justice and Equality. The review group, chaired by Mr. Kevin Toland, began this work in recent weeks and I look forward to receiving its report in July. The Garda Inspectorate has been asked to carry out a comprehensive inquiry into Garda management and the wide range of operational issues addressed by Mr. Guerin following his examination of various cases. Amendments have been made to the Protected Disclosures Bill to enable GSOC to be prescribed under the Bill as a body to which Garda whistleblowers may report concerns. New legislation will be introduced shortly to strengthen GSOC. 
The comprehensive programme of initiatives and reforms I have outlined deal with many of the recommendations made in the Guerin report.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	There were numerous operational and procedural matters identified by Mr. Guerin in his report, including the fact that, in some cases, the procedure for taking statements resulted in the withdrawal of complaints of a criminal nature. In the context of disciplinary proceedings being taken against a probationary garda, he recommended that a report be prepared on the adequacy of the supervision of the said probationary garda. He also referred to the need for procedures to be put in place to ensure CCTV footage was obtained by investigating gardaí. He further recommended a review of the operation of the PULSE system. He recommended reform of the application of station bail and, in particular, section 2A of the Bail Act. The report made particular reference to the need for direction and guidance to be provided for members of An Garda Síochána on victim impact statements. The Minister has said the Garda Inspectorate has a job of work to do in this context and that she is awaiting the outcome of its investigations.Does she intend to undertake a review of the bail legislation separate to that being carried out by the Garda Inspectorate? Has she considered reviewing the code of conduct for the Garda Síochána in the context of how members of the force behave? In so far as is currently possible and in view of the fact that she is new to the role, is the Minister satisfied that if a whistleblower similar to Sergeant Maurice McCabe were to emerge, he or she would be dealt with properly? Is she satisfied that proper and adequate procedures have been put in place to facilitate such a whistleblower?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	24	The Deputy asked a large number of questions.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	25	Yes.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	26	I do not believe the interim Garda Commissioner is obliged to wait until the commission of investigation has completed its work before initiating changes in response to the Guerin report and in respect of some of the issues the Deputy has identified. I have been assured that work is under way regarding this matter. Changes are currently being made - and others will be made in the future - in respect of various recommendations in the Guerin report. The Deputy also inquired about legislative change. The Guerin report makes a number of points about matters in respect of which legislative change should be considered. I will certainly analyse those but I am not in a position to comment on them at present. It will be possible for Garda whistleblowers to report under the terms of the Protected Disclosures Bill, which was recently passed by the House. One can never be absolutely sure with regard to the question the Deputy asked in the context of how organisations deal with whistleblowers. There has been enormous focus on this issue and there is a new awareness about it. As a country we are learning more about it. It is obvious that mistakes have been made. The Garda must make it clear that whistleblowers will be dealt with in an appropriate manner and that suitable systems will be put in place to facilitate this. As the Deputy and I are aware, a number of issues arose recently in the context of Sergeant McCabe's return to work. The interim Garda Commissioner returned to the relevant Oireachtas committee and provided it with further information designed to address concerns about the issues in question. I am of the view that there is a new approach to whistleblowers within the force, but it is clear that the position in this regard will have to be monitored on an ongoing basis by the Garda authorities and me.

Is the Minister in a position to indicate the timeline in respect of the publication of the terms of reference of the forthcoming commission of investigation and the likely establishment date for that body? How long will it be before the commission produces both an interim and a final report?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	29	The terms of reference must be discussed by Cabinet. The potential timeframe involved will be dependent on the completion of the terms of reference and discussions with the person appointed to chair the commission. The commission will be obliged to carry out a great deal of work. The first action we must take is to draw up the terms of reference. I hope to bring the latter to the Dáil before the end of the current session and that the commission will be in a position to begin its work shortly thereafter. The best way to approach this with regard to the code of conduct is to await and take cognisance of the response of the Garda Inspectorate to the matters that emerged in respect of gardaí in the Guerin report.No doubt that is part of what the inspectorate is examining. Its report should be available to me later this year.

Mr. Remy Farrell, senior counsel, heavily criticised the lack of resources given to the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE. He expressed the view that there was never a better time for white collar criminals to get away with it. These were serious comments. Mr. Farrell is one of the most eminent practitioners in tackling this area and seen as a leading expert. His comments, therefore, were alarming. What is the Minister's response?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	31	While the deployment of resources within An Garda Síochána is a matter for the acting Garda Commissioner, I have received a detailed report from her on the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, GBFI, and its functions. As the Deputy will be aware, the acting Commissioner has initiated an immediate comprehensive review and strategic realignment of An Garda Síochána's capacity to deal with emerging and complex crime and this will have an important bearing on how these functions are performed. As the Deputy has rightly noted, a major challenge facing the bureau is the rapidly changing environment in which white collar and other criminals operate, as well as the scale and complexity of some white collar crime investigations. As part of the review process An Garda Síochána is liaising with its international partners and national institutions to identify collaborative approaches. Clearly, international work and co-operation are singularly important in the investigation of these crimes. I am in ongoing contact with the Garda authorities in this regard. The Government moved rapidly to provide new legislation with the Criminal Justice Act 2011 which served to help to speed up investigations into white collar crime. The acting Commissioner is aware that I will give careful consideration to additional proposals from the Garda authorities in this regard. Furthermore, while specialist and major investigations are a matter for the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, many types of white collar crime are investigated by local units within An Garda Síochána with support and advice from the bureau. In addition, the Criminal Assets Bureau has been active in targeting the proceeds of deception, fraud, money laundering, bribery and corruption and other types of criminal activity commonly referred to as white collar crime. In so far as the question referred to liaison with other enforcement bodies, I emphasise that the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation is working closely with other bodies that have enforcement functions, for example, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Central Bank and the Competition Authority. GBFI staff are seconded to the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Competition Authority. There is considerable liaison between the various bodies with responsibilities in this area.

I will go through some of them. He referred to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. The director, Mr. Ian Drennan, had said the office needed five forensic accountants to keep up with the volume of complaints coming in, yet the office has only one. Clearly, this is not up to standard. One quote on forensic computer analysis, a core part of the investigatory functions of the office, struck me in particular. Mr. Farrell said:So if you’re going to commit an elaborate fraud, make sure to password lock your computer, even if it’s a really obvious password. That should buy you at least two to three years.Perhaps this was something of a rhetorical flourish, but the comments were alarming. We need reassurance that resources are being deployed. White collar crime is what brought the State to its knees. Arguably, there are all sorts of issues, but certainly there is a fear, as well as a concern, among the public that white collar crime was part of what led to the collapse of the economy.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	33	Regarding the Deputy's point on the need for greater accountancy skills in the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, such skills are fundamental to the office's ability to deal with the more complex issues and investigations it has been facing since the economic downturn. My colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, has been addressing this issue and working with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure that the posts are filled. This is critical. The Acting Garda Commissioner has told me that the main challenge the Garda is facing is the rapidly changing environment in which fraudsters and white collar criminals operate. This owes to changing technology, criminality and questionable business practices. As the Deputy knows, the Garda is working on a range of cases. I will keep the question of resources under review with the Acting Garda Commissioner.
#PadraigMacLochlainn	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-party	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-dob	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	34	As part of my preparation for this question, I read an article from the respected writer and columnist, Ms Elaine Byrne, which referred to the need for an independent audit of the capacity of the oversight agencies, namely, the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, the ODCE, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, the Central Bank, Revenue, the national bureau of criminal investigation, NBCI, the Competition Authority and so on. These agencies have a joined-up responsibility. Will the Minister consider Ms Byrne's brilliant suggestion of an independent audit of the agencies' collective capacity to tackle white collar crime? In the article, which Ms Byrne wrote last year, she mentioned that we did not have a police-led multi-agency task force approach to this issue. Will the Minister consider a police-led approach so as to join up the dots between the agencies and ensure they are effectively tackling white collar crime as a team? Mr. Remy Farrell, senior counsel, has stated that raising fines will not be enough. The people involved in white collar crime need to see clearly that they will be brought to justice, that resources will be deployed in the investigations and that there will be a joined-up approach. When people start being prosecuted and going to jail, the culture will change. Raising fines will not cut it.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	35	To a degree, the Deputy's points could best be dealt with in the context of the Acting Garda Commissioner's strategic review. By undertaking such a review, she clearly recognises that this issue is an emerging and serious priority. The questions of resources and of engagement with international and local partners are key. The precise mechanisms for that engagement and who should lead it are questions that will arise in the course of the review. I will seek the review's outcome and keep in mind the Deputy's points.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	38	The ex gratia scheme covers the ten Magdalen laundries that were the subject of the McAleese report and two other institutions that were subsequently included, those being, St. Mary's training centre, Stanhope Street, and the House of Mercy training school, Summerhill, Wexford. To date, 754 applications have been received and 357 applicants have received their lump sum payments at a cost of €12.8 million. A further 106 formal offers have been made and letters of provisional assessment on the length of stay in a relevant institution have issued to an additional 35 applicants. A substantial body of work and engagement has already taken place as regards those who are eligible for the scheme. Of the 754 applications received, 71 have been refused because the applicants were not in one of the 12 specified institutions.Some 24 applicants listed An Grianán as the institution in which they spent time. There is an independent appeals process operated by the Office of the Ombudsman. Any woman whose application has been refused is advised that she may appeal against the decision to the Office of the Ombudsman. I understand that five applicants who were in An Grianán have appealed to the Office of the Ombudsman and decisions are awaited in respect of these cases. I am sure the Deputy is familiar with An Grianán but I will put on the record of the House that it was established by the Sisters of Our Lady of Charity in the 1960s specifically for the care of teenagers. Though it was on the same site as the Magdalen laundry, St. Mary's refuge in High Park, Drumcondra, it served a different purpose. There were a number of different institutions on that site. The different nature of An Grianán was recognised by its inclusion in the Residential Institutions Redress Board scheme. All girls admitted to An Grianán were entitled to full compensation for the entire duration of their stay under the Residential Institutions Redress Board scheme.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	39	I want to put on the record of the House two letters I received from ladies who were in An Grianán as I think they show the difficulties unique to that institution. A woman I will refer to as Anne wrote to me on behalf of "An Grianán girls" who were refused the ex gratia scheme. She was 11 years old when she was sent to An Grianán and put in time at the laundry. She did not put in the same amount of time as those residents called "the seniors" because she was a "junior". While other children played with their friends and did homework she was cleaning dirty prison sheets. She received a small sum from the redress board and did not know at the time that another scheme would emerge. She was precluded from availing of the later scheme as she had received money from the redress board. I will call the second lady Maria. She spent three years in An Grianán and worked in the laundry. She says she did the very same work and was treated the same as the seniors. She was made handle filthy sheets and lift, push and pull this bedding. For various reasons, some very personal, she and a number of others applied late to the Residential Institutions Redress Board and are stuck in their situation. Maria said not to include An Grianán would be a great injustice to those refused by the redress board.  I ask that individual cases such as those I have outlined be considered.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	40	I thank Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan for the points she has raised on those cases. I have outlined the different situation relating to An Grianán. One of the women Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan refers to went to the redress board. Does the Deputy expect that people should have access to both the Residential Institutions Redress Board scheme and the Magdalen laundry scheme? It was not intended that people who had already been dealt with through a redress scheme would also be dealt with by this scheme. The Deputy also points out that a person, for whatever reason, did not avail of the redress scheme. If a person falls between two schemes I think the appropriate action is an appeal to the Ombudsman. I am sure the Ombudsman will make a ruling on this matter and I will monitor the Ombudsman's rulings.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	41	The woman in question did appeal to the Ombudsman and I saw the letter received in reply. The Ombudsman said he understood the rationale behind this person's arguments in support of her case and he was sympathetic. However, he was prevented from acting because of the nature of the scheme. This all illustrates that the industrial schools, Magdalen laundries and mother and child homes should all have been included in a single, thorough, independent investigation. At the moment it is a piecemeal process. An Grianán presents a particularly difficult situation because of the other centres on the same site. Women were moved from one place to another on the same site. The woman in the first case I outlined received a sum of money due to the fact that she experienced the industrial school but she has not received anything for the time she spent in the laundry. No scheme is perfect and it is only apparent how these schemes have failed when individual cases are examined. I feel what I have outlined furthers the case for the inclusion of the Magdalen laundries in the inquiry into mother and child homes.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	42	The Taoiseach made the apologies and Mr. Justice Quirke carried out his investigation and submitted recommendations in relation to the Magdalen laundries. Women who were in the Magdalen laundries have applied for benefits under that scheme. This morning, the Government, on my proposal, agreed to the publication of the scheme of a new Bill to provide for services and supports for women who worked in the Magdalen laundries. The purpose of this Bill is to make additional provision for access to health services, the exempting of payments which have been made by the State to these women from means-test criteria in respect of certain State services, for example, the fair deal scheme. It also provides for legal provision for relatives or other appropriate persons to act on behalf of any of the women who do not have the capacity to act on their own behalf. The heads of that legislation were agreed this morning. It is hoped it will be published and enacted soon.  I accept the point that there are some women who fall outside the scheme. In terms of the numbers of women who ended up in industrial schools, as I understand it the cross-over between industrial schools and the Magdalen laundries was 4%. As I said, the scheme is primarily for women who were in the laundries. The relevant institutions under the scheme are named. Obviously, we are in a different situation now with a new inquiry to be initiated following on from the Tuam situation.
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	43	When does the Government intend to sign the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence. While this was signed in 2011 it has not yet been ratified by the Irish Government. This is an important landmark for women. Gender-based violence is at epidemic levels and one in four women in Ireland have experienced domestic violence. Perhaps the Minister will indicate when that convention will be ratified.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	44	I am anxious to see Ireland in a position to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence - the Istanbul convention - as quickly as possible. However, I will only be able to proceed with ratification when we have in place measures that match the requirements of the convention. This will require changes to our domestic legislation. This is a matter of priority for me. To this end, the Department is working on a number of pieces of legislation which will assist in Ireland ratifying the convention. The legislation under development to allow us ratify the convention includes the Government commitment to introduce consolidated and reformed domestic violence legislation to address all aspects of domestic violence, threatened violence and intimidation, in a way that provides protection to victims. This legislation will enable requirements of the convention to be addressed. Substantial progress has been made by the Department in formulating legislative proposals in this regard. It is anticipated that the legislation to transpose the EU victims directive will also implement articles contained in the Istanbul convention. The victims directive is another important part of ensuring we can sign and ratify the convention, the deadline for which is November 2015. I am not suggesting that ratification will not take place until then but that is the actual deadline for Ireland to sign that directive. In addition, Cosc, the national office for the prevention of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, an office of my Department, is working with a substantial number of external Departments and other agencies to identify other possible legislative and administrative issues and solutions necessary before Ireland can ratify the convention. We will have an action plan to enable Ireland to ratify the convention provisions. I have asked for this to be progressed as quickly as possible, having regard to the various obligations of other Departments. I want to assure the Deputy that this is a priority for me. I believe Ireland should sign and ratify the Istanbul convention.There was some concern that our legislative provisions on barring orders might serve as a constitutional impediment to signing. I asked for further advice on that and got some. I hope there will not be an impediment so it will be a question of legislative change as opposed to constitutional change.
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	One of my concerns was that our very old Constitution would prove an impediment to women in terms of their being able to gain access to emergency barring orders. It is quite incredible that constitutional change on property rights would take precedence over the rights of women and their lives, health and children. I hope constitutional change will not be required. What has been said just reaffirms how outdated and outmoded the Constitution is in regard to any progress in society. I am not surprised that there is difficulty implementing the convention given the bedraggled condition of refuge services and services addressing violence against women in this country. Solas Family Resource Centre reports that demand for a refuge place is four times greater than what it can supply. Many refuges around the country have had to beg for money from their local councils because of Government cuts. I would imagine that considerable investment is required if Ireland is to be in a position to sign the convention.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	46	As the Deputy will know, it is not unusual for constitutional sensitivities to be raised when bringing forward important legislation like this. I have said that the most recent advice I have on constitutional difficulties suggests constitutional change may not be required. I am ensuring that we are preparing for the legislation that will be needed in order to sign and ratify the convention. That is certainly my goal. I have said the Bill is a priority. I will be meeting Ministers of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch and Deputy Jan O'Sullivan in regard to some of the issues the Deputy mentioned on housing and refuges. International best thinking suggests that more preventative work and supporting women in their homes is preferable to requiring women to use refuges. I accept that women need to use refuges very often. Having more supported services for women in their local areas is very much preferable, as is the effective use of court sanctions against those who perpetrate violence against women.
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	47	I agree the refuges are a last resort but we need massive structural, cultural and social change in society in order to end violence against women, not only in Ireland but also around the world. This, however, does not absolve the Government of its responsibility to provide emergency services for women who need them. Another requirement under the convention is education in schools. A host of educational changes is required. It is quite incredible that the austerity agenda that has been pursued continually over the past six years has hit women and children in particular, making it more difficult for women to leave violent relationships and gain access to the help they need. On one day last November, there was a census of the services addressing violence against women. It was reported that, on that day alone, 537 women and 311 children were accommodated or in receipt of support. The Minister will have to agree there is a need for massive change in respect of what the Government gives to combat violence against women. It must ratify the convention immediately.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	48	I agree with the Deputy that there is no room for complacency on the issue of violence against women. Some years ago, people might have felt this was less of a problem but evidence suggests it remains a very serious issue, very often associated with drug and alcohol use. Tackling the alcohol issue is necessary, therefore. This morning we saw a very disturbing report on Irish patterns of alcohol consumption. This House must take that report extremely seriously in so far as legislation is a factor.According to the recently published Council of Europe analytical study of the results of monitoring the recommendations in regard to domestic violence and violence against women generally, Ireland is only one of nine member states where the ratio of shelter beds relative to population is higher than 1 per 10,000, that being the recommended rate. Ireland has 1.29 shelter beds per 10,000 population. I make that point in terms of our own particular responses but, clearly, countries vary enormously in terms of how seriously they deal with this issue. I want to assure the Deputy I will deal with it with the utmost seriousness and, whatever legislation is needed, I intend to prioritise it.
#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy	unknown-#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy-party	unknown-#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy-dob	unknown-#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	I very much welcome the fact the Minister has prioritised this matter. The Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality recently held hearings in regard to reviewing the domestic and sexual violence laws. Deputy Anne Ferris and myself are the rapporteurs and we hope to have the report completed before the Dáil goes into recess and to make it available to the Department. This matter was raised by a number of contributors to the hearings, who felt it was imperative that the convention be ratified at the earliest possible opportunity. I join with Deputy Coppinger in urging that this be the case. I welcome the fact the Minister has made a priority of it.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	50	I welcome that work and the committee's report, which I look forward to receiving. I take this opportunity to thank the committee for the focus it has put on this area. It is extremely important that it should be the focus of discussion and debate in this House.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	51	I would like to ask the Minister to deal with the issue of direct provision for those seeking asylum and the unsuitability of continuing with those arrangements in view of the effect on the human beings who are the subject of this, particularly children.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	52	As the Deputy knows, the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, of my Department is responsible for the accommodation of protection applicants in accordance with Government policy in this country. I spent some time recently visiting Mosney and met with many of the residents there as well as staff and management. I acknowledge that the length of time residents spend in direct provision is an issue to be addressed. My immediate priority is to ensure that the factors leading to delays in the processing of cases are dealt with so that protection seekers spend as little time as necessary in direct provision. A key priority for Government is legislative reform aimed at establishing a single application procedure for the investigation of all grounds for protection and any other grounds presented by applicants seeking to remain in the State. I believe such reform would substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements by removing the current multi-layered and sequential processes that people get caught up in, choose to use or have to use. This would provide applicants with a final decision on their application in a more straightforward and timely fashion. I am reviewing the work done to date in respect of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill and will then decide how best to progress the implementation of this priority, in particular with regard to expediting the aspects of the Bill that will lead to the establishment of a single application procedure. With regard to the more specific matters raised by the Deputy, there are 4,353 persons availing of direct provision accommodation in 34 centres, some 38% of whom are children under 18, as the Deputy pointed out. Sixty-eight percent of those residents first claimed international protection in Ireland three or more years ago. I want to put on the record of the House that centres are inspected three times a year, once by an independent company. Obviously, various clinics and support services are made available to residents in direct provision, as I saw in Mosney - for example, young children can attend the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme.The child protection and Garda vetting policies are in place for all centres. It is very important to record the fact that all of these safety policies apply to the centres as much as to anywhere else. There is also a complaints mechanism. I have asked the RIA to highlight the statistics relating to children in direct provision accommodation and ensure as much information on them as possible is given. The Deputy will notice that it is included in its annual report this year.  A child protection policy based on the HSE's Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children is applied. I take the overall point made by the Deputy about the difficulties experienced in spending long periods in direct provision accommodation.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	53	Everyone agrees that decision-making needs to be significantly expedited. I thoroughly agree, but my question deals with existing conditions because the people in direct provision accommodation still face a long period of time in the system. Does the Minister agree that the living conditions enforced on people as a consequence of the current method used are inhuman? As she noted, 38% of those in direct provision accommodation are children. Is it not unsuitable for children to be in such an environment for three to five years in which they will never know a mother or father who cooks a meal because it is not possible to do so in such cases, in which they will never see a parent or an elder sibling go out to work because they are prohibited from doing so, in which there is very little privacy and no right to education resulting in de-skilling and in which there is isolation from society? Does the Minister agree that this is inhuman and should be changed while she is trying to deal with a process to hear people's stories?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	54	I certainly believe we must ensure the best possible standards are applied in the centres in which people are living. I recently visited the centre in Mosney and met the staff and management. I am sure the Deputy has visited some of the centres. Clearly, a lot of work is done to ensure, given the circumstances that apply, that people's needs are met as much as possible. Of course, any provision system is inextricably linked with the surrounding international protection process. As the Deputy is aware, countries vary in how they deal with the challenges posed by the numbers seeking refugee status or asylum and the type of accommodation provided. Clearly, Ireland has taken a decision to provide a certain type of accommodation. The biggest problem, certainly one of the key issues, with the current system is the one I mentioned, namely, the length of time people spend in direct provision accommodation. I want to bring forward legislative reforms aimed at establishing a single application procedure in the investigation of all grounds for protection and any other ground presented by applicants seeking asylum because if we deal with that issue and the length of time involved, it will go a long way towards improving the position.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	55	I will not make any suggestion concerning how some of the horror stories we have heard in recent weeks about our past and how children were treated can be equated with what is happening today. However, I will make the general point that we have learned lessons from the horrors inflicted on people, including women and children, particularly in the past. Taking into account what I said, I put to the Minister that we should realise people are being damaged by living conditions in direct provision accommodation.It has a dehumanising effect on children. Is the Minister aware that in some cases women, in particular, are more vulnerable in these circumstances? Where they might be subject to violence and assault, these conditions exacerbate that. That is what we are told by those who work with those in direct provision and we have to take this seriously. As well as pushing forward on the processing of people seeking refuge, this issue needs to be urgently examined and direct provision changed fundamentally.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	56	I welcome the Minister's reply and I acknowledge that 60,000 people have received citizenship since the Government came into power. Has she considered putting a process in place whereby the people who are waiting longest on their application to be dealt with would be prioritised? Some of the families have children who have been in such accommodation for up to nine years and they have been known nothing else.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	57	Clearly, where is it possible to make the decision Deputy Humphreys referred to, that will be done, but frequently, the reason for the long delays is that individuals have taken a range of judicial reviews and other legal remedies regarding their case, which then prohibits the discretion she suggests. With regard to Deputy Higgins's question, until this year it was difficult to compare how Ireland was doing relative to other countries, but we now have a report by the European Migration Network which examined 23 countries and made recommendations about good practice and dealing as sensitively as possible with people seeking asylum, and we will examine that. I agree with him that women and children are vulnerable in these circumstances. That is why we have inspection regimes and we apply the Children First guidelines. In addition, young children in direct provision have access to the ECCE scheme and attend local primary and secondary schools. However, I reiterate that the time families are spending in direct provision is a key issue that needs to be addressed urgently, and that is why I am considering dealing with it before dealing with the immigration Bill.

I sought statistics regarding those who have accepted compensation under the Magdalen fund and those who have applications pending. However, another few aspects need to be addressed.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	59	In the light of the Government decision to implement the scheme recommended by Judge Quirke, my Department established a dedicated unit of nine officers whose sole task is to assist in the implementation of the scheme. A total of 754 applications have been received to date and 357 applicants have received their lump sum payment so far. The cost is €12.8 million to date. I may have said €10 million earlier. A further 106 formal offers have been made and letters of provisional assessment on the length of stay in a relevant institution have issued to an additional 35 applicants. The remaining cases require further investigation. There is a problem. If the relevant religious congregation has no clear record, as is often the case, my officials will carry out a thorough examination to check whatever records are available to support the claim. Applicants consented to the provision of personal information to my Department by any Department, health or educational institution and the religious congregations for the purpose of verifying their claim. That work is under way and huge support has been offered to individual applicants where no records are available. Every effort is being made to work with other Departments to check where the possibility of a record exists. The applicants have given permission to gather that information together and that will help in order that corroborative information can be used to verify that the applicant was in an institution for a given period.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	60	I acknowledge what has been done to date and the Minister's response when I raised this issue on Leaders' Questions recently. However, there is a problem in that only 50% of the applicants have been dealt with and the pace is slow. Can those who are of advanced years or who have serious health problems be prioritised? Is the Minister satisfied that the Department is in receipt of all the records that are available, not only from the religious orders that were involved but from other sources, and is she satisfied that they have been co-operating? There is also the issue of those who have been refused. Is the Ombudsman their only recourse or is there another way they can be advocated for? I refer to ladies who have mental health issues and are unable to advocate for themselves. They either had a mental health issue that caused them to be placed in an institution or the issue emerged or was exacerbated because they were institutionalised. What is the position in this regard? What is the position of ladies who are in nursing homes and still under the care of a religious order? I acknowledge that the quality of care is excellent. These are outstanding issues, including the pace of the inquiries. I hope those living outside the State and those with serious medical issues can be addressed as a priority.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	61	We have a mechanism to support those who are outside the country to ensure they access medical services, which was agreed by the Government this morning. The issue of vulnerable persons was also included in the heads of the Bill that went to Cabinet earlier to ensure there is legal provision for relatives or other appropriate persons to act on behalf of the women who do not have the capacity to act on their own behalf. That is included in the legislation that will come before the House. That will deal with the issues the Deputy raised regarding women who have mental health difficulties or are vulnerable, or those who are in living in nursing homes and need support. The Deputy also asked whether all the records were being made available. Every effort is being made to get them and all the applicants have agreed that the Department can approach other agencies to get whatever information is available. It is probably difficult to judge precisely how much co-operation there has been but, clearly, every effort is being made to ask for the records and I hope people will co-operate. With regard to appeals, one can appeal to the Ombudsman, but if applicants disagree with the provisional assessment made by the restorative justice implementation team, they can request an internal review of their case. If there are cases the Deputy feels require a further internal review, that will be possible. There are five internal review cases on hand and ten applicants have lodged an appeal with the Ombudsman's office.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	64	Yesterday there was an announcement that the HSE's review of maternity services in the west/north west hospitals group was being shelved and would be subsumed into the national maternity services review. The report into the group's maternity services was near finalisation and it was exposed recently as containing alarming recommendations for the downgrading and potential closure of maternity services across the region.There was no public consultation on the report and public procurement rules were circumvented. Owing to the good work of Senator Marc MacSharry and others, the issue was disclosed and exposed and it contained revelations about proposals concerning maternity services at Portiuncula, about which there are very grave concerns. Services in the north west will be included in the national examination of maternity services. There are approximately 19 public maternity units in Ireland. What is the agenda for the strategy and the review? Will the Government publish the terms of reference and ensure there will be public consultation? Will the Taoiseach confirm that the agenda is not to reduce the number of maternity units to 14, 12, ten or fewer? People consider such a reduction is within the remit of the maternity services strategy. There are key issues regarding the recruitment of obstetricians and midwives. The Government's policy on obstetricians has backfired and we are short of obstetricians throughout the country. There is a need to end the anxiety in places such as south Tipperary, Portlaoise, Portiuncula, Castlebar and Sligo. If the trend is to locate maternity services in acute tertiary centres, where does that leave existing maternity hospitals? It is important that the Taoiseach indicate to the House the terms of reference.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	65	The national examination of maternity services arose from a number of high profile, tragic cases. The Minister was in order in saying we needed to see the highest standards applied in maternity units throughout the country in order to maintain Ireland's reputation as one of the safest countries in the world in which to give birth. For that reason, it is very important that mothers-to-be understand medical care, facilities and safety are of the highest order. Before the recent elections, one would have assumed, according to what I was hearing, that we planned to close maternity services in Letterkenny, Sligo, Mayo and at Portiuncula, leaving the entire west and north west with one centre for the provision of maternity services, Galway hospital.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	67	Obviously, this is not the case. It is in order that there be a national examination of standards in maternity units. There should be public consultation and the terms of reference should be published and they will be. Our intention is to raise standards to the highest quality in order that those giving birth will be comfortable in the knowledge that whatever maternity unit they are in is of the highest standard and integrity. That is the policy and intention.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	68	In February the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, announced the national maternity care strategy, but we have still not seen the terms of reference. At this stage, we are entitled to see them because this is a very important issue. Some people working in maternity services argue that they need immediate intervention by the Government to upgrade staffing levels to provide an obstetrician-led service, more midwives and better conditions. Not long ago, leading practitioners in the field of obstetrics said our maternity hospitals were not safe and did not have safe staffing levels and that those responsible for delivering a safe service were at the end of their tether because of the difficulty in recruiting obstetricians. There are clear issues regarding terms and conditions which have resulted in shortages and great difficulty in recruiting obstetricians and midwives. We need to see the terms of reference and I ask the Taoiseach to come back to me on their publication. Although the strategy which began in February is meant to be complete by October, we have not seen the terms of reference. The Taoiseach has shoved the west and north west into the process because it was too hot a potato for him to deal with.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	69	It is important that the terms of reference be published and they will be. Although people with experience in child health said it would be very dangerous in maternity units during the changeover when staff were taking early retirement from the service, nothing of the kind happened. It is everybody's interests that there be an examination of the standards that apply and that where they are inadequate, they be raised, by whatever means necessary. It is very important, as the Deputy can understand, that women and families be comfortable in the knowledge that they are going to one of the safest places on the planet in which to give birth. It is right and proper, following a number of high profile and tragic cases, that there be an analysis and examination of the standards, efficiencies, staffing and criteria that apply in order that we can keep and be seen to keep Ireland's reputation as one of the safest places in the world in which to give birth.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	70	Some nine mental health consultants in Carlow, Kilkenny and south Tipperary have withdrawn their confidence in the HSE's management of the service. As was revealed on RTE's "This Week" programme, these doctors, in a letter to the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, cited nine suicides by service users between August 2011 and January 2013. They included three suicides by in-patients by the same means, four suicides in home settings and one in a crisis house. The Taoiseach will agree that this is dramatic, disturbing and a very serious development. The doctors in question raised their concerns with the HSE in November 2012 and on a number of subsequent occasions. In their letter to the Minister of State one year ago they repeatedly questioned the safety of governance in the service, saying they felt devalued and ignored in attempting to raise concerns. They called on the Minister of State to intervene to ensure the proper investigation of incidents and that review findings would be properly communicated and appropriate reforms implemented. They were told their concerns had been addressed, but they said they were not informed of the outcomes of reviews of serious incidents. Is the Taoiseach concerned about the number of deaths by suicide of mental health service users in this area? Has he discussed it with the Minister or the Minister of State? What does the Government intend to do about this very disturbing revelation?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	71	Everybody is concerned about the phenomenon of suicide and its tragic consequences in any family for whatever reason. The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, dealt very capably with the report in recent days, both in respect of her advice that she was awaiting two reports to be brought before us and the progress made since A Vision for Change was published in 2006. She has made it clear that the recommendations made in the reports from the Mental Health Commission inspectorate are taken very seriously, as they should be. Today's report highlights the progress made since A Vision for Change was published in 2006. Further work must be done and that is evident. The report states:Although most residences are too large, overall the care and treatment of residents in 24-hour supervised residences has improved since 2005 and it appears that the major factor influencing this improvement has been the move of clinical care to rehabilitation teams and the consequent implementation of individual multidisciplinary care planning.Since 2012 the Government has prioritised the reform of mental health services and allocated an additional €90 million and 1,100 posts, primarily to strengthen the community mental health teams for both adults and children, enhance specialist community mental health services for older people with a mental illness and those with an intellectual disability and forensic mental health services in line with A Vision for Change which everybody accepted.The aim is to move away from the old-style psychiatric hospitals to provide care in a more flexible, community-based mental health service. Everyone agrees with that policy. The HSE's national service plan 2014 is underpinned by a detailed mental health operational plan for the year. This is an issue of which the Minister is very cognisant. Consultation took place with all of the relevant professionals. Where suicide occurs it is a tragedy for those concerned and their immediate families and a matter of serious importance for Government. In respect of the issue of some high support hostels having more than ten beds, the HSE has committed to reviewing the arrangements that apply. For Deputy Adams's information, it is important to note that all residents in 24-hour staffed hostels receive a mental health service and are supported either by a rehabilitation team or an adult community mental health team. Clearly, we have work to do for the future, but the report today from Dr. Susan Finnerty spells out the progress which has been made.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	72	The Taoiseach will know that 500 people take their lives by suicide in the State and 300 do so in the North while upwards of 12,000 people self harm. These are the reported cases. The nine cases I raise with the Taoiseach, however, happened while the people were in the care of the State. Concerns were raised by the clinicians who were in senior positions in the area. Contrary to the Taoiseach's reply, they say they are being ignored. The report on the services was only commissioned six months after the consultants first wrote to the Minister. Every second week, we hear disturbing revelations about our mental health services. There were 80 admissions of children to adult in-patient psychiatric units last year. The Children's Rights Alliance says this represents a clear breach of children's rights. It is not acceptable. We read in The Irish Times today that hundreds of psychiatric patients moved out of mental hospitals in the last few decades are living in totally unsuitable conditions with limited access to health care, which is also contrary to what the Taoiseach said. Is the Taoiseach concerned that this is a crisis that is costing lives while, once again, the mental health services are very much the Cinderella of an already decaying health service? There is a serious matter here. I would like to think the Taoiseach will take on board in his response the fact that these nine citizens took their own lives while in the care of the State and that the consultants working in the area have withdrawn confidence in the governance of the service.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	73	I agree with the Deputy that the mental health service was the Cinderella of the entire service for a long number of years. That is why the current Government ring-fenced particular funding to deal with the mental health service and to make it part of the normal quality of health service provided. As I pointed out to the Deputy, that is why €90 million in additional funding was put in place along with 1,100 posts to staff community consultancy teams and mental health action teams where necessary. As I said, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, has pointed out that there were consultations with everybody, including the professionals, working in the service, to bring about the best response. "A Vision for Change" was a document accepted by everybody. We have made very substantial progress and will continue with it. The nine suicides are tragic and are to be regretted as is every suicide and death that occurs of that nature. Clearly, the question of children who have died in State care is another matter of concern. Obviously, we have the statistics that point to where these tragic events happened also. Nobody wants to see a death occur by suicide or for any other reason where it can possibly be prevented. When one reads the reports, one can see the progress made since 2005 and we would like to continue to build on it through the allocation of appropriate resources in the budget later this year and in the future. As I know from the west of Ireland, the move from the big psychiatric institutions has been beneficial for the vast majority of those who use community-based services now. We want to continue that.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	74	The year 2016 approaches and with it the commemoration of the Easter Rising. While we have many defining moments in our history, the Easter Rising is a particularly significant one. We have had a number of celebrations to date including the strike and Lock-out and Cumann na mBan, which have been very well organised and dignified. The events in store for the anniversaries of the outbreak of the First World War and the Howth gun running operation will also be well organised and dignified. There were a number of venues used for the Easter Rising from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland at St. Stephen's Green to Mount Street Bridge etc. We can agree, however, that the GPO and Moore Street were absolutely vital. They are the place the Rising began and the venue that saw its end. There are great plans in place for the GPO but there are serious difficulties around Moore Street. There was a litany of errors in the past, starting with Dublin City Council right the way through. One of those errors might have seen the whole area obliterated in the late 1990s. That would also have seen the end of the significant street trading tradition in Moore Street. It was only due to the relatives who were able to campaign and bring about the preservation order in 2007 which led to the Minister being able to designate Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street as the commemorative centre and a national monument. There are indications from a number of people that the developer's assessment of the site was inadequate and flawed. That has been proven by things that have been discovered since it was carried out. What is in store for the national monument is that it will be either dwarfed by a massive shopping centre or surrounded by a derelict site. Neither represents a dignified memorial to the men and women of the 1916 Rising. There are also concerns as to who will own, control and finance Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street. The Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, with whom I have had this debate on many occasions, has said he has gone as far as he can on this. Regardless of who is in power in 2016, the onus and responsibility is on those in power now to ensure that the centenary celebration is dignified. As the Minister has gone as far as he can, I ask the Taoiseach to accede to the request from the relatives to meet them personally. The commemoration in 2016 requires the Taoiseach's leadership and direction at this stage.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	75	Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan has had a particular interest in the matter for quite some time and I thank her for her contribution. We are entering a decade of centenary commemorative events which must be inclusive, sensitive and appropriate. That is why the Minister, cross-party personnel and a number of professional historians are concerned to do this in a way which is authentic, fitting and appropriate, based not only on the revolution but on the direction of the country over the next 100 years. For that reason, the Government has made available substantial funding between now and the commemorations for the military archives at McKee Barracks, the restoration of Kilmainham Courthouse, the developments internally in the GPO, access to the Bank of Ireland on College Green and the preservation of Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street. I was down there myself on a number of occasions and it is not the kind of place in its current condition that one would wish to send people to view the location of the eventual surrender of the group from the GPO who sought safety there. The Minister's responsibility and function is in respect of the national monument at Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street. He has some responsibility beyond its curtilage as to where the private property developments may impinge or impact on the foundations in the immediate vicinity. Dublin City Council also has an impact in terms of planning permission conditions etc.On different occasions I met a number of relatives of those who had fought in the GPO and been involved in 1916, but I am not sure to which group the Deputy is referring. I am happy to engage with people. This is a centenary and it is important to get it as right as possible. This is our capital city and Ireland is recognised as one of the first small countries at the beginning of last century to achieve its independence. It is appropriate for those with responsibility in government to make arrangements to ensure the event is comprehensive, sensitive, appropriate and fitting at the commencement of a new century of progress for the people socially, economically, culturally and in other ways. Perhaps the Deputy might let me know the group about which she is talking and I will be happy to meet it with the Minister in due course to see how best we can proceed.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	76	I thank the Taoiseach. I will be in touch with his office to set up the meeting as soon as possible. When he was director of the National Museum of Ireland, Dr. Pat Wallace made these points and it was his considered view that any consent should be mindful of the national historic importance of the Moore Street area, including its laneways and buildings. This was reiterated by the National Museum of Ireland recently when it saw the Moore Street theatre of conflict as the most important historic site in modern Irish history. This is borne out by the Imperial War Museum in London, the representatives of which said, "it is the only city-based 20th century battlefield to survive in all of Europe and possibly the world" and "historically, it is beyond price." It is also borne out by a recent exchange with the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, on legislation dealing with areas surrounding a place of architectural significance. We cannot leave it to a self-appointed private group to look after an area of extreme historical significance. If Deputy Enda Kenny is still Taoiseach in 2016, he will not want to be standing outside one part of the building and surrounded by a derelict site. When he meets relatives, I hope an independent review can be discussed. People are thinking about seeking a judicial review and we could end up with NAMA using State money to defend a developer. There are precedents for undertaking an independent review; we do not want Moore Street to become like Wood Quay when we lost so much of Viking Dublin.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	77	We do not want to get lost in interminable discussions and rows between one sector and another. Work in the other areas mentioned is under way and will I hope be fully completed before 2016. When one exits the side door of the GPO, one can turn left, heading towards Moore Street. However, the gun in place at the Rotunda hospital meant that people leaving the GPO could not move towards Moore Street and The O'Rahilly was shot further up as he moved through the side buildings to 14 to 17 Moore Street. I do not have control over the planning application for anything outside the national monument, but I assume it is compatible with retaining some element of the lanes and the paths of history for those who may wish to travel the journey made by those who left the GPO and went as far as 14 to 17 Moore Street and beyond to the Rotunda hospital where the surrender took place on the footpath. I am happy to engage with people in so far as we can, but I cannot satisfy all demands. This is an issue that must be dealt with and not allowed to drag on interminably. Otherwise, 2016 and many other years will pass and the place will not have changed. We must do something about it and that involves making decisions which may not be fully acceptable to everyone. We must do the best we can in the interests of what happened. This is our capital city and part of our history. We want to build on it for new foundations for the future.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	78	The National Archives Act 1986 places an obligation on Departments of State to preserve records created or received in the course of performing official functions; to seek authorisation from the director of the National Archives prior to the destruction of any of these records; and from among its record holdings, to transfer to the National Archives those records worthy of permanent preservation because of their ongoing value for administrative and historical research purposes when the records are 30 years old in order that they can be made available for public inspection and research use. I am satisfied that there are suitable procedures and facilities in place in my Department for the preservation and archiving of its records and that my Department complies with its legal duties under section 2(2) of the National Archives Act 1986, including as regards the transfer of records that are 30 years old.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	79	Within weeks of entering office, the Taoiseach had begun to engage in a process of playing low partisan politics on the banking issue, particularly the banking inquiry. He came into the House and threw out snide comments that files might have disappeared or been shredded and that nothing could be found. I have since been doing what he perhaps did not do - checking the facts. A freedom of information request established that large numbers of files related to the bank guarantee were in the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance. I have a full list of these files, but when confronted with this information, the Taoiseach refused to withdraw his partisan slur. I have taken up this matter with the person legally charged with the maintenance of records, including those of political staff, in the Department of the Taoiseach, namely, the Secretary General. He is a person of high standing whom the Taoiseach promoted and who was a senior official when the bank guarantee had been agreed to. He has confirmed that, as far as he is concerned, the Department is fully in compliance with its legal responsibilities to keep records. The question is whether the Taoiseach is capable of withdrawing his partisan slur. The records are in place and have not been tampered with in any way. The Taoiseach can say there should be more, but he cannot leave on the record of the House his slur that records might have disappeared. He has already done a bit to prejudge the banking inquiry and at the weekend insisted that he did not want to prejudge anything. If this is true, surely he will confirm that, contrary to he said before, there is no evidence that records are missing. I have the correspondence with the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach which confirms that what the Taoiseach said was not true.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	80	I do not engage in low partisan politics. We set up a non-partisan, all-party Oireachtas committee to deal with the banking inquiry. When it starts its work, it will get down to No. 119 and many of the items listed are inconsequential. They were the days leading up to the most momentous economic decision in the history of the State and the records have all been released under freedom of information legislation. I would have expected, at a time when the country was entering into a difficult economic recession, that there would have been regular meetings about the seriousness of the matter, but that was not the case. There is a faxed cover sheet regarding a Iris Oifigiúil notice, No. 87; an Iris Oifigiúil notice regarding the NTMA delegation of functions order; a letter from the Clerk of the Seanad; a memorandum for the Government and a submission slip regarding a memo, No. 79.These things are available under the Department's system for examination by the Oireachtas committee and I am sure it will go through each of them. There are notes of a telephone call by the Taoiseach with the then British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, points for telephone discussion with the Scottish First Minister, Alex Salmond, an e-mail from the Office of the Attorney General including a letter to the Taoiseach, and so on. These are all elements of what is on file. I had expected that when it came to the most serious economic catastrophe that ever befell our country, I would have access to whatever discussions took place with banks or bank officials who were calling in to Government buildings for discussions with the Taoiseach and so on. There is a note of a telephone call between the Secretary General and the general manager of DEPFA Bank. In that sense, I found that of all the information I read, most of the notes are completely inconsequential. There was one letter of substance, which I think Deputy Martin has in his possession.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	81	Again, the Taoiseach has been and is still being very selective. There are some very consequential documents in this, such as Government memos. There is a full list there - well over 150 at this stage - of documents obtained under the freedom of information provisions, which proves there are records in the Taoiseach's Department. The Taoiseach said records had been disappeared. He used the word "shredded". That was a slur on the previous Taoiseach. There is no other way of putting it.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	87	There are records, very substantial records, in the Taoiseach's Department and the reply from the Secretary General is very clear. Martin Fraser's letter stated: As I said in my letter of November 22nd, documentation relating to the bank guarantee is held in this Department. That documentation was listed in the Schedule provided under the Freedom of Information Act, a copy of which I enclose in my letter. I can confirm that this documentation is still retained in this Department and that to the best of my knowledge, the Department is in compliance with its obligations under the National Archives Act.There was no attempt to disappear any records. There was no attempt to shred any records and the Taoiseach should be man enough to accept that that is the case. He should withdraw his assertion. Will he do that?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	88	Before the Taoiseach responds, the question was to ask the Taoiseach if he was satisfied that his Department had maintained its records in accordance with its legal duties under section 2(2) of the National Archives Act. Has that question been answered fully?

We are moving on to Question No. 2, in the name of Deputy Adams.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	95	I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive, together. The Cabinet sub-committee on social policy has met on two occasions since the Christmas recess, on 24 February 2014 and 28 April 2014. It will meet again next Monday.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	96	I have been trying to ascertain what this Cabinet sub-committee on social policy does. It covers a big range of issues that have a direct impact on citizens, but I would like to touch on three of these issues, two in some detail. These concern the cut in respite care and the effect this has had on thousands of families, the crisis in housing, and the mobility allowance scheme and motorised transport grants. Surely a committee looking at social policy would consider mobility allowance and motorised transport grants. Let me sketch the history of this issue. Last February, the Government scrapped the mobility allowance scheme and the motorised transport grant, affecting 5,000 citizens and their families. The Ombudsman advised that these two schemes were in breach of the Equal Status Act and the Disability Act because some citizens were excluded from them - people who were over 66 years of age. Instead of setting social policy and bringing all of those citizens into the loop so that they could be treated on the basis of equality and be in compliance with the law, the Government scrapped the schemes, actively discriminating instead of fixing the problem. The Minister explained by saying that if the Government kept the scheme going as it existed, it would be open to everyone over 65 who was defined as having a disability within the Disability Act, and it could not afford that. George Orwell could not have got it better than that: it could be open to everyone over 65 who had a disability. Surely that was what it was supposed to be about. One presumes social policy is about being socially just and fair. I want some idea of what the committee on social policy has done about this issue. When I asked about this last week, the Taoiseach told me it would be addressed through the health (transport support) Bill, but that Bill is not expected to appear before the end of this year. For all of this time, these citizens - people who need mobility support or who are disabled in some way - have been left with no support. We sit up all night to sort out issues for bankers, but surely the Government should be bringing in this legislation quickly. Has the committee given any consideration to speeding up the processes around the health (transport support) Bill, which the Taoiseach says will resolve these problems? There has been a savage cut of €325, a 19% reduction from the previous rate, in the respite care grant. I know from dealing with these issues on the ground that this has made things dreadfully difficult for families caring for loved ones. There have been other cuts in respite services and home help hours also. We are told that the PRSI yield for the Department of Social Protection is €100 million ahead of projections. This means the Minister has flexibility. I call on the Taoiseach to do the right thing by carers. Return to them the €325 that was taken from them. This would cost €28 million, just one-quarter of the PRSI yield, and it would help 85,000 people who are caring for a relative with a serious illness or disability. I may get a chance to speak about the issue of housing, but I just want the Taoiseach to deal with those two issues first.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	97	Sorry; the question was about whether the Cabinet sub-committee on social policy had met since Christmas. We are now straying into a whole new area. It is very difficult to be in this Chair and to try to chair matters positively and correctly. I do not mean to cut Deputies off, but the Deputy will understand my position. If he asks whether the committee has met and the answer is "Yes," he cannot start talking about what the committee discussed because, as we know, we cannot discuss what goes on at Cabinet sub-committees. If the Taoiseach wishes to reply, he may, but the Deputy must understand my position.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	98	I realise the constraints on the Chair. As I said to Deputy Adams, the committee met on two occasions and will meet again next week. He may well ask what the committee on social policy does. It ensures there is a focus on the fairness objectives and social policy priorities in the programme for national recovery. It assesses and presents for Government's consideration options or alternative measures to achieve better outcomes or to address barriers to achieving social policy priorities. It also guides the development and the management of a number of cross-departmental strategies and responses in the social policy area, considers the impact of programmes and policy measures on disadvantaged or vulnerable groups, including those groups that are emerging as being vulnerable, and proposes alternative or new approaches as necessary. It prioritises service delivery, especially through cross-departmental and agency action. As I said last week, the legislation to be introduced will deal with the question of the motorised transport grant. The Deputy may well ask what sort of progress is being made through the social policy committee.Clearly, the primary weekly social welfare rates have been maintained. We have put in place a really proactive approach to giving people on the live register the opportunity to get into the world of work. No doubt Deputy Adams will be interested in the news from the chief executive of PayPal that 68 people from Dundalk were taken off the live register and are now working in that plant and are participants in confidence-building measures, which is where we need to be.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	99	Which scheme does that come under?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	100	A referendum was held on children's rights, and child protection has been strengthened through the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 and the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012. The new Child and Family Agency was established. The national implementation framework and a value for money and policy review of the disability services programme was published. There were discussions about the changes necessary to have an evolving transport scheme. There was a €30 million investment in a new area-based childhood programme, which included €15 million from Atlantic Philanthropies. A school patronage survey was completed in 43 areas and the new junior cycle reform programme was launched. We have increased the time spent on literacy and numeracy skills in all primary schools and developed a new comprehensive action plan on bullying. We have also ended the practice of sending 16 year olds to St. Patrick's Institution. A total of 48,575 applicants were granted certificates of Irish naturalisation at an appropriate and formal ceremony. New supervised community service programmes commenced and a strategic review of penal policy was published. The national positive ageing strategy was published, as was the national carers' strategy. The Pathways to Work programme and the Action Plan for Jobs were launched. We introduced a package of measures to address alcohol misuse, so prevalent in today's newspapers, arising from the report of the substance misuse strategy group. We also published the implementation plan for the State's response to homelessness up to December 2016, a particular problem at present. As I understand it, 154 people were sleeping on the streets of this city on one night last week. The priorities for the rest of 2014 include advancing the work so that we can have a published report on a strategy for dementia. We will also progress the Children First Bill through the Dáil. We intend to progress the implementation of early actions in the national literacy strategy and advance the development of a new integration strategy. We will publish quarterly reviews on the State's response to homelessness, with particular reference to this city. We will also progress commitments in the programme for Government on school empowerment. While I am on my feet I should say that I heard Deputy Adams waxing eloquent yesterday morning about the wonders that will come the way of the nation should the people give Sinn Féin the opportunity to govern. I note that while Deputy Adams accepts that working families have shouldered an enormous burden and challenge in the last while, he wants to introduce a new 48% rate of income tax which would bring the top effective rate of tax for PAYE workers to 59% and to 62% for self-employed people. He also proposes to abolish the marginal rate of 41% tax relief on pensions, which would hit thousands of middle-income earners. Teachers, nurses and gardaí earning €40,000 would be hit with an €800 per annum pay cut. He wants to ramp up the inheritance tax so that a son or daughter inheriting a family home in Dundalk or the Louth area worth €300,000 would have to pay approximately €20,000 more in inheritance tax. Deputy Adams also proposes to increase employer's PRSI to 15.75%, which would slap additional labour costs on employers, costing thousands of jobs and inward investment. When Deputy Adams starts to throw around the material, he should be sure to know the pile from whence he is taking it. His own proposals for social policy would have a devastating impact on hundreds of thousands of hard-working people all over this country.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	105	First, the Taoiseach should not misquote Sinn Féin policy, but if it is a choice between taking carer's allowance from 325 people and taxing those who are earning €100,000, then there is no choice; it is a no-brainer for anybody with any sense of social justice whatsoever. This Government has made the choice to take the mobility allowance from citizens who need help to move about the place. What this Government is doing is a disgrace - it protects the rich, the elites, the bankers and the developers, and it does not look after citizens who are dependent upon the State.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	106	If I am reading it correctly, Sinn Féin policy is to increase income tax to 59% for PAYE workers and 62% for self-employed people.

Is that correct?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	115	Yes, twice.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	116	If I ask the Taoiseach what happened at those meetings I will be ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle, so I will ask my question in a different way. What is the point of the Cabinet sub-committee on social policy when the whole thrust of the Government's economic and social policies is anti-social in terms of its effect on working people and poor people as well as middle and lower income earners? The whole thrust of what the Government has done for three years in terms of austerity has had a huge anti-social effect. Those aged under 25, by the way, would laugh at the Taoiseach's assertion that core social welfare payments have not been hit, not to mention those people who are threatened with the loss of their unemployment benefits if they do not take part in forced labour schemes - that is, internships with big businesses for virtually no pay. It is quite incredible. The Taoiseach told us some time ago that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government was a member of the sub-committee on social policy. How does that square with the same Minister being responsible for heaping extra taxes on people's homes and, if the Government gets away with it - although I am confident that people will stand up and fight - the imposition, according to the Government's figures, of a charge of €580 for the water delivered to their homes? How does that sit with a Cabinet committee on social policy which, one would presume, aims to ensure that the policies emanating from the Government are in the interests of ordinary people in society and not anti-social in their effects, such as those being imposed by members of that same committee as part of the Government?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	117	I thank Deputy Higgins for his comments. I do not think it is in any way anti-social to call people who find themselves on the live register to discussions about what it is that they might like to do, about their ambitions, their competencies and their experience in order to try to give them an opportunity to get into the world of work. As I pointed out to Deputy Adams, more than 60 people in the Dundalk area have come off the live register and are now working with PayPal. They measure up to the standards that are required in terms of their ability to do a very good job. We have seen that happening in so many other areas. People are working not just for companies from abroad that have invested here but also for indigenous companies run by self-employed people, and some are forming their own companies. I know from his background that Deputy Higgins understands it is important that work is seen to pay and that people are able to reap the rewards of their work.The old chicken-and-egg situation whereby if one does not have a job, one cannot gain experience and if one does not have experience, one cannot get a job is one of the reasons JobBridge - which came about as a result of discussions between the Department of Social Protection and private enterprise - was introduced. While I have heard about instances where attempts were made to abuse JobBridge, the majority of young graduates with whom I have spoken informed me that they enjoyed the experience of working for a company or a business. Those individuals were either kept on, proceeded to establish businesses themselves or used the experience as a route to move elsewhere. Availing of places on JobBridge was better for them than languishing on the live register with no hope, initiative or motivation in the context of making the contribution which everyone knows they are capable of making. That is important. It must be also remembered that the Tús scheme has given a new sense of pride and initiative to many people who live in small rural areas. The European Commission and various European agencies produce reports on a regular basis. The best information available, based on the maximum subvention for Irish Water, shows an average charge of €60 per quarter. Obviously, the Deputy will have seen the potential of this in the context of job creation, the provision of proper infrastructure throughout the country and securing our future. We are aware that water is becoming a source of serious contention between the governments of different countries. In light of our geographical location, we have access to large amounts of this previous resource and we must conserve it for our people, businesses, etc., in the best way possible. Matters have moved in a progressive fashion in recent years. Deputy Higgins is well aware that between 1,000 and 1,200 jobs are being created in the private sector every week. That is very good. These figures are not mere statistics, they relate to young men and women who are being given the opportunity to go to work. We must build on what has been already done in this regard. I welcome the reports which emerged earlier today and which show the beginnings of an increase in house building in the private sector. Clearly, this will not be sufficient to meet our needs.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	118	It is the public sector in which I am interested.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	119	I was coming to that. We have returned to a point where there is a process of direct financing of local authority builds. However, recent reports from the NESC, etc., highlight that this model will not be sustainable into the future. We must find new ways of proceeding. In addition, those in private sector construction must step up to the mark. As Deputy Higgins is well aware, 90,000 houses were built annually during the height of the so-called boom. Last year, just under 9,000 houses were built. That represents an enormous collapse. We need to increase the number again and build 25,000 or 30,000 houses annually for the next number of years. It is hoped that the social housing innovation introduced and the construction stimulus and new planning legislation being brought forward by the Government will facilitate the type of activity required to invigorate the economy so that people will be able to obtain jobs and have a few euro to spend. The latter helps retail businesses in the localities in which developments are taking place. That to which I refer is of benefit but it is clear that people must be able to feel the change that is taking place, both in their pockets and in their daily lives. This is not happening yet. Things have improved and Dublin has felt the impact of this in a much bigger way than other places. That improvement must be filtered out to the different regions. The Government spent €500 million on extending fibre-optic cable to so many towns and villages in order that those who live there might have access to proper broadband services with sufficient speed to allow them to do their business. There is also the continuation of the stimulus package for bundles of schools, the development at Grangegorman in Dublin and the completion of sections of motorways that were left unfinished and other major projects of that nature. This is all part of the economic stimulus we need but we clearly have quite a distance to go. However, we have come a long way in three years and the challenges we have faced have been onerous for many people. Obviously, I disagree with Deputy Adams. We want hard-working families to be rewarded for the challenges in question. We also want those on the live register to have the incentive to find new jobs from which they will obtain incomes that will put them in a better place than they have been to date. That is all part of the challenge. Deputy Higgins has a different set of views and priority than those in government. Our priority is to fix the public finances and get the country back to work.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	120	We are all in favour of jobs but the Cabinet sub-committee on social policy does not have responsibility for jobs. There is another sub-committee with responsibility in that regard. Perhaps the Taoiseach will clarify the position but I was of the view that the work of the sub-committee on social policy relates to addressing poverty and social inequality and ensuring that all citizens will have the basic things they need to live a dignified and civilised existence. The evidence clearly points to the fact that both the sub-committee and the Government are failing disastrously in the context of dealing with poverty reduction, social equality and providing for the basic needs of our citizens in order that they might live a dignified and civilised existence. All of the indicators are going in the wrong direction. I appeal to the Taoiseach to read the recently published and very detailed Steps Towards a Fairer Future: Securing Economic Development, Social Equity and Sustainability by Social Justice Ireland, which states that, from the point of view of social equality and poverty, everything is going in the wrong direction. For example, it indicates that between 2010 and 2011 the at risk of poverty rate increased from 14.7% to 16%, the deprivation rate increased from 22.6% to 24.5% and the rate of consistent poverty increased from 6.3% to 6.9%. The position in respect of housing - the most basic need in order to function within society - was similar and now we have an unprecedented crisis in the areas of homelessness and housing. Matters are worsening on a daily basis. It is possible to have a working poor and, as is the case, massive numbers of people who are unemployed - and to seek to create jobs on that basis - while levels of poverty and inequality continue to increase. That is what is happening. The job of the sub-committee on social policy is to deal with those issues rather than telling us about the creation of 60 new jobs - which we all welcome - in Dundalk. The question that arises relates to whether we are addressing poverty and inequality and the answer is we are not. The situation has become worse under this Government and the indicators are moving in the wrong direction.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	122	Is the sub-committee not failing in its duty? The indicators of squalor and poverty in the 19th and early 20th centuries were lack of access to secure, decent and appropriate housing and clean water, resulting in disease, high infant mortality rates and so forth. That is the direction in which we are currently heading as a result of the fact that the Government is removing the basic and universal right to an affordable and secure roof over one's head and access to clean water. A lack of these basic rights inevitably gives rise to poverty, squalor and social inequality. The Government must refocus its efforts. If the sub-committee is to be taken seriously rather than, as appears to be the case, being seen as mere window-dressing, it must address the issues to which I refer. It is utterly failing to do so at present.

They now have permanent jobs and move on from being on the social welfare or social protection list. Deputy Boyd Barrett seems to think this is where they should be left.

That has changed now. The new Intreo offices introduced by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, bring about a situation whereby these people are spoken to, their ambitions are talked about and they are motivated and given the incentive and opportunity to have a job. If Deputy Boyd Barrett's philosophy on poverty and inequality is to leave people where they were, that is, on the live register, then I profoundly disagree with him in that sense.

It is not about languishing on live register lists; it is about being given the opportunity, incentive and motivation to upskill, retrain and move on to where jobs are being created. Progress has been made. Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to the indicators going in the wrong direction. Interest rates have gone down from 15% to 2.69%.

It is not possible to do that unless we get them to have the opportunity to have work and not be cast aside, as they were for years, on a disillusioned list of unemployed people and seen as having no contribution to make other than draw the soft money. That has changed. These people want to contribute and be given the opportunity, incentive and motivation actually to do that. Deputy Boyd Barrett asked about the indicators of squalor. They include poor housing and poor water. How does Deputy Boyd Barrett think we will deal with that? We are investing €300 million per year in water services at the moment. It costs €1.2 billion to produce that water and 40% of it is leaking away into the ground. Does Deputy Boyd Barrett think it is fine to leave that the way it is?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	149	We cannot do it without setting up an entity that can borrow off the Government balance sheets to provide the infrastructure and have the facility for everyone. I agree that this is a problem for everyone. Surely in 2014 we should be able to provide good quality, comfortable, warm and affordable housing for people. As I have said, we went from 90,000 houses to 8,000 houses. Why is it that when Government puts up money for 1,800 boarded-up units in this city, to which families can be allocated, each entire unit has to be scoured out and cleaned out completely, as if starting from afresh, when a good competent contractor could move in and agree to have a given unit in shipshape comfortable, warm, dry condition and affordable for a family? They should not be leaving them for nine or ten months after a unit is renovated and fixed up without awarding them to a family.

These people should be told in advance that the will get No. 7 or No. 12 or whatever it is. I hear all of these arguments but we have 100,000 people on the live register who have experience in the building and contracting business. These are good competent people. That is where we need to be and it is not only a matter of social housing.

We are now monitoring the progress on the 1,800 units to be fixed. However, we also need the private sector to step up to the mark.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	155	They were well able to build 80,000 houses in the so-called boom years and had people buying them over the telephone ten or 12 at a time. Now we need to be able to provide proper, affordable, good quality, warm, comfortable houses for families who need them and that is the focus of Government. This is an indicator of progress as distinct from squalor, as pointed out by Deputy Boyd Barrett.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	156	I put to the Taoiseach that the fact that the Cabinet sub-committee on social policy has met only twice says it all in terms of the lack of urgency in respect of some critical social issues. Will it be meeting shortly to initiate the restoration of the mobility allowance? The Taoiseach referred to vacant houses and the social housing problem. I know of a young woman with children. They have three weeks to go before they will be evicted because the house is being sold. They cannot rent a house because the rent allowance is not enough or landlords will not take the rent allowance or because the cuts in rent allowance and the limiting of the allowance has rendered it almost irrelevant for many people in these situations. I have seen her genuine anxiety because she will not have a roof to put over her children's heads in three weeks time. That sums it up. There is a lack of hands-on urgency from the Government, the Taoiseach and the social policy sub-committee. It should meet far more often. There is no point in the Taoiseach coming to the Chamber and shouting to everyone here about vacant houses. What the Government should have done during the past two years is brought in the county and city managers and put it to them that they should change their approach. There are thousands of houses throughout the country vacant and idle. They could be occupied very quickly but this is simply not happening. I pass by them every week. Houses which have not been allocated are boarded up for months and even longer. The social housing issue is a real crisis for many people. The Government has allowed it to get worse and worse without any urgent, hands-on intervention that would significantly change the story for many families. How many times does the Taoiseach envisage the social policy committee meeting in the latter part of this year? Will its agenda entail the re-establishment of regeneration initiatives throughout the country, especially in areas with significant disadvantage and where in the past good initiatives were undertaken through RAPID programmes and so on? The entire area of social policy lacks ministerial responsibility now because of the way the Taoiseach restructured the Government. There is no real ministerial responsibility in many communities in terms of regeneration or rooting out the underlying causes of crime as well as a range of other issues, including poor school attendance, better health outcomes and so on. I put it to the Taoiseach that the Cabinet committee on social policy is not meeting often enough and certainly its output is not effective in terms of tackling some of the critical social policy areas that we are dealing with at the moment.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	157	I have read out the list of issues dealt with by the social policy sub-committee, including the discussions that took place about the national ageing strategy, the national carers strategy, the substance misuse strategy group and the question of homelessness and housing. It is very distressing to hear of young mothers, young couples, single people or whoever, especially if children are involved, who have notice to quit their accommodation, inadequate though it might be in the first place, and who must go somewhere where they do not even have an option. I know the pressure that is on in Dublin and the greater Dublin region. It is being exacerbated by population change, rising costs and so on.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	158	It is everywhere, not only in Dublin.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	159	That is why NAMA has offered 4,000 units, although only 2,000 have been taken up. Fully 5,000 homes will be added to the social housing stock his year because the Government has a Minister of State with responsibility for housing. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, is working exceptionally hard right across the spectrum in this area. The position is quite distressing although we have allocated, through public funding, serious money.The national homeless budget this year will be maintained at €45 million. Can somebody explain to me why we have 154 people sleeping on the streets in this city this week? There are quite a number of agencies dealing with this. They will be in before the social committee, as will the city manager, next Monday. If this is an emergency, why is it that somebody cannot say, "You are sleeping in doorway X here; I have got a bed for you for the night"? I know that there are people with particular personal problems that make it very difficult for this to be achieved, but we should not in 2014 have a situation where 154 people, according to some of the agencies, are sleeping on the streets in this city on a nightly basis when we are allocating €45 million for the purpose of dealing with the homeless. The Deputy can take it from me that I will bring a new focus to this. I am completely unhappy with this situation where I hear constantly that these numbers are increasing on a regular basis. Now, I do not know all of the details of the different sectors, whether they are because landlords say people have to move out because they are getting better prices for their rent or because of personal circumstances or because it may be psychiatric problems or medical problems or whatever. The fact of the matter is, if these are emergencies, then in 2014 we have to be able to deal with them. I do not see why if, as has happened, even in the-----

The Deputy had flooding down in his own city in Cork and other places around the country. Emergency responses were had very quickly, but we should not have somebody sleeping in a doorway in this city - 154 of them on any night - in June 2014. I intend to see that this social sub-committee and the agencies for which we are paying €45 million of taxpayers' money respond in kind here and that these are treated as an emergency situation and that we get on with the building of social housing - the NAMA units, the renovation of those boarded-up units and get the private sector to measure up here in terms of what we know it can do in terms of provision of adequate, affordable, warm, comfortable housing for people. This is an issue and it is one that I intend to take very seriously through this sub-committee.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	162	This questions and answers session on the Cabinet sub-committee on social policy has been instructive. It is the stark core on which our discussion should be, particularly with the upcoming October budget. The inequality is measurable. It is not an opinion or impression. Rather, it is data based. I hope the Taoiseach got the chance to read Fr. Peter McVerry's opinion or analysis piece last Friday, the short opening sentences of which outlined the facts. Mr. Wilbur Ross made a profit of €500 million on an investment of €290 million in Bank of Ireland, which was a one-way bet only for profit. I told the Taoiseach before the bank's capitalisation not to sell 35% of half the country's banking infrastructure to a group of people for €1.1 billion. It was unwise. Regarding how the country's social fabric stands, the Taoiseach mentioned 68 jobs in Dundalk. That is great and we are all in favour of jobs, including Deputy Boyd Barrett, but thousands of families are being pushed to the extreme situation of having their homes possessed by banks. Banks are behaving appallingly and are out of control. They should stop what they are doing. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has provided statistics and called for courage and leadership. Distributive economics have been pointed out in data-based research by Professor Joseph Stiglitz in his book on inequality that I gave to the Taoiseach before Christmas and by Professor Thomas Piketty in his book, Capital in the Twenty-First Century. They are not celebrity economists. They are serious people who have undertaken data-based research to show the situation without emotion. It is a fact that the distribution of income and wealth in our society has become grossly unequal. The way of dealing with this situation is called social policy. The stock market has been totally recovered since before-----

He had a wrong impression of the 1.5 million people of our 4.5 million population whose lives had been turned inside out.

I will summarise those as examining fairness, options and so on. I gave the Taoiseach three simple options for dealing with homelessness, citizens who had lost their mobility grants and citizens who had lost their carer's respite grants, but he went on a rant and did not deal with my suggestions. I will make another suggestion - appoint Fr. Peter McVerry as Minister for the homeless.

He stands up and grandstands on these issues, but I have a statement that I want to read to him because it is his. It was made following the National Economic and Social Council, NESC's report on jobless households. As the Taoiseach knows, the NESC works under the aegis of his Department. According to its report, 23% of households are jobless, those being, households in which no one is employed or where the total working time by those able to work amounts to less than 20% of their available working time. This level is higher than the EU average. I commend the Taoiseach's statement. I do not know whether he wrote it, but it was issued. He stated:If this situation is not addressed it will perpetuate the cycle of joblessness, hopelessness and welfare dependency. The sharp increase in jobless households, from an already high level, will have lasting economic and social consequences for generations to come unless we have specific, targeted solutions.I agree completely. The social policy committee might bend its will to examining what is fair, namely, to tax those who can pay the most and protect those who need the State's protection. I commend this approach to the Taoiseach.

I actually had a brief conversation with Fr. McVerry recently. It is my intention to call to him when I get an opportunity to discuss some real facts down there.

I am glad progress has been made, though it is not happening fast enough. We must keep the pressure on. I note that the personnel from the IMF are leaving Ireland, having been based here for the past three years. They say there is a sense of normalisation. A headline in today's newspaper says we spend €50 million on alcoholic drinks every week. There is an unacceptable level of dependency on alcoholic drink and it is a creator of inequality in Ireland.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	202	I thank Deputy Gerry Adams for his comments on homelessness. A few years ago €50 million for homelessness and a further €30 million for facilities for homeless people would have been thought sufficient to deal with the problem. There are issues relating to homelessness that must be addressed by the sub-committee. The city manager will address the sub-committee shortly, as will different agencies. The programme for the prevention of homelessness has been agreed between the Department of Social Protection, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, the four Dublin local authorities and Threshold, with the support of the Dublin Simon Community and Focus Ireland. This ensures there will be a speedy response to prevent homelessness, particularly in Dublin, in cases of families with one or more children that are in receipt of rent supplement, as described by Deputy Mathews. Such situations mostly arise when a landlord increases rent beyond the rent supplement limits. The Department staff dealing with this issue will have evidence from Threshold showing temporary rent increases in particular areas and in individual cases. Threshold will make recommendations when it considers that all other avenues have been exhausted for a particular family's housing needs. The Department will consider the recommendations using its discretion under the social welfare code while the local authority and Threshold pursue alternative options on housing. This continues for 13 weeks and may do so for a further 13 weeks. The suggestions made by the Deputy are worthy of consideration and I will see that they are discussed by the social policy sub-committee. I hope real progress can be made in this area.

I wondered to myself, "Has this man been in power for the past three years?".

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	209	The Taoiseach shows tendencies similar to one of his predecessors, the former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern. I often argued with him across the floor and he suffered regular bouts of amnesia as he described the terrible problems in society to the House. He made no connection between these problems and the fact that he had been in charge for years. Will the Taoiseach please remind himself of his position as leader of this country? It is his responsibility if there is a huge level of homelessness, which there is. I had hoped we would address the matter of infrastructure, because the biggest infrastructural need is the need for new homes. The Taoiseach spoke a great deal on this topic but in answer to the wrong question. I will now shame the Taoiseach. Is he aware that 6,000 local authority homes were built in 1973 and 8,700 in 1975? He is responsible for the building of only a few hundred. Is it any wonder there is a crisis?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	210	I accept responsibility for what I must do. Some €80 million has been allocated to address homelessness this year. This consists of €50 million, supplemented by a further €30 million for facilities and support for the homeless. Of course we must return to the practice of providing sufficient social housing to meet needs, but a process must be followed. No matter what one does, blocks, concrete, foundations, sites, planning permission and so on must be in place before houses can be built for the people who need them. This is the focus of the Government as part of the stimulus for construction and new planning legislation that is on its way. I do not doubt Deputy Higgins will have very valid comments to make on the legislation when it comes before the House.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	213	The education section of the programme for Government committed to the establishment of "a multi-campus technical university in the south-east". I presume this should say "technological university". This relates to commitments given before the last election regarding a new university in Waterford. The programme for Government states "We will explore the establishment of a multi-campus technical university in the south east". Will the Taoiseach give an update on the progress of this commitment? When can we expect the promised legislation? On the issue of universal primary care, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Alex White, said the legislation currently in the House relating to free GP care for children under six years of age had been pushed back until autumn. This is yet another delay. The Taoiseach must examine the entire page of commitments made on primary care in the programme for Government because it bears no relationship to reality any more. When will the universal primary care Bill be passed? It says in the programme for Government that universal primary care will be introduced in phases so that additional doctors, nurses and other primary care professionals can be recruited. It says that during the term of the Government, GP training places will be increased and GPs will be encouraged to defer retirement and will be recruited from abroad. The plan was to increase the number of practice nurses so that care could be delegated to nurses where appropriate. Access to primary care without fees was to be extended in the first year to claimants of free drugs under the long-term illness scheme at a cost of €17 million. Access to primary care without fees was to be extended in the second year to claimants of free drugs under the high-tech drugs scheme at a cost of €15 million. Access to subsidised care was to be extended to all in the following phase. The programme goes on and on. A new GP contract was to provide incentives to GPs to care more intensively for patients with chronic illnesses. Registration of primary care teams was to be compulsory. This all now reads as though it came from fantasy land. Will any of this be implemented? When can we expect the universal primary care Bill, which is to govern all of this? What of the ring-fenced funding that was promised for additional psychologists and counsellors?It seems that what is required are concrete proposals to address these issues with which we have been living now for the past three and a half years.  Given the Taoiseach's commitment to a Cabinet reshuffle, when does he expect to bring before the House a resolution for the appointment of Ministers to new portfolios? What is the timeline in terms of that proposition being brought before the House?

I take the Deputy's point about a comprehensive response to the nine or ten issues he raised in relation to the programme for Government. I am glad to be able to inform the Deputy that progress is being made on the technological university legislation. I understand there is now much greater progress between Waterford and Carlow institutes of technology, which is to be welcomed because this is where the process commenced following the closure a number of years ago of TalkTalk. A number of entities in Dublin are moving ahead with lodging their formal applications and discussions between Tralee and Cork institutes of technology and Letterkenny, Sligo and the Galway-Mayo institutes of technology are ongoing. The process is moving ahead although, perhaps, not as fast as one would wish. The criteria in this regard are set very high, as they must be because what we do not want at the end of this process is inferior entities. I will seek more up to date information for the Deputy but I can confirm that progress is being made.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	219	Tá ceist agam faoi chlár an Rialtais agus ceist eile agam faoi na mother and baby homes. The programme for Government in the context of public sector reform commits to transparency and accountability. It states that where secrecy and unaccountability, waste and extravagance, are identified the Government will pin down accountability for results at all levels of the public service from Ministers downwards. Yesterday, the West-North West Hospitals Group announced it had suspended its review into maternity services. This follows on from the resignation as chairperson of the hospitals group of Mr. Noel Daly, a founder and shareholder of a private health consultancy, who was appointed by the Minister for Health. It was Mr. Daly's firm that was contracted to carry out the review of maternity services. In keeping with the commitment of the programme for Government in terms of accountability for results at every level from Ministers down, I have raised this issue with the Taoiseach on numerous occasions, whose response was that the Minister would make a statement on the matter in this House but he has not done so. I again ask the Taoiseach if the Minister for Health, in keeping with the programme for Government, will account to the House on this matter. Also, will the Taoiseach publish the HSE review into how Noel Daly's firm was awarded the contract to examine maternity services in that region? The Government is drip feeding information in this regard. If this had happened under the watch of Fianna Fáil Members opposite would be up on their hind legs shouting about it. This is happening on this Government's watch. A contract was awarded to a private consultancy firm, a shareholder of which was appointed the head of a public health service. The chairperson then resigned because of a conflict of interest, the review was pulled and the Minister has not accounted for this matter to the Dáil. In regard to the terms of reference for the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes, the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, said he expected these to be ready prior to the Dáil rising for the summer but that he does not expect the investigation to commence before the end of this year. Is this acceptable to the Taoiseach? Is that not an unduly long lead-in time? The Taoiseach will be aware that Archbishop Martin has said the inquiry should include the Magdalen laundries. Can he give that commitment? Will the county homes, as requested by the campaign of survivors group, also be included? What is the timetable and format for consultation between the Government and Opposition parties and between the Government and the survivors group on the terms of reference and other relevant details?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	220	On the Deputy's final question, I expect that the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, will be in touch with the House and publicly in respect of the timelines and so on. As we now know there are extraordinary amounts of material to be examined prior to this process getting under way. I will ask the Minister to communicate with members on the progress being made in this regard. I do not have all the details in relation to the other matter raised by the Deputy. He might consider tabling a parliamentary question or topical issue on the matter. In any event, I will have the Minister respond to him in respect of the question in regard to the West-North West Hospitals Group.  On the Bill, this is a matter for the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. I can inform the House that the Government this morning approved the drafting of a Bill to deal with the requirements for medical facilities and coverage for those women who were in Magdalen homes. A small number of them are resident in Britain and will be dealt with through the system there. The Minister for Justice and Equality was given authorisation today to move ahead with that legislation. That work is now under way.

When is that legislation due to be published given that there is a deadline by which all of the relevant legislation must be passed by member states? I hope the Government will commit to not guillotining the debate on that important legislation.

I have previously engaged with the relevant Ministers on this issue. The final issue relates to the Minister and the Department of Health. It was announced by the Government that a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Health will again be necessary. This relates to the U-turn by Government, rightly so, in relation to discretionary medical cards. Will the Taoiseach tell the House when that Supplementary Estimate will be brought before the House and if it will be only in respect of money required for address of the medical cards issue or, as has been mentioned, amounts of up to €500 million? Other figures have been mentioned, one being as high as €500 million.

One concerns secondary legislation and the other, primary legislation. On the former, section 20(6) of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 states the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government can issue regulations pertaining to the local adjustment factor, the power of local authorities to vary the local property tax upwards or downwards in the order of 15%. The Minister has indicated he intends to issue such regulations. As one knows, local authorities must notify the Revenue Commissioners by the end of September if they intend to vary local property tax rates. When will the regulations be published by the Minister? We have learned today that permanent tsb is to sell approximately €2.6 billion worth of its non-core loan book, which will involve sub-prime mortgages. The Minister for Finance has promised that the sale of loan books to unregulated third parties Bill will be published much earlier than 2015 because it will ensure people in the circumstances covered will not lose the statutory protection afforded by the code of conduct on mortgage arrears. Will the Taoiseach advise the House as to when that Bill will be brought forward? I am sure everyone on this side of the House will co-operate in finding time to have it debated and advanced through the House.

Dan Morrissey Irl. Limited is a company based in Carlow and Wicklow that is involved in the quarrying and concrete industry. It is a family-owned business servicing the construction and agricultural industries in the south east. The Morrissey family has ensured employment for hundreds of individuals and their families over the years through direct and indirect employment. It is also a great supporter of local organisations in Carlow town. On Wednesday of last week, I was deeply saddened to hear that Dan Morrissey Irl. Limited had gone into receivership. The laissez-faire and somewhat cavalier attitude of AIB in this instance leaves a lot to be desired. To the workers' dismay, they turned up on Wednesday morning to find the gates of their employment had been locked. The workers received no explanation or information and had to rely on the local media for any information they were able to get. They were left in complete limbo as to the future of their jobs. The workers simply cannot understand why a bank in which this State has such a large stake can do this to them and I have some sympathy with them. The loss of 160 jobs from a local economy would be a crushing blow to any community let alone one that has already suffered ravages from the loss of the sugar beet industry and the Braun factory some years ago.  With the workers, I welcome the court decision last Friday to appoint an interim examiner until 14 July. Most of the workers have young families to support and mortgage repayments among other debts. The domino effect that this would create in Carlow would be significant. The fact that an interim examiner has been appointed to Dan Morrissey Irl. Limited would perhaps indicate that there is a possibility of some resolution as I understand that the company does have over €4.5 million worth of contracts on hand with blue chip clients like Carlow County Council. I fully support any measure that can be put in place that will assist in the survival of this company. We need to ask what we as public representatives can do to help ensure the sustainability and survival of this company which is so vital to Carlow and the south east as a whole.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	282	In the past three years, I have highlighted at committee level and in this Chamber the plight of functioning businesses that are in debt distress. A large number of other commentators, including Morgan Kelly, have indicated the difficulties that SMEs around the country are experiencing with mortgage distress and what this is doing to the economy. The issue of debt distress is enormous. It is of iceberg proportions. For every bit we see, there are nine or ten more companies in this country under the surface dealing with debt distress. We are seeing functioning businesses being closed every week and hundreds of other businesses having their investment or spend literally paralysed with the result that they have a millstone of debt around their necks. It is a significant brake on the economy. The growth rates the Government is forecasting will not happen unless it deals with this issue. The problem lies with the Government's priorities. The banks are the Holy Grail of Government policy and the rest can get stuffed. Morrissey Quarry is a medium-sized business in Carlow with 130 staff on its books. It pays an annual wage bill of €5 million into the local economies, €500,000 in rates and hundreds of thousands of euro in vehicle and fuel taxes. It is a functioning firm and as has been noted, it has contracts worth millions of euro on its books waiting to delivered upon. It is in trouble because of a number of acquisitions it made in the noughties and because it is at the end of a line of credit where other creditors have refused to pay it the necessary funds as well. The workers need to know what the Government will do to make sure that a functioning business can be allowed to restructure its loans in a situation where it can be nurtured out of this debt. What will it do to ensure these businesses can remain in place, delivering their services properly, keeping these people employed and paying their debts in the long run? What will the Minister do?
#PatrickDeering	unknown-#PatrickDeering-party	unknown-#PatrickDeering-dob	unknown-#PatrickDeering-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	283	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this topic, which is very important in Carlow, Kilkenny and Wicklow. The issue is the appointment by AIB of a receiver to Dan Morrissey Irl. Limited last week. Thankfully, on Friday evening, common sense prevailed and the High Court appointed an interim examiner until this Thursday when, hopefully, the appointment will be confirmed for 100 days. As has been stated previously, Dan Morrissey Irl. Limited is primarily a Carlow company with operations in Wicklow and other locations. The company was established by Dan Morrissey in the 1930s, although the family's association with the construction materials industry can be traced back many generations. A family-owned and managed business, it is one of the biggest independent suppliers of materials to the Irish construction Industry. Its business includes the supply of quarry products such as ready-mix concrete, concrete blocks, aggregate, tarmacadam and roof tiles. These are sold extensively across the country but especially in Dublin and the south east. The company's vast experience and knowledge and its reputation for quality products has made it one of top suppliers of quarry products in the country. Like most, if not all, construction-related companies, it has come through a very difficult six years since this recession took its toll on the construction industry. However, things are looking up, the future does look brighter and there are signs, however small, of recovery in the construction industry. Dan Morrissey Irl. Limited has €4.5 million worth of confirmed orders on its books. This allied with the quick turnaround telephone orders that come in hourly mean that it could have as much as €8 million worth of work to complete in the coming months. I am amazed that AIB has moved in at this particular time. It begs the question "why now?" Why did it not do this not last spring when the company's order book was depleted and the going was tough? Why wait until there are positive signs - green shoots as we might call them? Look at the value of confirmed orders, many from local authorities. The company supplies its product to ten local authorities around the country. Regardless of whether it was in the days of the Celtic tiger or these less prosperous times we live in now, the construction industry has boomed in the summer months. Again, I ask why AIB is moving at this stage.  Dan Morrissey Irl. Limited employs 160 direct employees putting €6 million in wages annually into the local economy and an estimated similar indirect amount. It pays €1 million in rates to county councils in Carlow and Wicklow and it spends €250,000 monthly on fuel. It has enough deposits of raw material to meet its current demand for at least another generation, which is significant.  When this news broke last Wednesday evening, I contacted David Duffy, the CEO of AIB. To say the least, his response was disappointing - a standard copy and paste letter. It was the same reply he sent to the Cathaoirleach of Carlow County Council when a special meeting was convened. He said that he had exhausted every possible avenue to ensure a receiver would not be appointed. I understand that trying to ensure that taxpayers get value for money is difficult, but the big question we must ask is why AIB is moving in at this moment in time when the company is in its busiest season. Why did the bank not move last January or February? 
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	284	I thank the Deputies for raising this matter. My understanding is that following the appointment of a receiver last week by the bank concerned, an interim examiner was appointed by the High Court to the company in question on 20 June. I believe examinership is a good option for companies that have real prospects for the future but find themselves in financial difficulty at a point in time. Examinership is, however, a balanced procedure, taking into account both the interests of the ailing company and the rights of the creditors and giving the courts a role in ensuring a fair and appropriate outcome. As I have indicated, I understand the High Court appointed an interim examiner to the company on foot of an ex parte application on 20 June. The High Court fixed 26 June for the hearing of the petition and ordered that notice be given to a number of interested parties. It is a requirement of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1990 that a court cannot appoint an examiner to a company without giving creditors an opportunity to be heard. As the matter is before the court, the Deputy will appreciate that nothing should be said this evening that would be seen to interfere with this process.As the matter is before the court, the Deputies will appreciate that nothing should be said in the debate that would be seen to interfere with this process. The court will have the final say in the appointment of an examiner and we must be careful to respect this. I am conscious of the anxiety the appointment of an interim examiner to the company concerned creates for the workers involved and their families, as well as their local communities. General employment rights information is available to employers and employees by contacting the workplace relations customer service at 1890 808090 and on its website www.workplacerelations.ie. I have been informed by Enterprise Ireland that it has had limited engagement with the company concerned. In 2007 the agency paid the company a €4,500 Enterprise Ireland environment management grant. Although Enterprise Ireland does not fund companies to assist them to trade on the domestic market, its potential exporters division was in contact with the company to discuss exporting options and understands it is not currently exporting. The agency, therefore, was not in a position to assist. Employment retention and creation continue to be our primary objectives and we have worked hard to create the improved economic conditions which will support the maintenance of existing jobs and the creation of new ones. A robust economy capable of capturing new opportunities and sustaining jobs requires a medium to long-term vision. An Action Plan for Jobs is a key pillar of the delivery of that goal and the Government has focused on creating a supportive environment for businesses operating in Ireland. Enterprise development agencies, under the aegis of my Department, have been to the fore in delivering on the commitments set out in the plan. We consider it important that the impact on employment in County Carlow should be minimised and the State enterprise agencies and the Carlow Local Enterprise Office will continue to make every effort they can to develop new employment opportunities. Enterprise Ireland activity is focused on the creation of new jobs. The LEO has responsibility and it is up and running. I assure the House we consider it important that the impact on employment in County Carlow minimised and the State enterprise agencies and the Carlow Local Enterprise Office will continue to make every effort that they can to develop new employment opportunities. With regard to new initiatives for job creation, EI activity is focussed on the creation of new jobs. The local enterprise office has responsibility and it is up and running. In addition to marketing County Carlow for new investment, IDA Ireland works with its existing client companies in the county with a view to encouraging them to grow and embed their business in the county. IDA Ireland has strong relationships with all its client companies in County Carlow and works closely with them to ensure their long-term sustainability and encourage their growth, development and continuing reinvestment in their sites. The primary opportunity for regional locations is in respect of the existing client base and potential further investment. I am confident that the measures outlined in An Action Plan for Jobs, together with other policies and initiatives being pursued by the State agencies in County Carlow, will continue to support enterprise development and provide employment opportunities. The agencies will continue to work closely with each other and local interests to support an integrated approach to job creation in the county.

I hope that will happen. When the Minister returns from his trade mission to Beijing, we would welcome a meeting with him to see what can be done because it is much easier to protect what is there than to try to create something new. Approximately 160 jobs are involved and many people are indirectly employed in the area. We saw this when the sugar plant was closed. The impact of the closure was felt not only in Carlow town but throughout the south east. The dogs on the street were shouting that we had to do something about the sugar industry at the time. I understand we cannot intervene in the context of the courts, but we, as public representatives, who are representing the workers have to be seen to do something. I thank the officials from the Department of Social Protection who met the workers with me in the Dolmen Hotel in Carlow last Friday. I thank the Department for being proactive in outlining their entitlements and updating their files as they would have had to wait for weeks for benefit if the unfortunate had happened.

I understand its representatives have sought restructuring of the firm's debt, either through a write-down or extending the term of the loan or part of it, but these requests have been refused. That is what has led to the current problem. This is particularly hard to swallow, given that AIB was saved on the back of the tax dollar of every citizen and other companies and individuals such as INM and Mr. Denis O'Brien, etc., have received massive write-downs. None of this process is transparent and it is costing jobs and unfair. It is also not conducive to a healthy, functioning economy. A system is needed to solve the problem of functioning businesses laden with debt. They need to be enabled to separate themselves from the debt. The Minister has pushed responsibility for the future of these jobs to the court, but he is a shareholder in the bank and could use that leverage to determine its policy in the future. He could also create a system to separate the debts of functioning businesses and ensure there was a proper restructuring process. If a business is functioning, making a profit and has orders to beat the band, as the other Deputies said, there is an onus on us to save the functioning element of the business from the debt. That is where the responsibility lies.

I understand why it was general, but the major question that needs to be answered, as I outlined, is why AIB has moved in at this stage and why not last January or February when there were difficulties in the marketplace, the weather was bad and the company could not do the work it is doing currently? Was the bank trying to protect somebody or was another investor waiting for it to intervene? This is a viable company which has been dealing with the bank, as Deputy Peadar Tóibín said. Its representatives have not been putting their heads in the sand for the past few years. My understanding is that in the past six years they have repaid €19 million to AIB. They did not put their heads in the sand and tell it to go away. They have been up-front with it. It is important that the jobs are protected and that we get answers as to why the bank moved in at the busiest time of the year when the order books are full and a great deal of work is ongoing and did not do so last spring.

The High Court has fixed 26 June for the hearing of the petition in order that notice be given to the interested parties. We must allow this process to happen. Clearly, the contributions of the Deputies and due diligence relating to the company and so on will be apparent in the court's judgment. The court has the final say in the appointment of an examiner. There will then be 100 days for everybody to work and see what can happen. Ultimately, the Government has no role in the matter whatsoever. It is not involved in the day-to-day operations of a bank; that is not our job either. The court will have the final say in the appointment of an examiner and all we can hope is that every consideration will be given to the company. The fate of the jobs and whatever else will be decided during the 100 day period of reflection. The files will be considered and, ultimately, it will be the call of the judge.

I thank him for allowing me to raise this important issue. Bulmers, which is owned by C&C Group, has a proud heritage, history and association with Clonmel, south Tipperary and west Waterford.It is a wonderful company, which employed 600 people at its peak. I have fond memories of travelling to the vats in Clonmel as a buachaill óg with loads of apples, hand picked by men and children, and the wonderful aroma that descended on Clonmel from those vats during September and October. Production moved out to the present site outside the town and the company was doing fine and gave wonderful employment and had a superb workforce and legacy over the years. Every summer it provided hundreds of summer jobs. The situation has, unfortunately, taken a major turn for the worse. Since the takeover by C&C Group, a cloud has descended on Bulmers. There was major expansion, which frightened people who drove by, but, unfortunately, it has all gone wrong. Major corrections have been made by a sterling workforce from 2007 until now, but the workers are continually being asked for more. There has been a complete lack of engagement with public representatives by the company's managing director and others. Despite the fact that we were previously brought down for tours, meetings and trips and kept abreast of issues to be dealt with, we cannot get access. What are they hiding? I will quote some very worrying figures. Sales of Hornsby's, Magners and Woodchuck are down 40%, 17% and 1%, respectively. Although Bulmers in Clonmel contributed almost €40 million to the company's profits of €126.7 million, the workers are being asked for another €1 million in cuts. The company is trying to introduce a standardised hours system, whereby people would have to work all their hours during the summer months, when they have to be away from their families and neglect them, and then may be be idle during the winter. The union is fighting this, but is not getting much support. Bulmers has made wonderful profits and when it took over Gleesons some years ago my colleague, Deputy Michael Lowry, raised the issue here and we received all kinds of assurances. However, 30 jobs from that plant have been moved to Belfast and the equivalent of the IDA in Northern Ireland gave handsome grants to C&C to move jobs from Dublin and Tipperary in the Republic of Ireland to Northern Ireland. It is a crying shame and it is time to wake up and smell the coffee and demand meetings with the company, which wants a further €1 million in cuts, despite the many sacrifices the workers have made. The American market has collapsed. The market in Great Britain is collapsing. UK cider sales have fallen by 13% and profits have fallen by 29% for the last year. Magners are still sponsoring Celtic Football Club, which I have no problem with. Bulmers was always good about sponsoring local causes, but it has been dwindling and the goodwill is disappearing. I question the ability of the CEO and management to do the job. On 13 May, production moved from Clonmel to Shepton Mallet in the United Kingdom. Nothing has gone through that plant but water for a test and it lies idle with nothing being made. There are pictures on the company's website to prove this. Although I am not against the counties north of the Border, why should Northern Ireland offer grants to companies to take jobs from the Republic and go there? There is uncertainty, but Borrisoleigh is playing its part with a good, indigenous company, Gleeson Group. Two indigenous companies that have served Tipperary well for generations are being taken over by this all-encompassing C&C Group and we are carrying the other plants and the failures in America. It will take 46 years for the company to turn a profit from the investments it has made there. Why should Clonmel be forced to support it? I ask the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, to visit Clonmel - and the United Kingdom, if necessary, as the company will not meet on our turf - to meet the company management, get reassurances and demand answers because the workers are not getting fair play, and neither are the public representatives of south Tipperary.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	290	I thank the Deputy for raising the matter. I am very conscious of the anxiety that any threat to the workforce in C&C Group's operations in Clonmel would create for the workers, their families and the local community. In terms of safeguarding the rights of the employees, Ireland has a robust suite of employment rights legislation. For employees who are concerned about the safety of their jobs, Ireland's body of employment rights offers extensive protections to employees, including the Protections of Employment Act 1977, which provides for a process of information and consultation between the employer and the employee representatives; the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts 1973 to 2005, which give employees entitlements to specified notice periods or payment in lieu of notice; the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2007; and the Redundancy Payments Act which is administered by the Minister for Social Protection. While the plan of the company concerned is a commercial matter for the company, the group's commitment to invest has been demonstrated by its acquisitions in Ireland in recent years. It has just released results for the year ending 28 February 2014, with profits up 30%, of which 75% is represented by Ireland and Scotland, mainly by Bulmers in Ireland and Tennants in Scotland. The company is launching a new craft beer, with the plant currently being commissioned, and is nearing production in Clonmel. The group is a key client for Enterprise Ireland and has been provided with research and development and other supports. Enterprise Ireland visited the company last month. Employment retention and creation continues to be our primary objective and we have been working hard to create the improved economic conditions which will support the maintenance of existing jobs and the creation of new ones. While Ireland's competitiveness has improved in recent years, we must continue to do more, to ensure these competitiveness gains are not eroded as the economy begins to recover and that we continue to address the structural imbalances which had built up over the lifetime of the previous Government. Through An Action Plan for Jobs 2012 and 2013, the Government has focused on measures aimed at restoring our competitiveness and creating a supportive environment for businesses operating in Ireland. The Government recently launched An Action Plan for Jobs 2014 which contains a range of specific measures which will build on the progress made in recent years. These measures include a review of the key competitiveness issues for business, particularly cost competitiveness, and taking actions on key challenges identified; a review of key challenges in terms of ease of doing business in Ireland and taking action on the issues identified; and quarterly reporting to Government on competitiveness issues and progress in addressing these issues. The implementation of these actions, combined with the Government's exit from the troika programme and its return to international funding markets, will play a key role in improving our competitiveness further and realising our ambition of making Ireland the best small country in which to do business. The enterprise development agencies, under the aegis of my Department, have been to the fore in delivering on the commitments set out in the action plans for jobs and continue to ensure businesses can maximise their contribution to economic recovery and employment growth. It is very important that any adverse impact on employment creation and maintenance from any source in Clonmel is minimised and the State enterprise agencies and the local enterprise office, LEO, will continue to make every effort they can to develop new employment opportunities for County Tipperary. In terms of new initiatives for job creation, Enterprise Ireland's activity is focused on the creation of new jobs through continuing to work with established companies in its portfolio. The agency is also supporting entrepreneurs in manufacturing and internationally traded services companies. The agency works toward enhancing the innovation capability in its client companies through the support of research. The new LEO structure promotes entrepreneurship and self-help, and LEOs are now the first-stop-shops for those starting a new business. The Tipperary LEO is the local hub for enterprise support, delivering a comprehensive service. Anyone in Clonmel seeking assistance with a small or start-up business should contact it. IDA Ireland works with its existing client companies in the county with a view to encouraging them to grow and embed their business in the county. The primary opportunity for regional locations is in respect of the existing client base and potential further investment opportunities from that base. My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, is determined to ensure that Ireland can continue and he is on a trade mission this week. I listened very actively to the Deputy's concerns. I am confident that the measures outlined in An Action Plan for Jobs 2014, together with other policies and initiatives being pursued by the State agencies and the County Tipperary LEO, will continue to support enterprise development and provide employment opportunities. The State agencies will continue to work closely with each other, and with local interests, to support an integrated approach to job creation in Clonmel.

The best the Minister of State can do, given that he is a small businessman himself, is come here and read out facts and figures on a policy we know that is failing. This is an indigenous company with a proud record. The Minister of State is coming to Tipperary next month - beidh fáilte is fiche roimhe - and I ask him to visit the plant to see it for himself. He mentioned craft beer and the new promotion. There are two people employed there, which is a sham and a scam. The figures are there for all to see. The profits are measured per HL. Bulmers makes €69 per HL; Gleesons, €2; UK cider, €19; UK Tennants, €27; and international, €29. At €69, it is a non-argument. It is awful to have to listen to the official reply written for the Minister of State. Shame on him. This is a wonderful company which is disappearing before our eyes. Workers are being bullied. Annualised hours is what the company wants them to have, which means working all the hours of the summer, in spite of the four shifts they have to work. The workers have been top class and given great commitment, but they are not being engaged with. In fact, there are confidentiality clauses and they are being bullied and intimidated, which never happened before. I ask the Minister of State to talk to the group CEO, Mr. Glancey, as he will not talk to us. The Minister of State mentioned the new beer, which is to be called the 1650 beer. Does he know what happened in that year? It was the year Oliver Cromwell came to Clonmel and, thank God, he was run out of it, but now we have worse. The company has the cheek and audacity to celebrate it as the "1650 beer". It shows the respect it has for Clonmel, south Tipperary, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and everybody else. It has called the beer after the events of the unfortunate day on which Oliver Cromwell laid siege to Clonmel. He was resisted and now we must try to resist the C&C moguls who have no interest in a good company.  The Minister of State mentioned the profit figures. Of the €127 million, €40 million was made in Clonmel. The book should be opened and closed at that figure. It is just milking the company with two employees in the craft brewery when there were 600 before. There are now 150, while 50 jobs are under threat if the line is moved to Scotland. The company has invested in moving the line and has pictures of it on a website, notwithstanding the fact that nothing has gone through it but air and water as a test. It is trying make itself popular again. I call in the House and through the media for talks with the shareholders in the company to communicate the wreckage the CEO is making of it. He is trying to emulate Oliver Cromwell and must be resisted. To call it the 1650 beer is the ultimate insult. I hope the Minister of State will talk to the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, and immediately seek talks.

#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	313	In the past few months the House has witnessed a series of revelations on the Government's plans to introduce water charges and establish what has become a super quango. The exorbitant consultancy costs, the bonus-driven culture, the failure to target investment and infrastructure and the introduction of charges when household incomes are under unprecedented pressure have constituted chronic mismanagement by the Government. Over the weekend, reports on the threat posed by dangerous levels of lead in water pipes in schools, homes and businesses underlined further the need for investment in the water network. Schools such as Araglin national school in Cork, Garrabane national school in Waterford and Easkey secondary school in Sligo have all been contaminated with excessive levels of lead. EPA surveys across several counties exposed excessive lead levels, with concerns rising in the light of the new stricter requirements. Reports indicate that based on current rates some 55,000 homes may have lead pipes on their premises. The threat of lead water poisoning is a real health danger to homes, schools and businesses consuming contaminated water. Yesterday Irish Water spokespersons dismissed the concerns stating the issue had arisen in 2012 and, essentially, had nothing to do with them as it occurred on private property. They washed their hands of the issue. Irish Water has stated that in cases where lead is detected, it will alert the customer and simply provide HSE advice for households and premises affected. As far as it is concerned, it is a matter for the homeowner to fix the problem. It will cost approximately €1,000 to fix it. There are two issues I would like the Minister to address. First, the Government has committed to providing a first-fix policy. This means that problems with the pipes from the public mains to the household - essentially the pipes within the household's property - will be fixed for free by the Government. The first-fix policy was designed to help to ease the passage of water charges on the family home. Irish Water's claims that it is none of its business does not stand up against the Government's commitment. Homeowners whose water supply is rendered undrinkable need this support to ensure they get a service that delivers. In the coming weeks when the water charges strategy is fleshed out and confirmed, the first-fix policy should encompass households affected by dangerous lead levels. The second issue I call on the Minister to address is that of charging for undrinkable water. The water charges consultation period undertaken by the CER in the next few weeks is an opportunity for the Government to ensure people do not have to pay for a service which does not deliver. In places such as Boyle, where people are faced with boiled water notices, there are legitimate questions as to why they have to pay for a service that clearly does not do what it should. Lead levels pose a similar question. Will the Government ensure households affected by lead levels are not forced to bear the burden of water charges when they are reliant on bottled water and other sources to keep themselves going? It is vital that both issues are fully addressed by the Minister. Amid spiralling costs in the establishment of Irish Water, we need to know that the Government is getting something for the money it is pouring into it. The Minister must, therefore, inform the House of his plans and those of Irish Water and his response to these very serious issues which have arisen not only in recent days but which have been obvious to many in recent months. I ask the Minister to inform the House of how he intends to deal with them.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	314	I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter. I am glad of the opportunity to reassure the House and the public on a number of points relating to water quality, particularly lead exceedances in water supplies. I want the public to be assured that Irish Water is producing lead-free water. It is also producing water at an appropriate pH level to minimise the ability of water to dissolve lead. The public water network is lead-free. The issue of lead pipes creating a potential risk to water quality arises from communication and service pipes. The communication pipe is Irish Water's responsibility and typically 10% of the total length of the service pipe. There are also incidences of lead piping in what are known as common or shared backyard services. These are often located in private gardens and, in some cases, under building extensions. The only replacement remedy is the provision of a new water main in the street, as well as entirely new individual service pipes from the street to the back of each house. Before one can disconnect the common backyard service, every property has to agree to the new connections. Irish Water has a programme to address this category, reflecting the scale and cost of the work.  Lead exceedances in water is a serious matter and Irish Water is implementing a robust and appropriate water quality monitoring programme, as required under its responsibilities as a national water services authority. This year, it will take and test 250,000 samples of water. Where an exceedance occurs, as has been identified in 31 cases this year, Irish Water notifies the customer and provides health advice from the HSE. Irish Water data suggest the problem relates to less than 5% of houses. In addition to ensuring that mains are lead-free and implementing mains rehabilitation for backyard services, Irish Water is gaining valuable insight into the state of the network and the location of lead service connections through the domestic metering programme. Irish Water is recording the nature of the network, including lead, at every property that it is metering, thus providing important data for asset management. The first-fix scheme, details of which will be announced shortly, will provide many benefits, including vital assistance to households in tackling customer-side leakage in a speedy manner. The scheme will contribute to reducing the unacceptably high national leakage rate of 40% or more. While the first-fix scheme is primarily a water conservation measure, it will also address some of the lead connection pipes on private property. The spotlight on water quality issues is a reminder of the challenges facing our public water services sector and the need to address deficiencies relating to quality, environmental compliance and leakage. By establishing a national utility which can deliver water services efficiently and effectively and with a national approach, and by increasing investment in our water and waste water infrastructure through a more sustainable funding model for water, we can address these deficiencies and provide a secure supply of high-quality water for society and the economy into the future.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	315	I thank the Minister. I note much of what has been said about the ongoing process of investigation and reporting being carried out by Irish Water in addition to the information already in the local authority domain. The Minister has mentioned specifically that Irish Water suggests that the problem relating to lead piping and backyard systems affects 5% of houses, a substantial number which will require much investment. I refer to the commitment given by the Government before the CER was charged with responsibility in the current ongoing consultation process. I expect the process will ultimately recommend that the Government take cognisance of the fact that where water is undrinkable - in Boyle, among other locations - homeowners should not be asked to pay exorbitant charges. The Minister says the first-fix scheme is primarily a water conservation measure, but it will also deal with some of the lead connection pipes on private property. Can the Minister expand on that point and be more specific? The point on which I sought clarity relates specifically to the first-fix policy to which the Government committed. I expect the commitment is broad in the sense that where householders are informed of the deficiency and it is confirmed by the HSE that there is a contamination issue, rectification is necessary and works must be carried out. It is important that the works are carried out as soon as possible, but the costs associated with it are something we believed the Government would contribute to. For the Minister to say that the Government will address some of the lead connection pipes on private property is commendable in the first instance, but it must go much further than this. I ask the Minister to expand on the point and give assurance and commitment to those affected in such a way that the first-fix policy the Government committed to will include people in the unfortunate situation whereby they are informed by the Irish Water or the HSE of a problem that must rectified.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	318	The Deputy has advocated that, on people's private property and within the house, every leak should be resolved by the State. It would cost an absolute fortune to the taxpayer and I am interested to know the level of income tax or general taxation that would be required to meet that bill. We are certainly not going to do that as part of the first-fix policy. Some €25 million is being spent in County Roscommon to deal with water quality problems that have been neglected for years, and the issue will be resolved for 50% of the population. It is interesting to note that despite all the talk from Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin, not one member of those parties made a submission to the CER as part of the public consultation process. It is all talk and no action from the Opposition. We are doing the business for the people of Roscommon and other parts of the country but Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin made no submission with regard to water quality, the boil water notices or their concerns. We will get on with the job in order that we have a public water utility that is able to borrow money on the market to double the level of investment and deal with the under-investment in water and wastewater facilities that we inherited from the Fianna Fáil-led Government. We will discharge our obligations under the water regulations and I am glad to assure the House that no risk to public health arises from the issues in the media yesterday. Deputy Cowen is led by whatever he reads in the newspapers.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	319	We will shortly have the largest school in the midlands at St. Mary's in Edgeworthstown, County Longford. My concern has always been for the care and well-being of children. My genuine support for improvement of substandard facilities is well recognised across Longford-Westmeath. I have supported staff and services at every possible opportunity, even in the very difficult circumstances arising from Government and HSE cutbacks. Any curtailment of services at the school would be a major threat to the welfare of the community, and I understand the extreme anxiety caused by the notice that the school has received regarding the closure of one of the autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classes in September. The parents and teachers were so annoyed at this decision that they held a public meeting on Thursday, 29 May to outline their concerns. On the same day, I received a letter from the Minister of State, Deputy Ciarán Cannon, stating:There are currently 3 children attending the Early intervention unit in Edgeworthstown and it is my understanding that those children will be leaving the unit at end of this school year. The NCSE has consulted with both the HSE and the local SENO to determine if there are any other children in this area who might require such early intervention support and have concluded that, for now, there are none.On the night of the meeting called by the school, the principle disputed the facts and put in writing a reply stating there were three children attending the early intervention unit at the school but only two of these children had completed the early intervention programme. The SENO, when visiting the school on 2 May, stated that the third child was to be placed in a junior class in September 2014. There was no consultation with the parent, who wants her child to remain in the preschool class for a second year, as is the practice in such classes. Only two children are ready to move up to formal education. A parent who lives in Edgeworthstown visited the school on 29 May. Her child was diagnosed with ASD the day before the formal report, which I understand is with the Department, was issued, on 15 June. Another set of parents who have a child in the ASD early intervention class announced publicly at the meeting that their second child had also been diagnosed with ASD and they wanted their child to attend the early intervention class in Edgeworthstown. Another set of parents who visited the school three weeks ago have two children diagnosed with ASD, one of whom receives home tuition but is still eligible to attend the early intervention class in September.A parent wishes to enrol her child in the early intervention class from September. It had been her intention to enrol her child in a mainstream class, but she has now realised that the early intervention class would be more suitable for her. The child is not yet toilet trained and has feeding difficulties and mainstream schooling is not yet suitable for her education. Following the closure, between the schools in Edgeworthstown and Killoe there will be 36 ASD places. If the closure goes ahead, there will only be two available places in Edgeworthstown and three in Killoe. However, the NCSE does not take into account the fact that parents may not want to enrol their children in Killoe, as they live in the Edgeworthstown area and want their children to be fully integrated in the community there. Also, it is approximately 20 km from Edgeworthstown to Killoe. A demand for ASD classes has recurred in St. Mary's. It never went away, but the diagnosis process takes time. Autism is often referred to as the "hidden disability" because those on the autistic spectrum show no significant physical differences from their peers; rather, it is their behaviour that marks them out as being different. The number of children diagnosed with autism is rising. The current rate of autism in Ireland is 1:100.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	320	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue as it gives me an opportunity to clarify to the House the position on the special class in the school in question. The Deputy will be aware that the Government is committed to ensuring all children with special educational needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post-primary school network. Such placements facilitate access to individualised education programmes which may draw from a range of appropriate educational interventions, delivered by fully qualified professional teachers, with the support of special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum. The Deputy will also be aware that the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is responsible, through its network of local special educational needs organisers, SENOs, for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support students with special educational needs, including autism. It is also its role to make appropriate arrangements to establish special classes in schools in communities where the need for such classes has been identified. Children with autism can enrol in an early intervention class from the age of three years and, if they are assessed at a younger age, home tuition can be provided from the age of two and a half. Special classes within mainstream schools are intended for children who, by virtue of their level of special educational needs, cannot reasonably be educated in a mainstream class setting but who can still attend their local school in a special class with a lower pupil-teacher ratio of 6:1 and SNA support. The total number of special classes for children with special educational needs, including autism, in mainstream schools throughout the country at the end of 2013 was 737, of which 564 were in primary schools and 173 in post-primary schools. Some 74 are early intervention classes which have been established for younger children with autism. The NCSE has advised my Department that there are 17 children in four special classes for autism in the school referred to by the Deputy. One of the four classes is an early intervention class in which children from the age of three years can be enrolled. From September, the children in the early intervention class will move up to the autism special classes in the school. On this basis, the early intervention class will be suppressed. The remaining three special classes are not full. There are, in fact, two special class places available. While the NCSE is aware that children in the area are being assessed, there is no indication at this time that an early intervention class for children who have completed assessments will be required from September. The NCSE, through the local SENO, will continue to liaise with the HSE to determine if further special class provision is required. If additional provision is required, the NCSE will establish additional special classes to meet the need for such classes in the local area.

While appreciating that, in theory, the current enrolment does not warrant four classes, the level of need and support required has not been taken into account. In the light of the facts I have presented, I would appreciate it if the Minister of State reviewed the situation in Edgeworthstown because there is a conflict between what he has said and what the principal of the school has said. This was outlined to us at a public meeting on 29 May. I understand and have provided the facts that there are a number of children who have since come on board. Also, applications to the school are ongoing. It is always in June, July and August that the school receives new applications; perhaps, therefore, the Department has acted in haste. It is welcome that the Minister of State has said that if there is a need, the school will not lose the teacher and class in Edgeworthstown. Perhaps, in the light of the facts I have brought to the attention of the House, he will review the position as soon as possible. Parents and teachers tell me they can prove the preschool facility is viable. I, therefore, call for the post to be reinstated.

To clarify, the early intervention class can only be reinstated on the basis that the SENO, the only person operating in the region with the expertise to determine the special needs requirements of each child in the area, in liaison and consultation with the HSE, determines there are sufficient children in the area who wish to attend the school and avail of an early intervention service. If it transpires between now and September that sufficient children have been identified and there is sufficient demand, the NCSE, as was always the case, will consider reopening the class. I do not believe anybody acted in haste. As of now, the SENO has yet to identify any child that will require such a service. That is not to say a need may not be established between now and September. If it is, the NCSE and the Department have committed unequivocally to meeting it.

That is, in essence, a technical matter but as I have said previously, the critical point is that there is adequate funding to provide a health service that is fit for purpose and capable of responding to the needs of people when those needs arise. Quite clearly the significant cuts in the provision for health services over recent years, amounting to some €4 billion by the end of this year, have carved out a critical level of resourcing from the health structures, both in terms of the capacity of the health service to cope with all cases presenting and very especially with regard to the numbers of people employed. It has already been signalled that some 2,600 whole-time equivalent posts are to go in this current year on top of the 12,500 which have gone since 2007, almost 6,000 of which were front-line nursing posts.  It is not so much a question of whether the Minister has a single allocation or two budgets but that he has provided adequately and properly. I am afraid that the facts demonstrate that this is not the case. That is not to say that money thrown at the system is the way to do business either. We need to get value for money and there must be, at all times, a responsible evaluation of the return from public investment in our health services. We already know that many areas of the health service are under enormous strain, not least the acute hospital network. Many hospital sites are finding it very difficult, if not virtually impossible, to cope on the reduced budgets of recent years, yet section 10 of this Bill seeks to introduce what I can only describe as a piling, year on year, of any failure - in the language of the Department - of the health service to manage its affairs within the stated budget, that is, the allocated sum in any given year. What this will mean, in essence, is that if the HSE is unable to manage the health care needs of the population in any given year, it will have to carry forward any overspend as a further reduction in the following year's allocation. This would continue, year on year. That will work its way down into acute hospital sites and all of the other areas of health care delivery until we end up in an absolutely impossible situation. This is very worrying.  On Committee Stage the Minister introduced what I described as the "fantasy notion" that the executive might actually have a surplus, having underspent and he suggested we would have to get the approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for those moneys to be carried forward and added to the subsequent year's allocation. If only that could be, but it is most unlikely indeed. This is a very worrying aspect of this legislation. While I was not overly exercised about whether we had two separate budgets or one, as the case might be, when I examined the body of the Bill and saw what is actually entailed in section 10, it was a cause of great worry to me. I did not support it on Committee Stage and wish to record again that I will not be supporting it unless the Minister indicates, in response, his willingness to revisit that particular section.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	328	We said on Second Stage and throughout the debate on the Bill that we were very concerned about this legislation for a number of reasons. Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin has pointed to the fact that the Bill is technical in many ways in that it brings two Votes together into one under the Department of Health. However, there are also principles at stake. The difficulty we have is with a Minister and the Department setting policy with one Vote and then another agency under that Department implementing the policy. The issue we have centres on clear and distinct lines of demarcation and accountability. We want accountability in this Chamber. However, a lack of clear lines of demarcation can give rise to lines of influence. We have said previously that as the executive was structured previously, there was a certain distance between the Minister in the Department, who sets the policy and is accountable to this Chamber and the HSE which implements that policy. We can argue about whether the HSE is implementing policy in an efficient manner. Indeed, we could have that debate all day, every day. Some people argue that the direction we are now travelling, towards universal health insurance and all that will flow from that, is an effort by the Government to indicate that it wants to be different in how it funds the health service. However, it does not have any clear train of thought in terms of how that will impact on the health services. We are having discussions on an ongoing basis on universal health insurance, the establishment of the commission, the negotiations, discussions and submissions that are being received and the input of the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children. There are lots of reasons to be concerned about the Bill. As Deputy Caoimghín Ó Caoláin highlighted today and on previous occasions, there are also lots of things wrong with the Department of Health and the current Minister, particularly in the way they have directed policy. There is a lack of commitment to ensuring that if the entire Vote comes under the Department of Health we will have a better health service. Will this actually be more efficient and effective? Will it direct resources to where they are needed most or will it simply allow for more political interference? I do not like having to say this but the Minister has form, as do other Cabinet Ministers, in the context of deciding where resources should go. We had, for example, numerous debates in this Chamber on primary care centres, on how and why certain centres were prioritised and the lack of clarity on the criteria used for prioritisation. We had many discussions about algorithms but have yet to get a concise answer from the Minister on how particular primary care centres were prioritised. We have also dealt with issues around the funding of emergency departments, although nobody denies that funding for emergency departments in hospitals is essential. The recent HIQA report on the hospital in Dooradoyle highlights the inadequacies of the emergency department there although a new department will come on stream shortly. The point I am making relates to how decisions are made about where resources are directed.If the Vote in question is brought within the remit of the Department of Health - of course, the Minister is the representative of the Executive in the Department - there will be potential for horse-trading to occur between Ministers in the provision of money and how and where it is to be spent. There is actually more than just potential in this regard because it has happened already. The impact of what occurred when health funding was, for horse-trading purposes, diverted to certain Ministers' constituencies has been well chronicled in recent times. That is a type of behaviour from which we are trying to move away. I am concerned that when the Vote to which I refer is transferred back to the Department of Health, there will be potential for influence to be used and interference and conflict to occur. The Minister has not, by any stretch of the imagination, covered himself in glory in the presentation of budgets in the years since his appointment. Every year it is stated difficulties will arise. In recent times the chief executive officer of the HSE has highlighted the deficiency in this regard, namely, the fact that budgets are built on sand. We understand the need to pare back the public finances and prioritise certain areas within them. The key issue is that when a budget is set down, it must be sustainable in how services are going funded for the year ahead. Every January or February we come to the realisation that the budget the Minister presented the previous October as part of the Estimates process will not be sustainable. Representatives of the HSE have highlighted the fact in recent years, even as the Minister was negotiating the shape of the health Estimate with the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance. How he expects personnel in the HSE to deliver services when the budgets he is allocating are wing and a prayer efforts worthy of fantasy fiction is beyond me. The fact that the Department of Health will have responsibility for the Vote to which I refer is a source of concern. It is with regret that I make these remarks, but at least I am being consistent. I must continue to be consistent in this matter because, as has been well documented, every September or October there has been bedlam in the negotiations on the health Estimate. Last year apparently the Minister sought an additional €1 billion in funding and ended up with €666 million less. That had an impact in the delivery of services in emergency departments, primary care centres and settings and across every other area of the health service. For all of these reasons, we are of the view that the Bill will only expand the Minister's remit even further. We have concerns about that remit in the first instance.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	329	I point out to Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin that if the amendment to section 10 was not being introduced, there would be no legal constraint on the HSE's spending. That constraint is imposed by virtue of the executive having its own Vote. I must inform Deputy Billy Kelleher that there will be a clear line of accountability under the new arrangements. The HSE will be given a new expenditure figure by the Minister and obliged to submit its service plan in line with the net budget. There will be a legal obligation on the executive to ensure the plan will be implemented within the limits of the resources provided. As is the case, the national service plan will have to be approved by the Minister. It will also set out the budgets to be allocated to the different sectors within the health service. Deputy Billy Kelleher is fond of referring to shambles, disasters, catastrophes, etc. I highlight for him the fact that in 14 of the past 17 years it has been necessary to introduce Supplementary Estimates in respect of the budgets for the Department and the HSE. That was during the wealthiest period in the country's history, namely, the so-called boom years. It is not surprising that it has been necessary to introduce Supplementary Estimates at a time when the population is growing, when, thankfully, more older people are surviving and when, as those opposite pointed out, we are seeking to reduce budgets. Nonetheless, thanks to the great work of the men and women employed in the health service, 95% of those waiting for outpatient appointments have been treated or seen in under 12 months, 99% of those awaiting inpatient procedures have been treated in under eight months, while there has been a 24% reduction in the number of patients obliged to endure long waits on trolleys. That figure is still too high and we need to do more. In that context, we will continue with our reforms. The Bill before the House is another step on the road to further reform in creating a procurer-provider split. The HSE is buying services from itself. I am sure everyone agrees that there is no particular incentive to be competitive with oneself when one is providing a service. Clearly, it is in the interests of all those involved that we create the procurer-provider split. That will be achieved in the context of a health reform Bill to be introduced later this year. In the most recent general election the people gave us a very clear mandate to, as some would say, abolish the HSE. I prefer to say we are replacing it. In order to do so, however, we must transfer the Vote back to the Department as a first step. There are great people working within the health service and this legislation will assist them in delivering the excellent services they have been trained to deliver and which they wish to deliver but which, as a result of the system the Government of which Deputy Billy Kelleher was a member put in place, they have been prevented from delivering. It is my belief we can look forward to a brighter future. The OECD figures for health spending show that Ireland is slightly above the average and that, in actual fact, we should be below the average as a result of the profile of the population, namely, that there are so many young people living here. In order to achieve efficiencies and savings further down the road, further reforms will be required. The Deputies opposite will have to acknowledge that if money could have solved the ills of the health service, this should have happened during the 12 years in which the spend on health quadrupled. However, that did not prove to be the case.

As I indicated in conversation with Deputy Dessie Ellis just before this debate started, while the thrust of what he is trying to do with the amendment is right, in that it deals with an issue that is central to the Bill and addresses a significant problem that will develop if the Government presses ahead with the Bill, as constituted, I do not agree with how it is phrased. I will explain why I believe there is a slight problem with its phrasing. The amendment points to a critical issue with the rental accommodation scheme, RAS. During the controversy of the past week or two surrounding the Bill and the claims and counter-claims about what it means, the RAS has come to the centre. Last week the Minister of State claimed that the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme was really just the RAS expanded.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	336	Others did. Mr. Simon Brooke of Clúid stated it on radio the other day. He made the point - there has been a suggestion by the Minister of State to this effect - that we had not kicked up about this issue when the RAS was first introduced. The implication is that we are making a mountain out of a molehill and that, despite what we claim, there are no problems with the Bill. However, that is not true. In June 2011 some of us flagged the major problem with the RAS and the Government's proposals, which have found their way into this legislation. The issues have been raised in the Dáil repeatedly since. I looked back through a few statements I published at the time. In June 2011 I referred to how all new entrants to the RAS would be considered to be adequately housed and would no longer be eligible to be on housing waiting lists. I stated this was unbelievable, representing a counter-revolution in the State's approach to providing housing for low-income families and households, and that the hopes of tens of thousands of young families were to be devastated because their long wait of seven, eight or nine years for a council house - this period has since extended to 15 years - had come to nothing. They would never have a home that they could call their own and would become subject to private developers, speculators and banks, many of which had helped to bankrupt the country. I made this statement on foot of a major problem that had emerged with the RAS. The original entrants were told that they would participate in the scheme for four years, after which they would be given a council house. In June 2011 they were suddenly told that this was not the case and that they would be deemed to be housed under the RAS. There was uproar. We held a press conference in Buswell's Hotel with representatives of Tenants First and some of the affected families in my area. The media were befuddled trying to figure out the problem because they did not understand how housing waiting lists worked. They have taken four years to catch up. At the press conference we pointed out that this was the beginning of striking tens of thousands of families off housing waiting lists. On foot of this outrage, the 400 people in question were told that, while they would be placed on a fixed transfer list, everyone who entered the RAS after that date would be deemed to be housed. That is, of course, what happened. Anyone who joined the RAS afterwards was taken off the list.There are now thousands of people on the RAS. A few hundred are entitled to be on a transfer list because this concession was forced from the Government and local authorities at the time but the vast majority of people on the RAS have been taken off the list and are deemed housed. This Bill expands this to take everyone off the list. News of this is starting to filter out now but most people will only find out when they are forced onto the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme. When they discover that their wait of ten to 15 years has come to nothing it will cause despair and outrage. They will learn that after all that time they will not get a council house but will be deemed to be housed in private rented accommodation. The councils will then be able to say they discharged their obligation to those people. In response to these points the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, has said people can go on a transfer list. The RAS experience is clear. If a transfer list exists, and there are many local authorities that do not have one, one can only get on it if there are chronic overcrowding problems, medical needs, acute anti-social difficulties and so on. Only people suffering such problems will be accepted in their application to go on a transfer list. Even these people will have to wait months and sometimes years. The Minister of State suggests that people who do not have the acute problems outlined, who have merely spent a long time waiting, will somehow have a right to a council house but this is preposterous. We cannot even house the people in the most dire and chronic need. Housing departments will face the most impossible and diabolical choices as to who should be allocated the tiny number of houses that are available. I will give the example of an elderly man I am dealing with at the moment. He has had two strokes, he has brain damage, his memory is gone and he has serious speech difficulties as a result of the strokes. He has just been released from the National Rehabilitation Hospital. He is diabetic, needs two shots per day and must eat carefully to allow for those shots. Due to his memory problems the fear is he may not take his shots and if he does not do so he could die. He was released and put in emergency housing in Dún Laoghaire that is overwhelmingly populated by people with chronic drug or alcohol problems. When he arrived with his family and saw where he had to stay he was stricken with fear. On seeing his reaction his family worried he might keel over and have another stroke but the council said there was nowhere else for him to go. He is still staying in that emergency housing. If he dies as a result of the anxiety induced by being placed in completely inappropriate hostel accommodation it will be on the heads of this Government and the housing authorities. It is not the council's fault because they have no other accommodation for him. The people who run the emergency housing in question admit the facility is not set up for such a case. They argue that they are not doctors but rather deal with people with chronic alcohol and drug problems. They say they are not in a position to look after this man but will do their best. They say the emergency housing is not appropriate. Similarly, the hospital has discharged him because the bed is needed. His life is in danger. Given what is proposed under the HAP scheme, how will a housing authority allocate houses to people who have been on the list for ten or 12 years? The Minister of State says such people are entitled to a transfer. To whom will the authority allocate a house, the man who may die because he is in inappropriate hostel accommodation or the family that has waited on the list for 15 years? That family's need may not be as pressing an emergency but its claim on a council house is very legitimate. Where stands the list for these people? What of transfer priority or any priority? The man I refer to cannot be housed. I was told by the local authority yesterday it could be weeks or months before he is housed. How will a person on the list get a transfer in this situation? It will not happen. Housing officials will face appalling choices on who will get a house as every possible choice will cause someone else to suffer. Only those in desperate need will be considered a priority. This is going to be a disaster. Even those at death's door cannot be guaranteed housing. What the Minister of State proposes will not work. Housing departments are overrun already and I imagine officials feel sick with anxiety at what is going on and the situation in which the Government is putting them. The Minister of State must admit the truth and say this is not a permanent solution to people's housing issues. The RAS has not worked and placing a so-called obligation on local authorities to house people through the HAP scheme, which is an expanded version of RAS, gives people no chance of getting a council house. These people with housing needs will be thrown to the sharks, private landlords and developers. Only a trickle of people in the most dire circumstances may be housed.

Section 37 is the most damaging section and is the cause of most complaint for us, including people on the housing list. It amounts to one sentence that is written ambiguously and designed to hide the gravity of what is intended. Until last Thursday the Minister of State was hesitant and denied that people who go on the new HAP scheme would be removed from the housing list. Deputy Eoghan Murphy, from the Minister of State's council area in Limerick, exposed the lie by uncovering the following quote from a document raised at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht of 7 May:The intention behind the formal scheme is that once households are supported by HAP they will be considered to have their housing needs met and will be removed from the housing waiting list. This is a fundamental change to overall housing policy where those in receipt of long-term rent supplement support remain on local authority waiting lists.This could not be clearer and dates from May, prior to my election to this House. Yet in the past two weeks the Minister of State has come before this House and denied what has been outlined. The document goes on to say that 50,000 people of the 80,000 currently on rent supplement will migrate to HAP. It says "as they transfer to HAP waiting lists will be reduced by 50,000". This is very convenient. All of this has nothing to do with ending poverty traps or helping working people. A homeless family that works pointed out to me that there is nothing in this Bill to help them because they are not on rent supplement. The truth has been exposed by others and the Minister of State knew it all along. We now know the truth and it runs contrary to what has been stated in the past week or two.The Minister of State should withdraw this Bill and bring forward the statutory instrument about which she has been speaking for consideration by the House. In fairness to people, this matter should be addressed in the Bill. It is disgraceful that this fundamental legislation which will affect 100,000 families on the housing waiting list is receiving so little attention from the media. Them seem only to appear in the House to cover Leaders' Questions.

People's lives will be seriously affected by the provisions of this Bill yet most people are completely unaware of it. This Bill seeks to wipe out housing wait lists and privatise housing, which will result in people being placed in insecure situations with no prospect of security. I spoke at a meeting last week on the northside of Dublin. A number of people who had only heard that day through the media about this legislation turned up at that meeting very distressed. One of them told me that she had been on the housing list for the past 11 years and would go homeless rather than participate in the housing assistance payment scheme. My question to the Minister of State is what will she do if people refuse to participate in this inferior scheme because they will lose the many years they spent on housing waiting lists, which we all know do not really exist but meant that people at least had some prospect of getting a house whenever the Government got around to building some. What will happen to those people who refuse to participate in the HAP scheme? I would also like to know who, under the HAP scheme, will be responsible for fixing the boiler, gate and so on, which work up to now has been the responsibility of the council. I have been asked by council workers to inquire of the Minister of State who will operate this scheme. Will work in this regard be outsourced, which in my view appears to be clearly on the agenda? I can foresee the use of cheap labour to oversee the operation of this scheme. Those involved will be acting as estate agents rather than dealing with people's housing needs.  Many serious questions arise in relation to RAS. I have been asked by people what will happen to the RAS scheme. Why is it stated in the proposal in respect of housing supply that 2,500 houses will be RAS properties? What is the point in RAS continuing when the new scheme comes into force? What will be the difference between the two scheme? Many people were opposed to the introduction of RAS. I was a member of a council at that time and I opposed its introduction. So much for the housing agencies defending council tenants. Another aspect of the Bill to which little attention has been drawn is that of rent arrears deductions. There is no other group in society that can have rent or mortgage payments taken from their income. For example, the 100,000 people in mortgage arrears, for reasons which we all understand, are able to choose between buying food or paying their mortgage. Under this legislation council tenants will not be able to decide what bills and so on they can pay. Council tenants have been more under the cosh in the past six years than any other group yet this fundamental right is to be taken away from them. Members and former Members of this House have had their debts written down by the banks. Some have gone into bankruptcy. We all know that anybody can get into arrears, including the illustrious capitalist Denis O'Brien, who secured a write-off of €300,000.  All-in-all, it has now become clear what exactly is contained in this Bill. It is a sleight of hand to try to wipe out the nuisance of the housing waiting lists and to put people into insecure situations. It is incredible that unlike in the past people will not in future have the right to a permanent home in an area in which they can send their children to school - council houses are great, as are the areas in which they are located: the one I lived in was great - but will instead be shoved into the arms of private landlords.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	340	I explained on Committee Stage that these amendments duplicate a power already provided through the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 to housing authorities and the Minister. Section 22 of that Act provides that a housing authority can determine the order of priority in which it makes allocations to individual households in accordance with its allocation scheme. Subsection (5) allows the housing authority, having regard to any regulations made by the Minister in that regard, to reserve dwellings available for allocation in its area, in respect of particular classes of household, forms of tenure or households transferring from other forms of social housing support. The making of an allocation scheme is a reserved function of the authority. In providing for specific allocations and prioritising for same it is important to have regard to those in greatest need and in respect of vulnerable groups but also to avoid measures that would have unintended consequences for the different categories of need. Section 22(16) provides that the Minister may direct a housing authority to amend an allocation scheme in the manner specified by him or her and that the housing authority must comply with that direction. If I believe there is a robust case for the prioritisation of any particular class of household above another in the context of the allocation of social housing support by a housing authority I will use the power given to me under section 22(16). However, I do not believe that is appropriate in the two particular cases provided for in these amendments, namely, that people on RAS who have been responsible be given priority over the type of person referred to by Deputy Boyd Barrett or tenants in relation to unaffordable rent levels because people in RAS are on differential rent. I do not get the point about unaffordable rent levels. Obviously, people who are evicted are a priority because they are homeless. That is the position in relation to the specific amendments. I would like to address some of the broader issues raised. I did not ask Deputies why they had not raised the issue in relation to RAS before now rather what I said was that the matter had not been raised during the Second Stage debate. It has been suggested that not all councils have transfer lists. Deputy Catherine Murphy said that no such list exists in Kildare County Council. Under section 22(3) of the 2009 Act, all councils are required to have a transfer policy. As with all social housing tenants and, as will be the case with HAP recipients, HAP households who wish to do so will be able to access other local authority housing options through the transfer system. I have always said that people will be able to transfer. I have not said they will remain on the waiting list but that they will be able to transfer into local authority housing, whereby they can apply to transfer from HAP to local authority housing or approved housing body, AHB, housing. As I said previously in discussions on amendment No. 19, I am proposing that a robust transfer policy, which would afford HAP recipients and other social housing tenants equal opportunities to access other forms of social housing support, including incremental purchase schemes, will be a central part of a local authority's allocation policy going forward. This will be done under provisions already in place under section 22 of the 2009 Act. This list, while being a transfer list, will reflect the specific priority of the previous position held by a household on the main waiting list within the authority area in which they are resident. The principle will be that the reasonable expectations of households should be preserved. They will, therefore, be placed on a transfer list with no less favourable terms than if they had remained on the main housing waiting list. I hope that is clear because I know Deputies are seeking clarity.

It is a sad day for all of us in this House when a series of well-intentioned, well-constructed, reasonable amendments are tabled and a Minister or Minister of State fails to accept any of them. The Minister of State would have us believe that she has provided in the legislation that those in receipt of the HAP payment will be taken of the housing waiting list but can go on a transfer list.The problem is that the legislation the Minister of State has put before us provides for people to be taken off the list but provides no legislative framework for them to be put on a list. The Minister of State says there is a requirement for a local authority to have a policy. We have a policy in Kildare, namely that there will be no transfer. Therefore, what the Minister of State is saying to us makes absolutely no sense. Let me address very briefly the circumstances of a person under the RAS by comparison with those of a homeless person, as alluded to by other Deputies. If a casual vacancy or new house arises or the local authority is lucky enough to get a property from NAMA, it creates a vacancy. We are simply saying people who have had five years occupancy under RAS should progress out of the RAS unit and that the person who is homeless should come in behind them into the RAS unit. Therefore, there would be a degree of progression that would allow what I propose regarding tenants who demonstrate suitability in respect of the sort of community building to which we are all committed. Sadly, the Minister of State appears not to be committed in that respect.

On the one hand, she says a person such as the one I described would have to take priority but, on the other, she is saying people in the HAPS can apply for a transfer and, based on the number of years waiting, can have a reasonable expectation that the position in respect of those years of waiting will somehow be preserved.

In Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, for example, which I am sure is much the same as anywhere else, there will be two houses allocated this month, if we are lucky. There are already approximately 25 people on the priority list in dire circumstances. Their cases are similar to those I have just described. Therefore, the only choice available to the local authority is to house the people in absolutely diabolical circumstances. Effectively, therefore, the list is gone already. The Minister of State is saying that under the HAPS, their time waiting will still be taken into consideration and the reasonable expectation can still be delivered on, but it cannot be because there will be only two houses. Will the Minister of State say-----

She bandies about figures on RAS houses and refers to allocations of 5,000 and NAMA. The Taoiseach said today that NAMA offered 4,000 houses. Although a figure of 4,000 has been bandied about for three or four years, only 300 have been delivered nationally. Therefore, what has been said is just rubbish. Let me outline why this proposal will make circumstances even worse than those associated with the rent allowance. With the rent allowance, a landlord must sign up for a period of a year.

This will mean even more landlords will run away from rent support schemes with the councils. Therefore, by introducing the proposed measure, the Government will exacerbate an already dire set of circumstances in which landlords are not interested in rent allowance or rent support.

This is no way to legislate. The Government has denied what Members on this side were saying to the Minister of State last week. We were all outlining to the Minister of State the major flaw in the legislation. At the 11th hour, she is now saying to us that what we contend is not the case and that she will ensure such and such a thing happens. That is no way to deal with legislation. We asked for clarity but the Minister of State has not provided it. The Minister of State is saying a person will not lose his or her position. If a person is seven years on a housing waiting list, will he or she be deemed to be seven years waiting for a transfer if he or she avails of the HAP? I refer to a system based on time on the list.

Even if that is the case, it is not a lot of use to people because the Government has already instructed councils to give priority to homeless people. Therefore, the small few council houses that are available will be given to people who are homeless. Prioritised thereafter will be those with certain medical needs. Therefore, very few houses will go to anybody from the transfer list. People have said repeatedly that what the Government is doing amounts to privatisation of the social housing programme, a washing of hands and an abdication of all responsibility for the provision of social housing. Even in the worst of times in this country, Governments had reasonable social housing building programmes because they recognised it as a fundamental responsibility to provide public housing of decent quality to the many people who were not in a position to provide housing for themselves. For the first time, it seems, the Government is changing this policy and effectively washing its hands of responsibility-----

That scheme makes a lot of sense but nobody expected for a moment that, by introducing it, the Government would at the same time deem people to have their housing needs met, such that people would effectively lose their places on the housing waiting list. It should be a good and positive scheme to remove poverty traps and enable people in the private rented sector, with the support of the Government, to take up work and not lose rent support euro for euro. What should be a very good scheme, however, will turn out to be a very bad one for social policy reasons, but also a very unpopular one because people will not be prepared to give up their positions on a council housing list, having been waiting patiently for perhaps five to ten years. This is no substitute for council housing. As I stated, one of the biggest problems with this proposal is that a scheme that should have been positive and attractive to people will not be attractive to them because of the effect on their position on the housing waiting list.The Minister of State made statements here tonight but they are worth nothing if they are not set down in legislation. What she said tonight is not in the Bill. She has not produced any statutory instruments to establish what she proposes to do.

We had a situation last week where he could not attend Question Time, even though we had facilitated a changing of the day in order that he could be present. We also had a situation where he was not present for Leaders' Questions to deal with the issue of beef production. Again, tonight, we find that beef farmers are let down by the fact that he does not think it is sufficiently important for him to be in the House. I welcome the Minister of State and wish him well in the forthcoming Cabinet reshuffle because it is clear the Minister has signed off, headed off into the sunset and is nowhere to be seen. However, he has left a trail of destruction behind him. For the past two years, since I became agriculture spokesperson for Fianna Fáil, I have been saying that in the long term the biggest issue that will have to be resolved is that of price to ensure farmers get a fair return on their product. The motion calls for the crisis since the back end of last year and earlier to be addressed. Long before the bull beef price issue arose in the spring, I had been highlighting the fact that Irish prices were falling behind prices in British supermarkets. This is our primary industry. It affects 100,000 farms and 150,000 people across the country and is the backbone of the farming sector. I note the comments made by the ICMSA today that the cost of keeping a cow means that the production of weanlings is not paying and - a point I have been making for some considerable time - it is ridiculous in the long term to expect farmers to supplement their farming income from the single farm payment. We are being told by the Minister that nothing can be done. Again, I have highlighted the fall in the price of liquid milk during the years; the farmer used to get over 43% of the price per litre in a shop, but this has fallen to 32%. According to the Irish Farmers Journal, in its agribusiness section last week, in 2013 a farmer was getting 57% of the price consumers were paying in a UK supermarket; he or she is now getting 42%, a fall of 15%. However, despite all of the evidence, the Minister says the market regulates itself. I put it to the Minister of State that because there are only a few players in the telecoms industry and several other, we have provided for regulators. Where there is a dominant player against a multitude of small players, a regulator is needed because somebody is needed to referee the match to ensure there is fair play. What does the Minister say? He says we should let the market regulate itself and let a few big players control the game We had a situation which was particularly acute in the Minister of State's county where farmers with a considerable amount of livestock were advised to produce bull beef. We all know that beef cannot be provided according to the new age specification being required by the factories. There had been discussions with them and Teagasc about bull beef, but, suddenly, when it came to payday, there was no price to be obtained and many strong farmers were significantly burned because of what happened. We are asking for a number of things to be done. At this stage, it should have impacted on the Government that there is a crisis, that something needs to be done and that we cannot continue with the current arrangement. Therefore, we have asked for the appointment of a beef regulator. We have also asked for an explanation as to why cattle can be put on a lorry and a boat in Larne, yet the same companies will not carry cattle from Dublin to Holyhead. A lot of ridiculous excuses were given as to why that was so, but we need to have the issue dealt with. It is amazing that, with a Sinn Féin Minister in Northern Ireland, it has proved impossible to resolve the issue of nomad cattle. It is amazing that we cannot have weanlings brought from the west to the north east of Ireland and that there is a huge Border difficulty with labelling in that transaction. Nothing is happening. We see no evidence of the Minister pushing that agenda with this Northern counterpart, Ms Michelle O'Neill. I was very interested - he is in the same party as Ms O'Neill - when I listened to Deputy Martin Ferris at Question Time last week. He asked the Minister of State to persuade his boss to sit down with Ms O'Neill to resolve the issue. If we can prove that there is intransigence in the North, we can go to Ms O'Neill and take up the issue as to why she is being so intransigent. However, all of the indications from Ms O'Neill's colleague are that this is not the case. There are things to be done. There are recommendatins in the Dowling report that should, no doubt, be implemented. However, just sitting around and talking about it in talking shops, with no action being taken, while farmers are suffering huge losses in their businesses - the bigger they are, the bigger the losses - is not acceptable. It is important that, rather than the platitudes in the counter-motion brought forward by the Government, the Minister of State as someone who comes from a strong farming area and a strong farming background outline the actions the Government will take, rather than words, and tell us that he is going to do something more than provide for the soft supports outlined in the amendment. I refer to the quality assurance scheme. A quality assurance scheme should be a way of guaranteeing premium prices, as I am sure the Minister of State will agree. However, it is interesting that while 87% of farmers are in the quality assurance scheme, the reality is that the bonus is being paid in respect of only a very small number of cattle. The reality is that the scheme has been manipulated in such a way that the quality assurance bonus is being paid in respect of one quarter of the cattle going into factories. Instead of being a scheme to put up prices for farmers, as the farming organisations have highlighted, the quality assurance scheme is being used as a mechanism to have a very tight specification, even though most of the cattle are being sold into the British market and at the same price as the rest. Many cattle are now being discounted because the quality assurance scheme is doing the exact opposite of what it was intended to do.This is a Bord Bia-promoted scheme. I understand it comes under the Department's policy. Again, it is having the opposite effect on farmers.  The biggest issue facing farming and the primary producers of food in this country and Europe and around the world is the inability of the small producer to ensure fair prices from dominant multiples and processors. We have often heard talk about Fair Trade coffee and other products. This is not a crisis of yesterday or today but one that has been going on for some considerable time. The Government has refused even to recognise that this is a major issue for all primary producers and that we need to level the playing field to ensure that primary producers, not only in this country but across Europe and the world, are protected against the powers of forces much greater than themselves.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	378	I thank Deputy Ó Cuív for giving us the opportunity to discuss this crisis facing the Irish beef industry this evening. Imagine a situation in any other sector of the economy in which the average income had fallen by between 13% and 22%, in which that frame was from just over €9,500 to €15,000, in which prices were down between 15% and 20% in one year, and in which the primary producer was taking a loss of €300 per head on the primary input. It would be a crisis and there would be an outcry. Instead, what do we get? The Government amendment this evening is as watery as the Titanic. It talks about the importance of the beef sector to the economy - lovely motherhood and apple pie stuff. The amendment then says the Government has set up a round table - happy days. Those at the round table are talking while this crisis is happening on the ground and the quality of supply and the economics of the industry are literally going through the floor. Meanwhile, the Government has set up a round table. The Government set up a "Beef Pricewatch" online tool to make price information more accessible. That is absolutely no good to farmers with a limited choice of where to send their animals, when the price differences are so small that the cost of transporting animals across the country, which has been jacked up in recent times, will obliterate any price difference. The beef round table should be asking why those prices are the same and why there is such a small disparity between prices. Is that kind of issue being put to the producers? It is probably not being put to them because this is a Government that kowtows to the big industry players - no offence to the Minister of State - and forgets the producer and the place of the producer in the important chain of our food and beef industries. The same approach is being adopted by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with regard to the Competition and Consumer Protection Bill. Amendments that tried to strengthen protection for the primary producer - the farmer - against the might of big grocery multiples were voted down. The Minister's view was "Let them eat cake. Let the market decide." This seems to be what the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is intent on doing here in respect of the beef market.  We must inject urgency and then action into this debate. Farmers are key to all of this, because this element seems to have been forgotten by the Department in respect of the beef round table. If the Minister of State has confidence in the beef round table, he will commit to the establishment of an independent regulator who will have the power to say who is wrong here and to challenge the factories and the prices they are paying.  We also need a discussion about our market access policies. There is no sense in highlighting the fact that the Minister has given Bord Bia €500,000 to expand and target the promotion of Irish beef. For a start, that is a drop in the ocean and, frankly, what is Bord Bia doing with it when prices for consumers have gone up in supermarkets across the UK but prices for producers have gone way down? The demand is there. People want Irish beef, and to know that it is Irish beef, but the people who producing it are not getting paid enough and that is where the Government is continuing to stick its head in the sand. We will very quickly end up in a situation in which we will not have the produce and stock because so many people are getting out of it. So many people are deciding that this is not a space they want to be in and to put their families into. Meanwhile, the Government has a round table - well, good luck with that.  We need a Minister who is a Minister and who is not on a glory tour of the world before he moves to his next Ministry. We need a Minister who actually has the courage to challenge the beef industry and to say to it that at the end of the day it is dependent on the primary producer and it must treat that primary producer with respect, not just with regard to price but with regard to the quality of stock, the input and the way it deals with him or her. We do not have that relationship at the moment. We have a relationship that puts the industry first and the farmer very much second and last in line, and that is across a range of Government policies in a range of different areas in the Department. It cannot last. Surely, at a time of collapsing beef prices, there should be some kind of emergency plan in terms of income? Instead we have seen the farm assist scheme restricted and cracks beginning to emerge in the GLAS programme in the past week, which have been highlighted by Deputy Ó Cuív. In the amendment, the Government is highlighting it as a significant investment for the lifetime of the rural development programme, but we have seen that there are so many restrictions around it that many rural farmers will not actually get into it. What specific initiatives will there be for beef farmers? What specific initiatives will there be to assist with the price of stock, which is what we are discussing here tonight?  The Government talks about the beef genomics and beef data schemes and the beef technology adoption programme, all of which are welcome and significant. However, at the end of the day, when farmers are leaving the beef market, that is no good to anybody. When they are not getting the price for their stock and are trading at a loss of €300 per head, that is no good to anybody. That will not put bread on the table.  Again, we are looking at market access areas. Deputy Ó Cuív has already raised the area of live exports. We seem to have lost the hunger for promoting that. I do not know what will happen in the Department after July, but please give us a Minister with hunger who actually cares about the primary producer and a Government policy that cares for the primary producers in all other Departments. We will get an indication of that next week in the House when the Competition and Consumer Protection Bill is debated on Report Stage and when we will move the amendments we moved on Committee Stage that seek to protect the producer. We will challenge the entire House to debate them and to go and vote either way. Hopefully, Members will decide to protect the producer.  There is no more time for talking, round tables, or, in the words of the amendment, "bringing together farm organisations, beef processors and relevant State agencies to discuss recent challenges." The Government put that up as the first line in its amendment as a significant achievement. They should be coming together anyway. There should be regular dialogue anyway, but it seems that this is a sudden big achievement on the part of the Government when it is included in the first line of the amendment. We need urgency, because it is not there. If anything comes out of these two nights, if urgency is injected into this situation and if the reality of the situation is impressed upon the Department, it will have been successful. I know all the Government Deputies will come in here tomorrow night, troop in behind this amendment and cheer the Minister of State on, but what happens at 9.10 p.m. tomorrow will make no difference to the beef farmers of this country, who will still face huge challenges and the prospect of possibly having to leave the industry. Where will that leave us?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	379	There are 100,000 farms across this country that depend on the beef industry. Out of that group, some farmers are full-time while others are part-time. It is very much down to the structure and fragmented nature of farm ownership that the change that is needed in this area has not materialised over the years. When we examine the industry here tonight, the various contributions will identify the serious loss that has taken place over the past 12 months. The beef industry has been in a serious downward spiral. The beef industry has been an integral part of the Irish agricultural industry.It is worth approximately €2 billion a year to the economy, a statistic which should not be underestimated. Over the past six months, beef prices have plunged by up to 20% while retail prices in the UK are increasing at the expense of the primary producer. Changes in the Internal Market through beef specification restrictions and the external market through trade barriers with the UK via labelling have combined to drive down prices. The Michael Dowling report recommends the establishment of an independent beef regulator which, as Deputy Ó Cuív indicated, we fully support and the opening up of Northern Ireland to live cattle exports. The Teagasc interim survey in 2013 revealed that beef producers earn on average €9,500 per annum. This crisis will be the last straw for many farmers. The bald statistics along with the minimum wage position in other areas in the economy graphically illustrate the needs of farmers. Over the past 12 months, bull beef prices have collapsed with factories altering the age, weight and specifications required to slaughter cattle. Producers have been forced to accept losses of up to €300 per head. Teagasc estimates that producers need to earn €4 per kilo for beef to be economically viable in the long term. The current price of between €3.50 and €3.75 per kilo falls very much short of that requirement. A continuation of the present crisis will have profound implications for exports and employment in the sector. The Food Harvest 2020 strategy targets will not be met if prices continue to stagnate while the viability of the suckler herd is under threat if income levels are not increased. Without direct payments from the EU, beef farms would be out of business. The Michael Dowling report identified a number of issues needing urgent attention, including improved transparency, the potential for producer organisations, more formal contract arrangements between factories and suppliers, the small number of processors in the State and the cartel problem, which is a major difficulty for the industry. The Minister must negotiate with his British and Northern Ireland counterparts. Northern Ireland has a Sinn Féin Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development in Stormont. There is a clear opportunity for our Minister and his counterpart in Northern Ireland to develop an all-island industry. The moment is now and let us get on with it. Live exports to the UK would provide the safety valve for an export-dependent industry. Let us empower primary producers in Ireland. The targets under the Food Harvest 2020 strategy will not be met unless there are radical changes in one of our most important industries. The time for change is now. The Michael Dowling report mentioned specific changes that are needed but, at the end of the day, we need to examine the overall position of the industry and realise where the dynamics lie and where the control and empowerment within the industry lies. We need change quickly. It is difficult to believe that we cannot work towards a position where there is a much more integrated approach to the overall development of the beef industry in Ireland and the UK. There would be a mutual benefit for primary producers and consumers in both jurisdictions. Both ourselves and Britain are members of the EU and there is potential to develop a better, more coherent and more co-operative approach to the development of the industry to ensure its sustainability in the long term. I call on the Minister to realise he must achieve movement on the issues I have mentioned because otherwise we will have no industry. Suckler farmers will go out business and our exports will collapse. They are worth €2 billion annually, which is of significant benefit to the economy and the Exchequer. It is vitally important that the Minister and the Department realise the importance of that statistic and move to implement the changes that are urgently needed.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	380	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and I compliment Deputy Ó Cuív on tabling the motion. Beef farmers, of whom there are many in County Wexford, feel the Minister has lost the plot and has caved into the factories and allowed them to run roughshod over them in respect of beef prices. If the current scenario continues, many of them will go out of business. They will be seeking social welfare payments because they will be unable to continue in farming. I spoke to one of the most progressive farmers in Wexford earlier and he said that payments are down approximately €400 per head or €1.10 per kilo in comparison to last year. He was paid €4.85 per kilo last year but he is in receipt of only €3.70 per kilo this year. He predicts the suckler herd will be halved over the next two years. Prices are reducing and he referred to increased payments and other bills, including the property tax, water charges, universal social charge and health insurance. The beef crisis is jeopardising the livelihoods of 100,000 farmers. A cocktail of retailers, processors and Government inaction is undermining prices and destroying the Food Harvest 2020 strategy targets. Under the strategy, the suckler herd is to double, yet the farming community predicts it will be halved over the next two years. I read last week that many farmers in County Clare are getting out of suckler rearing and that must be a serious concern to the Minister in the context of the viability of the beef industry. The meat factories are changing regulations willy-nilly and introducing new concepts regarding how they define quality but this is being done at the expense of the farmer. Retailers are achieving a higher margin than ever, again at the expense of the farmer. The Minister has not taken action to deal with this. There are a large number of beef farmers in my county. We also have meat factories, which employ many people, that depend on these farmers to supply them. Many jobs have been lost in my area and in every part of the country and we do not want to lose the jobs in the meat plants. Changes in the Internal Market through beef specification restrictions and in the external market through trade barriers with the UK via labelling have combined to drive down prices. While I accept prices have reduced in Europe, prices in Ireland have reduced more. Surely this anomaly needs to be corrected in order that farmers are paid a decent price for their product. The Minister, as previous speakers said, seems to have washed his hands of the issue. Instead of giving decisive leadership, he has convened two summits on the issue but farmers are tired of summits. These are talking shops with no action and no price increases for farmers. He will find it difficult to get the IFA and other farming organisations to attend more summits because, having attended a number of them, payments have not increased to enable farmers to provide a decent standard of living for their families.We do not want any more summits, but action from the Minister. The Government must endorse the Dowling report, establish an independent beef regulator and open Northern Ireland to live cattle exports. The Minister, Deputy Coveney's attempt to side-step the issue while he awaits promotion within the Cabinet is an insult to farmers. I was surprised that the Minister, whose sincerity I have always respected, told farmers he may not be the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine next week or next month. Obviously, he is in line to move to a different Cabinet portfolio. Meanwhile, he should not abandon the farmers but ensure that while he is there he makes every effort to ensure they receive an adequate payment for the product they produce. For far too long the retailers and supermarkets have been ripping off the farming community. I do not blame this Government alone; different Ministers have failed to act on this issue. We have heard may promises of action against the supermarkets which seem to drive down the prices paid to farmers every year. A number of supermarkets are selling products such as carrots and potatoes way below the cost of production. How is that happening? They are forcing down prices and playing havoc with the livelihoods of the farming community. Coming from Tipperary, which has a large number of beef farmers, the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, is well aware of the situation. I hope he will take a direct interest in doing something in a sincere way that will ensure the farming community will have a decent and adequate standard of living. The Dowling report seems to be good. It arose from an initial round-table discussion in April. It emphasised a number of areas that need to be addressed, including improved transparency and timely communication on price and market specification, particularly between suppliers and processors, which is not happening. The report also recommended a formalised mechanism for ensuring that research, breeding and education remain consistent with evolving market realities. It noted the potential for producer organisations recognised under the EU’s Common Market organisation rules to play a role in building scale for farmers in the supply chain and building more professional relationships with the processing sector. There seems to be a "them and us" situation between the farmer who is not receiving an adequate price, the beef factories in the middle, and the supermarket and retailers which are creaming off large profits. These three areas should come together. The Dowling report also flagged the possibility of more formalised contract arrangements between factories and their suppliers. In my county, factories will no longer take a load of cattle from a farmer. A few years ago one could put 25 or 30 cattle into a lorry and the factory would take them all. Now, they might take between three and seven cattle, and might postpone delivery of them until another day or week. It is important that the Minister of State find out why that is happening. While it is to the benefit of the factory and retailer, it is not to the benefit of the farmer. The Government must establish a fully independent beef regulator to oversee the long-term sustainability of the industry and ensure transparency. The concentration of a small number of processors exposes the industry to the threat of cartels, as Deputy Kirk said, which a regulator would help to prevent. A regulator would help promote communication and medium to long-term planning between the facets of the industry rather than the short-termism that is destroying the beef industry. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, will take the message to the Minister that the situation is dire. When I hear very good beef producers in Wexford talking about going out of business, not having a decent standard of living for their families and going to claim social welfare payments, it is time for all of us to wake up and do something about the situation to ensure the beef industry will survive into the future.

I am the first to acknowledge, as does the Minister, Deputy Coveney, that prices are down on this time last year, mainly due to 2013 being an exceptionally high year for beef prices in Ireland. The price per kilo was €3.79 in 2014, €4.07 in 2013, €3.86 in 2012, €3.46 in 2011 when we came to power, and €2.90 in the last full year of the previous Government. Prices are matters to be determined between purchasers and sellers of cattle and it is neither appropriate nor possible for me to intervene directly in this issue. The days of market intervention are gone. My focus is on developing the potential of the beef industry, and expectations that I can intervene in the price relationship are misplaced. It is disingenuous to say that I can intervene. The relationship between processors and farmers is an interdependent one. Farmers and processors always fight their own corners to get the best prices. It is important to acknowledge market evolution in recent years. In 2013, the performance of the beef sector was strong, with output of over 518,000 tonnes, an increase of 5% over 2012. The value of beef exports increased in 2013 by 10% to €2.1 billion. Irish beef prices were 106% of the EU average in 2013 and, notwithstanding recent fluctuations, remain above the EU average. Beef prices are under pressure all across Europe and especially in our key market, the UK, which takes almost 50% of our beef exports. Three weeks ago I compared the UK prices in Sainsbury's supermarkets to ours. The managers of those supermarkets told me we are consistently under pressure in their supermarkets and there is a strong determination by the UK National Farmers Union that they sell only UK beef. That is a real problem which we, as a country, should work together to change in the next few years, if possible.As Deputies will be aware, Food Harvest 2020 outlines a strategy for the development of Ireland's agrifood industry, including the beef sector. My clear focus has been and will remain on delivering on the actions necessary to allow the beef sector to deliver on the targets it set for itself in Food Harvest 2020. It is important at this point to acknowledge the significant existing Government support for the beef sector, contributing towards its development. During the Irish Presidency of the EU, the Government negotiated a CAP package worth €12.5 billion to the Irish agrifood sector, which will see considerable investment within the beef sector. It was acknowledged by almost everybody in the country including the farming organisations and those involved in the industry as well as those who witnessed the performance of the Minister in the talks at first hand. The geonomics programme in the rural development plan is worth up to €52 per year for farmers. Last week at Grange, the determination of farmers to change the industry was evident in the large number of attendees. I attended and saw their determination first hand. In 2014, there is €40 million of national Exchequer funds for the beef sector through a range of schemes. I am pleased to note that €10 million in payments commenced today to farmers under the data programme announced last year. Deputies will be aware that in response to recent issues, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, invited key stakeholders, including farm organisations, beef processors and relevant State agencies, to a round table discussion on the future development of the beef sector. This initiative was intended to provide a useful forum for all main players in the industry to engage positively and present constructive ideas on positioning the sector to address current challenges. Discussions at the second round table included presentations from the ICBF, Bord Bia and Teagasc with the main focus being on the presentation by Mr. Michael Dowling, who had updated his work on the implementation of the beef activation programme. Under no circumstances did Mr. Dowling at any stage recommend a regulator for the industry. In his report, Mr Dowling recommended improved transparency and timely communication on price and market specification between suppliers and processors and consideration of possibilities for more formalised contract arrangements between factories and their suppliers. On transparency, my Department has made a number of improvements to its website in order to facilitate farmers. Arising from the round table discussions, I announced an additional allocation by Bord Bia of €500,000, which brings its total international marketing spending to €9 million. I urge stakeholders to reflect carefully on the proceedings at the first two meetings of the beef forum and on the Dowling report and to take time to engage with each other on its recommendations to find mutually satisfactory solutions to the current crisis. I acknowledge with everyone else that we face a difficulty. We need to co-operate. There is a misconception out there that no live exports are taking place. My Department attaches considerable importance to the live export trade. Total live exports to date this year stand at more than 150,000 head, of which 25,000 went to the UK, an increase of some 3,100 head. These are the facts. There are live exports and the Government will not stand in the way of them. In fact, we will encourage live exports wherever possible. We are in ongoing dialogue with our Northern Ireland counterpart, Ms Michelle O'Neill. I have met her twice in the past three weeks and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has met her on several occasions. There is no issue about meeting her. We will meet her tomorrow morning if it will help. The reality is that the issues are difficult to deal with. What we need is a proactive relationship with everybody to ensure we increase profits for farmers. As a beef farmer myself, I acknowledge the difficulties that exist. However, we will not get results when we condemn the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, who goes to the United States of America and who is currently walking around its supermarkets to deal with the issues. Last week, a Chinese representative visited to help us. We need co-operation and support, not condemnation of the industry.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	382	I thank Deputy Ó Cuív for moving the motion. The Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine raised this issue first at the behest of my colleague, Deputy Deering, and asked that we do some work on it. With that in mind, we set about conducting hearings with all stakeholders, including farm organisations, the meat industry, ICOS, Bord Bia and Teagasc. While the issue initially was about bull beef and the change in the spec for the animals, which was definitely contentious, it became clear that unless all stakeholders sat down together, we would not have a beef industry in future. Nobody could project what sort of future it held. I am a still-active suckler farmer myself and I understand exactly what is going on here. I do not normally sell finished animals, but the issue has a ripple effect down upon us all. When the price is depressed, it feeds back down through the system. I was amused at one stage. I have heard Deputies from the other side condemning the forum as a talking shop, yet part of the motion calls on the Government to implement in full the recommendations of the Dowling report. It seems contradictory. If one is not going to get people together to talk and to provide a forum in which people can thrash out the issues, chaired as this will be four times by the Minister, something vitally important will not be done. Some four or five years ago, we had the very same crisis in dairy when milk prices hit 20 cent per litre. It was unsustainable in the long run for farmers to continue to produce milk at that price. It was then and it is now. We must look at what constitutes a sustainable cost base on which the beef industry will be built. There is a variable in there compared to milk where people buy animals in the open market at different stages in their progression before they become ready for slaughter. We must look at that. A few years ago, the meat industry told us it could process 40,000 cattle per week, but it does not seem to be able to do because markets are depressed. We must look at the big picture, an integral part of which is live exports. Live exports have increased but there is more to be done. Some would say it is sacrilegious to sell sometimes our best and sometimes our poorest animals on the hoof. Without it, the industry will not survive as it does not have alternatives. We must look at that. I hope further progress can be made with the North. There is an issue, but it can definitely be sorted out. At North-South level, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has met regularly with his colleague, Ms Michelle O'Neill. Members of Sinn Féin might also urge the Northern Minister to get proactive with the Irish Government on this. There has been significant investment. Geonomics and the beef data programme are about making improvements. My sons and I are involved in beef discussion groups which help to improve efficiency inside the farm gate. What we must do now is to see that the forum ensures that stakeholders in the industry work towards a single goal. If one does not have a primary product which can be produced for a margin, one will not have an industry.

Everyone acknowledges there is a problem. It has been outlined by the Minister of State in the motion. While everyone acknowledges there is a problem, it will not be solved by the farmers, the factory owners and the Minister firing shots and accusations at one another. Round table discussions, which have taken place, and the actions proposed must be progressed. I looked at average deadweight prices over the past few years. There was an exceptionally high price in 2013 and the graph moves upwards from 2011, 2012 and 2013 compared to previous years. It has now gone back to the level of previous years, which is the topic under discussion. The quality payment scheme was the agreement between the IFA and the factory owners and it is important to acknowledge there is some issue that must be sorted as quickly as possible. The main problem is the reduction in the consumption of beef. In Britain, the reduction amounts to 8% and some of the large multinational stores have seen demand reduced by up to 18%. This means there is a reduction in consumption that does not just affect Ireland. I am glad to note that €500,000 extra is being put in by Bord Bia to market beef and to get people consuming it again. It should be noted that beef prices in Britain are down and there was a bigger gap last year. This is not something exclusive to Ireland. The Minister is not here because he is in the US doing something about the situation. In the last budget, there was investment of €40 million in the beef sector. Actions are being taken and this issue is better addressed by everyone working together rather than by people taking shots at one another.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	384	Fluctuations, or peaks and valleys, in the beef or meat sector are nothing new to this country. Years ago, particularly after periods of firm prices, there tended to be a valley that severely punished the unfortunate people who found themselves exposed in those situations. At present, there is considerable suspicion between various stakeholders. For instance, producers, processors and retailers raise the question of who controls prices apart from supply and demand. There is a certain amount of suspicion and we must spend time dealing with it. People in the beef business tell me that a cartel operates among the slaughtering facilities. I do not know whether it is true and I have no evidence to support it but the suspicion exists. Similarly, people tell me retailers have a controlling influence and there is considerable room for suspicion. In the US, the Government directly controls food prices, particularly beef prices, and sets the price on a weekly basis. There is advance recognition of the price for those producing, processing and retailing and for the consumer. The peaks and valleys carry a major risk. Until there is some regularisation, if not a guarantee, of prices and expectations, we will continue to have these kind of issues. I recognise that the Minister and Minister of State are doing everything possible to ensure the market prevails in a healthy state.  From the point of view of economic recovery, it is also important that the product of the agricultural sector is well recognised on the international market, and that a good price is achieved by the producer so that, as a result, the producer is able to continue to produce product in the future. The first disappointment concerned bull beef, which was referred by other speakers. In the expectation of certain things happening, producers decided to cater for a market they thought was there. It was not, and it disappeared almost overnight. It was hugely disappointing for those involved, who took a huge financial loss. The producers are sore and vulnerable as a result. I would like to have the contentious issues examined in an analytical way, with a view to ensuring we address them in the future.
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	385	I refer to the amendments to the motion. I acknowledge that beef producers are suffering from weakened prices in comparison to last year. This is having a negative effect on farm income and the sustainability of the sector. I met representatives of many farming organisations and farmers who outlined the difficulties they are facing. They are experiencing a difficult time. However, this Private Members' motion is political opportunism at its worst and is an attempt by Fianna Fáil, for political gain, to undermine the Minister when he is working to enhance and improve the markets available for Irish beef at a critical time for the sector. Is Fianna Fáil seriously saying there should be direct intervention by the Minister in the market, to the effect of price fixing? Can the Fianna Fáil Members clarify that point for the benefit of the House and the beef producers of the country? It is a dangerous road to go down. When tabling this motion, Fianna Fáil Members knew the Minister would be in the USA working to ensure new markets are available for Irish beef producers. The Minister should be supported by all Members in these efforts. Over the past year, I have been engaged with farming organisations to increase live market export opportunities from Rosslare port. Progress is being made in increasing opportunities to the UK market. The Minister and his officials have been supportive of these efforts. The Fianna Fáil motion calls on the Government to ensure there is no barrier to live exports to the UK. Members on this side of the House all agree with that and fully support it. Will all Opposition Members support that statement? I will watch with interest to see how the Opposition votes in respect of live exports. This year, live exports have increased by 14% compared to 2013. We should recognise and welcome that. The beef sector is significant for the Irish economy and there has made been an 8% increase in the value of meat and live exports in 2013, rising by €245 million to €3.3 billion. Last week, Chinese representatives were in the country examining the Irish product for export to Chinese markets. This week, US inspectors are carrying out final inspections in Ireland before giving the green light for beef exports to strong markets on the east coast of America. These markets have been closed for over 16 years since the BSE crisis. The sooner those markets open, the better for all involved. Beef prices have decreased this year, which we recognise, but they have dropped across Europe due to weakened consumer demand and competition from other meat products. The Minister's response is to allocate an additional €500,000 to Bord Bia to enhance new opportunities. We should all be working to improve the sector for the sake of all us and the Irish economy.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	386	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the beef sector. At the outset, I acknowledge the vital role the beef sector plays in the agrifood industry and, in turn, the major contribution agriculture makes to the Irish economy. I acknowledge there is a problem with beef prices at the moment.Unfortunately, many farmers are going through a very difficult time. I have spoken to many of these farmers. The terrible winter last year, combined with the poor spring, resulted in high feed costs for farmers and the fall-off in beef prices we are experiencing now means that producers are simply not able to recoup the moneys they invested during the difficult period. We need to find a solution. I believe what we need is a collective approach from producers, processors and farm organisations in order to address this matter. Currently, there is a lack of communication in the beef industry and this is in nobody's interest. We have two main players here, the processors, who are looking for security of supply, and the producers, who are looking for security of return and a reasonable margin. These groups need to come together if a solution is to be found. To this end, the Minister has held a number of round table discussions with key stakeholders. I welcome the fact the Minister and the Department are now considering legislation for the setting up of a producer organisation for the beef industry. This legislation could allow for groups of from 50 to 60 farmers to come together to use their power of supply to negotiate and agree mutually beneficial terms with the processors. We have seen this work very well in the mushroom industry, whereby producer groups can guarantee a continuity of supply to processors and in return, there is stability of price for the producer. I believe there could be similar benefits for the beef industry. This would help to provide an equilibrium of supply and help eliminate the peaks and troughs farmers experience in terms of price. Price brings us back to the core issue of supply and demand. Beef is like anything else. When there is a shortage of supply, prices are high and when there is over supply, prices are low. Producer groups, in conjunction with the processors, could forward plans to try to even out these dips in the market. I reject some of the Opposition criticism regarding the Government's lack of supply for beef farmers. The Government has taken important steps to assist farmers with a €40 million package to beef farmers in 2014, including €23 million for the beef genomic scheme, €10 million for the beef data programme, €5 million for the beef technology adoption programme and €2 million in residual payments on the beef suckler cow welfare scheme. As the Minister has said, the beef data programme will begin to issue in the coming week and this will come as a relief to many farmers who have been anxiously awaiting these moneys in order to meet outstanding bills. The Minister has far from washed his hands of this issue. He has worked tirelessly, as has the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, to expand our export markets and we have seen this work has paid dividends, with the resumption of live exports to Libya last year. There was a further boost last week when the US Secretary of Agriculture stated that he fully expects trade will resume between Ireland and the US before the end of this year. Good progress has also been made in terms of re-entering the Chinese market. Opening these markets would be a huge boost and can only be positive for our beef farmers. As I said earlier, the Minister and the Government are committed to the beef sector and we must all work together to resolve the issues.
#AnthonyLawlor	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-party	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-dob	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	387	I am delighted to be able to speak on this issue. I acknowledge that the beef industry makes a huge contribution to the Irish economy, with almost 100,000 people involved in it, whether on the suckler side or, as in most cases in my constituency, in the finishing of cattle for the factories. The main issue being discussed here is price, but there are other issues that must be acknowledged. Many of my constituents are having problems in two areas, first with getting cattle into the meat factories for slaughter and second with getting confirmation on the size or weight required. Many of my constituents are finishers who end up producing big, heavy, continental type cattle, but they cannot get them into meat factories currently. They are being penalised because of the size of the cattle. Meat factories are now looking for O3 type cattle, which are mainly the beef cattle coming off the dairy sector. This is completely wrong. I know from my experience in the sheep sector that any time I produce a lamb in excess of 21 kg or 22 kg, I do not get paid for the extra weight produced. Something must be done in this regard. The factories must be made pay for the cattle that are brought to them. We must acknowledge what both the Minister and Minister of State have done. It is cynical of Fianna Fáil to criticise the Minister. I was with him last week on a suckler farm in Kildare when he brought the US Secretary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack, to the farm in his effort to open up a market. The key to this issue is improved markets. We have a quality product - grass fed cattle. Look at Europe and the US and it is all corn fed cattle there. We have a quality product we should be selling to the market and must send out a strong message on that. I welcome the €500,000 that has been allocated to Bord Bia. More must be done on that. I also stress that while we are opening up markets, we should acknowledge what has been done in the past. I would like to highlight in particular the Irish Dairy Board, which branded Irish butter as "Kerrygold". Perhaps we should look at this in the context of beef. We must pull the meat factories together, pull Bord Bia together and get Irish beef recognised as a specific brand so the world will recognise it as coming from a grass fed animal and quality produced. What the world needs is a quality product. This is the message we should be sending, instead of sitting here and listening to the bickering coming across from Fianna Fáil, which has no positive outcome at all. Based on what has been going on within Fianna Fáil in the past couple of days, it would rather have Irish agriculture out of Europe. It is important we market our quality Irish grass fed beef properly.
#PatrickDeering	unknown-#PatrickDeering-party	unknown-#PatrickDeering-dob	unknown-#PatrickDeering-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	388	I am delighted to have the opportunity to say a few words on this important issue. It is not too often we get an opportunity to speak on agricultural matters, so it is important to point out the importance of agriculture to the economy. In years gone by, under Fianna Fáil administrations, agriculture was not treated with any respect. Now, for the first time, agriculture is more important than bricks and mortar. Farmers, beef farmers in particular, have gone through an early winter and a difficult spring. We have seen prices collapse in the industry. Prices were artificially high last year and an unreal expectation was created as a result. If we look back over the figures for the past number of years, the average price was €3.79 per kg. It is now €3.67 and at its height last year it was €4.43. An unreal expectation was created at that point. We need to put proper structures in place to ensure the current situation does not happen again. While I acknowledge there is a problem, there is no quick fix solution. There never has been a quick fix solution to the problems. As my colleague, Deputy Doyle, mentioned earlier, we had an issue in the dairy industry three or four years ago. I am well aware of that as a dairy farmer in Carlow. Nobody came to bail me out three or four years ago when I was getting 20 cent a litre for milk. I had to grin and bear it and get on with it. We have difficulties currently, but we must ensure these difficulties do not arise again in the future. We must put proper structures in place to ensure stability for the future. We are ahead of the posse on that, as Deputy Ó Cuív knows well from attending our Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which has been bringing in the different people involved. All the stakeholders have been involved in the committee, producers, factory people, Teagasc and so on. We brought all of these on board to ensure we had a round table discussion. This has been rubbished by some of the Opposition, but round table discussion and getting people together are the only way to sort this, to put proper structures in place and ensure we have stability. As a result of the round table discussions, we have had the Dowling report, which will be key to ensuring stability for the future. The recommendations that have been published must be implemented as soon as possible to ensure we have a proper structure for the future. It is ironic that we are discussing this issue when the Minister is in America trying to get alternative markets. One of the solutions to the issue is an alternative market. It is an issue of supply and demand as we know. More alternative markets are essential. It is important for the Minister to go abroad or to wherever the markets are to try to ensure viable markets for the future. Under the CAP negotiations last year, we got a good deal for agriculture in this country, despite the fact the Opposition might disagree. It is also ironic that the main beef producing farmers are the productive farmers in the south east of the country, as Deputy Browne mentioned earlier. They are the same farmers whose single farm payment Deputy Ó Cuív wanted to reduce to a maximum of €400 per hectare. That is what he wanted to do.
They are the productive farmers who are producing the beef to go to the factories for the supermarkets, but he wanted to reduce their payments to €400 per hectare. At the same time, we had to battle to ensure we got €700 per hectare.

Great words but to be honest, there are lots of people in this society who are fed up hearing members of the Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition telling us that they are acutely aware of our plight. Acutely aware does not cut it, when what we need is action. There are times when the Ministers on the benches opposite are nearly telling us that it is hurting them more than it is hurting us, that this situation is hurting them more than it is hurting the farming community. Well, that will not wash with Irish farmers anymore and it will not wash with beef farmers in particular. Twice last week we had farmers at the door of Leinster House, protesting. They were angry and to be honest, I am angry on their behalf. In my life time I have never seen two mobilisations by the IFA in one week and that in itself tells all of us that there is a crisis in the beef sector which needs to be sorted out. The big retail multiples are reducing their prices while their own profit margins are growing at the expense of farmers. Figures show that in 2013 the farmer received 57% of the average price of beef on the British retail market. The retail price per kilo has risen by 7% but the farmers’ share has dropped to 42% and that is some whack to take. I repeat - the farm-gate price for Irish cattle has fallen by 15% while the price of beef on the shelves of British supermarkets has gone up by 7%. Beef farmers have lost income to the extent that they are in crisis. They have also lost confidence in the Minister who on "Morning Ireland" last week publicly washed his hands of the crisis and said on air that it was all down to the market and he could do nothing about it. He blamed the situation on the market. We know that this Government looks to the rich and powerful and ignores the plight of the more vulnerable, but this one takes the biscuit. Is Simon Coveney so divorced from the reality of beef farmers lives’ that he does not know what is happening in the industry? In response to this crisis he set up a talking shop, called a "round table", where the beef factories’ representatives can talk to each other and tell us that we are all doing fine. I want to see the beef barons before the Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine. We discussed this matter this week and members want to see them brought before the committee. I want to see the powerful individuals who control this industry and not their press and publicity executives, their public relations men or their image consultants. I want to see the beef barons themselves, individually, come before our committee to account for their actions. This industry is too important for the Government to take a back seat and let these people ruin it and ruin the livelihoods of beef farmers and their families. The farmers who were encouraged by Teagasc to rear bull beef but who now find that the prices have collapsed and their sheds are full of cattle they cannot not sell are not impressed. The Minister has sat on his hands and allowed the beef barons to call the shots and to manipulate the market to the extent that some farmers have been pushed over the edge.  There is an individual out there, a beef baron who is known to everyone in this House - whose name comes up decade after decade, not just year after year - who plays a leading role in the beef industry in this State and who, it seems, is allowed to do what he likes to manipulate the market and he continues to do so. He is allowed to own and control a large herd of cattle and at his whim, he can flood the market and collapse prices, which he does. He is not alone in this but has allies scattered around the country. When he wants to, he calls the shots and brings the prices down. When farmers present to his factories with cattle, they are offered a price that is 5% below what they expect so they take the decision not to send their cattle in. Then the beef baron lifts the phone and his people all over the country make sure that he has a supply of cattle, making it almost impossible for the farmer who must sell his cattle to meet his overheads, repayments and so forth not to accept that man's price and the price set by others who control this industry. Nothing is being done about it. This has continued, year in, year out. When the beef barons want to, they can manipulate the market to collapse the prices. Last week, there were demonstrations going on outside by members of the IFA. What happened this week? The price was cut by another five cent. This is what they can do. They are an all-powerful cartel and their representatives are sitting in on the round table discussions. Their representatives appeared before the Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and stonewalled for the duration of the meeting. They are getting away with murder because they are being allowed to get away with it. Any Minister worth his salt would move to control this kind of behaviour, but this Government looks after the likes of him and the small man can go to hell or to the wall. The factories have abused their power and continue to do so. They have changed specifications at will and have driven down prices by penalising farmers who are struggling to put bread on the table. Farmers are tempted to abandon cattle at marts at the moment because the prices being offered are so low. They are not making ends meet and are producing at a loss. The reason they are producing at a loss is that the beef barons are manipulating the market to suit their agenda and continue to do so.  I said in this Chamber last week that many farmers suspect that the beef barons run the industry by this kind of manipulation and by having access, crucially, to the AIMS database. I know that the Minister denies this. Last week the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes was here when I said it and the Minister was not here. He did not turn up to answer questions, but sent along the new Minister of State to answer questions about data management and transparency within the beef industry. In fairness to Deputy Hayes, he did his best to answer the questions. He was in an unenviable position, trying to deny something that everyone knows is true; that they have access to the AIMS database.

That is how they are able to manipulate the market by flooding it when it suits them. It is widely believed that the beef factories have access to the database and to farm financial data, while farmers are not given access to figures collected by the Department on the numbers of cattle slaughtered each week, or, crucially, on the level of inter-trading among the beef factories. Unless the factory managers are clairvoyant, how do they know when finished cattle are coming on stream? The Minister of State cannot sit there and tell me, in absolute terms, that they have not got access.

We can see that the representatives from the beef factories who turn up to the round table circus are always vague and evasive in their answers. No one is prepared to speak about the real situation with regard to slaughtered cattle. This talking shop is going nowhere because it is not getting to the bottom of what is going on - manipulation of the market by the beef barons and the suspicion of access to the database. They know when cattle are coming on and can purchase them at their chosen price.  Will the new transparency promised include the figures for the number of cattle slaughtered and the inter-trading between factories? Is there any evidence of that coming from the round table talks? All we hear is that same old excuse, that this is "commercially sensitive" information. Commercially sensitive for whom? It is commercially sensitive in the context of the profits being made by the beef barons at the expense of the farmers and producers. Commercial sensitivity is used by this Government to protect and back up the beef factories as opposed to protecting the rights and entitlements of farmers and producers. The beef factories will not allow this information to be published. The all powerful beef factories will simply not allow publication of this data. Well, the Minister would want to take a stand on behalf of farmers and not allow the factories to call all the shots, which is what they are doing. They are calling all the shots at the expense of farmers all over the country. We need a beef regulator to oversee how this industry is operating because, above all, it is not fair. It is anything but fair. There should be transparency and equal opportunity for producers, the farmers who produce the cattle. This is not a question of market forces, it is a question of the unfair advantage of the factories who have the figures while the farmers do not. The traditional trade with the North, where cattle dealers came down to the South to buy cattle, has collapsed too. Labelling issues have been used as a pretext to create barriers to that trade. The Sinn Féin Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development in the North, Michelle O’Neill, is happy to go to the EU seeking a derogation on the issue of labelling. She has met representatives of farming groups, including the IFA and has listened to their concerns. She is concerned about current beef prices and has plans to meet the representatives of processors and retailers in the next couple of weeks in order to discuss the specifications which have recently been implemented. She is also extremely concerned about the current labelling situation, which is having a negative effect on the cross-Border trade of cattle. She has raised this matter with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State on a number of occasions and wants their agreement to seek a derogation from Europe in respect of the current anomaly. We want a single island-wide produce label which will not threaten traceability standards. Such a label can be achieved. If the will is there, we can find a fix for this situation.

Who is being penalised in this regard? Again, it is the producers. What happens to cattle when they enter the production chain? If they have had four or more owners, are they sold more cheaply? The answer is "No". Those who are the fifth and sixth owners of cattle are being penalised. When they take their animals to the factory, they are penalised because they have had more than four owners. Right along the food chain, there is no difference in the price. In other words, the customer pays exactly the same price for meat regardless of the number of owners that the animal from which it was produced may have had. Is that not fraudulent? I was contacted earlier by a man who buys large numbers of cattle throughout the country. He informed me that in recent weeks, when he brought animals to the factories, he did not even bother to seek a price. What does that tell the Minister of State? The individual in question has been broken by the way in which the factory owners have manipulated the market for their own selfish ends. They have manipulated it in such a way that they have managed to take everything they can get from producers. That is happening on the current Government's watch. In fact, it has been happening for many years, but no one done anything about it. Action must be taken. The Government must put something in place in order that we might know-----

If it does not do so, those in the industry will continue to do what they want. The people in question are not interested in what is good for Irish producers or farmers. They are only interested in what they can put into their own pockets and in making profits for their shareholders. They do not give a goddamn about producers and never have done so. They continue to get away with what they are doing. It is time the Government grew a pair of balls and stood up to them. It is time the Government took them on and said "Enough is enough". Everyone in this House knows the identity of the main individual involved in this regard. He continues to get away with doing what he has done for many years. He is one of the main people responsible for manipulating the market. Nothing is being done about that manipulation. We need to take action to protect the producers and farmers to whom I refer in order that they might continue to earn viable incomes and live in rural areas. It will not be done by engaging in round-table talks. Such talks are nothing more than a circus whereby the people who manipulate the markets send in their PR people to put their spin on it. They have done the very same thing on each occasion they have come before the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine. We want them to come before the committee individually, and our Chairman, Deputy Doyle - who is very good at his job - is prepared to try to facilitate this. We want to be able to sit across the table from these individuals, look them in the eye and challenge them to justify their behaviour.

I compliment Deputy Ó Cuív and the Fianna Fáil Party on bringing forward this excellent motion. My closest personal friend of many years, Mr. Bernard Collins, who has worked in the Tralee mart for over 35 years, has been warning me for some time about what is happening in the beef sector. We all know that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is for the road, and more luck to him. He is going to be promoted, or whatever one wishes to call it, and I wish him good luck. For the time being, however, he cannot take his eye off the ball and he must concentrate on the job at hand. Round-table talks my eye. Such talks will get farmers and beef producers nowhere. Independent regulation designed to create fairness in the context of the prices the factories are offering is not only necessary, it is vital. I compliment Deputy Martin Ferris on his excellent contribution. He referred to cartels and the fact that beef producers have been ground into the earth. The Minister of State and I are great friends. I wish him every success. He is a sensible, practical man and he is aware that it costs €700 to €800 to keep a cow for 12 months. If it costs that much to keep a cow and if one takes into account the prices the factories are paying for beef at present, then it is obvious that one cannot make money producing beef. What is happening in this country is a disgrace. We had tribunals and investigations in the past, but I am of the view that what is taking place now is criminal. The Minister of State is a sincere individual and I wish to ask him a straight question. What young man or woman would want to take up farming at present? If farmers in Tipperary, Meath and Kildare are giving up and getting out, then what will happen to the farmers in the Black Valley, Glencar and other areas which I represent? Carrying on just does not make financial sense for some people. I apologise for not being present for the Minister of State's contribution. However, I listened to every word he said on the monitor in my office. I am obliged to inform him that he sold himself short when he asked those who brought forward the motion whether they wanted him to intervene in respect of prices, etc. There are two individuals with responsibility for agriculture in this country and the Minister of State is one of them. Both he and the senior Minister are extremely influential and - I say this in a very respectful way - they should throw their weight around. They should put it up to the people who are organising the cartels and who are flying around in helicopters while beef producers are struggling to fill their jeeps with diesel. What is happening just does not make sense; it is neither fair nor right. I appreciate the fact that the Minister of State is a fair-minded man. He must realise that if the senior Minister is falling asleep at the wheel, it is not our job to throw him out of the car. It is our job to wake him up, however, and that is what Deputy Ó Cuív and Fianna Fáil are doing this evening. They are right to do it. The grid should be the grid and if it applies when cattle prices are good, it should also apply when they are bad. The chairman of the Kerry branch of the IFA, Mr. Sean Brosnan, is an excellent organiser and mobiliser of farmers. He and I are acutely aware of what is happening in our country and throughout the remainder of the country at present. Everyone involved in beef production is losing money. There is just no money to be made in rearing and fattening calves and then selling them on to the factories. The sums do not add up. What are the Minister and the Minister of State doing, for God's sake? They should forget about these round-table negotiations, because those who attend are only going to talk rubbish. The targets for 2020 are rubbish and will not be met. It is impossible for such targets to be met when beef producers are literally being killed off. If producers cannot make money, the entire enterprise is going to grind to a halt. The Minister of State knows that I am saying all of this in the most genuine and sincere way. I hope I am talking on behalf of the farmers of Ireland who are producing beef, who are losing money and who are working damn hard. They work all hours of the day and night and they and their families are operating under pressure. They are trying to better themselves and they are just trying to keep going. However, they are not making any money at a time when certain fellows are flying around in helicopters and peeing down on top of them.
