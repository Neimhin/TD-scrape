I look forward to our discourse on the development of North-South co-operation in the health care sector, which affects many people and how the EU director on patient mobility will impact on how patients access services in the future. I advise witnesses that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at this committee. However, if they are directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their remarks. Witnesses are directed that only comments and evidence in respect of the subject matter of this meeting are to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. The committee would like to explore new opportunities and would like the meeting to be as engaging as possible. We are not here to scrutinise ongoing work. We are interested in what opportunities exist in proper North-South health care provision, which are practical, pragmatic and sensible and which follow common-sense protocols. I call Ms Nic Aongusa to make her presentation.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-06 00:00:00	North-South Co-operation on Health and EU Directive on Patients' Rights: Department of Health	1	I thank the committee for inviting the Department to outline and discuss North-South co-operation in the area of health. Co-operation in this area makes sense because the challenges facing health and social care providers, planners, and policy makers on both parts of the island are similar. There is no doubt that patient benefits will accrue from pooling expertise, resources and exchanging good practice. The Department of Health is committed to strengthening and growing North-South co-operation in this area. Members will also be aware that both Ministers for health meet under the auspices of the North-South Ministerial Council, NSMC, to discuss and share experiences on a wide range of issues. This spirit of co-operation is in evidence through the work of Co-operation and Working Together, commonly known as CAWT, which is delivering a number of cross-Border health and social care projects in association with the health and social care services in both jurisdictions and also with the support of EU INTERREG funding. The HSE, as the key agency with responsibility for the delivery of health services, is proactively involved in the development of linkages between the services here and in Northern Ireland. The executive has a small number of personnel designated to lead on this work and to assist with establishing contacts between individual services in both jurisdictions. This work is greatly supported though the HSE's active participation as a leading partner in the CAWT organisation. The HSE and CAWT, with the involvement of the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland and the Department of Health work closely with the North-South Ministerial Council on matters of mutual interest to both jurisdictions. I would like to briefly outline some areas of specific co-operation in health. There is continued engagement between the Department of Health and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety on progressing co-operation in respect of acute hospital services. A clear example of that co-operation was evident in the instant and comprehensive assistance afforded to the HSE and to patients of the north west during the catastrophic flooding of Letterkenny General Hospital at the end of July 2013. The Department of Health has placed on record with the authorities and service providers in the North, in particular Altnagelvin Hospital, its sincere gratitude for that assistance. The needs assessment of congenital cardiac services on an all-island basis, which is currently being initialised, is a pragmatic example of co-operation across both jurisdictions that seeks to create an effective integrated service for the benefit of patients. In addition, a working group established by the Department of Health to determine how best to provide emergency aeromedical support to the ambulance service on a permanent basis has, as part of its membership, representatives from the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety of Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service.The terms of reference of the group include giving consideration, in the medium term, to the potential for an all-island approach to emergency air medical support. The committee will also be aware of the proposed new radiotherapy facilities at Altnagelvin Area Hospital in Derry. The Government has committed capital funding for the unit which will offer huge benefits for cancer patients from both jurisdictions requiring radiation oncology services when it opens in 2016. It will improve geographic access to radiation oncology services for over 500,000 people living in the north west of the island. It will also considerably reduce travel times for patients in Donegal and surrounding areas. The project is an excellent example of cross Border co-operation and great progress that has been made to date to ensure the delivery of the new unit. Officials from both jurisdictions are working together on the service level agreement for the operation of the unit. On alcohol and tobacco, the promotion of health and well-being is very important for all our citizens. There is important and ongoing co-operation between the two jurisdictions on health promotion issues including that of alcohol, which is one of very serious concern. The North-South alcohol policy advisory group, supported by the Institute of Public Health, was set up to undertake work on the issues relating to alcohol availability. This work contemplates examining product, price, promotion, and place, as well as hidden harm, which includes the need to support children with substance-misusing parents or carers. Last October, the Government approved an extensive package of measures to deal with alcohol misuse to be incorporated in a public health (alcohol) Bill. Work is progressing on the development of this legislation which will provide, inter alia, for a minimum unit price in respect of alcohol. This is a mechanism of imposing a statutory floor in price levels per gramme of alcohol that must be legally observed by retailers in both the on and off-trade sectors. Concrete steps are being taken jointly with Northern Ireland to prepare for the development and implementation of policy on minimum unit pricing. A health impact assessment, HIA, has been commissioned in conjunction with our counterparts in Northern Ireland as part of the process of developing a legislative basis for minimum unit pricing. The assessment will study the impact of different minimum prices on a range of areas such as health, crime and likely economic effects. It is expected that the findings from the HIA will be available by the end of quarter 2 of this year. Minimum unit pricing is key to reducing the harm of alcohol in adolescents and problem drinkers. Collaboration with our colleagues in Northern Ireland on the HIA sets a good example of progress which we can make together in tackling the issue of alcohol abuse. The Minister for Health and his Northern Ireland counterpart are in agreement on the need to act simultaneously to allay concerns regarding negative impacts on cross-Border shopping. An inaugural North-South tobacco conference was held in Belfast in November last. It provided a platform for speakers, both local and international, to share their experiences and expertise in respect of tobacco control research and policy. Good progress has also been made in respect of standardised packaging and the general scheme of the relevant Bill has been published and has been referred to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children. The joint committee called for submissions on the general scheme and the first in its series of public hearings on the matter was held on 23 January. I understand the committee is discussing this matter again today. There has been significant co-operation between the Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland and the National Office for Suicide Prevention, NOSP, in respect of suicide prevention measures and the implementation of the all-island action plan is ongoing. Particular actions arising from this approach have included understanding risk issues - particularly for young men - the roll-out of applied suicide intervention skills training, ASIST, and the sharing of training resources. As part of its programme of work over the next three years and in partnership with the Department of Health and the health authorities in Northern Ireland, the NOSP will further develop and implement the all-island action plan, focused on knowledge transfer, sharing of resources and information on programmes that are exemplars of good practice. Suicide is a complex issue and there is no single or easy interventions that will guarantee success. However, by promoting cross-organisation collaboration and the development of networks and partnerships we can maximise the impact of our suicide prevention initiatives. As members are no doubt aware, the Food Safety Promotion Board, or safefood, is one of the six North-South implementation bodies established under the Good Friday Agreement in 1999. It is principally charged with tasks involving food safety awareness, supporting North-South scientific co-operation and fostering links between institutions working in the field of food safety. It has been engaged in a wide variety of projects and campaigns including continuing to support the all-island obesity action forum, the purpose of which is to support the implementation of obesity policies; the "Stop the Spread" public awareness campaign, which was launched in May 2011 to raise awareness that excess weight has become the norm in Ireland and to encourage people to take action; and an independent television production "Operation Transformation", which has been sponsored by Food Safety Promotion Board since 2011. I am pleased to report that e-health is an area in which we are developing very positive and meaningful relationships with colleagues in Northern Ireland. As part of the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union there was very useful co-operation during e-health week in May 2013. The Northern Ireland Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Security, Mr. Edwin Poots, MLA, and his officials were welcome guests at the three-day conference on e-health we hosted in Dublin at that time. The e-health strategy approved by Government and published on 13 of December. It highlights the benefits of e-health from both a jobs and patient-care perspective. We are interested in working more closely with our colleagues in Northern Ireland in this area and we believe there may be potential for an all island approach to e-health. This would have benefits for patients and providers on both sides of the Border. I am of the view that this short presentation has demonstrated the depth and breadth of co-operation between the two jurisdictions in the area of health. We in the Department of Health will continue to foster that co-operation. While I have attempted to give members a flavour of progress on issues of co-operation, it is not been possible to cover all areas in the time available. My colleagues and I are happy to answer any questions members may wish to pose.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-06 00:00:00	North-South Co-operation on Health and EU Directive on Patients' Rights: Department of Health	3	I would like to provide the committee with a brief overview on the application of the directive on the application of patients' rights in cross-Border health care, more generally known as the cross-Border directive. As members will be aware, the vast majority of patients receive health care in their country of residence. However, in certain circumstances, patients may wish to receive their health care in another country, for example, in the case of highly specialised treatment. The new directive seeks to ensure a clear and transparent framework for the provision of cross-border health care within the EU and EEA. In particular, it aims to facilitate access to safe and high-quality cross-border health care; promote co-operation on health care between member states, while fully respecting their national competencies in the field of health; facilitate the reimbursement of the cost of treatment in another member state; introduce a system of prior authorisation for certain categories of treatment; and facilitate efficient transfer of patient information between member states. The directive gives people who ordinarily reside in Ireland the option to obtain the health care that they are entitled to under our public health system delivered in another EU or EEA country. The health service provider abroad may be in the public or private sector. The costs will be borne by the patient and he or she can seek reimbursement for the service from the HSE upon his or her return to Ireland. Reimbursement will be equal to the cost of the health care abroad or the cost of similar treatment here, whichever is the lesser. Similarly, persons resident in other EU and EEA states may use Irish health services subject to appropriate referral. On the transposition of the new directive, there will be two alternative routes for patients who wish to receive planned health care in another member state that will be paid for by the member state in which they reside. The first of these is the long-established route under the relevant EU regulations, commonly known as the E112 route.The second is the new route under the cross-border directive. The main differences between the two routes are the existing E112 route relates only to treatment provided in the public sector; the treatment must not be available in the health system where the health patient lives; the care must be pre-authorised by the home state; and the costs and reimbursement are handled directly between the home member state and the health care provider abroad rather than between the patient and the health care provider. By contrast, under the directive there is no requirement for the treatment to be unavailable in the health system where the patient lives, and patients may access treatment in either the public or private sector in another member state. However, patients must pay the health care provider directly for the treatment and then seek reimbursement from the home health system up to the cost of similar treatment in the home state or the actual amount paid whichever is the lesser. Except where the member state opts to have certain treatment subject to a system of prior authorisation, and this power is limited under the directive, the patient is not required to obtain prior authorisation. Under the directive the member state has obligations to its own residents and to residents in other member states. In the case of Irish residents we must ensure the procedures regarding the use of cross-border health care and reimbursement of costs are based on objective non-discriminatory criteria which are necessary and proportionate; that the procedures are easily accessible and freely available publicly; that requests for cross-border health care are dealt with objectively and impartially; that requests are dealt with in a reasonable period of time, taking into account the specific medical conditions, urgency and individual circumstances of the patient; that decisions regarding the use of cross-border health care and reimbursement are properly reasoned, subject to review and open to challenge in judicial proceedings; and where a patient has received cross-border health care that any necessary follow-up medical assistance the patient may require would be the same as had the patient received the care in Ireland. We must also ensure patients who seek to receive or receive cross-border health care have remote access or be granted a copy of their medical records. Member states have the option to offer patients a voluntary system of prior notification whereby the patient receives written confirmation of the amount to be reimbursed based on an estimate of the costs. This estimate must take into account the patient's clinical case specifying the medical procedures likely to apply. In the case of residents of other member states we must provide information on request about practical aspects of receiving cross-border health care in Ireland. This includes providing information on treatment options, quality and safety, invoices and price information, the applicable fees, and appeal and redress procedures if patients consider their rights have not been respected. Patients must also have access to a copy of their medical records. Draft statutory provisions to fully implement the directive here have been prepared and are being considered by the Department. They will then be examined by the Office of the Attorney General prior to settling. Our aim is to have the necessary statutory provisions in place before the end of the first quarter of this year. In the meantime a national contact point, NCP, has been established in the HSE. The NCP is a key provision of the directive. Its function is to provide information to patients resident here and those abroad considering coming here for services. The NCP will advise on all aspects of the directive, including the terms and conditions for reimbursement of costs and the procedures for accessing and determining entitlements. The NCP has arranged for information on the directive to be placed on the HSE website. I am pleased to answer any questions members may have.

It was due to be transposed at the end of October last, but we did not meet this deadline because of the pressure of domestic legislation. The small eligibility unit I head has been involved in a number of pieces of domestic legislation relating to our health services, some of it quite controversial with regard to private patient charges and changing the thresholds for medical cards for those aged over 70. It has held us up, but our aim is to have the directive fully transposed by the end of this quarter. The HSE has already established the national contact point. Work must be done on pricing procedures. Someone going abroad is entitled to an indication of the level of reimbursement on their return. This means the HSE must have a schedule of prices available for various procedures so patients will know the likely reimbursement on their return and can make decisions accordingly. All of this work is being done in advance of the transposition, which we hope will happen by the end of this quarter.

We strongly recommend people go to their GP to obtain an appropriate referral in the normal way. It is the same as here, one cannot just ring the local hospital and state one wants to go in for surgery; one must be referred. In the same way we expect people to be appropriately referred.

I represent Fine Gael in the Cavan-Monaghan constituency. I very much welcome the directive on access to European health care services. We are almost 20 years into a peace process and on a practical day-to-day basis there must be benefits from the peace process in health care and education for ordinary residents living in peripheral areas, but this has not been driven fast or far enough. Many people along the Border go to GPs in the North. Those living in Monaghan may go to a GP in Armagh. If an emergency occurs family members must drive them to Craigavon Area Hospital rather than getting an ambulance because the ambulance will not cross the Border. These issues need to be sorted out. They are practical measures which should happen on a day-to-day basis for ordinary residents on both sides of the Border. While the directive is welcome it is discriminatory because there is inequality of access. People who do not have money cannot avail of it as one must pay upfront for the service. If one has it one will get it, but if one does not one will not. A European directive should not be framed in this directive.  I will give a practical example of what could be done at cross-Border level with regard to emergency services such as ambulances. For many people in Monaghan who attend the GP in Craigavon or Keady in Armagh the nearest hospital is Craigavon Area Hospital. It is important these services are provided. I welcome the air emergency helicopter ambulance which has been introduced as it has been used a number of times and has been very beneficial in the Monaghan area. I commend the HSE for putting the service in place. With regard to alcohol and drugs, there are Cuan Mhuire facilities in my home town of Ballybay in Monaghan and in Newry. This service is provided by Sr. Consilio who receives no funding from the HSE. The service is badly needed in the area and many of those who attend have alcohol, gambling and drug addictions. They are recovering and may be homeless, but no service is provided by the State in the Border area. A voluntary service provided by Sr. Consilio has had to be put in place instead of having services provided by the HSE, or by the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland. The service is living on handouts and needs statutory funding from the HSE and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland to ensure the service is provided in the Border area. Sr. Consilio would not have needed to open the centre if services were provided by the state on both sides of the Border. More needs to be done.As a first practical step, the HSE needs to engage with Cuan Mhuire and try to provide it with a service. They are getting some ad hoc  funding from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to keep going but there is nothing coming from the HSE. That needs to be addressed immediately. These are the initial points but I would be more than happy to engage, if I can, on the day to day experience of people along the Border. There was hope 20 years ago that services would be developed - some were put in place at the time between Monaghan hospital, Omagh, Dungannon and Craigavon - but the process must be driven much faster. The idea of cross-Border health services is not an abstract thought but it is a practical daily need of people living along the Border. There must be joined-up thinking. Perhaps a small, dedicated team from both the HSE and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland could ensure this can happen. We must remove obstacles so we can achieve a proper level of health care at the nearest hospitals on both sides of the Border.

I agree with Deputy Conlan in regard to the need to improve practical co-operation on a daily basis. Over the years there has been the provision of services by Omagh hospital for Monaghan and a dialysis service from Daisy Hill Hospital for patients in County Louth in particular. That is welcome. The Co-operation and Working Together, CAWT, agreement of July 1992 was the first formal partnership and although there has been co-operation, there should be additional momentum. For those of us living in the Border area in particular, we are fortunate that a very capable hospital has just been built in Enniskillen. The last time I was there I saw that the potential of the hospital has not yet been maximised. If we take the area of Monaghan, Cavan, Enniskillen and Sligo, there is surely a need to deliver services in the area based on a cross-Border context. If there are additional services or new facilities being provided, does the Department or the HSE consult with bodies or account for the needs of health services in the North? We should not provide additional services or new facilities, such as physical infrastructure, on the basis of just catering for our own population in the immediate catchment area. We must factor in the needs of the patients in the North, where such services are also lacking. I hope that in the context of Sligo, Enniskillen, Cavan and Monaghan, we will maximise the potential of the Enniskillen hospital. Services should be provided in the North and South, and I hope the very dramatically improved relationship between North and South will help provide the needed momentum in the health care area. Mr. Barron mentioned that the aim is to have the necessary statutory provisions in place before the end of the first quarter. Does this mean they will be operational from the end of the first quarter or is a commencement order needed? Has this directive been transposed into law in many member states? Is it only applicable where a resident of a member state that has already transposed it into law is seeking a service in another member state that has transposed the directive into law?
#JoeOReilly	unknown-#JoeOReilly-party	unknown-#JoeOReilly-dob	unknown-#JoeOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-06 00:00:00	North-South Co-operation on Health and EU Directive on Patients' Rights: Department of Health	11	I will begin where Deputy Smith left off when he mentioned the Cavan, Monaghan and Sligo area. Before I get into the issue, I welcome our visiting delegations and thank them for the presentation. It is important that we develop services on this side of the Border in our hospitals and there should be a strategy for the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group, as well as Sligo. In my constituency there are the Cavan and Monaghan hospitals, which have services that can be available to people north of the Border. That must be a very important part of our strategy. What is happening in Altnagelvin is good, and I am sure the Chairman is acutely aware of the benefit of that. We have listened to radio programmes for a long time about people travelling on buses to Galway from Letterkenny and Inishowen. These were harrowing stories, so it is a great development. Just as we see the Altnagelvin development, there is an onus on the Department and the HSE to ensure we develop services on our side that will draw patients from the South as well as the North. There must be co-operation on both sides about the use of these services and their rationalisation, etc., and it is important that we gear up the services too. I am very happy that the congenital cardiac services will be provided on an all-Ireland basis. I, along with the Chairman and others, met a very fine delegation of volunteers in the reception area of LH 2000 who campaigned for this issue, as well as parents of children with congenital cardiac conditions. They were campaigning for an all-Ireland centre of excellence. I am happy about that because I was very impressed with the sincerity of the delegation, and we did what we could at the time by going to the Minister. Will a timeframe be provided on that issue and how will it develop in practical terms? It must be very reassuring to parents with children affected by the issue. I subscribe to what has been said about air medical support, which should operate on an all-Ireland basis. Given the size of the country, it does not make sense that it would be otherwise. Alcohol has come into a tragic focus in Ireland in the past week with the events surrounding the practice of "neknomination" and the two fatalities connected to it. The other night I saw one or two examples of horrific posts that concerned the practice. In one post there was a seven year old child and a baby in a cot as the people took part in the practice, and I can confidentially direct colleagues to that post if they are interested. It was horrific stuff to watch. It is a major problem. I know it is not on the agenda here but Facebook has a responsibility to take these types of posts off its website. If it cannot do so, it should be shut down. We cannot have it as it is an horrendous practice; it gives a terrible example and has horrendous consequences. Although it is not strictly in today's brief, it underlines the gravity of what has been said by the delegation about alcohol. I agree about the minimum unit pricing. Will the witness elaborate on how the Department sees that progressing, although I know there is a political dimension to this? Deputy Conlan spoke very eloquently earlier and both he and Deputy Smith could speak about how we have seen cycles over the past number of years. In one period everybody would go north to buy cheap alcohol but in another period they may come south to buy it as pricing changes. People fill their car boots full of very cheap alcohol, so minimum unit pricing is critical. There should also be a standardisation of pricing in the North and South. We must make it a less attractive product for people. A youngster can go out with €20 tonight and buy four pints of beer in a conventional bar, where he or she would drink them in a social environment. That youngster could with the same money buy 20 cans of lager and bring it home to drink it unsupervised and without any social control. That is what we are dealing with, so it is a very big issue. Whether we like it or not, there is a correlation between pricing, consumption levels and addiction. Will the witnesses comment on how they see the process evolving practically, what is being done and from where progress will come? There is also the issue of tobacco packaging. Empirical findings suggest that if plain and unattractive packing is used, it will have an impact on young people starting to smoke. The Minister is right in going after that issue. We have heard about other practical issues, such as the doctor-on-call system.My colleague, Deputy Conlan, might have more specific information on the matter due to his location. My understanding, and please correct me if I am wrong, is that we have not developed a satisfactory doctor-on-call system, north and south of the Border. That should be an area of practical co-operation that we could achieve and that would be efficacious on every level. I ask the delegation to comment on the matter and I am happy to be corrected if I am wrong. I know that it was not the case some months ago and presume nothing has changed. Similarly, we do not have an adequate cross-Border ambulance service. I mean an ambulance that would work in a Border radius area, would pick up people on either side of the Border and be able to travel to Enniskillen, Cavan, Monaghan or whatever is required. That is an important issue. Obviously the points made on food safety do not merit repeating because they were adequately made. They are also very important points. I wish to make a general observation. I agree with the colleagues who have expressed frustration with the lack of progress to date in the area. Surely, health is an area that we can achieve co-operation on and should not be so politicised. Health is not about flags or emblems and is universal. Illness is universal and does not respect religious or social barriers. Education is another sector but is much more politicised and problematic. The delivery of health services should be a classic area for co-operation. I know that the Department's bona fides are sound and it wants to co-operate but a lot more should have been achieved. Does the delegation agree with my broad observation that not enough has been done, we could have done a lot more and should quickly make up for lost time?

I apologise as well because I could not possibly have the eloquence of my friends from Cavan or even worse my friend from Ballybay but I shall make an attempt. I am a former GP and warmly welcome the potential for the cross-Border directive outlined by Mr. Barron. It is interesting and exciting and I want to see it in action. I shall be brief and have one or two simple questions. What, in the name of God, is stopping further practical patient-oriented co-operation and health? There is no issue more frustrating for people along the Border than the flexibility on that, in both directions but probably on balance slightly more going North than those coming South. I do not want to incriminate myself too far. I abused the British system for years because I was aware of dozens, if not hundreds, of people from Donegal fabricating an address in the North so that they could access health care. I have never mentioned this before and I do not wish to make a song and dance about it but it was a scandal for all sorts of reasons. That frustration exists. The British side or the British National Health Service has tightened up significantly and has managed to sift all of these people out of the system. Therefore, somebody living in Donegal today has great difficult accessing the North but 15 or 20 years ago - and I do not want to say any detail because probably some of it was slightly fraudulent - people were desperate to access health care. That is not justifiable, whether it is surgery or an item of health care. The witness wisely mentioned pricing. We know what pricings are here in the VHI system. We know what pricings were in the North under fund holding 15 years ago. We gave up fund holding because the bureaucracy around it was more than the clinical care. It is easy enough to price things. A price can be put on a gall bladder or appendix removal. There is space and accommodation. At times there are queues for some issues in the North but there is always accommodation around the system as well. There is always vacant accommodation around the system.  My colleague here wisely mentioned the Enniskillen hospital. I am very worried about the Enniskillen hospital because it needs more customers, to be put at its simplest. Those customers could be people living in Blacklion or similar places along the Border. It could equally be people in the South and south of Donegal on the other side. It is not beyond the wit of man to get some of this together.  I have a lot of time for Co-operation and Working Together, CAWT, the various organisations, and Mr. Tom Daly and his efforts. From what I have seen, our bureaucracy on both sides of the Border seems incapable of defining the barriers and removing them. Everything is perfect in theory and practice but we do not seem capable of getting it to the final stage and over the line. Nothing would create more satisfaction in people's minds, on both sides of the Border, than opening up flexibility. I shall not go into a ream of detail on the matter but shall suggest one simple thing. There can be a trade-off. People on the southern side of the Border would warmly welcome, as Deputy Conlan has outlined, access to primary care, GPs and similar in the North and early, simple and straightforward secondary care. If it came to a complicated situation there might be a decision made that a person must be referred back to Dublin or whatever. We have a problem in the North which is being highlighted at the moment by congenital cardiac surgery that you guys are tackling and I thank them for doing so. That could have been tackled a wee bit more sensitively and with a wee bit more political understanding. The initiative is almost over the line, if not over the line already. There is a need for high quality coronary care and there are facilities in the North. The Minister in the North would like to create a second set of facilities around Altnagelvin which would serve Donegal and other areas. That initiative must be got over the line because if one's father, mother, brother or sister is dying with a heart attack one is not terribly choosy as to who will save his life. That is essentially what we are talking about here - getting people in remote rural areas, within an hour or less than hour, to a catheter lab where the clot or whatever is threatening their life can be removed. Other issues can be traded off in a southern direction. We desperately need a plastic surgical unit dealing with burns. We have a small but very significant number of people, on both sides of the Border, who have been very badly disfigured and scarred. However, we do not have a coherent unit to deal with burns on the island. There are some good people in the North who work at the discipline but they have at least one hand tied behind their backs and the same happens in the South. There is another issue around obesity. There is a desperate need for an all-island obesity service where surgeons can take out bits of bowel or whatever in order to help those people who are unable to control their weight. I have outlined a number of niche markets and issues where there is no major coherent service, North or South. There can be a coherent service on both directions and must of it can be located in Dublin. It would lead to a win-win situation. As Deputy Conlan suggested, we could have a flow northwards at primary care level and there can equally be the same for highly specialist and niche markets or rare diseases. I congratulate the delegation. I am not levelling any accusation against any of the people here because I know the work that they have done. We must find the driver, somebody or something that will make more happen quicker because health initiatives should not be so slow. I want to know if there have been issues in the North. I have regular conversations with Edwin Poots. Regardless of politics, he has made it very clear to me that he has signed up for as much cross-Border co-operation on health as he can and it is not a political issue with him but a humanitarian one. Therefore, we must find the ways and means. Are there medical obstacles? Is it the medical profession?

Everybody accepts there is goodwill towards the project and no one seems to be opposed to it. There is an argument that it is not delivering the results as quickly as we would like. I would like to concentrate on what Mr. McDonnell refers to as people guarding their patches. If there are difficulties in respect of the system, is there a way of better co-ordinating it? Under the current system, the Ministers meet and the officials meet. Can another layer be established or is there a need for a conference bringing people from medical backgrounds together with those who are concerned with patients' rights? They could look at the gaps in services and what we could do better. Has that ever been done? Would that be a helpful way of moving forward? Yesterday, a group based in Maynooth, AIRO, made a presentation on its work to map needs and services throughout the island, particularly along the Border. The group focused on the limited number of services and time critical issues such as travel times for accident and emergency cases, coronary care and strokes. Co-operation on these matters is a real benefit for communities. One of the questions is whether the Department works with groups like this to map services along the Border. Does the Department provide support to map services and plan for cross-Border services in accident and emergency, coronary and strokes? We are familiar with the golden hour. How does this operate in respect of choosing between going to Louth hospital or Newry? What co-ordination exists? Mr. Barron referred to the directive that is to be introduced. Is there anything we can do in respect of the resources? What is needed to speed it up? It makes sense in respect of cross-Border services. Is there something the committee can do if there is a delay? The witnesses referred to what is available to people, including the E111 card. Is there a difference between jurisdictions? If I travel across the North and I am involved in an accident, I may be provided with services. Is there a difference if a similar thing happens to me in Spain or France? As an example, someone was recently involved in a serious accident in Spain. The person has been sent a bill for €8,000 because the person did not produce the E111 card. The person had it on a mobile telephone but this was not acceptable. The card has to be produced. Are there anomalies in the system that must be ironed out? We can talk about it later. The witnesses also gave the example of people looking for care outside the jurisdiction. What are the options for people waiting for access to a paying doctor for one and a half years while on all sorts of medication that is making their condition worse? Rather than waiting for a year or a year and a half to see an ophthalmologist in Tallaght hospital, can I opt for this? What is the deadline? Regarding specialties, do difficulties exist if Crumlin hospital or Newry hospital must upgrade services? If there is a lack of service in respect of certain specialties, what can we do? I am thinking about this committee and trying to encourage the cross-Border element. The witnesses must come back to us with recommendations that we can put forward to change the system. We are not looking for negativity for the sake of it but an improvement to services. That is what we are all looking for.

In this area of health, progress has been made. Health is more positive than many areas. As Mr. McDonnell said, there must be a key driver of all issues and the opportunities for more co-operation. I am interested in current arrangements for cancer care in the north west. Ms Nic Aongusa referred to this but perhaps she can repeat the point.

Much of what I wanted to say has been said. I welcome the progress made but we have a long way to go. Everyone has goodwill towards this. Like Deputy Conlan, I live along the Border in Dundalk. I do not understand why an ambulance from the North cannot come into the South and vice versa. In emergency care, this point must be addressed. I refer to the options for people with disabilities to access special care across the Border. This applies to the search for paediatricians. In my area, there is no orthopaedic paediatric surgeon in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital. It is a centre of excellence, and despite numerous questions I have submitted seeking details, I have yet to receive a response. From sitting in the hospital for up to eight hours waiting for an orthopaedic appointment, I know people can go across the Border and access it more easily and quicker. This is not available to us. What plans exist in this respect? At the moment, the facilities are not in place.We have spoken about nomadic people with various addresses but I actually know of people whose children have special needs who have moved across the Border. They have upped and moved across the Border because they could access treatment and services in Newry that they could not get in Dundalk. That is appalling and it must be addressed urgently. I recently dealt with a mother whose son had applied for funding under the treatment abroad scheme for a very rare condition. He had been assessed and accepted by a hospital in England, which would provide the required treatment. When he came back and applied to have that treatment, he was told that the treatment was available in Ireland and his application was refused. What is the criteria for qualification under that scheme? When he checked the situation here, the orthopaedic specialist he saw in Cappagh Hospital told him that he would have to go to England for treatment. He was assessed and accepted for treatment. The witnesses may know of the case to which I am referring. I know the individual returned to England for some treatment but has been experiencing problems again in recent months.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-06 00:00:00	North-South Co-operation on Health and EU Directive on Patients' Rights: Department of Health	22	I apologise for being late. The former Taoiseach Brian Cowen once referred to the Department of Health as "Angola" because there were so many landmines going off. I appreciate that the witnesses do a great job and work very hard in very difficult circumstances. However, it sometimes seems that the Department of Health, those working for the health services, such as doctors and consultants, and HIQA do not follow up on their convictions and leave politicians holding the line. Perhaps the press does not listen to them but they should state what it the best approach for our health services. It should not be left to politicians to hold the line. I come from Roscommon and at the mere mention of Roscommon County Hospital, people say "Oh my God". Roscommon county has a population of a little over 50,000, with just over 5,000 living in Roscommon town. Those living in north Roscommon, where I live, travel to Sligo for treatment, while the people of south Roscommon go to Ballinasloe. Therefore, there are approximately 25,000 people living in the catchment area for the hospital. The accident and emergency department at the hospital had no cardiac surgeon, no paediatric surgeon, nobody to incubate and no anaesthetist for overnight cover. How can that be called an accident and emergency department?  I was in Dublin just over two years ago discussing this with representatives of the Department of Health. Everyone told us why the accident and emergency service could not remain in the hospital. The consultants wrote that the department was unsafe. HIQA said that the consultants could not remain in the department because they would be de-skilled. Then all hell broke loose and everyone went to ground. The Department of Health did not get the message out. HIQA decided that it would not follow up on what it had said at the meeting because it did not want to be political. The consultants who wrote the letter said nothing and the GPs and doctors all went to ground. They left this unfortunate politician to hold the line. I know that everyone here will agree, privately, that it was the right decision to make. It would have been crazy to allow the accident and emergency department to remain open. That is irrelevant, however, because the people of Roscommon think that people will die. Nobody has died in two and a half years and at least 50 lives have been saved because there is an air ambulance in place. Paramedics and advance paramedics are saving lives. The Department and others running our health services must stand up sometimes and not leave the politicians holding the line. I will always be the politician who closed the hospital. The hospital is actually twice as busy. The urgent care centre is as busy as ever and by the time we are finished, the hospital will be five times busier and twice as big. The witnesses here know that and I know that. How can we get that message out? It should not be left to the politicians to hold the line because nobody believes politicians or even wants to believe them.  In terms of the media, both local and national, it is a race to the bottom. They want to report the worst case scenario. I am disappointed in the Department of Health, HIQA, GPs and consultants. There is a saying, "What is the difference between a consultant and God? God doesn't think he's a consultant". The witnesses here have a job to do. I would like to hear their observations on that. What happened was they allowed a vacuum to be filled. I am not blaming them. I am blaming the whole system. I am blaming politicians too. Politicians will try to take credit for some things. They should stand up. We need impartial people to come out and state the facts. That is what happened in Mallow. The situation regarding the accident and emergency department in Mallow was very similar but three consultants there came out and said that closing the department would be the best move in the context of patient safety. They said that the people should go to Cork, end of story. In Roscommon County Hospital, the three consultants wrote a letter stating that the department was only useful when, probably once in every four years, there might be a car crash within a mile of the hospital. I asked them why they did not say something when 5,000 people were outside the hospital, protesting at the closure of the department. They said it was more than their lives were worth to say something. All I am saying is that the witnesses have a job to do and it is a difficult one. However, there are times when they cannot leave politicians alone, defending decisions. The air ambulance service is an enormous success and must be retained. Now it is time to get an air ambulance in the North too. The air ambulance from Athlone will cover most of the south. An air ambulance in the North could serve the people north of Athlone. This is cross-Border co-operation that will save lives. It is imperative to examine the possibility of having two air ambulances.  I am sorry to have spoken at length earlier. I was not having a go at the witnesses but was saying that something must happen and the witnesses cannot leave politicians high and dry.

It is also an emotive issue but there are practical solutions to hand. We want to help and we want to contribute. I will give the witnesses an opportunity to respond but before doing so, I wish to acknowledge the fact that 2016 is the target for the opening of the radiotherapy centre in Altnagelvin Area Hospital, which will cater for a catchment area population of 500,000. That is very welcome. I wish to pick up on a point made by Deputy Feighan and others about paramedic and ambulance cover. I do not know what the situation is in County Louth but I am aware there is good co-operation between Altnagelvin Area Hospital and Letterkenny General Hospital. I am not sure that the public is aware of that, however, so we have a job to do in terms of letting people know the true situation.  I am not seeking a comment on the tragic case of Ms Porter who died at the side of the road in Carndonagh, having waited for 50 minutes for an ambulance, because that is currently the subject of a HIQA inquiry. I welcome the fact that such an inquiry is taking place. A few miles down the road from that incident, however, there were ambulances at Altnagelvin. There were also ambulances outside Letterkenny General Hospital but Ms Porter's family could not get an ambulance for their mother, who was dying at the side of the road. On top of that, the helicopter service was en route from Malin Head to Sligo at that time. There are opportunities for joined-up thinking.  The Minister for Health is on record speaking about the potential for Enniskillen, Sligo, Altnagelvin and Letterkenny to co-operate in the context of air ambulance and paramedic services. I invite the witnesses to comment on that. What is the current standing of the proposal in the Department? Sometimes we as politicians talk about cross-Border co-operation as if it is a simple matter. At a political level, the Health Minister, Mr. Edmund Poots MLA, and the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, are working together and agreeing solutions but sometimes the implementation proves difficult. Perhaps the witness could elaborate on the difficulties they are encountering. Are there turf wars or cultural barriers? Is it the case that people have a difficulty with doing something new? Is it down to the human condition? Are we creatures of habit, used to doing things in a certain way? The witnesses are responsible for the Twenty-six Counties.What are the difficulties and what are the barriers to the common-sense practical solutions we naive politicians think should happen in the morning? This may be something we need to find out. I thank the members for their contributions and leave the last analysis and feedback to our guests.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-06 00:00:00	North-South Co-operation on Health and EU Directive on Patients' Rights: Department of Health	24	I am the senior person in the Department of Health with overall responsibility for North-South co-operation. As is evident from the discussion, the areas of co-operation span many parts of the Department. Therefore, in a few minutes I will ask my colleague, Charlie Hardy, a principal officer in the acute hospital division, to deal with some of the issues committee members have raised about emergency and hospital services. Issues were raised also about GP cross-Border services, and my colleague, Paul Barron, will deal with those. He will also cover the various issues relating to the cross-Border directive. I will take a few minutes to deal with some of the other issues. A general question raised by a number of members, including the Chairman, concerns the fact that while there is significant good work under way in cross-Border co-operation on health, there is much more that could be done. The Department of Health would agree with that. There is very close co-operation at official level between our Department and our colleagues in the North. The Secretary General of the Department meets his counterpart in the North, Andrew McCormick, regularly - several times a year. There are also regular meetings at official level across the spectrum of North-South issues. A question arose as to whether there is a process by which new areas of co-operation can be explored, other than through the usual liaison between officials. Deputy Crowe mentioned conferences and special events. We have done that in the past and would consider doing it again. I mentioned the successful cross-Border conference on tobacco. We also had one on e-health in Dublin during our EU Presidency, on which we had very active engagement from Minister Poots and his officials. Under the formal mechanisms, the parties involved are in regular contact to decide on priorities. At the most recent North-South Ministerial Council plenary session, it was agreed there would be an exploration in each sectoral area to establish whether there were additional priorities that could be progressed. That exploration will take place in the health area and we will certainly take into consideration the various issues raised here in this discussion. The issue of alcohol was raised and there were questions and concerns about minimum unit pricing. We have a North-South alcohol policy advisory group in the Department, which was set up by the chief medical officers of both jurisdictions in 2012. This group has been doing significant work on assessing the evidence for the alcohol policy that has been agreed. The Government has approved an extensive package of measures to deal with alcohol misuse, including the drafting of the public health (alcohol) Bill which will include provisions for minimum pricing. Concrete steps are being taken to address concerns about minimum pricing. I mentioned research that has been commissioned, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Public Services in Northern Ireland, to model the impact of the minimum unit pricing on alcohol consumption in both jurisdictions. As well as looking at the health impacts of alcohol consumption, the impact assessment is being required to look specifically at the likely effects of different minimum prices on a range of areas, such as crime and the economy North and South. A Sheffield university has been awarded the contract to carry out the wide-ranging impact assessment, and it is anticipated the research will be ready by the end of quarter two of this year. I expect the study will address some of the concerns people have had about the economic effect and, possibly, the effect on levels of crime in Border areas. Minimum pricing is a tool which addresses the issue of alcohol that is cheap relative to its strength, and all the evidence has shown that its use is more effective in terms of targeting at-risk drinkers, particularly young people. Some committee members mentioned the recent controversy concerning the so-called Neknomination. Young people are attracted to buying cheap alcohol at very low prices, and minimum unit pricing has been shown to be the most effective way to deal with that. It is more effective than increasing excise duty across the board in terms of addressing this issue. Senator White asked about the cancer radiotherapy centre in Altnagelvin. That unit is due to open in 2016 and the Irish Government has committed once-off capital funding of a ceiling of one third of the cost for radiotherapy facilities at the centre. The unit will provide access to radiotherapy services to more than 500,000 people. Approximately 10% of patients from the Republic will continue to receive more specialist treatment in Galway or Dublin. Republic of Ireland patients receiving radiotherapy in Altnagelvin will continue to have their diagnosis, surgery and other treatment planning in either Letterkenny or Galway. Agreement was reached with the Northern Ireland authorities on the revenue costs, and discussions are under way for a service level agreement which will finalise the agreement between the two jurisdictions for the radiotherapy services to be provided in Altnagelvin. This is very much a success story in terms of North-South co-operation.

Currently, there are cancer centres in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford and an outreach service in Letterkenny for breast cancer. Patients from the north west are seen in the appropriate centre, depending on the particular cancer. For example, radiotherapy centres are provided in St. Luke's Hospital. Currently, a consultant from St. Luke's visits Letterkenny once a week and refers patients to the St. Luke's network, which is St. Luke's, Beaumont and St. James's hospitals. When the Altnagelvin unit is opened, patients from the north west will have access to that unit.

Approximately 90% of patients in the north west will be able to avail of facilities at Altnagelvin.

By the time they require radiotherapy, they are at the start of a slippery slope. Perhaps they will get better, but when people need radiotherapy, it is usually because the cancer has spread. What are the chances that these people will be able to access surgery in Altnagelvin or elsewhere at some stage? There is a world class cancer centre in Belfast. Professor Patrick Johnston, a proud son of Derry and soon to be Chancellor of Queen's University Belfast, effectively set up that centre. What are the chances of tapping into that resource? If somebody has a tumour, the sooner he or she has surgery, the better. I do not suggest they should wait for treatment in the North, but surely it is worthwhile trying to access any space available for surgery in the North, rather than wait six weeks or three months to have surgery in Galway, Dublin or somewhere else. How soon treatment or surgery can be started is a vital issue for people who are diagnosed or whose relatives are diagnosed with cancer.

It is a step-by-step process. A very good example of how this can be done is the radiotherapy centre in Altnagelvin. I will hand over to Charlie Hardy in a moment to talk about the other work that is under way in the hospitals area. There is huge potential there as we continue to strengthen the links at official level. I mentioned that our Secretary General meets with his counterpart but I also know that our chief medical officer, Tony Holohan, has a very good working relationship with his counterpart. Our chief nursing officer, Siobhan O'Halloran, has a very close working relationship with her counterpart in the North. This is a work in progress. We will continue to work to foster and develop those links and look at other services that can be developed. I will hand over now to Charlie to talk more about the hospital issues.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-06 00:00:00	North-South Co-operation on Health and EU Directive on Patients' Rights: Department of Health	31	Recent developments in the State have been moving towards the organisation of hospital groups, leading to hospital trusts. The report was written by John Higgins who happens to be a Tyrone man working in Cork. He is well aware of the North-South dimension. Built into the report was the need to ensure that in strategic plans for the bigger groups there would be North-South co-operation and networking of hospitals across the Border. I do not think there will be cross-Border groups or trusts at this stage but networking across the Border is a very important element of the strategic plans the groups are being asked to draw up in the next few months. A strategic advisory group is meeting as we speak. John Higgins is part of it and it will look at the services generally. That is something will be kept on the agenda. We will build on the work of Co-operation and Working Together, CAWT. In the past there were very good examples of cross-Border co-operation and they will be built into the strategic plans of the groups, in particular those groups relating to the north east and west north-west, which are conjoined with the Border. As well as that, there is a proposal to draw up a steering group between the two Departments to deal with hospital co-operation in particular. We will work with colleagues in Northern Ireland to set that up in the future. That will give some element to the co-ordination to which reference was made. As regards the emergency ambulance situation, I know that calls have been made across the Border to the North and the South for ambulance transfers in emergency situations. There are developing links and good communication in many areas on that and the National Ambulance Service is anxious to improve on the links and will work to do that as much as it can. The aeromedical service has been very successful, as Deputy Feighan acknowledged. It is being reviewed at the moment. We hope to enable it to continue in the best way alongside the proposal that has emerged for a northern aeromedical service that will be complementary, exactly as has been described. The discussions are at an early stage at this point. The policy in the North was not to have an aeromedical service but the view on that has changed and we are working together to see whether we can have a joint aeromedical service to complement the service being established in the State as well. That will be very positive, in particular for Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal. Again, in the north west we have heard about Altnagelvin but there are also proposals on the table for north west cardiology. When Bill Maher, the CEO of the west north-west group, and his chair, Noel Daly, went to Altnagelvin to thank them for all the good work they did to assist when the flood took place in Letterkenny they raised the issue again. While resources are very tight and it is very difficult to carve out resources to make progress in many of those areas at the moment, they are working with colleagues in Altnagelvin to see how that could be advanced as well. There will be no change in any service in that area until it has been put in place and piloted and we can see what the results are on a broader front. Again, that would apply to the group plans that have been put in place there too. Reference was made to congenital cardiac surgery and paediatric cardiology. That has been worked on for a long time and there has been good co-operation. Up to 29 cases involving children from Northern Ireland were treated last year in Crumlin hospital in Dublin. They are working on a new service level agreement as an interim measure to deal with the service west. An internationally-led expert assessment is to take place, which is due to finish at the end of June. The assessment will describe the existing hospital services in both jurisdictions, outlining options for service configuration and governance arrangements. The experts will report to both Ministers jointly and recommend an approach to an appropriate model that meets the population needs and other requirements in both jurisdictions. We can expect a report from the internationally-led group, which is well supported in terms of the requirements it needs to bring the report forward. In addition, we have looked at the situation in Enniskillen. We think there is great potential for cross-Border co-operation with that hospital. There will be two-way traffic. We are determined to try to ensure that two-way traffic takes place and that everybody gains the maximum from the situation. I will take back the ideas that were spoken about in terms of obesity services, the paediatric surgeon and other ideas. I can feed them back into the system in terms of considering the strategic options and the group strategic plans that will be brought into play in the next few months. That generally covers the issues. I will come back if anyone wants me to follow up on any issue.

He is on the spot and he knows. We need the drivers to be in place. With all due respect, reports and meetings between the Secretary General and his counterpart mean nothing.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-02-06 00:00:00	North-South Co-operation on Health and EU Directive on Patients' Rights: Department of Health	42	I am conscious of time also. A number of questions were raised about the EU directive so I will try to deal with them as quickly as I can. There were also questions on cross-Border GP care, which also falls into my area. Deputy Conlan suggested that the directive is discriminatory. The directive is European legislation not domestic legislation. If it is discriminatory it is not because the State wants to have discriminatory legislation. In my opening remarks I very briefly compared and contrasted the two routes, as I described them. It is fair to say that the new route under the directive might not suit everyone because it involves one having to pay upfront and seek recruitment. I take the point that it might not suit on every occasion but the other route still exists – where one does not have to pay upfront – albeit one is limited to availing of public facilities rather than private facilities. There is good and bad in respect of each route. One of the important roles the national contact point will play is to provide advice to people so that they can make decisions as to which route they wish to follow. Deputy Smith inquired about my commitment to the end of the first quarter. The intention is that at the end of the first quarter we would have full implementation and that on or before the end of the first quarter the Minister would sign the commencement order and then we are in business. There would not be a further lead-in period. Hopefully, from the beginning of the next quarter we will be up and running legislatively. Deputy Smith also inquired about the number of member states. To the best of our knowledge, as of the end of last year, only seven member states out of the total had transposed the directive. That is no excuse for us not having done so but the fact of the matter is that only seven member states have so far transposed the directive. Our understanding is that the UK transposed it at the very end of December. Deputy Smith then asked a supplementary question on the position whereby some countries have transposed the directive and others have not.The position at present is that it is not open to residents here to avail of the directive and to go abroad because we do not have a system in place to enable them to be recouped. However, for those countries that have transposed, it is open to their citizens to come here because their home member state will recoup them. Consequently, until such time as we have transposed, it is not open to people here to avail of the provisions of the directive, unfortunately. There have been a small number of inquiries to the HSE and the position has been explained to them. Our understanding is that people are prepared to wait for the few weeks until the directive comes into operation. Deputy Crowe kindly asked whether there was anything the joint committee could do and we are grateful for the offer. The position is that through no fault of our own, there was pressure of business following on from the Presidency and so on and we had a backlog of legislative work. Much of that backlog now has been cleared and while a number of issues are ongoing, this one is very much a priority. We have engaged a legal draftsman to help us and the matter is very much in train. As I stated, we hope to have the directive transposed by the end of the quarter. Consequently, while we are grateful for the offer, I do not think any further assistance is required at this stage. The Deputy also asked about differences between countries and I suppose an important point to make is that what I described this morning are two routes for people to avail of elective treatment abroad, whereas the Deputy's example pertained to an emergency situation. Generally speaking, such emergency situations in the European Union are dealt with under what used to be known as the E111, and which now is known as the European Health Insurance Card, EHIC, which sits beside the two routes. It is getting complicated now, in that there are two routes to avail of elective treatment abroad and then in addition, the EHIC is there to assist if one is on holidays or whatever abroad. My colleague, Mr. Tom Monks, sits on a European grouping that oversees these various measures and it appears as though there can be difficulties in certain jurisdictions, Spain being one of them. If the Deputy has a specific case in mind, we might be able to provide him with some assistance. Senator Moran raised a specific case and while we are not familiar with the case in question, we would be happy to talk to the Senator about it. One condition that applies at present is that a person going abroad under the current E112 arrangement must have sign-off by the Irish consultant. I do not know whether that arose in this case but we can talk to the Senator about that. Some questions in respect of GP out-of-hours services were raised by Deputy O'Reilly and Mr. McDonnell - I am unsure whether he has any other designation. Our estimate is that in the case of approximately 65,000 people, their nearest GP out of hours is across the other side of the Border. Consequently, a pilot project allowing patients in Inishowen to attend out-of-hours GP services in Derry came into operation as long ago as January 2007. A second pilot project, allowing people resident in south County Armagh to obtain the service in Castleblayney, commenced in November 2007. Since commencement and up to 31 December 2013, approximately 700 patients from Inishowen received services in Derry, which is an average of approximately eight per month, while 2,300 patients from south County Armagh received out-of-hours services in Castleblayney, which is an average of approximately 32 per month. Both jurisdictions are involved in monitoring this on an ongoing basis. There were proposals to extend the trial to cover Blacklion, County Cavan, and Pettigo, County Donegal, to assist people on the opposite sides of the Border. Initial discussions took place with local GPs but there did not appear to be a great deal of interest. However, if there is a particular interest in it, we would be happy to take this up again.

I acknowledge much work has been done and am aware of the work of Co-operation and Working Together, CAWT. However, there is much greater scope for more work and for cost-saving were this to be done right. In the Assembly this week, my colleague, Phil Flanagan, raised the issue of how Enniskillen hospital could be better used in bringing services to it. Have there been discussions on the island of Ireland about the health implications of fracking, if that is introduced? My constituents in County Fermanagh, together with people in counties Leitrim and Cavan, are extremely concerned about the environmental and health implications of that process, if the earth is broken and benzene and other chemicals are allowed to get into the air or the water table. Have there been discussions on that issue?

While one can get caught up in issues concerning quality, quantity and so on, the wide range of people who are present in today's delegation is a sign to members that the Department is committed to the process. A range of issues exist, such as the provision of paediatric cardiology in Belfast and Dublin, and loads more questions remain. However, it is good to have a point of contact, even today. Can the joint committee liaise with Ms Nic Aongusa if issues arise? Is it okay for the joint committee to use her as a point of contact in respect of health issues?

Over the past 40 years, this infrastructure has never been developed and to get from one county to another at present is a nightmare.

I thank him again for the kind invitation to come before the committee today to comment on the role of the Commission for Victims and Survivors and our key priorities for the future. I am grateful to the committee for affording me the opportunity to discuss a number of issues that directly affect the lives of victims and survivors. Despite the passage of time, including some 15 years after the signing of the Agreement, there are many victims and survivors who continue to suffer from the devastating effects of the Troubles. I express my pleasant surprise and gratitude to see members of Justice for the Forgotten, Ms Margaret Irwin and Ms Bernadette Joly, here today. I acknowledge their tireless work. They are an important reminder to us all of why we do what we do for victims and survivors. As the Commissioner for Victims and Survivors in Northern Ireland, I believe passionately in the work of the commission to promote the rights of all victims and survivors to be heard, to be respected and to have access to services that are the best they can be. Over the past year, there has been a significant amount of reflection and comment around the 15th anniversary of the signing of the Agreement. Before providing the committee with an update on the work of the commission, it is worth briefly highlighting the commitments made to victims by the signatories to the Agreement. The Agreement, as I am sure the committee will recall, states:It is recognised that victims have a right to remember as well as to contribute to a changed society. The achievement of a peaceful and just society would be the true memorial to the victims of violence.Significantly, the Agreement goes on to state that "The participants [to the negotiations] particularly recognise that young people from areas affected by the troubles face particular difficulties and will support the development of special community-based initiatives based on international best practice". It is important to recall these commitments contained in the Agreement because they represent a formal recognition of the need to address effectively the needs of victims and survivors, including past and present generations. I will return to the issues of trans-generational impact of the conflict later but it is important to set the work of the commission within the context of the commitments contained in the Agreement. Our vision at the commission is to improve the lives of all victims and survivors. What does a victims commissioner do? My role is defined in statute but it is essentially to promote the interests of victims and survivors. It is simple, except, of course, that it is not. In Northern Ireland there are many things that are contested and the definition of "victim" is one of them. The law, as it stands, is clear and states that a victim is someone who has been injured, someone who has been bereaved or someone caring for someone who has been injured. The injury can be physical or psychological. It would seem on the face of it to be straightforward. There are many in Northern Ireland who believe there should be a distinction between victims, that there are innocent victims and that "victim makers" should not be included in the definition of victim, that those who set out to kill and maim with guns or bombs and are killed themselves or injured as a result should be afforded no assistance whatsoever. Other commentators have said that this approach does not appear to allow for those who were killed as a result of state collusion, those who were killed or injured, for example, in the events of Bloody Sunday, or the Ballymurphy families. Despite apologies from the Westminster Government, there seems to be little acknowledgment that these families and their loved ones were absolutely and completely innocent. Positions become entrenched and no one hears the other opinion as their opinion is the right one. It is as though, by the very act of listening honestly and carefully, there could be a contamination. Maybe then what is really being talked about, it has been suggested, is a hierarchy of blame. After 18 months in post, one thing I am certain of is that there must never be a hierarchy of pain. I have heard said on many occasions that the tears of the victim's mother are the same colour as those of the mother of the man who set the bomb. No one wins and everyone hurts. I acknowledge the comments made by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, during his address to the British Irish Association in October last. I was in the room that day and I was particularly struck by his insightful comments in recognising the responsibilities of us all in dealing with the complex and challenging issues related to our troubled past. Since I took up post, I have spent time with many individuals who have direct experience of the Troubles and who live with those experiences and the difficulties they bring every day. When asked about what my priorities are as commissioner, it is quite simple - to listen, to support, to advise, to care and to safeguard those who have been affected by our troubled past. I have met people who have been bereaved, I have met those that have been injured, both physically and psychologically, and I have met people who are caring for a loved one who is bereaved or injured.Those affected have various needs and it is imperative that we all take responsibility for ensuring that we address them properly. The needs vary. Obviously people require adequate resources and treatment, support and help, access to social support and access to help to obtain the justice and truth they deserve, if that is what they want.  The committee has asked that we brief it on the commission's priorities. I would like to do this by initially taking it through the work of the Victims and Survivors Forum. I will then highlight a number of key areas of work based on the commission's three key strategic priorities, namely, building for the future, dealing with the past and improving services for victims.  One of my primary duties as commissioner is to make arrangements for a forum for consultation and discussion for victims and survivors. Strengthening the role and enhancing the profile and work of the Victims and Survivors Forum has been one of my priorities since coming into office. The forum currently has 22 members, 19 of whom meet the definition of victim and are representative of the breadth of victim experience. There are three associate members, who bring their unique experience to enrich the work of the forum. It is important for me to reinforce the contribution made by forum members as volunteers who meet once a month, at a minimum, to inform the work of the commission. The work of the forum increasingly underpins the work of the commission. It has become a resource for the commission to discuss and identify live issues for victims and survivors across three working groups, which concern dealing with the past, services, and building for the future. In the past year, the forum's working groups have continued to meet regularly, engaging with a range of academics, politicians and other key stakeholders to inform their work. Examples of meetings include those with Lord Freud and Minister McCausland on welfare reform and the Attorney General to discuss the implications of Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights for victims and survivors. Importantly, last November, the forum met Dr. Richard Haass in addition to all of the political representatives that comprised the panel of parties to the Haass negotiations.  I will return briefly to the impact of the forum in informing the work of the commission but at this point I must emphasise the significant and positive impact of the forum on victim and survivor issues. In my opening remarks, I noted the commitment to victims and survivors contained in the Agreement. In the years following the Agreement, it was lauded internationally for aligning the process of political transition with the recognition of the rights of children and young people, including those affected by the trans-generational impact of the conflict. Developing our understanding and responding effectively to the negative impact of the conflict's legacy on the lives of young people in Northern Ireland is a primary area of concern for the commission.  Fifteen years after the Agreement and 20 years since the ceasefires, it is certainly an appropriate time to reflect on the continuing impact of the conflict's legacy on victims and survivors. Throughout the Troubles, young people suffered disproportionately in terms of the number killed and generations of young people who have been left to cope with carrying a significant burden due to exposure to conflict-related violence.  We will be undertaking a number of research projects, including one in partnership with the University of Ulster. The Better Future project will include an examination of the relationship between the impact of the conflict's legacy on the social, economic, and political life of Northern Ireland and the extent to which these factors affect children and young people's mental health and social well-being. Let me turn to dealing with the past. A question I have often been asked since taking up the post as a single commissioner is how I tread a course through the diversity of opinion and the widely varying while promoting the interest of all victims and survivors. The question has certainly not become any easier to answer 18 months into my post. Without doubt, one of the most challenging areas for the commission, if not the most challenging, is dealing with the past. As members will know, dealing with the legacy of the past and issues relating to truth, justice and acknowledgement remain contentious and divisive across society in Northern Ireland. From a victims' and survivors' perspective, it is important to remember first of all that victims are not a homogenous group and do not speak with one voice. Different people want different outcomes. The forum is a very good example of where people from a range of backgrounds have come together to share and understand one another's perspectives. While they might not agree with one another, they have come to respect that different people have different world-views. Despite the disagreement among local political parties relating to the proposed agreement document that emerged from the Haass process, it does provide an important message. The document states:We can […] all agree that the past has consequences for individual victims and society that continue through the present. We must meet the challenges posed by the past and work to ensure that they do not overwhelm the present or undermine the future. In the past year, the forum's dealing-with-the-past working group has been engaged in important work that is facing head-on the challenges posed by our contentious past. While there remain understandable differences of opinion among forum members on difficult issues, including the definition, which I note was an issue that the main political parties could not resolve during the Haass process, there is strong collective resolve among all forum members to ensure that “the past must never happen again”.  A key theme contained in the Haass document that I certainly welcome is the need to address effectively and comprehensively the needs of victims and survivors. In particular, I welcome the premium placed on the learning and inspiration that can be derived from the lived experience of victims and survivors. I consider myself very privileged to hear and learn from the often-pained but inspirational voices of many victims and survivors that I have met as commissioner. I was heartened by the commitment to ensuring that victims and survivors have timely access to high-quality mental health services that focus on the often-complex psychological needs of individuals and families affected by the Troubles. As the main political parties continue to deliberate over the content of the Haass proposals, the commission will be hosting a conference on dealing with the past later this month in Belfast. Working in partnership with Queens University, the University of Ulster and Healing Through Remembering, the conference will provide a timely opportunity for all stakeholders, including the wider victims and survivors community, to discuss a number of the unresolved issues linked to the past and for the commission to hear the views of all victims and survivors. As commissioner, one of my primary statutory duties is to review continually the adequacy and effectiveness of the treatments and services accessed by victims and survivors. I regularly make the point that given the unimaginable emotional turmoil experienced by many victims and survivors before and after the Agreement, they deserve to have access to gold-standard treatment and care from whatever sector or wherever it is provided. With the inception of the Victims and Survivors Service in 2012, the commission continues to review the operation of the organisation to ensure it delivers a service and care of a high standard to victims and survivors. In exercising my statutory duty and owing to a series of critical issues, I have recently been invited by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister to commission an independent assessment of the Victims and Survivors Service. The assessment, which will be completed in the next two weeks, will focus on the service's corporate governance and management, the individual needs review process, the broader policy framework and wider issues relating to service delivery. Once again, the forum has performed an important role in representing the breadth of experience of victims accessing the service. Important work in which the commission is currently engaged relates to an independent study to examine the viability of implementing a pension for victims and survivors who were severely injured during the Troubles. The rationale for such a pension is aimed at improving the position of those individuals who not only lost the ability to work following their injury but who also lost the ability to accrue any occupational rights as a result of their having lost their career prospects to chronic ill health.The final report will be presented to the commission in March 2014 and, based on the findings and recommendations, I will then provide advice for Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister on the next steps in progressing this important project on behalf of the severely injured. In the year ahead my focus will be on collaborating with the forum, engaging with the wider community of victims and commissioning research to provide an evidence base to inform my advice to the Government, with advice on how to deal with the past, build for the future and provide services from a victims' perspective. I respectfully request this committee to encourage others in considering urgently the Haass proposals and, specifically, those proposals for dealing with the past and victims. Prior to the Haass discussions and throughout the process, politicians committed sincerely to supporting victims and making their needs paramount in the discussions. I ask committee members to urge their colleagues not to lose their momentum or forget the victims.  I thank the committee for listening to my presentation. My colleague, Mr. John Beggs, and I are happy to take members' questions.

I thank Ms Stone and her team for the tremendous work they have done. We should record the value of that work to the people and the even-handed way in which they approached victims, irrespective of from where they or the victim makers came. I endorse the comments on the Haass discussions. Having been involved in the negotiations, we made considerable achievements on behalf of the victims and it is a tragedy that the negotiations were not concluded. We are, however, still working on these issues. On Monday and Tuesday I was engaged in lengthy meetings. I want to see a conclusion and, if there is one priority in driving the effort to reach a conclusion, it is the needs of victims and survivors. I agree that victims need a conclusion and that the Haass process must provide a way of supporting victims and survivors. There is potential to achieve closure and reduce the pain many victims feel. On behalf of those in my party with whom I am associated, I assure Ms Stone we will be driving the process every bit as much as she wants to see us driving it.

In the aftermath of the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, Kenneth Bloomfield was appointed as victims commissioner in the North and the former Tánaiste, the late John Wilson, became victims commissioner in the South. Has Ms Stone succeeded Mr. Bloomfield, or is her role separate?  I endorse Mr. McDonnell's positive comments on the need to reach agreement on the Haass proposals. The SDLP, the Alliance Party and Sinn Féin worked positively and proactively on the proposals to reach agreement, but, unfortunately, the Unionist parties have not made the same commitment. I gather from the tone of Ms Stone's comments that the services provided are not adequate to deal with people's personal and health problems or their educational needs. All of the victims are getting older and a cohort are now elderly. As time passes, it will become increasingly difficult to provide them with adequate services. Is the issue of providing adequate services for those in older age groups, in particular, being treated with the urgency it deserves?  I wish Ms Stone well in her work in this difficult area. As she correctly noted, the victims' needs should be paramount in all of the work done by the people of this island to address the issues arising.

Regardless of where I go in the North, it is not long before people raise this issue. When we were in Dungannon with Ms Gildernew, we heard people speak about it. The Justice for the Forgotten group discussed it recently with this committee. Does Ms Stone agree that the issue informs many of the current political positions in the North? The committee had a lengthy discussion on the Haass report. Does she think the recommendation made in the report on victims and survivors can be a template for making progress in this area and would she add anything to it? She has noted that a review is ongoing of the victims' and survivors' service. Has there been much of a take-up of the service? What is the level of buy-in?

While there was limited agreement on the causes of the conflict, I would like to think there is agreement that we must ensure we will never be revisited by conflict.There is very little agreement with some parties on the definition of victims, which is part of the difficulty. How important is the fact that we find it difficult to deal with the past? Some say it is time to move on and forget about it, that there is no point in going over old hurts and wrongs. Will dealing with the past be one of the recommendations Ms Stone considers? In the past couple of weeks there was a reconciliation event in the Skainos centre in east Belfast, which this committee has visited on a number of occasions. The Skainos centre is the tent; it is supposed to be safe, a shared space to which people can come. For example, Mr. Pat Magee, who served time for the Brighton bombing, and Ms Jo Berry, whose father was killed in that bombing, met in it. They talked about the story of their relationship, how they had got to meet each other and how this had or had not helped with their difficulties in dealing with the past. People and members of the PSNI were attacked outside. How important is it for victims to deal with the issue of reconciliation? How important is it to have this shared space in which people can come together? Different groups have come together, including ex-combatants or people who have been hurt by the Troubles. Is there any way the victims' commissioner can facilitate the likes of this happening? Ms Stone has said there is no agreement on the definition of "victim" among victims or political parties. There is no victims' commission in this jurisdiction. There is very little funding for it. Is that a weakness in the system and is there a need for some such structure? Justice for the Forgotten was mentioned. Representatives of that organisation came here and said funding was one difficulty. There is an anomaly in that it could obtain funding in the North but not in Dublin. Does Ms Stone have recommendations for the two Governments in that regard? Will she examine this issue as part of her submission? Justice for the Forgotten is going to the Historical Enquiries Team, HET, which is questionable. It is also going to the Police Ombudsman's office to talk about pursuing investigations that the RUC was supposed to have performed in the past and its actions or inaction. There is no similar mechanism whereby people can go to the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission. Can Ms Stone make recommendations to the two Governments on dealing with such issues?

When one lives and works in the North, one cannot fail to know somebody who has been a victim of the conflict. One of the people I know particularly well is a mother who lost three sons in the conflict. She met Sir Kenneth Bloomfield a number of years ago and feels that during the years her needs have not been met. I am hoping there is a more positive outlook on victims. Many are deeply insulted by the suggestion but some of our supposedly more sensible elected representatives have talked about a legacy of victims. The hurt and offence this causes to people like the woman about whom I am talking are very deep. I would like Ms Stone to give us some thoughts on this. I was born in 1970 and last year was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, which is probably fairly common in people of my age when one considers what we experienced in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Mr. Peter McBride from the Northern Ireland Association for Mental Health, NIAMH, appeared before this committee last year. He is investigating how mental health and counselling services can be accessed. My constituency is Fermanagh-South Tyrone. In rural areas it can be very difficult to access counselling when one needs it. I would like Ms Stone's thoughts on this issue and how we can progress it to provide support for those who need it. We have people who are struggling with debt management and children at school. This is on top of what sometimes makes life very tough for people.

It is an awesome challenge that they must face and I have no words on how difficult it will be. The definition of "victim" was a contentious issue in the Haass report and Ms Stone said it was an issue the main political parties could not resolve. Therefore, she faces a question mark, which it is interesting to know. In her presentation she said, "I was heartened by the commitment to ensuring that victims and survivors have timely access to high-quality mental health services that focus on the often-complex psychological needs of individuals and families affected by the Troubles." Does the commissioner think the system will be able to deliver this?

That in 2014 she is highlighting the fact that there is no gold standard access to mental health facilities in the North shows there is a lot of work still to be done at that basic level to help people in the initial stages, even before we get to the other issues that need to be dealt with. It is very important work. The lack of access to mental health services in rural areas, an issue raised by Ms Gildernew , must be addressed at a fundamental level by the Government and it must be done immediately. I cannot believe it has not been adequately addressed. The fact that the commissioner has highlighted it in her presentation shows there is something very wrong with how victims have been dealt with thus far. This committee must explore further what we can do from our side of the Border. There are victims on both sides of the Border, not just in Northern Ireland. We had the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. These issues need to be addressed adequately. I wish the commissioner well in her work.

On the definition of "victim", I will cite as an example somebody not from Northern Ireland but who was intimidated outside it. This person was threatened back in the 1970s, told not to go back to Northern Ireland and has still not returned. There were no physical consequences or bereavement, but the family has had this hanging over them for the best part of 40 years and probably longer. Is there a conversation happening about how to deal with the silent victims of the conflict who do not fall into any particular category? There was no single event. Ms Margaret Irwin is present.Justice for the Forgotten lists a figure of 160 victims outside of Northern Ireland, if I am citing the contributions correctly. Do these silent victims who suffered severe intimidation and threats fall into that category?

When I accepted this role, I did not imagine that I would spend every day - it really is almost every day - meeting people who had been broken by what happened to them during the Troubles. They have been described as being shrunken by sorrow. Many members can recall or know people who have been physically shrunken by their experiences. There is no doubt that acute and chronic mental health services are of paramount importance. Ms Gildernew, MP, bravely described her experience of being diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD, some considerable time after the conflict. One conclusion in a piece of research by the commission, a report entitled Troubled Consequences that is available on our website, is that it is a common thing for people to be diagnosed with PTSD and related mental health conditions as many as 20 years after the end of a period of conflict or events causing conflict. These are difficult experiences for people and inform the requirement to plan services carefully to respond to individuals' needs. I have often been reminded that these services must not just be located in city centres. Many people who live in rural areas, particularly along the Border, are profoundly affected in terms of their mental health, their emotional well being and their ability to create and sustain relationships with partners and their children. The transgenerational impact of these mental health conditions is also prevalent and is something on which we must act quickly. During the health presentation, it was mentioned that the population was getting older. Demography is against us. We must work to ensure that people have support. We must also work quickly to ensure that those who are getting older have access to truth and justice that will help them in their later years. Frequently, I meet people who burn with the frustration of not knowing what happened to their loved ones and of not having the justice that everyone agrees they deserve. I will address some of the points raised at this meeting. It is important to acknowledge that the review of the Victims and Survivors Service, VSS, has seen buy-in. The service's new board of directors has welcomed the independent assessment of the service and is looking forward to the report, as that will give the board a framework on which to improve and build on the service's foundation. It is not fair to say that the services being provided are inadequate. We must remember that many groups and voluntary organisations have been in existence, often for decades - Ms Margaret Urwin and Ms Bernadette Joly are examples of that - and provide not only emotional support but also practical support and advocacy throughout a justice process, however that might be defined. I will try to explain how I came to be commissioner, where the commission sits into the Sir Kenneth Bloomfield report and what happened after that. He wrote a report, entitled We Will Remember Them, which was published in 1998. My understanding is that, afterwards, there was a hiatus followed by the appointment of a sole commissioner, Ms Bertha McDougall. It was quickly acknowledged that there needed to be other commissioners representative of different backgrounds. There was a period during which there were four commissioners, one of whom, Mr. Mike Nesbitt, left to follow a political career. When the terms of office of the remaining three commissioners ended I was recruited as a single commissioner. In his report, Sir Kenneth Bloomfield described the role of a victims commissioner as a painful privilege. As I took up my post, I had no idea what he had meant by that. Eighteen months later, I understand exactly what he meant. My role is, indeed, a painful privilege. My work with victims and survivors inspires me and my team every day to ensure that victims get not only what we expect them to have, but also the services that they deserve. Some time ago after a difficult and challenging meeting, one of the members of our victims forum sent me an e-mail thanking me for giving her a voice. I hope that by presenting to this committee, we have been able to give victims of the Troubles a voice and that members have understood what some of their primary concerns are. I thank the committee for affording us the opportunity to appear before it.

Does the commission's remit cover someone who is a victim of the Troubles as a result of something that happened in the Six Counties but who is now domiciled outside them? If not, what advice would our guests give us for putting the individual in touch with other services? Is there a pathway for someone outside Northern Ireland?

People have presented to the commissioner and received support and advice from same. Individuals can also present to the VSS and receive access to funding and services. However, a jurisdictional issue around group funding has been raised with the commission. We have received representations from groups outside Northern Ireland. Given those representations, we have reviewed our position and, as of this week, are finalising advice to the First and deputy First Ministers on giving access to groups outside Northern Ireland. I do not want to pre-empt the outcome but we have reviewed the representations and will make a strong recommendation. This will take account of the fact that there is an inconsistency between individuals and groups.
