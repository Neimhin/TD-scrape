#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I have received notice from Senator Bannon that on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to clarify the position regarding the commencement of Rathowen sewerage scheme, the provision of which is urgently required in the interests of environmental, health, residential and commercial interests and tourism in the area.I have also received notice from Senator O'Meara of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Health and Children to instruct the National Hospitals Office of the Health Service Executive to approve the spending of €2.2 million for the renovation and extension of the accident and emergency unit at Nenagh General Hospital which was announced by the Taoiseach during a recent visit to Roscrea.I have also received notice from Senator Norris of the following matter:In light of the fact the Environmental Protection Agency intends to spend in excess of €3,500 of taxpayers' money on media and PR consultants to prepare it for a meeting with the Aghancon Concerned Residents Association in regard to the decision by An Bord Pleanála to allow retention by persons (details supplied) of an illegal development at Leap Castle, Roscrea, County Tipperary, the need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to provide an equal sum of money to the residents group to allow it to have similar professional assistance.I regard the matters raised by Senators Bannon and O'Meara as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret I have to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Norris as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	1	The Order of Business is Nos. 1, 2 and 20, motion 25. No. 1 is a motion which was referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights and it has completed its deliberations. It concerns a proposal for a Council framework decision on the European evidence warrant for obtaining objects, documents and data for use in proceedings in criminal matters. It is envisaged that the framework decision, when implemented, will result in quicker, more effective judicial co-operation in criminal matters. This item will be taken without debate. No. 2, the Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2005 — Committee Stage, will be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business until 5 p.m.; and No. 20, motion 25, will be taken from 5 p.m. until 7 p.m.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that after No. 1, we set aside time to discuss the future of the Irish sugar beet industry. As colleagues will be aware, last week in Brussels the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, agreed to the reform of the European sugar industry. As a result of the reform package agreed by the Minister, it is now inevitable that the Irish sugar beet industry will cease to exist and that sugar beet will no longer be grown in this country. For the first time since Ireland's entry into the European Union in 1973, a decision taken in Brussels and agreed by the Government at EU level will result in the elimination of a native Irish industry.At present, almost 4,000 people grow sugar beet in Ireland and their future is written off. The jobs of hundreds of people working at the factory in Mallow will also disappear. Up to 3,000 or 4,000 people work in associated areas, in the haulage industry, in the service industry and as electricians, mechanics, etc. The jobs of all these people will be lost as a result of the decision that was agreed by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan. The Minister has made the case that agreed compensation will be paid but the issue now causing the most grave concern to people involved in the sugar beet industry is that farmers will get very little while Greencore will get the bulk of it.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	3	What risk taking. Irish capitalism.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	4	That is not acceptable. Greencore has done well out of the Irish sugar industry since it was privatised some time ago. We must now make the case that whatever compensation is available will be paid to those who invested their money and time down the years in the growing of sugar beet.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	5	Hear, hear.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	6	We are talking about up to 4,000 growers, hundreds of workers at the Mallow plant and thousands of people in associated areas of employment. It is a matter of extreme concern. This decision taken last week in Brussels wipes out a native Irish industry. We need to discuss where we go from here and how we can ensure that the compensation is paid to those people who need it most.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	7	The Cathaoirleach will be aware that my colleague, Senator Norris, has tabled a motion to have the Order of Business extended to an hour. He will also be aware that we previously discussed having a topical hour at this stage. This is one of those times when so many things are happening that Members of the House need to have an opportunity to express themselves. We should look at this matter again.I support the idea of a debate on the beet industry. I have no doubt I will be defending the Minister for Agriculture and Food, like I have Ray MacSharry, Ivan Yates and Deputy Walsh——
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	8	And the farmers.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I will defend the farmers as well. From 1990 to 2000, I listened to people unfairly trying to convince Irish farmers that in some way we could avoid the world beet price. We all knew it was staring us in the face. Every year the rainforests of the Amazon are cleared to the extent of the acreage of Ireland. Two factories producing sugar in the Amazon will wipe out not just the Irish but the European sugar beet industry. That is a fact. Whatever way we are to deal with this issue, it is not a problem to be laid at the door of the Government, the Minister or anybody else. If we want to go back in time, we should never have done a deal on beet in 1973. That was done to protect northern French and Belgian farmers and we got in on the tail end of it.The points made today by Senator Bradford are correct. I agree that people are affected and are being displaced. The matter needs to be debated. We should be looking at the alternatives. We should examine how we can look after the farmers involved in production and the workers in the factories. That should be the tone of the debate. If we waste another two hours having a go at the Minister, the Department or the previous Minister, the Government side will defend the Minister and this side will have a go at her. We will go back 20 years and get nowhere. It would be a total waste.Let us talk about the alternatives. Last week I outlined here the need to help farmers get into biofuels and other alternatives. There is a need for them to produce crops that can be used for energy generation, to use the land properly and to get a fair income from it. I will support that approach and stand with them on every one of those issues. Let us keep the debate focused on that.Connected to this issue and the displacement of people in their jobs through no fault of their own is the Irish Ferries dispute. It was discussed at some length yesterday in the Dáil. This is something which people on all sides would want to be on record. I ask that time be made available, today if possible and I look forward to the Leader's response. The issues have been well rehearsed. I have raised the matter here three or four times previously and I would like an opportunity to explore what are the possibilities and where this can go. This is about trust and confidence as well as people's jobs. This reflects badly on everybody and will undermine the relationship between all parties on the labour spectrum, business and workers, Government and the social partners. It has the capacity to undermine much of what we worked for during the past 20 years and from that point of view, we must debate this issue.Last week, I raised the fact we did not get a response from the Vatican to the Ferns Report. Following that, I wrote to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and requested him to formally post a copy of the Ferns Report to the Papal Nuncio in Ireland and the Pope in Rome to seek their response. Not only did we not get a response from them on the most serious issue ever of its type, the most appalling development occurred during the past week whereby the church is trying to throw the blame on the fact that some priests may be homosexual. A fortnight ago I stated that until the church begins to recognise, understand and accept homosexual and married priests, it will never solve its problems. We must make our position clear. We must revisit the church's response to the Ferns Report as soon as possible.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	10	In an extraordinary attempt by the worst kind of business practice to reassert its capacity to exploit, which is what the Irish Ferries dispute is about, one of the Government's arguments was that legislation offered to it in the other House could not be introduced because it would be in breach of European obligations.I have before me amendment No. 63 to the Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2005, with which we will deal later this afternoon. The Minister of State said we would need to get permission from the EU following its passage. I have no problem with that amendment. When it suits us we pass legislation first and then deal with the EU. However, when it comes to Irish workers being displaced by exploited cheap labour from eastern Europe, we cannot do so. That defines the problem. It is not that we cannot do so but that we will not. We urgently need a debate in this House. Many people are sick of the left-wing rhetoric of members of the Government which translates into capitulation every time they get a chance to draw breath. We have seen no action from the Government on this critical issue.The same type of two-facedness applies on the sugar beet issue. Greencore bought into the sugar industry with its eyes wide open. Nobody in his or her right mind could have imagined the regime as it existed would continue. When Seagate closed in Clonmel and many other companies closed due to world forces, the workers were compensated. Nobody suggested the company must be compensated because the world caught up with them. For some reason, Greencore will be compensated for making a bad business decision. I thought this country was about risk taking and that was the reason we gave some adulation to all of these wonderful people. I cannot see any risk taking by the company directors of Irish Ferries or Greencore. Neither can I see any risk taking by the chief executives of banks whose companies were ripped off and who paid no price personally for it. All I can see is farmers and workers in County Cork and the rest of the country being exploited. Those already rich and powerful will end up richer and more powerful. As long as we allow that to happen, they will continue to treat people as they do.
#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	11	To follow on and touch on some of the issues raised by other Members and in light of the Irish Ferries dispute and how it will affect every worker and employer in the country, I call for a general debate on the concept of work, decency and fair play. Should our society be dictated by the mighty euro or should we examine our quality of life and the way Ireland will develop in future? I ask the Leader for a wider debate than what is suggested here. The state of the beet industry and the Irish Ferries dispute call for a wider debate to discuss points raised last week, including education. The future of Ireland must be examined in terms of how we work and the conditions of work. I ask the Leader to consider holding such a debate in the new year.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	12	Many Senators have indicated they wish to contribute so I ask them to be brief.

#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	14	I second the proposed amendment to the Order of Business tabled by Senator Bradford. There is a crisis not only in the sugar industry but in agriculture. The farming community has suffered dreadful pain through CAP reforms. Sugar proposals that devastated Tuam, Thurles and Carlow now put the Mallow plant under threat. I have called for this debate over the past two weeks and I am disappointed it has not taken place. Perhaps the Leader will accede to the amendment today.Compensation for beet growers should be directed towards the farmers rather than "Greedcore", as the farming community has described it. The company must shoulder the blame and responsibility for poor decisions that have caused this crisis.Pig farmers' difficulties with the nitrates directive must also be addressed. Every bacon factory and every worker in those factories is threatened if this problem is not addressed. Poultry farmers are also having difficulty. We must grasp this issue and have a debate on it. We must stand firm against the Mandelson foxes, who want cuts in agricultural subsidies to liberalise trade in industrial goods. Sugar beet is of vital interest to the country and we should not be penalised by decisions of the British who only want cheap food. Mandelson has been supported and complimented by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on his role in securing agreement on world trade.

I think it important to have the debate and that the Minister for Agriculture and Food attends. Confusion exists about the sugar deal done last week. I concur with previous speakers on Greencore receiving compensation but it is important the Minister attends our debate.Senators O'Toole and Ryan referred to the role of Greencore but Senator Ryan, a Cork Senator, will also recall Irish Shipping, Ford and Dunlop. The list is endless.

#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	23	Having listened to Senator Callanan I am reminded of his near neighbour, Ms Alice Taylor, and her famous book, To School Through the Fields, because the Senator has just taken us on a trip down memory lane.Irish Ferries has been to the fore in the public mind recently but an edition of "Prime Time" this week featured a man from one of the new EU member states who was working on a building site in the docklands area of Dublin. He was being paid €400 per week, while his Irish counterpart was being paid €600. Therefore, while Irish Ferries is the focus of attention at the moment, many people are being exploited throughout the country.In that context, it is lamentable that there are fewer inspectors from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment dealing with this issue than there are dog wardens. When will the inspectorate be beefed up to ensure that employers are behaving responsibly towards their employees? I have asked this question on many occasions. The Taoiseach indicated recently that he hopes the inspectorate will be expanded. This must be made an urgent priority.
#JohnGerardHanafin	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-party	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-dob	unknown-#JohnGerardHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	24	I wish to raise a number of issues, the first of which is the need for a debate on the World Trade Organisation discussions which are currently taking place. The beef and beet sectors are within the ambit of those discussions.I am particularly concerned about the issue of free trade versus fair trade. We have been told that free trade is to the benefit of Third World countries, but the reality can be very different. That issue should be debated in this House. Many of the companies that benefit from free trade are in First World ownership. They own vast tracts of land and the factors of production in the Third World.In that context, of what real benefit is free trade to the Third World? We know of cases where workers are treated very badly by employers and are at a major disadvantage. We have heard of extreme cases where workers in fields are sprayed from the air with pesticides that affect their health and may affect that of future generations. These issues must be debated before we roll over and agree to any changes in world trade. We must ensure that all trade is fair and free.With regard to compensation payments for the beet sector, I suggest that any payment to Greencore should not be for the benefit of the few, but of the many, namely, the workers of that company. Our first concern should be the farmers who have depended on the beet crop for many years, who number over 3,000. Our second concern should be the workers and any moneys for Greencore should be ring-fenced for compensation for the workers. Our last concern should be for the company that has enjoyed increased profitability and has built a different business for itself in the UK. The reality is that beet is a very minor part of Greencore's business. It is one of the largest sandwich makers in the world and the majority of its employees are now in the UK, not Ireland.With regard to calling for changes in the church, I would like to see a situation in the future where this House calls for changes in areas that are within its remit. Members of this House are calling for changes in the church as if it was the State church. The reality is that it is not a State church and making such calls is often futile.On the issue of the positive options directory of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, one may say what one wishes, but abortion is not a positive option. The last thing we should allow the Crisis Pregnancy Agency to deal with is abortion as a positive option. It may be an option, and one can twist, divide or subdivide it any way one likes, but it is not positive.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I support my colleague, Senator O'Toole, in his call for a debate on Irish Ferries. Virtually everybody agrees that the buccaneering attitude of Irish Ferries towards its employees and the thuggish way it introduced people to its ships, effectively smuggling security officers onboard, is just not tolerable. The President of Cyprus attended today's meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs and indicated that the Cypriot Government is unhappy about the reflagging issue, although it may be compelled to permit Irish Ferries to reflag because of its obligations under international law. However, it was very interesting that the President himself raised the subject and received a round of applause at the meeting.I have tabled a motion under Standing Order 29 requesting that this matter be discussed today as a matter of national priority and urgency. A similar motion was successful in the other House yesterday so it will be interesting to see the progress of this one.I ask for a further debate on Iraq. I propose that we follow the example of the British Parliament and ask the Leader to establish a cross-party parliamentary committee to investigate flights through Shannon. The pattern of flights in the UK is the same as in this country and they are concerned that the situation implicates Britain in torture and extraordinary rendition.Mr. Chris Mullin, a former junior Minister at Westminster, expressed his concern on television last night. The aeroplane that lands at Shannon was in the background of the shot throughout the programme, detectable by its registration number. We know the nature of the torture, namely, they drown detainees and revive them and use electric drills on them. What does President Bush have to do before the Taoiseach acts or says "Boo" to the Americans? Does he have to establish extermination camps in Shannon?

That aeroplane is a pariah and should not be permitted in Irish airspace.I support Senator O'Toole and am grateful to him for raising the subject of gay priests and the Vatican. It must be viewed in the context of our own responsibilities. We permitted the churches to get away with an exemption from the operation of equality law. They have shown themselves to be unfit. If we are responsible to the citizens of this country, including gay citizens, we must re-examine that exemption. A moving article in today's edition of the Irish Independent told how a lovely young man in Donegal killed himself because of this situation. His sister, to whom I pay tribute, gave interviews on radio and in the press in which she laid the responsibility at our door because there is no educational programme in this area.

I ask the Leader to seek a re-examination and possible amendments to equality legislation to prevent a church that has behaved so viciously toward gay people from outlawing decent people, putting them out of their jobs and, sometimes, their homes simply because they support a gay lifestyle. What does that mean? I saw an article in the Irish Independent——

One such matter is the arrest yesterday of a high-profile republican in the North. As with many previous cases it seems to be as much about politics as about the pursuit of justice.The man in question is a member of the Northern Ireland Assembly and comes from a high-profile sporting family, which is involved in the cultural and artistic life of the community. In pursuing people like Francie Brolly, we need to make sure we do not undo the progress we have made. This man should be allowed to return to his family and community because in recent years he has promoted good community relations and interaction across the traditions in Northern Ireland. He has been at the coalface of that work for a long time. The theatricals we saw yesterday in Northern Ireland do not help the peace process.

On the so-called issue of on-the-runs, of which we have heard much recently, will the Leader enlighten the House as to the Government's rationale — I accept there is an agreement on the matter — behind its decision to grant a presidential pardon rather than allowing these people to be freed on licence?The surplus to requirements voting machines were raised in the other House yesterday. They cost approximately €60 million to store. While the Minister appeared to indicate to the contrary, I understood the commission found that they did not meet the requirements in regard to accountability and the standards required by the voting public. I would like the Leader to reply to the matter.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	35	I support what was said about the sugar beet industry, particularly what was said about farmers and workers. I know from my own constituency what the closure of the Tuam sugar factory in the early 1980s meant for the people employed in the factory and for those involved in the haulage of beet to the factory. I would like to have the matter discussed. Farmers who have invested in machinery are now in a particularly difficult situation. I hope the €145 million will go to these farmers rather than to Greencore. We should press hard in this House for farmers to get the compensation.On Senator O'Toole's point on the Vatican's statement on seminarians, I welcome the fact that a statement was made because we do not have too many statements from the Vatican. I hope the Vatican will issue other statements on married priests, female priests and so on. I was very interested to hear the Archbishop of Armagh, Dr. Seán Brady, say this morning that guidelines on child protection would be published before Christmas, which I welcome.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	36	I support Senator Bradford's call for an amendment to the Order of Business. It is important to have the Minister for Agriculture and Food here because, since we joined the EU, no agriculture Minister representing Ireland has presided over the demise of an Irish agricultural industry. This is the oldest Irish industrial process relating to agriculture. As Senator Kitt said, we know what happened in Tuam. We are also aware of what happened in Thurles, Carlow and now Mallow. Not only will this closure affect the sugar beet industry, it will have far wider repercussions on every strand of the Irish agricultural industry, including crop rotation and so on. It will change completely agriculture in this country.

The Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party last night debated this robustly and at length. While it is an environmental issue, it has afforded an opportunity to many of us on this side of the House to put forward a view that we now face the demise of yet another agricultural industry.Since I have been a Member of this House I have met many organisations and individuals from rural areas and this most recent controversy is unlike any I have experienced before. Pig and poultry producers face ruin and their families face unemployment and destitution as a result of an EU directive that does not take account of the unique nature of Irish grassland.In that context, while I accept that the directive will soon be implemented, and there is nothing much we can do about it, I compliment the Minister for Agriculture and Food on the proposal she put to the party meeting yesterday, which will address as far as possible the issues surrounding the directive in terms of anti-pollution measures.

This Government has savaged the wheat, dairy and grain industries and, as Senator Mooney says, it is about to savage the pig and poultry industries by its handling of the nitrates directive. It is dismantling the beef industry as we speak and the Minister has lost the confidence and trust of Irish farmers.

I hear that they will make up the first consignment of Government waste for the new incinerators.When will we debate the report of the Barr tribunal that investigated the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. John Carthy in Abbeylara, County Longford? The tribunal was established in 2003 and concluded earlier this year. We were promised that the report would be presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas by 1 November. Will the Leader indicate if we will have this report before Christmas? People are asking about this in my clinics.

In October 2004, when the Minister had just been appointed, she was warned in this House about the dangers facing the sugar beet industry. We tabled a Private Members' motion in January and she paid it no heed. She was told three days before the closure of the factory in Carlow what would happen but the Department did nothing to prevent its closure, an action that would have strengthened her hand in the negotiations.Japan imports 7% of its rice and the Government imposes strict limits on the amount of rice that can be imported. Most of the imported rice is put in storage and does not make it to the market. Korea imports 4% of its rice while in America 25,000 cotton farmers are in receipt of $3 billion a year in subsidies from the US Government. There is no point, therefore, in a country rolling over and allowing the WTO to oversee the complete demise of an industry, which returned a profit of €10 million last year. It is outrageous and the moral implications are disgraceful.

Greencore has walked off the pitch in Ireland, taken the football and locked the gate ensuring nobody else can play. It is a disgrace. An urgent debate on this issue is needed. I do not have confidence in the Minister on this issue. She has been an unmitigated disaster since she took up office.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	61	I thank the Leader and Senator Callanan for their timely intervention on the single farm payment issue, which I raised last week. They used their good offices to influence the Minister for Agriculture and Food to ensure cheques were paid on time.Inishowen is sometimes mentioned in the negative because of road tragedies and job losses, of which there have been 4,000 in the past six years. These are major stories but a major positive in the area is a company called Forward Emphasis, which is based at Malin Head, north Inishowen. The company employs 120 people at a call centre. Yesterday, its management expressed grave concerns and stated the provision of broadband will determine whether the company can survive. It made a strong plea for the provision of an adequate broadband infrastructure in north Inishowen.I am seeking a more equitable strategy in the provision of broadband technology so that Inishowen will be covered. Broadband is provided haphazardly in County Donegal but we should try to retain companies in north Inishowen which are trying to survive in spite of a lack of telecommunications and transport services. For example, no road in Inishowen was mentioned in Transport 21, which is an aspirational plan. Inishowen has a population of 40,000 and it has suffered significant job losses. The region is trying to overcome inadequate services. I seek a debate on the lack of telecommunications and transport provision in peripheral areas.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	62	Senator Bradford, the Acting Leader of the Opposition, moved an amendment to the Order of Business calling on the Minister for Agriculture and Food to come to the House to explain the deal done in Brussels. The House will debate the WTO negotiations next week, which essentially deals with the same issue. However, the Senator is fully entitled to move an amendment. He represents a town that will be devastated by what has happened and I acknowledge the sincerity of his contribution.Senator O'Toole stated two factories in the Amazon basin could wipe out our sugar industry. He also said the 1973 sugar deal was wrong and laid the groundwork for the recent deal. Farmers need to get into other industries such as biofuels and so on. The Senator also dwelled on the Irish Ferries issue and sought a debate later, if possible. He referred to trust and confidence in the partnership model and in employers versus employees. The Irish Ferries issue strikes at the heart of what kind of people we are. Outsourcing work and replacing 500 workers with another 500 is extraordinary.As Senator Ryan mentioned, some of the comments, particularly on a television programme on Monday night, from people who should know better were horrific. Senator O'Toole said there has been no response to the Ferns Report and that the church is throwing blame on sections of the population.Senator Ryan referred to the Irish Ferries dispute and asked why Ireland and three other countries voted against a directive that would have solved the matter. We are told by members of the Opposition in both Houses that the directive would have had this effect, but I do not know. Nonetheless we should debate the matter here as soon as possible. Senator Ryan also spoke about risk taking, not by management but by workers, in any industry that goes to the wall. Senator Ormonde wants a wider debate and that is fair enough.Senator Coonan seconded Senator Bradford's proposal and, referring to the beet growers, called Greencore "Greedcore", which I thought was smart. Those two issues coming together have brought great despair on many sections of the population. Senator Callanan would like the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, to attend the House for the debate and commends her for the package she negotiated.Senator Finucane also referred to the Irish Ferries dispute and called for the expansion of the labour inspectorate, which for some time he has been told will happen. Senator Hanafin referred to the WTO. We hope to have a debate on it next week. The Senator said trade should be fair and free and that farmers should get the money under the beet compensation agreement rather than the company.Senator Hanafin also referred to the Ferns Report and said the church is not a State instrument and we do not have the right to call for changes in it. We have the right to debate the church but it appears that no heed is being paid.

He also called for an ongoing debate on Iraq, with which I agree, and suggested the establishment of a cross-party committee in this House to examine what he described as the "torture flights". Every day more evidence on that issue emerges. I picked it up on a Channel 4 television programme last week. Senator Norris also spoke on the need for us to amend the equality legislation to bring all churches under its remit.Senator Ó Murchú asked for an ongoing debate on Northern Ireland and referred to the young Irish man prominent in Irish culture in the North who was arrested. Senator Coghlan referred to the issue of on-the-runs. We are governed by the Attorney General in this regard. I queried this in the Taoiseach's office and the advice of the Attorney General is that the matter should be dealt with by presidential pardon

He is glad that Archbishop Brady has said the guidelines on child protection will issue before Christmas.Senator Ulick Burke called for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to attend for a debate on the sugar beet industry. There is no point in having a debate without the Minister. He mentioned what happened in Tuam, Thurles, Carlow and now Mallow and asked why the European directive was voted down. Ireland and three other countries opposed it. I hope to have a proper line on that issue tomorrow.Senator Mooney called for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to come to the House to clarify the nitrates directive. I agree with him that Fianna Fáil had a thorough debate on it yesterday, to which many of us contributed. We know the directive is supportive of the environment. The Minister for Agriculture and Food is putting forward ameliorative measures which will help farmers.Senator Bannon is very busy if all the issues he mentioned arose in his clinics. I do not agree that the Minister for Agriculture and Food has lost the confidence of Irish farmers. She has not, but is very much in their confidence.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	92	I request that the House be adjourned under Standing Order 29 to debate the need for the Government to take immediate steps to resolve the dangerous and confrontational situation between Irish Ferries and its shipboard employees as it is a matter of urgent national importance. We have witnessed the entrance of hired thugs on to the ship in question and the maintenance of a vigil by the crew on board the ship. Attempts to register the ship under a different flag have also been made. This issue has been ruled a matter of national importance in the other House.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	94	I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for his ruling but it makes a farce of the business of the House and the Standing Orders. It is ludicrous that a matter can be considered a national emergency in the other House but not in this House. The idea that careful consideration is being given to the matter is nonsense. A similar situation arose previously when I raised a matter and was informed that it was not a matter of national importance. Thirty minutes later, the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, stated in the other House that it was a matter of national importance. Could an inquiry be held into the space-time continuum as it affects Seanad Éireann and Dáil Éireann because they appear to operate on two different planets?
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	95	The Standing Orders in Seanad Éireann differ from those in Dáil Éireann. A recent amendment to Standing Order 29 means that a matter can only be raised under the Standing Order if it has arisen suddenly. The matter to which Senator Norris refers arose last week and can be raised in different ways other than Standing Order 29.

These amendments were originally suggested by the Labour Party but have been slightly amended based on advice received from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. I, therefore, cannot accept amendment No. 2. I thank Senators for their contributions. As a result of amendment No. 1, citations in sections 7, 19 and 24 have been deleted.Amendment No. 3 provides for the insertion of a new section to provide a standard provision regarding enactment. This is a technical amendment. The new section arises as a result of grouping all the citations in one section.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	98	This Bill is one of the most badly constructed pieces of legislation I have seen in my political career. I have no argument with any issues it contains. The Short Title of this Bill is the Irish Medicines Board (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and it incorporates amendments to the Irish Medicines Board Act, the Control of Clinical Trials Acts, the Misuse of Drugs Acts and the Health Acts. A generation of lawyers will be kept occupied tracking down amendments to the Health Acts alluded to in a Bill that will not refer to that fact in its Short Title. I would like to claim credit for this insight but it came from a lawyer friend who does such work for the Labour Party.The Government amendment is better than the Labour Party amendment and is necessary. However, I dispute the manner in which the Bill has been introduced although it does not affect this particular amendment. I am very concerned about making amendments to four different Bills. The amendments to the Health Acts concern the provision of health services and have nothing to do with the Irish Medicines Board. This House ought to assert that the short titles of Bills should contain material relevant to what reasonable people would assume to be their content, as opposed to the Department of Health and Children's practice of tacking on every additional piece it can think of to a Bill. It is poor legislative practice that will make more money for more lawyers and will probably expose the Department to increased litigation in the future.A good symptom of the peculiar way the Department conducts much of its business, which culminated in the financial disaster relating to nursing homes last year, is the fact that it puts legislation together in this way. This Bill is a mishmash and should have been called the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. I agree with the Bill's content, although I have queries regarding nurse prescriptions and professional liability. These issues should have been addressed in separate Bills.

Amendment No. 38 is one page long. I am not trying to be unhelpful but one might like to ask questions about some of these amendments.

It is not intended that all nurses will prescribe all drugs. Rather it is intended to permit the introduction of a scheme for prescription for medicinal products or certain classes of medicinal products or certain controlled drugs — for example, in palliative care situations — to be issued in prescribed circumstances by certain registered nurses. The various circumstances and the procedures to be complied with in the issue of such prescriptions will be set out in regulations under the Irish Medicine Board Act and in accordance with the standards and requirements of An Bord Altranais.Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 are technical amendments. Amendment No. 6 amends the definition of "practitioner" in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 to include a registered nurse. It also defines a "registered nurse" as a person registered with An Bord Altranais. This is required for the introduction of nurse prescribing as provided for in amendments Nos. 7, 9 and 64 as well as in part of amendment No. 38.As regards amendment No. 7, a new section is being inserted to amend section 5 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977. This will allow regulations to be made to permit registered nurses or classes of registered nurses to prescribe certain controlled drugs. A new subsection 1A is being inserted which stipulates that the Minister shall only make regulations in respect of nurses where he or she is satisfied that it is safe to do so following consideration of the type of controlled drug concerned.Subsection (c) excludes a nurse from the provision of section 5(2)(a) which allows a registered medical practitioner, a registered dentist and a veterinary surgeon to prescribe, administer, manufacture, compound or supply a controlled drug. A new subsection is being inserted so that regulations can be made in order that it is not unlawful under the Misuse of Drugs Act for nurses, subject to section 13 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, to prescribe, administer, manufacture, compound or supply a controlled drug. These subsections facilitate the making of regulations for nurse prescribing for certain controlled drugs in specified circumstances.As regards amendment No. 9, a new section is being inserted to amend section 8(7) of the Misuse of Drugs Acts 1977, as amended by section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1984. Section 8 provides that the Minister may issue a special direction against a practitioner. This new section provides that where the Minister has issued a special direction against a nurse, he or she should send a copy of the report to An Bord Altranais. This is a consequential amendment to the enabling provision for nurse prescribing.As regards amendment No. 38, the amendment inserted between lines 29 and 30 inserts two new paragraphs (l) and (m) which deal with different issues. The main purpose of paragraph (l) is to provide power to the Minister to make regulations, which would provide for nurse prescribing in certain circumstances as would be set out in the regulations. In the context of this provision, it also became necessary to set out in the Bill all those who would be entitled to issue prescriptions for prescription-only medicines under any regulations that would be made.Subparagraph (i) of the new paragraph (l) is intended to continue the traditional position in relation to practitioners’ ability to prescribe medicinal products within the scope of their professional practice. Subparagraph (ii) establishes the entitlement of nurses to issue a prescription in respect of medicinal products as may be specified by regulations. Provision is made so that the authority to issue prescriptions could be made available to nurses generally or to nurses of a particular class having regard to the particular education and training of the class of nurse concerned. It is also provided that the issuing of prescriptions by nurses shall be subject to such conditions, if any, as may be set out in the regulations.Subparagraph (iii) provides for the supply of medicinal products in certain emergency circumstances in accordance with provisions that would be set out in regulations. This also preserves the limited authority available to pharmacists to supply certain medicinal products in certain emergency situations and the availability of certain medicinal products for use by emergency medical technicians, that is, ambulance personnel.Paragraph (m) has, as it main purpose, the prescription and non-prescription control of medicinal products as classified by the Irish Medicines Board acting in its capacity as the competent authority for the granting of marketing authorisation in respect of medicinal products placed on the market in this country. Products which are not to be subject to prescription control may also be controlled by being made available only in pharmacies and, as appropriate, in other outlets according to the classifications in that respect to be assigned by the board.This arrangement will enable regulations to be made to give direct effect to the various classifications that are currently being assigned by the Irish Medicines Board in the grant of the relevant marketing authorisations. This proposed control in respect of non-prescription products is a national control and is intended to rationalise the current three-tiered system that has, to date, operated in respect of medicinal products. The three tiers are those specified in the Irish Medicines Board product authorisations, the prescription and control of supply regulations and in the poisons regulations. As part of this rationalisation process, it is intended to remove medicinal products for human use from the scope of the poisons regulations.Amendment No. 47 proposes the insertion of two new subsections (11) and (12) into section 32 of the Irish Medicines Board Act. Subsection (11) refers to the proposed regulation-making powers under the new subsection (2)(1) which relates to the control of medicinal products on prescription and the issue of prescriptions. This new subsection sets out in greater detail the criteria to be taken into account in the introduction of the prohibitions and exceptions that may be made in regard to the issue of prescriptions and the supply of medicinal products on foot of such prescriptions, including those medicinal products that may be supplied on the prescription of nurses or certain classes of nurses.Subsection (12) refers to the proposed regulation making powers under the new subsection (2)(m)(ii) which relate to those non-prescription medicinal products that may be sold otherwise than in pharmacies. This subsection sets out in greater detail the criteria which would be applicable to such products in terms of their nature, purpose and safety.Amendment No. 48 is a technical amendment as a result of the earlier insertion of new subsections (11) and (12). Amendment No. 50 is a technical drafting amendment arising from amendment No. 51. Amendment No. 51 inserts a new subsection which defines "relevant profession" for the purposes of subsection 2(k) which enables regulations to be made in regard to who may administer medicinal products and subsection 2(1) which relates to the control of medicinal products on prescription. This is a generic description, which is intended to cover registered medical practitioners, and registered dentists who heretofore had a traditional entitlement to administer to patients under their care all classes of medicinal products which they considered necessary for the treatment of their patients.Amendment No. 64 provides for the amendment of section 59(2) of the Health Act 1970 to allow for prescriptions written by nurses to be reimbursable under the drug treatment schemes. Eligibility for free medical services and drugs under the Health Act 1970 is provided for under sections 58 and 59(1) for fully eligible persons, that is, those in the GMS scheme; and under section 59(2) and (3) for limited eligibility persons under the drugs payment scheme and the long-term illness scheme. It is necessary to amend section 59(2) in regard to the drugs payments scheme. The existing subsection (2) provides for reimbursement of expenditure on drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances by limited eligibility persons, above the defined monthly threshold for the DPS, on the prescription of a registered medical practitioner. The proposed amendment would permit the reimbursement to a contracted pharmacist of the prescription of a registered nurse within the parameters to be defined for such prescribing.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	110	This is ridiculous. There is no other word to describe it. Nobody in this House knows what the Minister of State has just said and I am no less intelligent than anybody else in this House, nor am I less intelligent than the people who drafted these amendments or the Minister. I do not claim to be brighter than any of them but I have never in my life been in a situation like this before. I have dealt with complicated company law — and I am not a lawyer — and I have not had this problem. The correct thing to do if they are going to rewrite it like this is to withdraw the Bill, add in all these amendments and reintroduce it.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	112	This House has never held up legislation and it is extremely efficient at processing it. We do not cause delays. We wait and we ask. Most of the time in this House we are either waiting for the Dáil to finish legislation or for the Government to be ready to move with it. We do not hold up legislation either by inertia or deliberate intent and none of us is an innocent in politics. This is a good legislative House.I do not have a script from the Minister of State and I can only remember so much of what he said. This is a profound change, one to which I do not have any principled objection. The Minister of State referred to subsection (i) of new paragraph (3) of an amendment. This is entirely wrong. If I had any sense I would just leave but I am not going to.I have a number of questions. I am not even in a position to state to which amendments they refer because I do not know. The fundamental change to the legislation is both necessary and correct but it must be clear where the professional liability will lie if a nurse prescribes erroneously. Some people suggest to me, including people very close to me, whose existence I do not have to advert to every time I speak here, that the professional liability will still lie with the medical practitioner and that in the event of a prescribing error it is not clear that a nurse would be professionally liable but that it may well be the doctor under whose supervision the nurse is working.That question must be answered with absolute clarity, otherwise the Minister is heading for another big row with the medical organisations, one in which the medical organisations will have right on their side. The legislation must contain clarity on where professional liability begins and ends in terms of culpability for negligence. It appears that professionals are to be liable for the errors of others. We cannot leave this matter unclear and I have seen nothing in the amendments to provide clearly for it. The matter may be addressed but the more I have read of the amendments, the more my mind boggled.Assuming we are only talking about nurses, I question why we have to introduce into our legislation terminology that is hopelessly dated. The Minister of State said that giving people the power to prescribe somehow involves giving them the power to compound and manufacture. I do not know if it does because I am totally confused. The Minister of State mentioned words like "compound" and "manufacture". I put it to him in his professional capacity that a reference to pharmacists compounding prescriptions is little more than a leftover from the way they used to do business. Pharmacists have a hugely important role as the interface in this transaction and as a second safety check but I am not sure they do much compounding any more, if at all. They do an extremely important professional job in terms of making sure that what the public gets is what has been prescribed and deal with ambiguities, uncertainties or even mistakes by those prescribing.It is not clear how pharmacists will know what different grades of nurse are allowed to prescribe. The Minister of State said that certain nurses will be allowed to write prescriptions for certain substances but how will an individual pharmacist know whether Nurse Ryan is a psychiatric nurse or a palliative care nurse? We must know where that information will show up in a way that is clear. My spouse is a psychiatrist and when she writes prescriptions she regularly gets telephone calls from pharmacies to confirm the prescription because she is not a GP. This situation will now be multiplied.I would like to know if the Department of Health and Children has thought out the process by which we can ensure a failsafe proof that prescriptions for palliative medicine in particular, which can have appeals to people other than those who need it, are valid. Increasingly, we have a corporatist pharmacy industry in which there is not an individual local pharmacy but a number of pharmacists employed by what is, effectively, in some cases nearly a multinational at this stage. Substances should be available to people that can help them palliatively, including some of the more controversial substances. If there is medical evidence that either heroin or cannabis is helpful to people who are sick I cannot accept there is any reason not to provide it for them. We must ensure that the chain of authorisation is clear. It may be my fuzzy head or advanced years but I choose to say it is the Minister of State's fault for producing amendments like this without back-up documentation. I do not know that these matters are dealt with in the proposed amendments. That is my first round.

I am very uncomfortable with this. I have never seen anything like it before in the three years I have been in the Seanad. I am also concerned the Minister of State may have a conflict of interests in his role as a former pharmacist. It is regrettable the Ministers of State, Deputies Seán Power or Brian Lenihan——

It is regrettable that neither Deputy Seán Power nor Deputy Brian Lenihan, who are also Ministers of State in the Department, was sent here today because it puts the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, in a very awkward position dealing with this area as a member of the pharmacy profession. I do not make any apology for saying that. I say it out of respect for the Minister of State.I fully agree with Senator Ryan. What we should do at this stage is withdraw the Government amendment until Report Stage and debate it on a different day. It is next to impossible to take in all the information that has been thrown at us in the space of a few minutes.This has major implications and Senator Ryan alluded to some of them. The question that strikes me immediately is whether extra resources will be given to An Bord Altranais. I have limited dealings with the board on the issue of Irish nurses returning home after training or working abroad. It is under pressure dealing with those applications. It also has difficulty finding the resources to deal with the issue of recognising the qualifications of foreign nurses who wish to work here. This will put the board under extreme pressure. Nothing in the Bill provides it with extra funding or staffing. I wonder how well it will work out.What are the implications for ambulance crews? Will people on ambulance crews and fire services have the power to prescribe drugs? I am aware that in Dublin the fire service works on a different system to the rest of the country. It is run like an ambulance service and has extra powers. What are the implications of amendment No. 38 for ambulance and fire services?I urge the Minister of State in the interests of co-operation and fairness to park this series of amendments. Let us have time to digest and examine them and make sure we are proceeding in a correct manner instead of the farcical scenario of returning in a few months' time to put forward further amendments after realising we rushed this through. I urge the Minister of State to leave this amendment to Report Stage. Let us think about it for a week. Hopefully, it will work out fine.Fine Gael has no objection to nurses having the power to write prescriptions. It makes sense. However, we must work out the details and make sure we are not taking an action that will backfire on us.

I am surprised by the comments made by Senator Browne on a conflict of interest arising because I am a pharmacist. I would like the Senator to spell out how it is a conflict of interest. I do not see any. On the contrary, the fact that I am a pharmacist helps me to understand it. Does it mean that a Minister who was a farmer could not take any matter pertaining to farming, or that if I were a businessman I would have to leave if a matter pertaining to business was before the Seanad?

If a conflict of interest arose I assure Senator Browne I would not be here. This is enabling legislation and as it progresses I can foresee objections from pharmacists. I cannot apologise for being a pharmacist. It is what I am.

The Department of Health and Children has three Ministers of State. It would have been preferable if the Minister of State with a pharmacy background did not take the Bill. I do not apologise for that.

I do not understand it. The other Ministers of State are unavailable and I see no conflict of interest. If Senator Browne pursues that line of thought he must explain where the conflict of interest lies.

It is somewhat confusing, particularly for those such as myself seeing the Bill for the first time. However, I am willing to take the word of the Minister of State and his officials that everything is in order and that the concerns raised by both Senators, particularly those raised by Senator Ryan, will be addressed by the Minister of State in his comments. It is unfair of Senator Browne to even suggest that the Minister of State has a conflict of interest in this Bill. In the interests of fair play I ask Senator Browne to withdraw the remark.

Apart from anything else, I am married to a medical practitioner and if the Minister of State has a conflict of interest, so do I. Deputy Micheál Martin was before the House putting through an education Bill and he is a teacher. I do not accept Senator Browne's point. If I felt the Minister of State was representing pharmacists I would be the first to tell him. I do not believe that. It does not mean I am in any way less displeased with how this Bill is being dealt with.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	123	I will attempt to answer some of the questions. On the issue of accountability and clinical indemnity, it is important that these issues are addressed during consultation, and a great deal of consultation with professionals will take place to allay doctors' fears and ensure they are dealt with if unforeseen issues arise during implementation .Senator Ryan asked whether doctors will be held accountable for the prescribing decisions of nurses and midwives. The answer is "No". Nurses and midwives are accountable for their own professional practice and competence. The authority to prescribe medication will require the individual practitioner to be responsible for the prescribing decision, which is the nurse in this case. An individual not involved in determining the medication treatment plan cannot be held accountable. Communication and collaboration among the health care team is essential in sharing the plan of care of patients and clients, particularly as it relates to medication management. On that point, Senator Ryan also asked about errors made in prescription by a nurse. It is the professional responsibility of the pharmacist to pick up errors made in prescriptions, regardless of who prescribed.On the question of clinical indemnity, nurses working in hospitals or other agencies covered by the clinical indemnity scheme are insured to undertake any practice which is in accordance with the law and any stipulations by An Bord Altranais regarded as falling within its area of responsibility. The clinical indemnity scheme is based on the principle of enterprise liability. The employer is covered and assumes vicarious liability for the acts and omissions of employees. The clinical indemnity scheme covers public hospitals and other agencies funded by the Exchequer. It does not cover GP practices.Senator Ryan also asked a question on identifying prescriptions. When the GMS started, numbered medical pads with the name of the doctor were introduced, and only prescriptions on those pads are accepted by pharmacists. Only doctors who are registered can prescribe. The same system will apply for nurses. I agree with Senator Ryan that it will be a technical matter to sort out the classes of nurses who will be allowed to prescribe. It will be done by regulation following consultation with An Bord Altranais and the nursing profession. It has been done in other countries. It will take a great deal of agreement and consultation but it can and will be done.Compounding is a term used. Senator Ryan is correct to state that pharmacists do little compounding, but it was done up to a few years ago and pharmacists are still competent to do it. EU regulations have changed it and a problem now exists with pharmacists using broken packs. It is extremely difficult for pharmacists to compound extemporaneously. It is still done in hospitals and in the community but not as much as before.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	124	If it is still done I agree it should be included. Does the Minister of State agree that if this were done properly we could have had a far more enlightened and informed debate? I have no issue with what the Minister of State proposes. Changing a practice that has been done here and in most other countries for an extremely long time must be done in a comprehensible manner. If ever there is an argument for two Houses of the Oireachtas, this is it. As this Bill emerges from this House a proper debate will take place in the other House but that is no consolation to those of us addled by this procedure.Last summer I had the pleasure of visiting what I claim to be the oldest pharmacy in Europe, located in Dubrovnik. It looked quite different to the Minister of State's former place of work.I reserve the right to examine this amendment and consider further amendments on Report Stage. I must read the Minister of State's detailed explanation of this group of amendments, particularly amendment No. 38.

This has the potential to lead to increased business for pharmacists. We see major commercialisation of pharmacies, with health centres built around the country, complete with in-house pharmacies. There are more and more commercial features. I will withdraw my comment and I did not intend to be personally unfair to the Minister of State.To ensure we debate this Bill correctly, I ask the Minister of State to withdraw this amendment and table it on Report Stage. By that time we will have had the opportunity to digest and debate it.

I do not always get my way.Much legislation is being brought together to allow nurses to prescribe and for the use of drugs by ambulance technicians. Much existing legislation is being amalgamated and we should proceed with the legislation before us. As Senator Ryan stated, this Bill must be passed by the Dáil, at which point amendments can be made.An Bord Altranais has completed a major review of prescribing and has set up an implementation project. There will be no significant funding issues and work has already been done on the educational requirements and standards for nurses to prescribe. Ambulance technicians are employees of the service providers involved and are not covered by this legislation. This legislation provides that they can use the drugs but they cannot prescribe them.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	129	They will administer drugs.

In the heel of the hunt it is best for the patient as the drugs are administered quicker than if one had to wait for doctors to administer them.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	131	Perhaps I am the one with the conflict of interest. What about nurses not employed in the State sector? Erroneous prescription of drugs and adverse side effects are two reasons doctors or their professional indemnity insurers have had to pay substantial sums of money. If these mistakes are made by nurses not employed by the State and if they are to be covered by professional indemnity insurance, nurses will pay insurance policies comparable to those of the most expensive sections of the medical profession until the matter was resolved recently. I wonder what happens in other countries. Perhaps those people do not sue but one will never stop Irish people from suing.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	132	Nurses would not be able to prescribe drugs unless registered with An Bord Altranais. Professional liability will lie with the nurse if he or she does something incorrect. The counterbalance is the pharmacist, who has responsibility for the prescription being correctly written. Liability resides with the pharmacist if a prescription that is incorrectly written is dispensed. It is envisaged that a small number of nurses will prescribe when regulations come into effect. Much discussion will take place with the nursing profession.Regarding Senator Ryan's point on liability, these regulations will not happen unless the nursing profession and An Bord Altranais are on board. It would be foolish to allow legislation to be passed if it were against the wishes of the professional body.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I do not wish to delay the House. I believe I am doing fairly well, considering the state of matters.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	135	It has been suggested that in many areas of delegated responsibilities, where the senior medical person is no longer the person who is professionally liable, there is widespread reluctance to use the delegated authority. People are aware they are open to major legal consequences. We must reassure professionals that as long as they act in an appropriate fashion, taking what peers determine to be appropriate levels of care, they will not be subject to legal actions which they cannot sustain. This is true of all professionals and everybody is responsible for doing a job competently and to an acceptable standard.Regarding the other Bill I have debated with the Minister of State, concerning sub-professions within medicine and social care, people in those professions should also meet a certain standard. When people meet that certain standard they should not have to worry about the possibility of being sued for doing their job in a way everyone regards as competent but which sometimes results in unfortunate consequences. This applies to consultants as well as nurses.I would have wished we could have debated this in a different manner as it requires further discussion.

In the United Kingdom, many general practitioners in the national health service write a considerable number of prescriptions, thereby freeing doctors to do more necessary work. This system has worked despite fears that major problems would arise. I understand the problems to which Senator Ryan alludes but legitimate fears about delegation of responsibility and opening up professions can often be overcome. Proper consultation and working as a team are essential.

In page 6, to delete lines 31 to 33, and substitute the following:"(b) in the case of a body corporate, the Chief Executive Officer of that body.”.This amendment refers to accountability because there seems to be no accountability at the head of the organisation. Fine Gael is concerned that the circumstances raised by Senator Ryan could arise, whereby an individual nurse could be held personally liable. That might cause problems down the line, especially where a person is working for a major GP service. Fine Gael wishes the chief executive of the organisation to accept responsibility and liability. What are the implications if a nurse was sued for millions of euro and did not have the money to pay the litigant?

The wording would also cover the chief executive officer, but to limit responsibility to the CEO alone is considered too narrow an approach. For example, managers, who may not be CEOs, may be responsible for a pharmacy and therefore, must also remain liable if convicted of an offence in connection with controlled drugs. For this reason, I cannot accept the amendment.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	139	On section 3, the word "secretary" is wide open to interpretation, unless the Minister of State can quote company or other legislation to the contrary. The word had a definite meaning at one point in time but it is strange to include it in this Bill. I have always objected to the use of the word when it arises in these types of circumstances because it is a term from another era.

Whether one likes it or not is another issue. The Bill refers to "any director, manager, secretary or other official of a person referred to in paragraph (a)” and secretary is included to cover everyone.

These licences, permits, authorisations and so forth are issued to manufacturers, suppliers and wholesalers of controlled drugs. On occasion they are also issued, for the purposes of research, to universities.Senator Browne's amendments relate to nurse-prescribing but I have made provision in the Government amendments to enable this. With regard to paramedical staff, an advanced paramedic training programme commenced this year and ensures that ambulance personnel can administer an additional 19 medications, including, for example, cardiac medicines. A statutory basis has been provided for this scheme and, therefore, I cannot accept these amendments.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	144	The main point of amendments Nos. 11 to 13, inclusive, is to ensure that nurses undergo training. While a nurse may be registered, medicine is constantly evolving and new drug treatments come on stream regularly. In that context, it is important that nurses be required to undergo additional training on a regular basis to update their skills. That is the simple point Fine Gael is making with these amendments.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	145	It is a sine qua non that nurses, doctors, pharmacists and others involved in this area would undertake continuous education courses. No profession would claim that once individuals are qualified, they do not need postgraduate education. An Bord Altranais ensures that continuous education takes place among nurses. That would be happening automatically, in effect.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	149	I was not in the House for the Second Stage debate but I read the Minister of State's contributions carefully, both his introduction of the Bill and his reply to the debate. I ask him to explain the practical implications of section 4. As I understand it, the aim of the section is to transfer what were the functions of the Minister to the Irish Medicines Board, which seems like an eminently sensible thing to do. However, does the section mean that, for example, a decision to allow cannabis or heroin to be prescribed for people who are ill, will be entirely a matter for the Irish Medicines Board or will the Minister still have a reserve function in that regard? I have struggled with various elements of the legislation so I now ask the Minister of State to prove that he has done the necessary research.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	150	Section 4 amends section 14 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 to allow for the activities of the Irish Medicines Board to include the granting of licences, permits or authorisations under the Misuse of Drugs Act. To date, this activity was carried out by the Department of Health and Children and is now being transferred to the IMB, which will be responsible for the management and supervision of the various licensing schemes.To answer the Senator's question about allowing cannabis or heroin to be prescribed, under controlled conditions, by medical practitioners to terminally-ill patients, the Minister would have the authority to do so.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	151	Would that power still rest with the Minister or the Irish Medicines Board?

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	153	If that is the case, what difference will it make? It is always better for these decisions to be made by people who are somewhat detached from the maelstrom of politics. I accept that the medical jury is out on this issue but if there emerges significant medical evidence that heroin has palliative benefits or that cannabis is a suitable prescription for people with multiple sclerosis will there be a political row or will the competent professional body be allowed to decide? Might the Minister veto the Irish Medicines Board if it deems it necessary and appropriate that the two substances should be made available under controlled conditions?
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	154	This is another example of the Government moving accountability away from the Department of Health and Children to an independent body. I have no objection in this case but there seems to be a trend for this Government to continually take powers away from the Department. The downside to this is a lack of accountability. In future if people ask the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children about prescription drugs they will be told to ask the Irish Medicines Board. When the Bill is debated in the Dáil another section should be inserted to allow for accountability to the Dáil because otherwise, like in other areas, there will be none.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	155	The Irish Medicines Board would make a recommendation to the Minister and the Minister would accept or reject it. It would not involve a political row because the Minister of the day would be foolish to ignore the recommendations of the board. The products must be licensed to be manufactured and used properly. The Irish Medicines Board has the expertise and is there to advise the Minister, who will make the final decision. I cannot envisage the Minister of the day making a decision against the wishes of the board.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	156	I never claim to understand the logic by which Ministers make decisions. Many forces may be at work. I am trying to find out what difference this will make in practice. Is there to be a transfer of personnel from the Department of Health and Children to the Irish Medicines Board or are we simply legislating for the de facto situation that the board already makes recommendations to the Minister?
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	157	Senator Ryan's point is valid and it strikes me as similar to the Health Insurance Authority, set up to advise the Minister but whose advice on risk equalisation the present Minister has rejected.The Minister of State did not answer my question on accountability. I become more confused every day as to the exact role of the Department of Health and Children. A huge amount of power has been devolved from the Department. We welcomed the formation of the Health Service Executive on this side of the House but are now beginning to change our minds because of the lack of accountability. It is anti-democratic because people cannot get answers to questions. Are we creating a similar situation with the Irish Medicines Board?
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	158	I do not have the regulation on the powers of the Irish Medicines Board but they have existed from the time of the National Drugs Advisory Board. There has been no addition to or diminution in those powers. Senator Browne is incorrect to say that this further diminishes the powers of the Department. The Department of Health and Children makes decisions for the Government on policy.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	159	They are the words in the explanatory memorandum.

It already does that for all drugs to ensure legislation in Ireland is up to date, so there is no change. Many people try to circumvent legislation with counterfeit drugs and Members will be aware of a case in the past few days, about which I will not comment. The Irish Medicines Board must be vigilant of change and update the Minister accordingly.There is an ongoing worldwide debate on the therapeutic effects of heroin and cannabis in limited situations.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	161	I am still not clear. As Senator Browne said the explanatory memorandum states, the section enables "the Irish Medicines Board to issue licences, permits and authorisations in respect of controlled drugs for various purposes including manufacture and supply, import and export". If that is the case then the Minister has no function. If the Minister has a function then the board is not enabled to do that task.My only problem with ministerial responsibility is the fact that Ministers want the glory. When the day arrives when a new road or motorway is not opened or announced by a Minister and both are done by the National Roads Authority I will accept there is no ministerial responsibility for building a road. What frustrates the Oireachtas is that Ministers want to be seen to make the announcement of good news but when life gets complicated they say it is not the Minister's responsibility. It either is or is not the Minister's responsibility.I believe that decisions such as this are best taken by a group of competent people. I happened to agree with the Irish Medicines Board on St. John's wort but I must listen to other wise and experienced voices. I am satisfied St. John's wort is potentially dangerous and without regulation would do harm.Wearing a different hat and declaring an interest, I teach people who work in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products. Does the Department currently, and will the Irish Medicines Board in future, provide licence approval for the export of pharmaceuticals out of the country? What work can the Department or the IMB do to deal with the significant Internet trade in what are effectively prescription drugs? I have no idea what harm is being done to people by drugs that have come through no quality assurance scheme. I am not trying to lead the Minister of State astray, but these are valid issues under section 4.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	162	As far as I am aware, licences for the export of drugs will only be issued if they are being manufactured for export to other countries. Obviously manufacturers will be aware of the different regulations.The point the Senator made about the Internet is a valid one. I share his concern on the matter. I have had a few meetings with all the different agencies involved. It is not just a problem in Ireland. It is a worldwide phenomenon which is causing serious problems.The Senator is correct that we have no idea of the damage it is causing. Terrorists are involved and the Internet is also being used to launder money. What people think they are getting on the Internet may be totally different from what they get.I had a meeting with the Irish Medicines Board, the Irish Patients Association, the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda and all the interested agencies. The Irish Patients Association, in agreement with the Irish Medicines Board, got a small grant recently to research further the matter and advise the Government on it. It is a serious problem which is getting worse. There are significant safety implications for vulnerable people such as psychiatric patients who may start to get medicines on the Internet which would not be prescribed for them or may already be prescribed by their psychiatrist. They may add to it with impunity without the intervention of other doctors. We are examining this area and I would be obliged if the Senator would make suggestions on the matter at any time. The Irish Patients Association, representing consumers, is very interested in this issue. I had several discussions with Mr. Stephen McMahon on the matter.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	163	I would like to see a study on the market for Internet drugs in different countries, depending on the generosity of their public health service, in other words, in countries where people do not have heavy prescription charges, such as ourselves, for example. The drugs refund scheme is extraordinarily good for middle class families, in particular, but it hits people on a lower income. In countries where there are comparatively low pharmaceutical product prices, like France, people are in danger of killing themselves with the levels of pharmaceutical consumption. Is there any evidence that where people have access to comparatively cheap prescription medicine through their public health services there is a decline in the demand for Internet drugs and, by contrast, does one find a significant demand in a country like the United States which probably has the cruelest health service in the world?I am unashamedly making a political argument for the idea of a publicly-provided, free at point of use health service. I would ask the Minister of State not to go the route of trying to blame the Internet service providers. This would be shooting the messenger because one does not like the message. It is reasonable in the case of the exploitation of children. It is a sufficiently grave matter involving so much human hurt. Whatever people do with Internet drugs, they are, by and large, doing it to themselves. This is a different level of hurt from the person who is exploiting children in order to sell their images on the Internet. I do not think we should go the route of trying to clamp down on ISPs. We must ensure that people have access to medication at a reasonable price, otherwise we are leaving them wide open to this problem.

One may think one is sourcing a drug on the Internet from America, but it could come from anywhere in the world. We have had discussions on this matter. However, it is extremely difficult to get any handle on the quantities involved because one is basically dealing with an illegal activity.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	165	Is there any evidence in this country of increasing numbers of people showing signs of being harmed because of this activity? I would not care so much if it was just placebos that were involved. I would not care if people just got an overdose of chalk from the tablets but I would be concerned if there were half attempts at making the active agent, containing God knows how many impurities in perhaps multiple doses. What is happening is ridiculous, because on any given night one could sort out one's love life, pharmaceutical needs and everything else on the Internet for allegedly no cost. Paradise is just round the corner.

There is good co-operation between the Irish Medicines Board and the Revenue Commissioners in regard to seizing drugs coming into the country and so on, but it is extremely difficult. If the Senator is interested, I would be pleased if he joined the working group because we need all the expertise available.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	170	Did the form of the legislation cause problems? I have no problem with the amendment. Did the previous prohibition on the production of poppies inhibit people from celebrating great days in November? Is it something we included as a matter of good sense? The amendment proposes that we no longer prohibit the production of poppies unless it is for the production of opium. It used to be a blanket prohibition on the production of poppies.

#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	172	I move:That Seanad Éireann, noting:—that 354 persons have been killed on our roads in the first ten months of 2005;—the number of persons killed or seriously injured on our roads in the first ten months of 2005, is now higher than for the same period in 2004;—that the number of fatalities last month was almost double that for October 2004;—that the Government is failing to achieve its target of reducing road deaths by25%; and—that the Government's failure to put in place the enforcement and legislative measures necessary to reduce road deaths and fatalities is aggravating the level of carnage on our roads;calls on the Government to:—implement in full the commitments contained in the National Road Safety Strategy 2004-2006; including the complete roll-out of the penalty points system from the existing four to the proposed 69 offences;—the achievement of the full complement of the Garda traffic corps as an urgent priority;—the establishment of a road safety authority with a dedicated, rolling budget;—the introduction of random breath testing;—the roll-out of speed cameras nationwide; and—the compulsory training for motorcyclists.I welcome the Minister of State and his officials to the House. I am deputising for Senator Paddy Burke, who is standing in for the Cathaoirleach today and who, unfortunately, cannot move the motion.I welcome the opportunity to debate this important motion. Every year Fine Gael Members use Private Members' time to highlight the unacceptable upward trend in road fatalities and the corresponding failure of the Government to do anything about it. This year has been particularly bad with 20 more people killed than this time last year. That equates to one third of the membership of the Seanad.It is easy to consider figures coldly but when they translate into family members and so on, one realises the devastation caused. This figure contains a high number of young drivers while the number of serious injuries has increased significantly. Naturally, less emphasis is paid to the injuries caused by road accidents but such injuries are usually accompanied by devastating life changing circumstances for the individuals involved and their families. Sadly, the number runs into thousands each year.The motion refers to the death toll for October, the latest month for which figures are available, although the death toll for November will be even worse. This is totally unacceptable and cannot continue. In October 2004, 22 people were killed on our roads while in October 2005 a total of 42 people lost their lives. It is difficult to believe the figure has almost doubled. Many of the victims were young people who had their entire lives ahead of them. Why is Ireland the only country in the European Union in which the trend in road deaths is upwards? This raises serious questions.As this unacceptable increase in road deaths continues, everybody, except the Government, is conscious that these deaths could be avoided and accidents could be prevented. This must be particularly hard for the families of the deceased and the injured to deal with and they deserve better. Unfortunately, we can predict that each weekend our nightly news bulletins will be characterised by grisly images of broken cars and heartbroken families. This must stop.As the motion highlights, all we have had from the Government is promises and more promises. None of these empty promises has been delivered. The Ministers for Transport and Justice, Equality and Law Reform never move beyond such promises. Where is the 1,200 member Garda traffic corps, which was promised as a priority in 2002? An extra 34 gardaí have been deployed so far but the corps is not dedicated to traffic duty alone. The gardaí involved can be called away from their road side duties at any time. How can this corps effectively police our roads if it is absent for critical periods?Where are the speed cameras, which were first promised as a priority in 1998, when we were informed such cameras would be rolled out throughout the country? Seven years later, only three speed cameras operate at any time in counties Meath, Dublin and Louth. The Government may well tell us cameras are on the way but, having waited for seven years, I cannot be blamed for being sceptical that they will ever arrive.Motorcyclists were promised compulsory basic training in 1998 but nothing has happened in this regard. This is a glaring issue, which must be addressed urgently. Motorcyclists comprise fewer than 2% of the motoring public but they account for almost 16% of road fatalities annually. A swift roll-out of all 69 penalty point offences was also promised but, thus far, only four offences are provided for under the system and there is no sign of other offences being added.In the latest fiasco involving the Government, the long-promised introduction of random breath testing is floundering. The Minister of Transport stated it may not be possible to introduce such testing due to legal difficulties but Fine Gael does not accept this view. Random breath testing is a feature of road safety in many states. For example, in the Australian state of Victoria, its introduction contributed to a 50% reduction in road deaths. The template is in place and random breath testing can save lives. We cannot turn our back on it merely because of legal difficulties. If we are serious about reducing carnage, such difficulties must be overcome.With regard to the issues of the traffic corps, speed cameras, penalty points, motorcycle training and random breath testing, the Government made lofty promises but did not act. The Government lacks the will to do anything, despite the urgency of the situation. We need leadership from our Government to tackle road deaths but, instead, we have experienced paralysis while the number of road fatalities has increased.My party leader, Deputy Kenny, recently called on the Taoiseach to take personal responsibility for ensuring these crucial road safety measures are implemented. Nothing less is good enough. In France, President Chirac took responsibility for this issue and fought to ensure what needed to be done was done. The result was a dramatic reduction in road deaths. We need the same high level involvement in Ireland or else nothing will change. The public has lost confidence in the ability of the responsible Ministers to do anything.The Government has an appalling road safety record, although it will seek to defend it later. However, I ask Government Members to consider the appalling record of road deaths. The upward trend in recent years speaks for itself and the current road safety regime is failing. They should also consider that the failure of the Government's response is nowhere better typified than by the decision of the chairman of the National Safety Council to resign last week. Mr. Eddie Shaw has long been a committed supporter of reform of our road safety regime. He has campaigned passionately for many years for reform and new initiatives to reduce road deaths. His resignation is the culmination of years of frustration due to his pleas for action repeatedly falling on the deaf ears of the Government. Who could blame him for his decision to walk away? I urge the Government to take its head out of the sand and give this issue the priority it deserves. If the Government continues to ignore road safety, countless more preventable deaths and injuries will occur on our roads every day.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	173	I second the motion and I thank Senator Browne for raising this matter again. I welcome the Minister of State to the House.Over the past month, there have been repeated calls in the House for a debate on the issue of road safety. My party colleagues decided to use our Private Members' time to give the House an opportunity to debate the strategy, if it can be called that, in place and to analyse the Government's performance in achieving the goals agreed on a cross-party basis in 1998.Despite early successes following the introduction of penalty points, the trend has been in the opposite direction in the most appalling way. The House, which has a good record on debating this issue, needs to take ownership of this issue again as we head into the Christmas period to make sure the clear strategy set out in 1998, which has since been updated, is implemented.The annual national survey of motorists' behaviour and attitudes was published yesterday and I read it this morning with dismay. Unbelievably appalling statistics come from that survey of just over 1,000 drivers. One in eight drivers has fallen asleep at the wheel because of his or her hectic lifestyle. Motorists are comfortable with flouting the law because they feel they will not be caught by gardaí. Driver behaviour has worsened in the past 12 months. The only thing that will stop the 1,000 drivers surveyed from continuing to break the law is more enforcement. When penalty points were introduced there was a dramatic reduction in road fatalities and injuries in the first three months, a trend which has since been reversed. Some 44% drove after drinking and half of those had three or more drinks.From this basic survey we can see that the Government's strategy to which we signed up is not working. Both Houses must revisit the implementation of that strategy and ensure that much more is done on the kind of issue Senator Browne raised to try to reduce road fatalities and injuries.I will concentrate on random breath testing. I note the Government amendment includes the following, "That Seanad Éireann notes the ongoing efforts of the Minister for Transport, together with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General, to extend the basis for roadside breath testing". The Government first announced that it would move on this issue in 1998 and seven years later we have a Government amendment that notes the "ongoing efforts". What efforts? If there are constitutional difficulties, let us hear about them. Let us have it upfront rather than this nonsensical ping pong game between the Taoiseach, who said one thing and the Minister for Transport, who said something quite different in the space of 24 hours last week. I have changed my mind on the issue of random breath testing because I have examined the international evidence and seen that random breath testing elicits a significant change in drink driving. It is time we moved away from platitudes such as appear in the Government's amendment towards the kind of implementation that was promised in 1998.One of the reasons I have changed my mind on random breath testing is that the evidence from countries such as New Zealand, Australia, France, Finland and Belgium is incontrovertible. Where random breath testing is introduced there is a dramatic causal reduction in the number of fatalities as a result of drink driving. We must move quickly towards a situation where random breath testing will happen. We also have the opportunity to reduce the allowable blood alcohol level, which is still high by comparison with western European standards. After Finland's 25 year campaign, drink driving as a reason for fatalities represents less than 1% of the total number of people killed on the roads. In New South Wales, Australia, random breath testing was introduced in 1982. Drink driving caused 32 deaths in the first quarter of 1981, before random breath testing was introduced, compared with eight deaths in the first quarter of 1982, after it was introduced. Similar evidence has come from New Zealand and France. The attitude to this issue has changed. People are fed up that we cannot make the progress that was clearly needed in 1998.I wish to speak on penalty points North and South. I am a member of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body and with Lord Alf Dubbs produced a report two years ago asking both Governments to move immediately to the mutual recognition of penalty points north and south of the Border. From the evidence of fatalities, speeding and road-related injuries on the North-South roads that traverse the Border, in particular the Dublin-Belfast road, it is clear that poor driver behaviour is related to the fact that no penalties can be imposed on people. We must immediately move to a situation where a Northern Irish driver who commits an offence on our roads has penalty points attached to his or her licence and vice versa. The British say they do not even have mutual recognition within the United Kingdom but I believe there is no reason mutual recognition between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland cannot be introduced tomorrow because that is where people are driving and where the danger exists. I ask the Government to continue its efforts in this area, which is a huge contributing factor to the number of deaths on our roads.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	174	I move amendment No. 1:To delete all the words after "That" and substitute the following:Seanad Éireann—notes that Government policy since 1998 on road safety has provided a framework for the delivery of reductions in road deaths on a sustained basis;—notes the commitment of the Minister for Transport, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Commissioner to advance a further major extension of the operation of the penalty points system as quickly as possible;—notes that the Government has decided to pursue arrangements for appropriate private sector involvement in the deployment and operation of speed cameras;—notes the ongoing efforts of the Minister for Transport, together with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General, to extend the basis for roadside breath testing;—acknowledges the progress being made by the Garda Síochána in increasing the strength of the Garda traffic corps in line with the commitments made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform;—notes that the Minister for Transport is pursuing legislative proposals for the establishment of the road safety authority and that the new authority will have a central role in the co-ordination of the delivery of road safety programmes, and notes that the Minister will provide a legislative basis for the introduction of compulsory initial practical training for motorcyclists, which will be overseen by the RSA; and—acknowledges and supports the Government's continued commitment to the delivery of the policy initiatives set out in the Road Safety Strategy 2004 to 2006 and its continued efforts to realise the target set in the strategy to reduce road deaths to a total of not more than 300 per annum by the end of 2006."I welcome the Minister and the opportunity to discuss this important issue. I compliment Fine Gael on this motion, which we have been talking about on the Order of Business for a while. Every opportunity to discuss road safety and deaths on our roads allows us to further highlight this serious issue. The most important factor is trying to bring about a culture change, which as everybody knows, happens slowly. The Government has an important role in defining policy and ensuring that the proper legislative framework is put in place; the proper enforcement exists; and there is a network to follow the strategy that has been agreed, as Senator Hayes pointed out, from an all-party perspective. Notwithstanding the efforts made, we have seen a continuation of the increase in road deaths this year. In 2003 the EU Ministers with responsibility for transport met in Verona and declared that "the huge amount of human victims on the roads is too high a price and that, the situation being such, the eradication of this scourge is a top priority on their political agenda. Any delay in action would mean further irreparable losses in terms of human lives". That is an indictment of all elements of the operation including the political system, enforcement bodies and the individuals who have failed to observe the law. As legislators, we have an important role to ensure legislation exists and that we have the resources for enforcement.By and large we are dealing with adult vehicle owners, most of whom are bright and intelligent workers. However, they fail to contribute to society in terms of their duty of care, not just to themselves, but to the people among whom they live. It is critical we address this issue of the people in society who continue to have scant regard for laws and life. People should have greater respect for their lives and those of others and we must address this lack through education and culture change.This has been a difficult year in terms of road safety. Up to Monday of this week, some 359 people had died this year as a result of road accidents, 24 more than by the same date last year. Addressing this situation requires a sustained and strategic approach by the Government and a commitment from all our citizens.Senator Brian Hayes outlined well the situation relating to random breath testing. One of the major causes of death on our roads is drink driving. Despite promotional campaigns, enforcement efforts and severe legal repercussions, people continue to make the decision to drink and drive. This cannot be allowed to continue. The introduction of random breath testing has dominated media coverage on the issue of road safety of late. This has come about because the Government has wanted to move on this area for some time. International experience has shown some phenomenal results, particularly in the state of Victoria in Australia which has what it calls the "booze-buster bus" where people suspected of drink driving can undergo random breath testing. The processing is done in the large mobile vehicle on the side of the road.The road safety strategy provides that random breath testing should be in place before the end of 2006. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, has raised the difficulty of introducing such a policy with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, of which I am a member. He has outlined the constitutional issue and the advice from the Attorney General; the parliamentary legal adviser attended the committee today in private session. I will not go into the details of the discussion. The committee has sought further legal advice from her and, if necessary, from an outside legal adviser with a view to getting a clear opinion on where we are headed with this issue.There is a body of evidence that suggests that the bodily integrity issue, in terms of being asked to produce a random breath test, is not proportional, and under the Constitution may create a difficulty. We must try to get beyond this legal point. I do not consider being asked to blow into a bag invasive, considering the consequences in terms of the destruction a person over the alcohol limit can cause. We must be careful how we proceed on this. As the Minister is aware from his deliberations, there is no point in enacting legislation that will be challenged in the courts.The one area of legislation most frequently challenged is legislation associated with drink driving. Certain people believe they are not committing a criminal offence by drink driving and will challenge that in every court. These people usually have considerable resources available to them. We have seen many challenges in the past, and no doubt will see many more. Whatever we do now must be cognisant of the Constitution and ensure we are not left in a situation where the laws passed in the House will be ridiculed. That would undermine the work done here. The people affected by drink driving and the road deaths associated with it will have little regard for anything that is done within the environs of the Legislature if we enact laws that can be overturned.I agree with the sentiment of what Senator Brian Hayes said in terms of the necessity for and acceptance of random breath testing. Recognising that, we must look at the issue from the constitutional point of view. Whatever we do, we need to move quickly. If we can legislate to give gardaí greater powers to impose roadside breath tests, the purpose will be to change the climate and culture among the public at large towards the practice of drink driving. This brings us back to what I said earlier about the need for culture change as well as education. In the unfortunate event that we cannot legislate, we should remind ourselves that as matters stand, gardaí may request a breath sample where they form the opinion that an intoxicant has been consumed. This has created a difficulty in the past. Some cases have gone through the courts where there was no issue as to whether the person was intoxicated, but a challenge was made as to how gardaí formed the opinion the person was drunk. This happens despite the test indicating the person was at three times the limit. Some people will go into court and fight the issue on the basis of how the opinion was formed. I do not wish to involve the Judiciary in this regard, but one must question where the balance lies. This is something we need to address.I do not wish to concentrate on drink driving, but it and speed combine to cause many of our accidents. Many of us saw the programme on anti-social behaviour the other night and saw how high speed cars were involved in that behaviour. The Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Callely, has a view on how these can be controlled through the NCT and how we might move away from a culture where people have an over-inflated pride in their car and in souped-up models.There is a club effect which involves these people racing their cars day and night. This is seen even in rural areas. On many Monday mornings we can see tyre marks associated with handbrake turns. This culture has developed on the back of a strong economy. It is not so long since we grew up, but the type of money required for these cars was not available to 17 and 18 year olds then. Now they have high-powered cars to race in at weekends whereas we were lucky if we had a bad bicycle to get us home from the disco. The situation has changed and is creating a problem which should be addressed in conjunction with the other areas.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	177	I welcome this debate, but I am sorry it is so adversarial. We make a mistake by taking the attitude regularly that we will have one party praising the Minister and the other attacking him for failure. This carping style does not go down well with the public, particularly when dealing with a subject as serious as road safety. The debate has not been confrontational, but the terms are, which is a pity.It is useful that this matter is addressed in the Joint Committee on Transport, of which both Senator Dooley and I are members. Mr. Eddie Shaw appeared before the committee recently and he provided a very interesting breakdown and recommendations, including legislative recommendations. I will not summarise them here, but the Minister would do well to look at the report of the committee. The committee acts in a neutral atmosphere and that is why it is so valuable.With regard to how gardaí form an opinion that somebody is drunk, a dreadful situation was reported on the radio recently where a woman spoke in a very dignified manner about how her husband who had a stroke was left to die on the floor of the Garda station because gardaí thought he was drunk.On the matter of speeding, we must have consistency and coherence with regard to speed limits. They are absurd and all over the place. We will not have respect for the law unless we do something to ensure it can be respected. Some issues are quite obvious with regard to crashes. Every weekend we get the same kind of syndrome, we find a group of young people with powerful cars on secondary roads in a rural environment in the early hours of Sunday morning — quite often drink is involved. Let us examine rather than evade this issue.There are also circumstances where the authorities have a real responsibility. I want to raise a particular case which illustrates a serious worry. I refer to a young woman called Aisling Gallagher who was killed in Mayo. Her parents have been in touch with me. She was travelling on the road after a shopping trip and was due to catch an aeroplane to America the following day. There was a temporary surface on the road. There was no warning about the use of dense bitumen macadam forming the top layer. There were markings on the road which suggested it was a full, proper surface, but it was not. There were no indications of a speed restriction.The speed limit sign on that road indicated 100 km/h. One is not compelled to drive at 100 km/h in such a speed zone but one has a sense of safety if the authorities are of the view that when driving at 100 km/h one will be safe. Driving at even 30 km/h in this case would probably have been enough to lead to this accident. The parents in this case feel there was serious disregard for public safety because there was no safety warning and there was an inappropriate temporary surface, and this has continued to be the position since then.This girl was only 20 years old. She had got an honours degree. She was a wonderful young, attractive, intelligent woman with her life in front of her. The National Roads Authority had outlawed the use of DBM wearing course outside 50 km/h zones, and there was a sign indicating a speed limit of 100 km/h on this road. This young girl, Aisling Gallagher, was approaching a bend in road in the village of Murrivaugh and had to reduce speed because the car in front was turning right. Immediately and unexplainedly, her car veered across the road into the path of a loaded concrete wagon coming in the opposite direction. Neither motorist had taken any alcohol and this was shown to be the case subsequently and, furthermore, neither was speeding.The Minister needs to examine the question of road surfaces. Some are clearly done wrong. I have evidence in this case that the buck was passed from one Department to another, to the Health and Safety Authority, to the National Roads Authority and then passed back to the county council where the process began. I will send copies of this information to the Minister. This issue is serious and I believe it may have been at the root of the tragic accident involving the school bus in Trim.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	178	I thank Senator Norris for sharing his time with me. I add my words of praise for the work of Eddie Shaw, the former chairman of the National Safety Council. He resigned last week because of what I believe was his utter frustration at his inability to persuade the Government to do what he believed had to be done.I had the experience some years ago of meeting a man on the floor of my supermarket who made a criticism. When I questioned his criticism, he said he recognises these things. The words he used were "I am a quality inspector in the construction industry." I asked him was this the reason he noticed standards were slipping, to which he replied "Yes". I asked him what was the most important element in ensuring that standards are reached. He said it is "if the boss thinks it is important".Senator Dooley referred to the position in Victoria, Australia. I came back from Australia last week and I often travel to France. There has been a dramatic drop in the number of road deaths in Victoria and France and the reason for the improvement is that the boss thought the issue was important. The President of France gave it priority and said he would put this issue at the top of his list. He said he would ensure the number of road deaths was reduced and that has happened.I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power. We know what we have to do to address this issue. We do not need to debate it further. If motorists know they will be caught, they will behave on the road. Senator Brian Hayes referred to a point with which I would like us to get to grips. I often travel North and I refer to the behaviour of motorists on either side of the Border. The drivers of southern cars north of the Border and the northern cars travelling to County Louth know they will not be caught for bad road behaviour or, if they are, that the penalty points system would not apply to them. It would be simple to address this matter. We know we can do that and we need to do so.When the penalty points system was introduced the number of road deaths dropped dramatically from 40 per month to 20 per month. That improvement in the position lasted only four months but for that period our record was the best in Europe. Then motorists began to realise that they would not be caught for breaches in that respect. As a nation, we took our eye off the ball and our leaders, irrespective of which party or parties were in Government, did not make this issue a priority. If motorists know they will be caught for such breaches, they will behave. Whether the breach is in respect of alcohol consumption or driving at speed, we have the technology to do something about this.In addressing the issue of driving at speed, I am a great believer in using technology and in erecting speed cameras throughout the country.

The investment would be worthwhile. Motorists would know they would be caught for breaches of the law. Speed cameras can identify what happens on our roads and the motorists who drive at speed. The use of such technology would result in what happened two and a half years ago when we reduced the number of deaths on our roads. It is in the hands of the Government to address this issue. It is in the hands of the Minister of State to say he will push the Government to do this. If the Taoiseach were to give this issue priority — I accept the Minister of State gives it priority but he must get support for it — there would be an improvement in the position. We do not need new ideas, strategies or promises. All we need is for the Government to deliver on the promises it made so many times in the past.I repeat what I said at the outset. We know what we have to do if we are to cut the number of deaths on the road. All we have to do is actually do it. However, this issue needs to be given priority and determination and somebody at the top needs to say, "This is my priority and this is what the Government will do."We do not have to wait for a new Government to take office to address this issue. It could be done next week. I welcome this debate because it is a way of making sure that this matter it brought to the top of the agenda and to the forefront of our minds to ensure that we do something about it.
#KateWalsh	unknown-#KateWalsh-party	unknown-#KateWalsh-dob	unknown-#KateWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	183	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, to the House. I appreciate this opportunity to speak on this tragic issue. I last spoke on road safety here on 27 April. Since that day, 242 more lives have been lost on our roads. I said on that occasion that I have a problem with statistics because they disguise the pain and distress families and friends suffer as a result of tragic loss. I referred in April to there being 118 tragic losses and of the sorrow for the families of those who lost their lives to that date, but another 242 lives have been lost. That is a shocking waste of life and many of those killed were young. Commitment and investment by the Government must be matched with real action and improvements because that means lives will be saved.In April, I focused on three specific points, namely, the use of headlights during day-time driving, the cleanliness of headlights and number plates and pedestrian safety. These issues are even more important at this time of the year when visibility is reduced, weather conditions are worsened and many people make extra road journeys. On the first point I mentioned, studies reveal that leaving dipped headlights switched on during daylight, regardless of the weather conditions, reduces the risk of crashes. This is especially true when cars overtake and cross to the other side of the road.Legislation in many countries forces drivers to drive with their lights on all day. In Canada, this has been the case for 16 years. The authorities there estimate that the practice of using headlights during daylight hour have saved 120 lives each year. I also highlighted the cases of Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. I repeat my call that we consider the introduction of some similar measure in Ireland, particularly for heavy goods vehicles. We have vast numbers of HGVs on our roads, transporting goods in what is, thankfully, our prosperous economy. If large trucks and lorries used their dipped headlights during the daylight, accidents would be avoided and lives saved.As I stated previously, the practice would have an added benefit in that as darkness falls in the evening, we would not rely on individual drivers to switch on their lights. How many times have motorists approached oncoming cars at dusk with their lights switched off? I have driven by them and flashed my lights at them. It puts the heart crossways in me when I meet a grey or dark car with the lights switched off. It is particularly prevalent in lit up areas and these motorists seem to think that they can rely on street lights. It is dreadful. A child or a person out jogging crossing the road in the path of such an unlit vehicle could be knocked down. Dark coloured cars with the lights switched off travelling on a dark evening are a hazard to their occupants and other motorists.It is crucial that drivers of vehicles, in particular HGVs, keep their headlights, indicators and number plates clean and visible. The Minister of State has previously appealed to drivers and owners of heavy good vehicles regarding safety mirrors, for which I commend him. Similar campaigns should be applied with regard to lights and visibility. Drivers must be compelled to keep their vehicles in the safest possible condition.Bus drivers have a specific responsibility as they hold the safety of passengers in their hands. Fading light and poor weather contrive to make driving vehicles such as buses more hazardous in winter months. The driver is responsible for safety. Before he or she turns the key, he or she must confirm that the lights are clean and their number plates are visible. I have frequently driven behind buses with faulty, broken or filthy lights; a situation which is unsafe.Vehicles must be in proper condition and headlights are extremely important. Sometimes, a car only carries side bulbs and lacks any headlights. Drivers facing such a car do not know whether they are meeting a wide vehicle or a motorcycle. Studies show that dirty headlights can reduce a driver's night vision by between 50% and 90%, which can be the difference between having an accident or not. I have called for all regulations relevant to this area to be reviewed and would be grateful if the Minister of State could inform me as to whether this has been done or is being considered. We must work towards reducing the risk of accidents on Irish roads.A total of 56 pedestrians have been killed on our roads this year. Drivers must be aware of the dangers traffic poses to people walking on footpaths, and in many areas, on roads. Pedestrians who walk on our roads, particularly at night, also have responsibilities. More than two-thirds of fatal pedestrian accidents happen during the hours of darkness. Pedestrians may be able to hear oncoming traffic and see their lights but drivers may not see them and certainly will not hear them.Consideration should be given to making it compulsory for pedestrians walking on roads at night to wear reflective armbands or Sam Browne belts. How many lives would have been saved if the pedestrian in question could have been seen from a safer distance? These three specific points are important to any debate on road safety. I appreciate the opportunity given to me to make them and I support the Government's effort to make Irish roads safer for all.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	184	I do not often quibble with the content of Government amendments since they are usually daft but I sometimes become annoyed when people make factual claims that are unsustainable. I am not sure what the first two lines of the Government amendment mean. These state that "Government policy since 1998 on road safety has provided a framework for the delivery of reductions in road deaths on a sustained basis". A total of 458 people died on our roads in 1998, while 413 people died in 1999, 415 people died in 2000, 411 people died in 2001, 376 people died in 2002, 334 people died in 2003, 374 people died in 2004 and over 374 people have died so far in 2005. There has been some reduction in road deaths, for which I am glad, but one is entitled to dispute the claim that there is a sustainable pattern of reduction in road deaths.It is alarming to discover that matters are not as bad as they were previously. Figures released by the Garda Síochána reveal that 628 people died on our roads in 1978. Matters have improved. The formula for reducing road deaths is simple to say, if not to practise. One needs safe vehicles, safe roads and safe driving. The lack of any one of these elements will frustrate the achievement of the other two. If some people do not drive safely, the roads are not of a sufficient standard or vehicles are not roadworthy, accidents can occur. The NCT has removed unroadworthy vehicles from our roads. We should remember the vehicles which were allowed on our roads before the introduction of the NCT. I remember sitting in cars where I was forced to keep my feet off the ground because the cars in question had no floor. Such vehicles were officially taxed and insured.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	186	I assure the Minister of State that I did not drive while I was keeping my feet off the floor. I accept that vehicles are safe with regard to their engineering maintenance and care. There are greater numbers of roads today, which are safer than before. However, newspaper headlines from the last two days indicate that our driving is getting worse. According to an NRA survey relating to 2003, 86% of cars exceeded the 30 mph speed limit in the urban arterial 30 mph zone. The NRA trumpeted the fact that this figure was a considerable improvement because the figure for the previous year was 99%. I do not dispute the fact that the 2003 figure represented an improvement. The figures from the survey showed that 75% of cars exceeded the speed limit in the 40 mph zone. A total of 96% of rigid vehicles and 92% of articulated vehicles exceeded the speed limit in the 30 mph urban national zone. There was no difference between the figures for articulated vehicles in 2003 and 2002, while the figures for rigid vehicles in 2003 represented an 11% increase on the 2002 figures.Figures relating to motorways are even more alarming. A total of 85% of articulated vehicles exceeded the speed limit on motorways in 2003. The average speed of these vehicles was 53 mph, which is three miles above the maximum speed limit. Articulated trucks are forbidden from driving above 50 mph. Only 23% of cars exceeded the speed limit on motorways, while 83% of rigid vehicles exceeded the speed limit, with an average speed of 55 mph. Articulated vehicles must have a governor fitted which prevents them exceeding 55 mph yet the vehicles in the survey managed an average speed of 53 mph. One does not need to be a mathematical genius to work out that if such vehicles have an average speed of 53 mph, a considerable portion of them must be exceeding this speed. An articulated vehicle travelling at over 53 mph is exceeding what it is supposedly able to do. As I have stated previously in this House, I have begun a guerilla war against articulated trucks. While I am driving during the day, I note the name of the company which owns the truck that is exceeding the speed limit and telephone my secretary because I am unable to write down names while I am driving. My secretary then keeps a record of the name.

I then write to the companies which own the trucks in question. It would be invidious and improper to identify them but they are major distributors, some of which operate in the retail sector. I receive heartfelt letters from all of them assuring me their trucks are fitted with governors.However, my secretary recently received a telephone call from a major company which assured him that everyone knew of ways to circumvent governors. If we all know, we can all stop their use. I have discovered since that one can simply remove a fuse from a governor. In my innocence I assumed that, like a meter in a taxi, a governor would have an official seal on it to ensure that once it was put in, it could not be tampered with. If we can do so in regard to meters in thousands of taxis, we can insist on it in respect of governors in articulated trucks.I got involved in this campaign when the National Roads Authority told me that of all vehicles on the road, 3% are classified as heavy goods vehicles yet they are involved in 10% of fatal accidents. I draw the obvious conclusion that the reason they are involved in that number of accidents is not necessarily exclusively, but largely because they are being driven too fast by drivers who are under considerable pressure, either by contract or employment, to do too much on our limited roads in too short a time. The one measure which could have a dramatic effect would be to enforce the law in respect of heavy goods vehicles.

So far this year, 360 people have lost their lives on the roads of the Twenty-six Counties. While the number is dramatically down on the 472 people killed in 1997, it is 360 people too many. It is the Government's intention to reduce the number of deaths from 472 in 1997 to an average of 300 by 2010. However, that is still too high a figure.In October 2002 the penalty points system was introduced by the then Minister, Deputy Brennan. I very much welcomed its introduction at the time and, initially, it was a very successful campaign. However, I now admit it is not working the way in which it was intended and for a number of reasons, mainly because the gardaí are not on the right roads. I am not talking about the highways but about the byways on which many of these accidents occur. It is not working because people detected speeding must sometimes wait up to three months to get a letter in the post stating they have been caught speeding. It is also not working because there are technical hiccups. For instance, letters are not registered, an issue I raised before. It is a loophole which people can get around and it should be closed.Unlike some previous speakers, I do not believe the penalty points system should be expanded to 69 offences. It should be confined to five or six, including speeding, not wearing a seat belt and, in particular, driving without insurance. Not only should somebody receive the maximum number of penalty points, which is 12, if they are caught driving without insurance but he or she should be disqualified from driving for five years.I agree with what Senator Kate Walsh said in regard to headlights. It should be compulsory for headlights to be on at all times. I commend Senator Brian Hayes, who is a member of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body along with myself and the Acting Chairman, Senator Dardis, and Lord Dubs on the work their committee is doing in regard to trying to harmonise the penalty points system between North and South. It is a joke in my part of the country where the natives attempt to obey the speed limits yet they are overtaken by cars with Northern registrations doing twice the speed limit, the drivers of which know nothing can be done about them. I welcome the initiative being undertaken and I commend the amendment.
#MarcMacSharry	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-party	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-dob	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	192	I thank Senator Wilson for sharing his time. Like Senator Norris, I regret a motion must be tabled on this issue. We should have statements because there is a great deal of unanimity in regard to the approach to this issue and agreement that we continue to fail in our efforts to reduce the number of deaths on the roads. However, that does not mean the willingness does not exist on all sides of the House to try to implement a strategy which will reduce the number of deaths.Since 1998 there has been an unbelievable increase in the number of cars and trucks on the roads. The level of traffic in the most rural parts of the country has also increased. I am not here to necessarily praise the Minister or to give out about him but I would like to make a few points on how we could make more progress. Speeding results in more deaths than any other factor. Senator Norris mentioned that speed limits throughout the country are inconsistent. Responsibility for speed limits should be removed from the local authorities and they should be implemented by the new road safety authority. Deaths as a result of speeding occur predominantly late at night or in the early hours of the morning. Young drivers, young men in particular, are seriously injured or killed.When I was younger I probably was careless and fond of driving that little bit too fast. Indeed, I had a number of accidents. When many young people get their provisional licences at 17 and 18 years of age, it is all about driving fast and getting to their destination more quickly. When I think of how irresponsible my actions were at that time, I am thankful I am more mellow now and can see the benefits of driving slowly and in a calculated way. We must deal decisively with this scenario of young people driving fast in modified cars set up to do higher speeds than those for which they were built.I recommend that we implement a policy where governors should be considered for drivers under a certain age unless they are prepared to embrace a particular course of training. In fact, I would incentivise people with governors, whether through direct State subsidisation of their insurance bills or through the insurance companies. The insurance bills of those with governors and driving under a 60 mph speed limit should be reduced by up to 50%.Speeding obviously attracts young people, so there should be alternatives. We have none compared with other countries. There is Mondello Park and a number of go-kart tracks throughout the country. Along with the more reputable celebrity drivers, whether Formula 1 or rally drivers, we should implement State-sponsored programmes in schools and allow young people to experience speeding in an appropriate environment. The impression is given in Hollywood movies that it is cool to drive at 100 mph on particular roads. However, we must implement a policy which shows it is not cool to drive at such speeds but that it is cool to engage in motor sports with the professionals and in the proper safe environment and not on our roads in the middle of the night. We also know alcohol abuse is a problem which, mixed with speeding, is a lethal combination.The use of governors should be considered. We should encourage alternatives and engage those involved in motor sports to try to encourage people to drive more slowly. If people must speed, they should do so in the right way and join the various clubs. Perhaps the Minister of State could take a couple of those points on board.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	193	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Callely. I hope he has tuned in to what has been said in this important debate on road safety and that he will take note of the points made.Ireland is the only country in the EU where there is an upward trend in road deaths. There is absolutely nothing the Government can do to spin its way out of this, the figures that exist tell a story of human suffering and misery beyond understanding, which could be prevented by the necessary legislative and enforcement measures.Most importantly and tellingly, the National Safety Council has stated that half of these deaths could be avoided if the proper enforcement structures were in place. That is, they could be prevented by a strong Government, which could tackle the horrific carnage that we see on our roads. That certainly does not describe the present Government which has exhibited great inaction on the issue of road safety. Here we get to the nub of the matter. We have a Government which does not enforce its own legislation or initiatives. Every action of the Government sends out a message of low priority in regard to driver behaviour and the subsequent threat to road safety. How can we be surprised when some drivers pick up this signal and cause mayhem, injury and death on our roads?A total of 2,000 extra gardaí were promised after the election in 2002, but we now know that this figure will not be met until 2008 — another promise. This delay is impacting on the effective policing of road safety measures.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	196	The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated in May this year that 211,982 speeding offences were detected in 2004. This means that a mere 20% of the target set in the national road safety strategy is being reached. Should we not feel helpless and despairing when we read that gardaí in rural areas arrest only one driver each per annum on suspicion of drink driving? The figures also indicate that only one person is arrested for drink driving for each of the 12,000 pubs in the country annually and even more strangely, only one quarter of that number is convicted.There is a direct correlation between initiatives to increase safety on our roads and a decrease in road fatalities. If the Government does not channel resources into improving standards, the cycle of low standards leading to high road death figures will continue. The Government is sending out the message that anything goes. Over 30% of drivers on our roads break speed limits and drink driving is commonplace. Despite continual assurances to the contrary, there are significant delays in attaching penalty points to driving licences. The positive impact of penalty points, which did have a dramatic effect in reducing road deaths, has not followed through. Senator Dooley referred to this matter. The results were great in the first four months after penalty points were introduced but this has not been sustained. To date, only four out of 69 offences for which penalty points are applied have come into operation. Will the Minister of State indicate when the computerised system will be activated and outline the reasons for the delay? Some 18,000 drivers who hold licences that are not Irish are able to treat the current system with disdain and get away scot free in terms of the attachment of penalty points. This issue must be urgently addressed. Several Members have referred to this matter.Nothing has improved or changed since the introduction of the penalty points system and until it is fully functioning Garda time will continue to be wasted and drivers will literally get away with murder as road deaths continue to rise. The number of deaths caused countrywide through traffic accidents is "shamefully high" according to the National Safety Council. In 2004, road deaths reached their highest level since 2001, indicating that we are back to the pre-penalty points level of fatalities.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, announced the creation of a traffic corps in late November 2004, two years after it was promised as a priority measure in the programme for Government. To date, this has entailed little more than a merging of all existing traffic units. Current staffing of the traffic corps is 530 gardaí. This figure will only rise by 33 in 2005.Like a seasonal itch, the Taoiseach has once again raised the possibility of random breath testing as a measure to reduce road deaths. The Minister of State will forgive me for not holding my breath on this Government promise.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	198	This plan was first proposed six years ago, yet six years later the Taoiseach is still singing the same old tune. Despite assurances from a succession of Ministers since then, nothing has happened. Doubts have now been expressed as to whether it will be possible to introduce random breath testing at all, despite the fact that figures from Australia and France prove that it significantly reduces fatalities. All I know for certain is that this lame-duck Government has failed to achieve its target of reducing road deaths by25%. A total of 323 people were killed on our roads in the first ten months of this year and those seriously injured or killed in this period is higher than for the same period in 2004. A further 40 people were killed on our roads in the past month. A mere 20% of the national road safety target is being reached.Speed limits are breached with impunity on our dual carriageways and motorways. The lack of police presence, which is compounded by the Government's failure to deliver the full complement of the Garda traffic corps, gives a strong message to drivers that they can break the law and get away with it. After nine years in office, this limping Government has failed to implement the six year old road safety strategy. This, as we know, was strongly criticised by the ex-chairman of the National Safety Council, whose resignation was the impetus for the tabling of this motion.I have raised the issue of road safety on many occasions in the House and called on the Minister for Transport to urgently debate plans to improve road safety. Dangerous roads, particularly in the midlands, such as the N55 between Athlone and Cavan, the N53 between Kinnegad and Tyrrellspass, and the appallingly bad stretch between Edgeworthstown and Armagh town, pose a serious threat to the safety of the public.In my parish a young man was killed last July on the worst stretch of county road in the midlands, the Rathowen to Legan road at Ballygarvey. A significant percentage of such deaths on country roads are due to their neglected condition. They were described as the "roads to hell" following a survey conducted earlier this year by the Automobile Association. The roads to which I referred were highlighted, in addition to a significant number of other dangerous roads throughout the country which are a major threat to our safety. The survey described the road between Edgeworthstown and Armagh, the N56, N54 and A3, as the worst continuous stretch of road, varying between medium to high risk and very high risk. There was a major underspend on roads last year of €640 million, with many of the roads in need of remedial action being in the BMW region.

I will give a small example. I was travelling down the country last Monday on a side road. Fortunately I was driving slowly. A young fellow came at me and only that I was quite into the ditch I would not be here speaking today. This issue is about speeding and crossing white lines. It is not always about drink driving. It is about behavioural and attitude change in everybody who gets into a car.The Government cannot do everything. Every crossroads and byroad in the country cannot be manned. Responsibility must be put on young people. If they go behind the wheel of a car they must know to obey the rules of the road. That is the bottom line and there is no way to overcome that point. I do not care what legislation or breath testing is introduced. If the simple rules of the road are not obeyed we will have accidents.

That is the bottom line. Let there be no doubt about it. Stating that we must have random breath testing and rolling out cameras deviates from that. Such measures are great and we want deterrents. However, it rests with parents and education. A cultural change must occur. Programmes must be introduced for 14 and 15 year olds.We are all shocked when we see the vivid illustration on television in the magnificent advertising campaign. It gives a clear message on the guilt and shame that will rest with people who cause deaths on the road. That campaign should be brought into the classrooms of 14, 15 and 16 year old pupils to make them realise that they take responsibility for obeying the rules of the road when they take the wheel of a car. No garda, task force or strategy will stop them if they do not know how to behave and take responsibility for their behaviour.

#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	224	The campaign for it started 41 or 44 years ago. Developments such as the bypass help frustrated motorists who have waited in long queues to get through Loughrea. The frustration of motorists often contributes to accidents. Senator Ormonde mentioned speed cameras. We must get them into operation.A great deal of hypocrisy surrounds driving and bad driving. Drivers openly admit they break and bend the law. In the next breath they state more gardaí are necessary to catch those who break the law. Such logic escapes me. Another example is of people who use mobile phones while driving. I saw figures from the UK which suggest that 77% of motorists use mobile phones while driving, but only 30% use hands-free kits.Longer journey times and traffic jams lead to fatigue and frustration. I hope we can deal with those issues. Single vehicle accidents that occur early in the morning are extremely disturbing. It attests to loss of judgment. Drink driving is still a major cause of accidents. The headlines in some newspapers suggest that drugs have worsened the situation.It seems anyone can teach anyone else to drive or to pass the test, which is more like what people want to do. Driving schools can operate without supervision. The Minister of State should also examine that issue to improve the situation. I agree with Mr. Tony Toner who stated in today's Irish Independent that “Education is the only way to teach these artful dodgers”. He is correct. I cannot understand why more emphasis is not put on learning the basis rules of the road in secondary schools. Transition year would be an ideal time for this. Mr. Toner refers to Rosemary Smith, who established a think awareness programme nine years ago through which tremendous work was done. Education and enforcing rules and regulations are simple and easy ways to deal with it. I hope the new road authority and Mr. Noel Brett will work hard to ensure they can make progress.I was sad to hear last year when the road safety strategy was announced that the intention was to reduce road deaths to not more than 300 per annum by the end of 2006. That figure is too high. One death from a road accident is too many. The strategy intends to reduce the number of deaths and we would like that achieved.I am glad we are having this debate. A number of issues can be dealt with by the Minister of State and I am glad his efforts and those of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, have succeeded in making this a top priority. We must ensure this is prioritised within the Government. I hope education policy, particularly in second level schools, will lead to a reduction in road deaths.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	225	I am glad to have an opportunity to say a few words on this important motion. As my colleague Senator Browne outlined at the start of the debate, this has regularly been the subject matter of Private Members' motions submitted by the Fine Gael Party during the past three or four years. The fact we had to raise the issue so frequently shows not only the extent of our concern but the extent of the problem. I agree with previous speakers. The problem and solution concern all parties in this House. It is not a party political matter. As a serious Opposition party we are obliged to highlight the crisis on the roads of Ireland and demand strong cohesive action from the Government.There are two schools of thought on this issue. Senator Ormonde placed responsibility on individual drivers while Senator Bannon suggested better roads and more policing. Like all issues of politics, the answer lies somewhere in between. There are major issues in this country with dangerous junctions, bad roads, bad drivers and enforcement. While we will not solve the problem this evening it is important we debate possible solutions.We were all pleased with the introduction of penalty points. Many Oireachtas Members, like any cross-section of the community, have penalty points and this does not please them. The concept was welcomed in the House and across the country and in the initial stages it seemed to work. We seemed to be solving the problem of deaths on the road. Perhaps it is an Irish trait to get used to these issues and then try to get around them. Every motorist was concerned about the imposition of penalty points when the policy was implemented. It was a hot topic of conversation but that has faded. Hundreds of thousands of drivers received penalty points but one would expect the introduction of the system would slow drivers in the long term and improve safety.These statistics paint a different picture. Up to October this year 354 people were killed on the roads, a higher figure than in the same period last year. The advantage gained from the penalty points has diminished and we must consider other means of enforcement. The penalty points system did not aim to increase insurance premiums or ban drivers from the road, rather it seeks to ensure every driver would be more careful, thereby improving road safety. This has not worked as well as we thought and it must be urgently reviewed.I have heard the Minister of State speak on the roll-out of further offences covered by penalty points, such as use of mobile phones. This will help but it is only part of the solution. I have raised the issue of driving instructors, driving lessons and the driving licence system. Perhaps this needs to be reviewed as our system of instruction is not working if we see such carnage on the road network. Driving and care of a vehicle could be studied in secondary school and this matter deserves attention. Most 18 year olds and some 17 year olds are driving. If one can instil a sense of the dangers of the road and teach driving skills, it would be a positive long-term investment.We should also examine simple issues that are easy to implement, such as those raised by Senator Kate Walsh this evening and on previous occasions. Drivers should have their headlights switched on regardless of the time or weather conditions because this seems to work well in Europe. It will not reduce the statistic of 354 to zero but if it reduces it to 324 that would be great news for 30 families. Sometimes we seek a glorious one-page solution when we need dozens of minor measures. I support Senator Kate Walsh's proposal and hope we can implement such a simple, straightforward measure.We must also examine the NCT test. Every motorist with a car over a certain number of years must have his or her car tested. We hoped that improving the quality of our vehicles and removing minor faults would improve road safety. This does not appear to have worked. The NCT tests are expensive and there is a suspicion it is a money-making scheme at this stage. I ask the Minister of State to examine this. I strongly favour the NCT test but wonder if vehicles coming through the system are as roadworthy as they should be. Many accidents are caused by faults in the vehicles and that should not happen if the NCT test is as good as we were led to believe.The quality of roads must be addressed and we will debate Transport 21 in the House tomorrow. While proposals for Atlantic corridors and major motorways are positive, we must ensure a substantial amount of the investment is used for road safety measures. We should examine accident blackspots throughout the country and tackle these issues. Through local authorities we are aware of areas where accidents occur once a fortnight. We should remove these problems through proper investment in road safety measures.Sometimes it is as simple as replacing a yield sign with a stop sign. I speak as someone who had an accident a number of years ago. I did not see the yield sign, drove through a crossroad and was almost removed from the political and the entire system. The gardaí who were called to the scene of the accident told me accidents occurred on a weekly basis. I was pleased to see the yield sign replaced with a stop sign some months later. If that had been done months before, several accidents could have been avoided.Such solutions will not result in newspaper headlines but they will work. When we invest billions of euro in our road network we should consider such minor measures. Local authorities should play a greater role in road safety because council officials, engineers and councillors know the areas in which accidents occur.I support the motion as it is important the Houses of the Oireachtas emphasise making roads safer and reducing road deaths. By bringing forward this motion the Fine Gael Party allows everyone in the House the opportunity to propose ideas. The Opposition and the Government Senators will listen to each other and if we are all here next year, the carnage on the roads in 2006 will be less than the figures for 2005.
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	226	I welcome the Minister of State and this debate, which I called for some weeks ago. Yesterday, the report of the annual national survey of motorists' behaviour and attitudes to road safety was published. The survey of 1,100 drivers nationwide was carried out by the Smurfit business school, UCD, in partnership with FBD Insurance and Advance Pitstop. It provides startling and eye-opening results. A total of eight out of ten drivers surveyed admitted to knowingly speeding, while 44% admitted to drinking and driving, frequently having consumed three or more drinks.The report also found that general driving behaviour has worsened considerably over the last 12 months. The authors asked respondents what would make them abide by the law. They found that the only measure that would stop drivers from continuing to break the law is more Garda enforcement on the roads. Drivers are comfortably flouting the law because they believe they will not be caught.The report's findings must be placed against the backdrop of 354 deaths and an estimated 2,800 serious injuries on our roads in the first ten months of this year. These figures are quite sickening and it is clear that current policy is not sufficient. We are failing in our roads policy. If gardaí are not visible, there is little deterrent for those who flout the law and put their own lives and those of others at risk.I note that since its launch last year, just over 500 gardaí have been deployed to the traffic corps. The Minister has promised that the corps will reach its full strength of 1,200 by 2008. However, 500 gardaí equates to less than 20 traffic corps officers per county, which is far from satisfactory, given the extent to which people are flouting the law. The traffic corps should be expanded as quickly as possible.Speed cameras should be rolled out nationwide but, more importantly, they should be fully functioning. The introduction of penalty points for speeding was very effective initially. Drivers were made very aware of the penalties for speeding and were conscious of a Garda campaign to crack down on same. However, we have seen a clear reduction in consideration of speed limits on the part of drivers. This has occurred because of the lack of a visible Garda presence, well-reported questions over the legality of certain speed cameras and the fact that some cameras are not functioning at all. As I said a number of weeks ago in this House, I drove from Dublin to Athlone one evening and did not meet anybody, travelling in either direction, who was obeying the traffic regulations and keeping within the speed limits. Everybody on the road that evening was flouting the law, even when entering country towns and villages on the route.Drink driving is something I find particularly abhorrent. Random breath testing should be the norm in this country. A potential drink driver should be fearful of being caught, rather than drinking and driving at will, as the survey results appear to indicate. Again, deterrents and a Garda presence are key, especially in proximity to public houses.We are also failing in our courts. A judgment was handed down recently in the case of a man who killed two others on the road. The court heard that the man was so drunk that he had unknowingly forced a car off the road. The drunk driver was fined €2,000 and banned from driving for ten years. He then walked free, with not even a suspended prison sentence. If we are failing to provide a deterrent on our roads in the form of visible gardaí, the sheer leniency of this sentence illustrates that we are also failing to provide a judicial deterrent in cases of drink driving, causing harm. We are failing on both fronts and the lives of those who have already perished on our roads will have been in vain if we, as legislators, do not ensure that the law of the land is respected and upheld.This is not a political but a moral issue. I want the Government to do more to tackle the carnage on our roads and to do so as soon as possible — not later, or over a phased basis. This is a crisis.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	227	This debate comes at a time when we face major challenges in the pursuit of our road safety policies. Road safety is an evolving area of public policy. Improvements in road network standards and vehicle engineering can, on the one hand, enhance road safety and, on the other hand, establish a false sense of security that blinds us to the need for constant care.The major challenge to the Government and society in general, in terms of road safety, arises from changes in expectations. When we had poorer roads and far fewer and technically inferior vehicles in the 1960s and 1970s, the annual number of road deaths often exceeded 600. Now in an environment featuring levels of motorisation that were unimaginable 40 years ago, the picture is somewhat different. My Department's aims for the immediate future are set at reducing road deaths to a level of no more than 300 per year. Society demands that the daily reality of deaths and injuries on our roads must be addressed and the carnage curtailed. In that context, I welcome most of the contributions to this debate, which reflect that demand.Similar demands for action to address road casualties were prevalent in the late 1990s. The response by the Government in 1997 was to adopt a strategic model based on achieving targeted reductions in deaths and injuries through the pursuit of targeted advancements across a range of policy areas. A significant feature of the first national strategy on road safety was the creation of the road safety high level group, which was tasked with overseeing the delivery of the programme that had been adopted in a co-ordinated way. The high level group was asked to monitor and report on progress achieved, recommend adjustments to the strategy and prepare proposals for future strategies for Government approval.An international expert on road safety was engaged to examine the strategic model that was put in place in 1997. He confirmed that the approach adopted and the oversight regime and reporting mechanisms that had been established provided a robust model for the pursuit of road safety policy. Reflecting on the past eight years during which those structures have been in place and a second national strategy has been developed, it is clear that there has been a significant degree of success. Casualty trends have been relatively consistent and significant advances are evident when one reflects on the fact that the average number of road deaths over the past four years was 374, compared with the average annual level for the previous four years of 440.However, the capacity for road casualties to fluctuate dramatically is evidenced by the fact that as of yesterday, the number of road deaths this year is 20 higher than on the same day last year. The task of realising the target set in the road safety strategy of reducing road deaths to a level of not more than 300 per annum by the end of next year can be placed in sharp focus by the trends revealed so far this year.It is appropriate that I should report to the House on the progress achieved to date with our strategy. There are a number of key policy initiatives set out in the strategy, on which the achievement of further reductions in road deaths rely. These initiatives relate primarily to the adoption of a new structure for speed limits based on metric values, the establishment of a dedicated traffic corps, the extension of the penalty points system, the introduction of a network of privately operated speed cameras and the extension of the basis on which a breath test can be requested by the Garda Síochána.The Government introduced a revised speed limit structure expressed in metric values in January 2005. The legislative basis for this system was provided for in the Road Traffic Act 2004. The changeover process involved a major public information campaign as well as the posting of some 58,000 road signs signalling the new speed limits. The changeover went very smoothly and represents a good example of national and local authorities working together with a common aim. From the road safety perspective, the revised system provides for a reduction of 16 km in the speed limit on regional, rural and local roads.The new legislation confirmed the central role of the elected members of county and city councils in making determinations for changes to the speed limits that are applied under the legislation and gave them the capacity to deploy a greater range of speed limit values, including the 30 km/h limit. The system is further improved by a facility for public engagement in the process of local authorities making speed limit changes.One of the most important elements of any road safety policy is enforcement. The efforts of my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Commissioner to radically step up enforcement are vital to success in the road safety arena. The Commissioner has placed the new Garda traffic corps under the supervision of one of his most senior officers of Commissioner rank, as a signal of the intent of the force to bear down on enforcement. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is adamant that the very significant increases in the strength of the traffic corps planned for the next few years will proceed and that the corps will not lack for any technical resources. The Minister and the Commissioner will have my full support and any policy or legislative assistance I can give them in their efforts.The traffic corps currently stands at 560, and will comprise some 800 officers by the end of next year. In the latter half of 2007, there will be 1,000 gardaí deployed to the traffic corps. The increased enforcement should have a significant deterrent effect on drivers' behaviour. This is crucial to an improved road safety performance and is an initiative which I very much welcome.In my recent contributions before the Oireachtas Joint Committees on Transport and Enterprise and Small Business, I expressed my disappointment that we were not in a position to see an application of the penalty points scheme to other key road safety offences in addition to speeding, seat-belt wearing, driving without insurance and careless driving.The legislation underpinning the system has been in place since 2002. The speed of the roll-out has not been satisfactory and this has blunted the potential of the system to deter drivers from the very behaviour that gives rise to collisions. It is my understanding that the IT systems and other administrative support mechanisms will be in place by the beginning of April 2006 and that the major extension planned for the operation of the system can be put in place at that point. My colleague the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, is in regular contact with the Garda Commissioner on the issue of meeting that target date.The road safety strategy identifies the introduction of a significant network of speed cameras as a central component in addressing speed limit breaches. The Minister for Transport proposes to bring forward, early in the new year, an amendment to primary legislation to enable the engagement of the private sector in the widespread deployment, under strict Garda supervision, of speed cameras. A working group, established to examine the general framework within which this proposal can be pursued, acknowledged that it would be necessary to engage private sector interests if we were to reach the critical mass required to establish the level of enforcement of speeding that will support the achievement ofthe enforcement targets in the road safety strategy.I take this opportunity to reassure the House that the operation of the system will be grounded firmly in road safety considerations. The Garda will be responsible for choosing locations where cameras will be placed, and such decisions will be based on collision history and prevalence of speeding. The working group has also recommended that there can be no relationship between the receipt of fixed charge payments resulting from detections by privately-operated cameras and the funding of the private sector operator.There has been much debate recently on the possible introduction of random breath testing. The road safety strategy provides that random breath testing should be in place before the end of 2006. I and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, have pursued a detailed examination of the possible approaches that could be adopted here to give the Garda greater powers to impose roadside breath tests. This examination has been informed and supported by the receipt of independent legal opinion and the opinion of the Attorney General. In examining this issue it is important that a balance be struck such that measures aimed at reducing road fatalities which are clearly for the common good are proportional in that they have proper regard to the legal rights of the individual. However, the protection of the community from individuals who abuse those rights must inform our examination of this issue.The Minister for Transport recently met with the chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and party spokespersons for a discussion focused solely on the issue of random breath testing, at which he outlined the legal concerns as he understands them. He is endeavouring to work with colleagues in the committee to try to find a solution to this issue, which crosses party boundaries.If, however, we cannot legislate for wider roadside breath tests, I point out that as things stand, gardaí can require a driver to provide a preliminary breath sample where they form an opinion that an intoxicant has been consumed, or where a collision has taken place, or where a road traffic offence has been committed. I am sure that the Garda Síochána will continue to pursue drink driving enforcement robustly through the range of powers available to it. I recently discussed the issue with the superintendent of the greater Dublin area, who brought to my attention that road deaths and serious accidents in the area are down and detection of drink driving is on the increase. It shows that gardaí are out there and applying the relevant Road Traffic Acts with success.The process of establishing the road safety authority is well advanced. The Driver Testing and Standards Authority Bill 2004 which has completed Second Stage in the Dáil is the legislative basis for establishing the authority. When the Bill was introduced its principal purpose was to establish a driver testing and standards authority whose primary responsibility would be the delivery of the driver testing service and the regulation of driving instructors. The authority would also have a statutory duty to promote the development and improvement of driving standards. However, the functions to be assigned to the authority were reviewed and I indicated during the Second Stage debate and at committees that the establishment of a separate public sector body to deliver the driver testing service and take responsibility for other functions relating to the testing and control of drivers, offered an opportunity for other functions relating to roadsafety in general to be assigned to the new authority.Consequently the Government decided to amend the Driver Testing and Standards Authority Bill 2004 to enable other functions to be assigned to the authority, which will ensure it can play an important role in the process of improving road safety in general. As a consequence of these amendments it is proposed to change the title of the driver testing and standards authority to the road safety authority, and the Bill to the road safety authority Bill.The road safety authority will be a single agency with responsibility for a wide range of functions which have a bearing on road safety and will be in a unique position to co-ordinate and advance the road safety agenda through delivery of road safety programmes such as testing of drivers and vehicles, driver education and the promotion of awareness of road safety in general. I see the authority having a significant advisory role to the Minister for Transport in the development of road safety policy.In order to facilitate the road safety authority in carrying out its role, the additional functions that will transfer to the new authority include the functions of the National Safety Council in relation to road safety. As the Bill already provides that the authority will have a general duty to "promote the development and improvement of driving standards" it is appropriate that the educational brief of the NSC, together with its brief for the promotion of road safety, be transferred to the authority, which I believe the House supports.In the road haulage sector the authority will take responsibility for the functions currently exercised by my Department on driver hours and rest periods, including the tachograph, the working time directive for mobile workers in the road transport sector and the implementation of EU requirements on bus and lorry driver vocational training. In addition, the authority would also be enabled to enforce the relevant regulations in these areas as well as the conditions applying to licensed road haulage operators. Responsibility for implementing new requirements under EU directives on professional driver training in this area will also be assigned to the new authority.While the Bill already provides for vehicle testing to be transferred to the authority, it is proposed to also transfer other functions relating to the standards that apply to vehicles sold or used in Ireland, as required by EU directives, and all related matters. Work in this area includes EU vehicle type approval law, standards for in-service vehicles, commercial vehicle testing and oversight of the NCT.The activities of the authority as originally envisaged all have a bearing on road safety and the addition of these functions will enhance the effectiveness of the authority in contributing to an improvement in road safety. While the authority will have a significant input into road safety through driver training and testing and vehicle testing, it will also be given responsibility for road safety research. This will enable the authority to both analyse the causes of road accidents, evaluate what action might be taken and make appropriate recommendations.I wish to refer to the issue of compulsory basic training for motorcyclists. The establishment of the road safety authority will also facilitate the introduction of compulsory initial practical training for motorcyclists. A working group, chaired by my Department and comprising motorcycle interests and an insurance representative, has been considering the appropriate standards that will apply in this area.The House will be aware that Mr. Eddie Shaw tendered his resignation as chairman of the National Safety Council. The term of office of the board of the National Safety Council elapsed last April and the Minister, Deputy Cullen, specifically asked Mr. Shaw and members of the board to continue to pursue their remit until the end of the year so that they could support the proposed transfer of the council's function in regard to the promotion of road safety to the Road Safety Authority. To further enhance that process, the board of the council recently appointed the chief executive officer designate of the Road Safety Authority to act as the CEO of the council.As the model within which we currently work needs to be re-examined, I accept the point raised by Senators. The establishment of the road safety authority presents an opportunity to pursue such a review. The authority will be tasked with the delivery of a programme across a wide range of areas and will also play a central role in ensuring that road safety policy is pursued in a co-ordinated and structured manner.This year has seen a number of tragic collisions and, as the Fine Gael Party motion points out, October saw almost twice as many road deaths as last October. Reference to monthly totals for road deaths can create misleading impressions and the degree of variation over the months of this year reveal a significant degree of volatility. However, the trends re-emerging over the past two years are certainly a source of concern. We are now at the end of the second year of the current strategy and there is much to be done to complete the roll-out of the programme set down in the strategy and to realise the main target of reducing the level of deaths to not more than 300.I assure the House that as Minister of State with responsibility for certain areas of road safety, I and my colleague, the Minister, who have immediate responsibility for road safety policy at national level, together with my other colleagues in Government, who have either a direct role in delivering programmes relating to road safety or in supporting the overall policy, are fully committed to achieving their goals. I commend the amendment to the House.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	228	I thank the Minister of State for what he said by which I am encouraged. We are all aware that alcohol is a significant factor in speeding. I recall that when the Road Traffic Bill was being discussed here alcohol was the predominant factor.The whole road signage system throughout the country has been discredited. Local authorities erect signs and never take them down. It gets to the point when one does not know whether one is arriving at roadworks or at an oil spill. I travelled to Galway recently and there were oil spill signs all over the place but there were no oil spills. The danger of this is obvious. One is likely to go off the road when there is one because one has ignored all the other signs for oil spills.There is a constitutional aspect to the issue of the breath test which I hope can be resolved. I hope this can be done without having to resort to a referendum. However, if this is what must be done, then it must be done. On the hands-free phones, if one can afford a car, one can afford a hands-free kit. We have been discussing this matter for ages and it should be done. I have driven in a number of countries and I do not believe that people in other countries are any more or less responsible than they are here, but the chances of getting caught are high. I drove on a short journey in Italy not so long ago and the speed camera went twice. I was not even aware that I was driving over the speed limit. The fine came back to Ireland through the hired car company, which should be the case. Wherever one travels, one should be subject to the law. Senator Brian Hayes referred previously to a similar situation.Until the enforcement is implemented, all the abuses will continue. I accept what was said about personal responsibility. There must be personal responsibility and education, but unless the regulations are enforced, people will continue to flout the law.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	229	I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the motion. I thank my party colleague, Senator Browne, for tabling it. It is a significant national issue but I find it difficult to get away from the parochial aspect of the negative experiences we have had in County Donegal in the past few months, specifically in Inishowen where five young people lost their lives tragically in a car accident. When trying to highlight the issue, we talk in terms of the statistics which are escalating. I want to put on record the human impact of such a tragedy whereby five young people's lives have been lost tragically, for which nothing can compensate. One cannot describe what the immediate families went through as a result of this tragedy. Nothing can compensate for the impact it had on the Garda and emergency services personnel who arrived at the scene and had to deal with the accident and the consequences and impact on the Inishowen community at large.As Inishowen is a very close-knit community, the people are still reeling from the effects of this tragedy. Following the car crash, my colleague, Councillor Bernard McGuinness and I had a meeting with Chief Superintendent Terry McGinn. It was an important meeting because the superintendent highlighted the human impact of such a tragedy. She told us of the impact it had on the bereaved family members, with whom she was directly involved, on herself and on her Garda colleagues. She said that if there was a debate on the issue in the Seanad, she would like to have some form of communication with Members. Therefore, I welcome the fact that she sent a representative, Garda Brendan Roche, to represent her during the debate. This is how serious Garda personnel take the debate on road safety. While it might be easy to criticise the Garda in regard to the numbers of road deaths, it is important to put on record that it is very interested in moving forward on the issue.The superintendent said that she would welcome more involvement on the part of local authorities. She would welcome a partnership approach in this regard, which was referred to earlier in the House. I believe we are all singing from the same hymn sheet in this regard. The local authorities, as a statutory mechanism, can play a pivotal role in terms of combatting dangerous and reckless driving either in urban or rural areas.Approximately 40,000 people live in Inishowen. The number of Garda personnel in the area is based on the population who live in the area. The fact that Derry city is the fourth largest city in Ireland and that there is a constant movement of people across the Border into towns in Inishowen, including Burnfoot, Buncrana and north Inishowen, is not taken into consideration. Resources are not put in place to deal with this issue. There is a fundamental problem in the area because there is double the amount of traffic as a result of people crossing the Border from another jurisdiction.When debating road safety, we must consider extra Garda personnel. We require ten times the number of Garda personnel in Inishowen to deal with the current problems. There is one 24-hour manned Garda station in Burnfoot. That is a 30 minute response time to north Inishowen, which is not good enough. We need resources for a second 24-hour Garda station in north Inishowen to cater for the ever-increasing amount of traffic coming from Derry city.I will not go into the repercussions for drivers who speed and live in the North. There are no ramifications for these people if they are arrested for speeding. This problem needs to be addressed in the short term.The majority of young people are very responsible drivers and they want to do something about this. Next Wednesday, the Minister of State will have the privilege of meeting young people from Cork to Donegal at a protest entitled Cruise the Dáil. They are protesting about specifications relating to car exhausts and tinted windows. While these are issues, road safety, dangerous driving and road fatalities will not be resolved by addressing them. Young people are travelling to the Phoenix Park next Wednesday and it is expected that between 1,000 and 1,500 cars will be present. Twenty representatives of the group will attend Leinster House to meet the Minister of State. They will put forward the case regarding the two issues I mentioned. However, the opportunity should not be missed to heed their message that all young people do not drive recklessly and they do not want to see their peers dying on the roads. They want to do something about it and the Minister of State will experience their conviction in this regard first hand.I hope we can move forward. We can do so because many young people want to get involved. It is positive that they are staying at home in County Donegal and in County Clare, where Senator Dooley is from, rather than emigrating, as they would have done not so long ago. They are staying at home, working in their local communities and buying cars. They pay outrageous amounts for car insurance but they are at home.

#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	231	I agree. I would like the Minister of State to fast track the implementation of policies and dedicate resources in this regard. I refer to a specific issues in rural areas. A small percentage of young drivers act irresponsibly doing donuts and driving carelessly but they use mobile telephones. They know when gardaí are on duty and they know which crossroads they use to set up checkpoints. If a garda has set up a checkpoint about which one of them was not aware, he will text his friends to warn them. This issue needs to be addressed but it again relates to Garda resources. Every back road in the State cannot be monitored on a 24-hour basis and a garda cannot be deployed behind every bush. However, if a presence is created, it will have a massive impact on the minority of young people involved in these dangerous activities.I ask the Minister of State to heed the young people he will meet next Wednesday because that will empower them. They are responsible drivers and they are endeavouring to do something about the tragic loss of life throughout the State. The Minister of State should take them seriously.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	238	I welcome the Minister of State, whose roots are in County Westmeath, to take this important matter. I have brought it before the House to highlight the appalling lack of sewerage facilities in Rathowen, County Westmeath, and to ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to clarify the position on the commencement of the scheme. Provision of the scheme is urgently required in the interests of the environment, health, residential and commercial interests and tourism in the area. Rathowen is within three miles of my home but is in County Westmeath. It is unbelievable that the more than 300 people who live in the village on the N4 are forced to use often unreliable septic tanks in what should be a showcase area. This is the only village between Longford and Dublin without a modern sewerage system in place. It is detrimental to the health of the residents and has far-reaching environmental implications for the area. The lack of a viable system is delaying developments, both housing and commercial, curtailing the building of private local authority schemes and impacting badly on tourism. As the Minister of State knows, there are interesting lakes in the vicinity, including Lough Owel, Lough Ennell and Lough Derravaragh. The village is also close to the River Inny.The village of Rathowen is not getting the investment it requires because of delays in providing this urgently needed scheme. The people of Rathowen are becoming very impatient with the excessive bureaucracy and red tape. Planning for a new infrastructure is almost at a standstill and would move ahead rapidly if the sewerage scheme was provided. The lack of progress on the scheme has meant a fall off in pupils entering the primary school as the same housing development is not taking place there as in other parishes. It also has major implications for the future of the village, and the increasing population of its hinterland. More and more once-off houses are being developed because of the lack of proper sewerage facilities in the village. There have been excessive delays at every stage of this much needed scheme and I ask the Minister of State to assure me that it will be put in place without further delay.The scheme has gone through preliminary report stage and on the request of the Department a report based on the polluter pays principle was submitted. The preliminary report is awaiting approval before the tender procedure will follow, with contracts then being awarded. However, we hear that work will not commence until 2008. I received this detail in a letter from Westmeath County Council last week. This timeframe is totally unrealistic. Will the Minister of State indicate when it is anticipated that construction work will realistically commence?A Government Deputy from north Westmeath told the people of Rathowen two years ago that funding had been ring-fenced for this scheme, which would be fully constructed by 2005. So much for his promise. I would like the Minister of State to assure me that funding has definitely been ring-fenced for the Rathowen project. Senator O'Rourke has been contacted in this regard also.We are not happy with the long delay nor are we happy with the letter I received from Westmeath County Council, dated 9 November, stating that considering the process and the various approvals required at various stages of the project, it anticipated that a contractor would commence work during 2008. That will be after the next general election. We do not understand why there is such a delay when we were promised that funding would be delivered and the sewerage scheme completed during this Government.I thank the Minister of State. I hope he has taken notice of what I have said, that he conveys it to the Minister and that he will write the cheque next week to ensure this important infrastructure for Rathowen is constructed immediately.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	239	I listened to Senator Bannon with great interest. I do not represent Deputy Cassidy or Senator O'Rourke on this matter but the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche. I assure the Senator that if this was a matter of signing a cheque next week, he would have the cheque.The provision of modern water and sewerage infrastructure to support environmental, social and economic objectives continues to be a major focus of Government spending. There has been unprecedented investment by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government under the national development plan in water and sewerage schemes and this has made a key contribution to our economic growth.The Department's water services investment programme for the period 2004-06 is made up of 869 schemes at different stages of development, with a total investment value of more than €5 billion. The programme includes over 20 projects in County Westmeath with a value of some €216 million. Any reasonable person would accept that is a very reasonable sum for that period for County Westmeath. Towns and villages such as Athlone, Mullingar, Moate, Rochfortbridge and Rathowen can all look forward to new or upgraded sewerage schemes. Many areas will also benefit from improved water supplies, for example, Athlone, Mullingar, south Westmeath and other locations around the county.Many of Westmeath's towns and villages will benefit from the drive to bring our water and sewerage infrastructure up to a modern standard. Rathowen is very much part of that effort and the necessary funding for the scheme has been set aside in the Department's water services investment programme. Westmeath County Council originally intended to progress the sewerage schemes envisaged for Rathowen, Coole and Finea as one project. However, the council later indicated that it wished to pursue these schemes separately. That is what is now happening.In the case of the Rathowen scheme, the Senator will be pleased to know that the Minister, Deputy Roche, approved Westmeath County Council's preliminary report last week, subject to some additional information being provided with regard to the proportion of the capital cost to be charged to the non-domestic sector in accordance with the polluter pays principle. The approval of the preliminary report clears the way for the council to draw up contract documents. How long these take will be a matter for discussion and agreement between the council and the engineering consultants it has appointed to design the scheme.Once the contract documents have been completed and approved, the council will be able to invite tenders and commence the works. The scheme's estimated cost is €1.3 million. This will put in place modern sewerage collection and treatment facilities to meet current demand and to facilitate future development requirements in the village and surrounding area.The Minister is conscious of the importance of this scheme to the Rathowen community and will encourage Westmeath County Council to progress the contract documents as quickly as possible. He has assured me that as far as his Department's involvement in the remaining stages of the project are concerned, the Senator can be assured that there will be absolutely no avoidable delays or obstacles in dealing with the scheme.It is important to reiterate that the necessary funding for the scheme has been set aside in the water services investment programme and is available for draw down by the council as soon as the work begins on the ground. The Minister will do everything he can to bring that about as quickly as possible. The priority is for the council to move ahead rapidly with the preparation of the contract documents which will bring the project a critical step closer to commencement of construction.The Senator should be aware that a preliminary report for the scheme was received from Westmeath County Council in February 2005. However, the water pricing report, which is required at the preliminary report stage under departmental procedures, was not received until August of this year. These reports were examined by the Department and, as I indicated, the preliminary report was acceptable. However, further information is required on the water pricing report.The preliminary report was submitted to the Minister for approval on 21 November and was cleared by him on 25 November. Four days is not bad going. It is subject to the additional information being provided on the water pricing report. Approval of that preliminary report enables the council to speed ahead on the contract document.I thank the Senator for his interest in County Westmeath. I hope it is an interest he will sustain in the months and years ahead. I note there is a great deal of interest being shown in counties Westmeath and Longford these days by a significant number of Deputies and Senators.

Westmeath County Council said in a letter that it will be in 2008. Is there anything that can be done to progress this in the Department? When I raised this matter other Senators took note and brought relevant reports to the Minister. He has acted on that because he was aware the matter was being raised. Hopefully the project can be brought forward, perhaps to the end of 2006. I will keep up the pressure and I have no doubt the Minister will make the necessary representations to ensure it is commenced in 2006 rather than 2008.

There is no funding obstacle in the Department with regard to this matter. It is a matter for the council to furnish the information on the water pricing report. That is essential. Approval of the preliminary report allowed the council to prepare contract documents for the scheme. They can then be submitted to the Department for approval. Once the Department approves the contract documents, the council can then invite tenders. The ball is in the council's court. The Minister is more than willing tohelp.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-11-30 00:00:00	Prelude	242	I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for allowing me to raise the important matter of the specific allocation of funding for Nenagh General Hospital. I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to reply to this matter. He will be aware that there is a considerable degree of local interest, in particular, in the future of Nenagh General Hospital. At least a year ago, the then Mid-Western Health Board approved funding for works at the accident and emergency unit, the laboratories and other works at Nenagh General Hospital. An amount of €2.2 million was specifically allocated for the accident and emergency unit. It was widely anticipated that this work would take place.When the HSE was set up on 1 January all such applications were submitted to the National Hospitals Office. I and other public representatives were informed that that office would have to approve such allocation of funding. The application for such works was passed to the Minister's desk, it was on the list of capital projects and we waited for the allocation of such funding. The capital projects were announced and the Taoiseach, who was in the constituency since the summer, announced that this spending would go ahead.I telephoned the HSE on Monday, which I do regularly as part of my work, to ascertain the position regarding the allocation of the €2.2 million only to be told that it was still waiting to be told it could spend this money. That is a matter of some concern. Why is it being told to wait in terms of the spending of this money? Against the backdrop of everything Professor Drumm, the chief executive of the HSE, told us of his plans for acute hospitals, there is a degree of concern that the failure to spend this money on Nenagh General Hospital points to a policy change in terms of its future. It is against the background of that concern that I raise this matter.I believed the Taoiseach when he said the allocation would be made. When one is told by senior members of staff in the HSE locally that they still have not been given the go-ahead to spend this money, which was allocated well over a year ago, one must ask questions. Hence, I ask why the money has not been approved for spending. Is there a change in policy? If so, will the Minister of State indicate this and state what it is?

I listened carefully to her comments and I reassure her that the Taoiseach is a man of his word. In regard to the matter raised, I shall explain the reasons and the circumstances in the course of my reply.I take this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. I want to emphasise the commitment of the Government and the Tánaiste to the continued development of services at Nenagh General Hospital and the continued provision of high-quality, safe acute hospital services in north Tipperary.In recent years, funding of €2 million was provided to facilitate extension of existing buildings and significant refurbishment of the existing facilities. Some €750,000 was spent on the refurbishment and upgrading of mechanical and electrical services at the hospital. Additional ultrasound equipment was purchased for the hospital at a cost of €200,000. Planning permission has been obtained for an acute psychiatric unit with 24 beds. Space has been protected on the Nenagh campus for the proposed future provision of a geriatric assessment-rehabilitation unit. Approval has also been given for the development of a health centre-community care headquarters.The next capital development at Nenagh General Hospital comprises an extension to the laboratory, radiology and accident and emergency departments and the provision of a CT scanner. The estimated capital cost is in excess of €2 million. The HSE mid-west area has progressed the project through planning stages, tenders for the work have been sought, and the HSE has informed the Department that approval has been given to the HSE mid-west area to proceed with the accident and emergency and laboratory aspects of the project.The accident and emergency department aspect was referred to by Senator. However, the HSE has informed the Department that the radiology-CT aspects of the project require additional planning, staffing and revenue funding, the source of which needs to be identified prior to approval. That is the current position.The Tánaiste is satisfied that what has been outlined to the House represents tangible evidence of the commitment of the Government to the continued provision of high-quality, cost-effective, timely and responsive hospital services in Nenagh for all. The Government is committed to supporting and developing critical services, including key areas such as maternity and accident and emergency services. The decision of the HSE to proceed with the accident and emergency department and laboratory aspects of the project immediately is evidence of this fact. Let us move away from scare tactics and unfounded claims of downgrading and loss of services. Let us have a debate about how best to work together to develop a quality health service for the future and as part of that to ensure a high-quality, sustainable hospital service in Nenagh.

He said that the HSE has informed the Department that the radiology-CT aspects require additional planning, etc. I take it that is the HSE at national level because it certainly is not the HSE at local level. That suggests there is a delay in this regard on the part of the HSE at national level. Therefore, there is a blockage to this funding being made available. I have a communication from the HSE mid-west area which is not in line with what the Minister of Statesaid.

I can assist the Senator in indicating that it appears from the reply that the radiology-CT aspects of the project were part of the original project. The National Hospitals Office of the HSE is assessing the projected current cost of developments as part of its forward investment programme on the capital side. It appears from the reply that the HSE has decided to proceed immediately with the accident and emergency and laboratory aspects and has informed the HSE mid-west area of that. It has also informed the Department that it requires further time to plan for the provision of that the radiology-CT aspects of the project.
