#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Yesterday, the Taoiseach admitted that his statement in the House that the taxpayer would not be liable for the consequences of the introduction of the bank guarantee was not true, and that the vast majority of the €22 billion pumped into Anglo Irish Bank will never be seen again.  The taxpayer is therefore liable.  The lives of the next generation have been mortgaged.  Today, I notice in the national newspapers selected briefings by the Department of Finance that the Government now intends to introduce a punitive property tax ranging from €250 to €3,000.  This is grossly unfair.  I ask the Taoiseach to confirm — "Yes" or "No" — whether the Government is planning to introduce a property tax in the budget at the end of this year.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	1	That is a budgetary matter that will be decided at the time of the budget.  The Deputy will know that a site value tax is mentioned in the programme for Government, and the Commission on Taxation has suggested a need to widen the tax base.  However, no decisions have been taken on these matters.  I cannot comment on speculation.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	2	The reports in today's papers were not straws in the wind.  They were deliberate briefings to the media as the Government flies another kite.There are 300,000 families in negative equity at the moment and more than 430,000 people on the unemployment register.  Families cannot have any confidence unless there is clarity about the future of their incomes.  People who are not yet in negative equity are struggling to meet their mortgage payments.  Many people will not be in a position to make pension provisions for themselves.  Yet there is no clarity from the Government on whether it is its intention to introduce a property tax in the budget at the end of this year.The introduction of such a tax would be grossly unfair.  Mr. McCarthy made a series of recommendations to the Government, fewer than one in ten of which have been implemented.  There is plenty of scope there to reduce borrowing without the introduction of a property tax in this year's budget.  It is the same old story.  The Government will present straw men when it feels like it, saying there is no alternative to a property tax.  There is an alternative.  What the Government is now proposing is grossly unfair.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	4	On the basis of the circumstances in which we find ourselves, the introduction of a property tax in this year's budget would be unfair, and I will oppose it.  I ask the Taoiseach again for confirmation that the intention of the Department of Finance is to prepare a plan for the introduction of a property tax in this year's budget.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I explained to the Deputy already that any introduction of a property tax would represent a major structural change in the taxation system and would clearly have to take into account the total tax impact on individuals.  No decision has been taken on this matter.  The Government will consider its budgetary strategy in the normal way and the Minister for Finance will consider the position.  I refer the Deputy to the programme for Government and the report of the Commission on Taxation.  We want to make sure we have a clear view of the impact of any such proposal.  It would represent a major structural change and will need to be considered in that context.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	8	To date, €33 billion has been handed over or committed to the banks.  Last week, the chief executive of Anglo Irish Bank said that the lion's share of the €22 billion that bank had received would never be seen again.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach eventually confirmed that this was in fact the case.  The money is gone.It was a condition of the recapitalisation that banks would agree to extend credit to businesses so that jobs could be sustained and people could go back to work.  This week, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, published a report of a survey in which it interviewed 834 small and medium-sized businesses.  Of these, 55% said they had been refused credit in the past three months.  ISME has accused the banks of putting thousands of businesses and their employees at risk.  It reports that banks are illegally requesting family homes as collateral for the extension of credit.  It describes the actions of the bankers as giving a "two fingered policy response" to the Government and it calls for an investigation by the Central Bank into SME lending by the banks.Can the Taoiseach tell the House what is being done to require the banks to extend credit to businesses?  They have the money.  As we now know, we will never again see the bulk it.  It was a condition for the very large amounts of taxpayers' money that has been committed to sorting out the banks that they would lend to business.  A report has stated that 55% of companies that applied for credit were turned down.  What is the Taoiseach going to do to require the banks to deliver on the condition that was attached to the recapitalisation money, that they should lend to business in a normal way?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	9	The aim of Government policy on banking has been to return the banks to a position where they can access funds and lend these funds to viable businesses and households in order to support enterprise growth and economic recovery.  This is the whole purpose of the recapitalisation, particularly in the case of the two main banks which continue to service the country and their clients.  The Government position is that both the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation and the Minister for Finance are in touch with the banks to ensure we get sectoral plans that meet our requirements and as yet we have not received those or we are not satisfied with what we have received thus far.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	10	With the greatest of respect, the Taoiseach is totally out of touch with what is happening in the country and with the reality of what happens when a business goes into a bank to look for credit.  The reality of what is happening — I hear this all the time — is that businesses going into banks do not even get to make the application.  They are told not to bother; they are told to go away——
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	11	Correct.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	12	As soon as they see the bank manager or the bank official they are sent packing with a flea in their ear.  It is one of the reasons ISME has suggested what it calls a re-education programme on business lending for the banks.  The businesses are not even getting past the front door.  Even of those who do get past the front door 55% of them are having their applications rejected.  Time and again, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, when he replied to questions in the House recently, told us the Government is having conversations with the banks, that it is appealing to the banks and trying to encourage them to lend to business, all of which I believe and I am sure this is what is happening.  However, we must get this straight, the banks have got the money and they are not going to give it back.  Having got the money——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	13	A question, please, Deputy.

That is why they were given the money.  If they are not lending — and it is the case they are not lending — that is what is still causing the problems of job losses and people not getting back to work.While I am on the subject, the Taoiseach might have a word with the chairman of the now nationalised Anglo Irish Bank, Mr. Dukes, who came before an Oireachtas committee last week and gave as arrogant a performance as any bank czar has ever given at the height of their boom.  He would not even answer questions from Deputy Burton——

It was not a case that the money was handed out, as the Deputy knows and if he does not know, he should know.  The purpose of it was——
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	23	It was not given to businesses.

The Government has asked for plans from both Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks.  They have to provide €3 billion each for new or increased credit facilities for SMEs this year——

We are in the process of making sure that the sectoral plans and the geographic plans they bring will be adequate to meet that requirement. That has not yet been met, so far as Government is concerned and we will continue to engage very directly with those banks to ensure that this is the case.  The Deputy should stop putting out the trite comment that people got money so that they could give it out.  The money was put into the banks for the purpose of having sufficient capital so that they can access funds in international markets to have a business.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I propose to answer Questions Nos.1 to 13, inclusive, together.The report of the Bloody Sunday inquiry was published on Tuesday, 15 June.  I met with families and representatives of the victims of Bloody Sunday on Wednesday, 16 June and congratulated them on the success of their long and difficult campaign.  As Deputies will be aware, we will have an opportunity in the House next week to have a detailed discussion of the report.I met with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Owen Paterson, on 2 June and congratulated him on his appointment.  The Secretary of State stressed the commitment of the new British Government to the Good Friday Agreement and all that has followed and to continued close co-operation between both Governments.On the morning of 3 June, I received a courtesy call from the former First Minister of the Northern Ireland Executive, Dr. Ian Paisley and his wife, Baroness Paisley.  Later that day, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I met with an SDLP delegation led by the party leader, Margaret Ritchie and which also included Northern Ireland Minister for Social Development, Alex Attwood MLA, and the MPs for South Belfast and Foyle, Alasdair McDonnell MP and Mark Durkan MP.I also met with a Sinn Féin delegation led by the party leader Gerry Adams and the Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness MLA.  It also included the Northern Ireland Minister for Agriculture, Michelle Gildernew MLA.At both meetings I congratulated the MPs on their recent electoral success.  We reflected on the outcome of the recent election, with a particular emphasis on the positive results that saw all constituencies returning pro-Agreement representatives.  I also briefed the party delegations on the Government's initial contact with the new British Government and looked forward to my first formal meeting with the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, which will take place later today.We identified a number of new challenges and opportunities following the Westminster election and the successful completion of the devolution of policing and justice.  These include working together to deal with the economic crisis, with a more ambitious approach to co-operation in delivering improved public services on an all-island basis against a background of fiscal restraint, North and South.  We also discussed the increased interdependencies between both parts of the island in the economic sphere and the need to proactively develop the island economy.  I also emphasised the need to continue to develop relationships with unionism, including in the context of the forthcoming commemorations, following on from my recent speech on the subject of a shared history.  We also discussed the shared concerns of the Government and the Northern Ireland parties on the situation in Gaza.  The publication of the Saville report into the events of Bloody Sunday was also discussed.During 2008, the Government consulted with the social partners and various cross-Border and North-South groups on the establishment of the North-South consultative forum.  Following on from this, we formally communicated our proposals to the Northern Ireland Executive on the role, format, membership and operation of the forum.On 15 October 2009, the Government facilitated a consultative conference in Farmleigh involving the social partners and other civil society groups from across the island.  I gave the opening address at that event.  Participants from across the island came from all traditions, including representatives from business, the trade union movement, agriculture and the community and voluntary sector.  There was a wide-ranging discussion on the role of civil society and its capacity to contribute meaningfully to cross-Border co-operation.  There was strong support for further such engagement to explore specific areas for co-operation, North and South, at the level of civil society.Following on from the October event, a second consultative conference took place in Dublin on 26 May.  The event was well attended, with over one hundred representatives from civil society from both parts of the island in attendance.  The Deputy First Minister of the Northern Ireland Executive, Martin McGuinness MLA, addressed the conference.  There were presentations and discussions on the key themes of the conference: sport and young people, and innovation.I addressed a conference organised by the Institute for British-Irish Studies in University College Dublin on 20 May last on the theme, A Decade of Centenaries: Commemorating Our Shared History.  I am arranging for Members of the Oireachtas to receive a copy of my speech.  The conference was also addressed by the Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure in the Northern Ireland Executive, Nelson McCausland MLA.In the course of my address, I set out the principles which will guide the Government's approach.  We want to see full acknowledgment of the totality of the island's history and the legitimacy of all the traditions on the island which draw their identity and collective memory from our shared history.  We want the process of commemoration to recognise the totality of the history of the period and all the diversity that this encompasses.    We believe that mutual respect should be central to all commemorative events and that historical accuracy should be paramount.  Based on those principles, we will engage in a programme of outreach to all those who are interested in commemorating our history, in all its dimensions, with pride and respect.  That will, of course, include all of the political parties on the island, as well as leaders of civic society and cultural institutions.  The parties in the Oireachtas have already been working together on these issues through the all-party Oireachtas consultation group on the centenary of the Easter Rising.In 2010, the Government commemorated the 94th anniversary of the Easter Rising on 4 April, Easter Sunday.  The first annual commemoration in memory of Daniel O'Connell took place at the refurbished Glasnevin Cemetery on Sunday, 19 May.  On Sunday, 16 May, the annual famine commemoration was held in Mayo.  The annual national day of commemoration to commemorate all those who died in past wars or in service with the United Nations will take place on Sunday, 11 July, at the Royal Hospital Kilmainham.Latin American countries celebrate the 200th anniversary of their independence this year.  Many Irishmen and women were associated with the achievement of independence, including Admiral William Brown, the "father of the Argentine Navy".  The Government, in accordance with established precedent, acknowledged the significance of this anniversary and the links that Ireland has with these countries by sending the Irish Naval Service vessel, the LE Niamh, on a ten-week mission to Latin America, visiting Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Mexico.  The voyage will also include the first transit through the Panama Canal by an Irish Naval Service vessel.  The LE Niamh is due back into Cork on 14 July.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	32	The Taoiseach has taken questions Nos. 1 to 13 together.  These cover a wide range of issues, including commemorations, Northern Ireland and various meetings he has had or will have.  With regard to his meeting with the British Prime Minister later today, can he tell the House what matters he expects to discuss with Prime Minister Cameron? On behalf of the Labour Party, I wish him well in those discussions.  Is it his intention to discuss the Saville report on Bloody Sunday and what views will he express to the Prime Minister on it?  Does he intend to have any discussion with the Prime Minister in respect of the security situation in Northern Ireland and, in particular, the activities of dissident republican groups?  Recently, a large bomb, which, fortunately did not go off, was detected in Aughnacloy.  This activity is a worrying development.  Does the Taoiseach intend to have any discussion with Prime Minister Cameron on the implications of yesterday's UK budget for Northern Ireland, both in respect of public expenditure in Northern Ireland and in respect of the future of the tax regime, particularly with regard to VAT and corporation tax?On commemorations, I read the speech the Taoiseach gave recently and welcome its contents and the approach outlined with regard to how the decade of commemorations should progress.  However, while I know that in an address of that sort not everything can be included and there can be omissions, I was a little surprised that there was no reference to the 1913 lock-out, an event in the labour history of this country which should be remembered and reflected upon.  I was also surprised that there was no specific mention of the first Dáil.  I appreciate we commemorated the first Dáil recently, but in the context of the centenary commemorations, it should be included.  The Taoiseach referred to the all-party committee.  I understand the committee does not meet regularly and the most recent meeting was last December.  Does the Government intend that the commemorations that are due to take place over the course of the next decade will be organised and managed on an all-party basis?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	33	The meeting this afternoon will be an opportunity for me to meet the new British Prime Minister in a formal bilateral meeting.  I met him informally at the European Council meeting and referred to the statement he made in the House of Commons on the Saville inquiry report.  I told him that what he said and the spirit in which he said it was appreciated by the families and I commended him in that respect.  The issues that will emerge will include those relating to Northern Ireland, the general bilateral relationship between Britain and Ireland and any European issues of concern to us that we wish to discuss.  That will be the general context of the meeting.I thank the Deputy for his comments regarding my speech on 20 May.  I did not set out a comprehensive list of what is to be commemorated, but simply indicated to the British-Irish studies group that issues such as the First World War, the establishment of the State, their own rising and similar matters were all issues that would be commemorated and that we would seek to address them in as inclusive a way as possible consistent with historical accuracy.  Various traditions place varying emphasis on various issues, but we should seek to commemorate these traditions in a way that is mutually respectful of our shared history.  On the question of the all-party committee, I understand it is concerned with the commemoration of the Easter Rising and does not have a wider remit.  Any input parties wish to have on these matters over the next decade will be appreciated and welcome.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	34	I thank the Taoiseach for that reply.  He has said he is open to suggestions from all parties on commemorations and I would put one suggestion to him.  One of the things that is missing from our historic records is a definitive list of all of those who were killed during the period from 1916 to the end of the Civil War.  There are various lists such as members of the security forces, volunteers or innocent people who were killed for one reason or another.  However, there has never been a compilation of the names of all of those who were killed during the period.  I suggest that in the context of that commemorative period, a definitive list should be drawn up of all those who were killed.With regard to the North-South bodies, the Taoiseach has referred to civic discussions that have taken place between representatives of civic society North and South.  The Good Friday Agreement proposed the establishment of a North-South civic forum.  Is it intended to establish that forum on a structured basis and when might that happen?  I understand some progress has been made with regard to the establishment of a North-South parliamentary body and I am aware a meeting was held in Belfast on that last Monday.  What is the latest position with regard to the establishment of a North-South parliamentary body?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	35	I note what the Deputy had to say regarding the period 1916 to 1922 and will inquire whether something can be achieved on that matter in the context of the commemoration and the issues that will arise in the course of the preparations for it.  On the North-South civic forum, we have been seeking the establishment of this forum for some time and there has been much work and effort to generate enthusiasm on both sides for the establishment of such a forum.  We continue to work on this.  A North-South Ministerial Council meeting will take place soon and these issues will arise, with a view to trying to get people to commit to the establishment of these bodies, which are mentioned in the Good Friday Agreement.As for the establishment of a North-South parliamentary body, the Ceann Comhairle and the Speaker of the Assembly have been working to ascertain how quickly that can be moved along.  While it is a matter for the Oireachtas and the Assembly to bring that about, the Government obviously is encouraging of its establishment as soon as possible.  I understand good progress has been made but I have not received an update on the Monday meeting.

I refer to the centenaries of the aforementioned great lockout in 2013, the Easter Rising in 2016, the Sinn Féin general election victory in 2018 and the first meeting of Dáil Éireann in 2019.  These are all important centenaries.  An bhfuil clár cuimhneacháin á ullmhú ag an Rialtas do na hocáidí sin uilig?For Sinn Féin, and I expect for all parties, these centenaries do not simply represent a recall or a commemoration of great historic events.  They are of course occasions that can offer an opportunity to assist progress towards the full achievement of the goal of those generations who were the front-line participants in those major historical events.  Certainly for them and for me, that goal is a truly independent and united Ireland, a united people — I lay particular emphasis on that — and a Republic worthy of the name across the 32 counties of Ireland.  One should not ever feel that referencing, promoting or encouraging this is in any way to deflect from the importance of reconciliation and the building of mutual respect.  The two are not mutually exclusive and it is about encouragement and about working and developing relations and understandings.While this is only a suggestion on which no major work has been done, when considering the individual centenaries to which I have referred, such as, for instance, that of the great lockout in 2013, would it not be appropriate to have made progress on legislation providing for mandatory recognition of trade union membership by 2013?  Would this not be a highly valid and appropriate achievement on the centenary of the 1913 lockout?  Will the Government consider such a process?  We in Sinn Féin and others have argued for this repeatedly and I moot the idea with the Taoiseach this morning.

Moreover, as we enter this decade of centenaries that ends in 2020, which will mark the centenary of the partition Act that divided our country, would it not be appropriate for the Government to consider preparing a Green Paper on Irish unity?  Again, in the spirit of what I have already indicated, this would be an appropriate contribution.  I refer to planning in a systematic and structured way towards the achievement of a united Ireland, including, very especially and importantly, a dialogue with all views across the island of Ireland and, clearly critically, with those who have not held to a Nationalist or republican outlook throughout all these years.  If we are to achieve the unity of the island and the unity of people to which I referred, we must embark on such an engagement.  We should do so not in any weak, nervous or uncertain way, but with the certainty of what it is we hope to achieve——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	39	I ask the Deputy to put a question, please.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	40	——will represent for all the people who share this island today.Does the Taoiseach agree that addressing Irish unity over the course of these centenaries and in advance of the centenary of the first Dáil threatens no section of the people on the island of Ireland and does not in any way take from the agreements that have been entered into, namely, the Good Friday Agreement, the St. Andrews Agreement, etc.?  Rather, it recognises that both provide for progress to be made on the basis of consent, for which I again assert my support.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	41	As I outlined earlier, the entire purpose of the commemorations is to signify the significance of these events in the history and evolution of the society and political arrangements we have in this country and how we have developed them thus far, where they have a contemporary resonance.  Its purpose for the current generations is to try to put this into the context in which we live today.  The entire idea of commemoration is not to be a prisoner of one's history but to use and learn from history to be creative about how one can solve the problems of today and how one can draw inspiration from those founding fathers of the country in its modern manifestation as a result of the independence movement.  On the other hand, others in this country served in the British Army during the First World War, many of whom were of Nationalist outlook and many of whom understood at the time that they were contributing to the prospect of providing a greater degree of autonomy for the country.  Obviously, the impact of the 1916 Rising and the resulting raising of national sentiment brought about the struggle for independence and the outcomes that derive from it, which unfortunately found our country divided again and which perhaps dominated our politics for far too long.Commemoration is not about returning to the divisions of the past.  It is about recognising and respecting all those who were part of our national life at the time and who did things, as they saw it, by their best lights. It is about so doing in a respectful manner to recognise there are other traditions that played their part as they saw it.  Moreover, one must recognise and respect the fact that many paid the ultimate sacrifice.  This is done every year at the national day of commemoration, at which an inclusive opportunity is provided to commemorate everyone who died in past wars or while serving with the United Nations.The question of initiatives on issues such as what one wishes to do with the labour laws or how to promote unity by consent is separate from the commemoration process itself.  The commemoration process is about commemorating those significant events, applying them to the context of our times with regard to what can be learned for the future and drawing inspiration from the self-sacrifice of those who were at the centre of those events.  The question of other political initiatives for contemporary times are a matter for this House and do not have to be intertwined.  The Government seeks an inclusive approach, while recognising that people come from different perspectives on this issue.  Although it is not a question of ending up with something that is bereft of meaning or substance, at the same time it must be done in a way that is responsive to the sensitivities of others.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	42	To take up from the Taoiseach's response, I would have thought that the questions and the manner in which I posed them reflected some of the points indicated in his response.  The point at which we disagree is that there is no interrelationship and the Taoiseach spoke of not being intertwined.I believe they offer opportunity.  That is the point; that they are not moments in time of themselves.  Does the Taoiseach not agree they can be part of a process in terms of progress on the rights of workers, the rights of citizens to national rights and to the hope and achievement of those national rights within their lifetime?  That is something which means a lot to me and to many people, not only those whom I represent but those whom I know across a range of political opinions.  I acknowledge that.  We should not be afraid to address the bigger issues that are important to people.  Does the Taoiseach not agree that we have a responsibility to ensure that politics addresses those issues and that a vacuum is not created that others would all too willingly seek to fill?  What is important is to prove the primacy of politics and political address on major national questions that remain to be addressed.  The way to do that is through dialogue and developing understanding.

#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	44	It is a question.  I believe that this decade of centenaries offers such an opportunity.  I invite the Taoiseach again to reconsider same.The Taoiseach responded earlier to the question on the consultative civic forum.  I would welcome progress in that regard.  As a member of the North-South Parliamentary Forum working group I record my appreciation of the efforts of the Ceann Comhairle, the Clerk of the Dáil and the representatives of all parties.  We had a further meeting, our first joint working group meeting, on Monday in Stormont.  All one can say in that respect is progress is being made.  I would wish to see similar progress at least being made on the consultative civic forum.The Taoiseach is about to depart for his first meeting with the British Prime Minister, David Cameron.  I too wish him well, as he is representing all of us in that engagement.  Given that the Taoiseach has not raised this matter with the former British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, since this House passed an all-party motion two years ago next month on 10 July 2008 on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, and seeking address in terms of the Saville report referencing the terrible events of January 1972, I ask that he would accept and correct the fact even now late in the day and that he would raise the issue with David Cameron in the hope of furthering the proposal to have an inquiry established led by an independent, international judicial figure to investigate fully the facts behind the tragedies that were visited on the people of Dublin and Monaghan town on 17 May 1974.  I put it to the Taoiseach that that is something he must do.  I appeal to him to use the opportunity and to start the process of raising that matter now in a real and concerted way.With the impending cessation of the funding stream to Justice for the Forgotten, will the Taoiseach restore that funding commitment, as it is the only group representative of victims of the conflict functioning, operating, campaigning and working tirelessly in this jurisdiction?  The comparable groups representing hurt communities north of the Border continue to secure funding from the British Government.  Surely it cannot be lost on the Taoiseach that that is a very stark contrast between the approaches of both Governments?  I appeal to the Taoiseach to recommit the funding stream to Justice for the Forgotten to allow it to continue and I hope one day soon to conclude its important work.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	45	I responded to the last question during a previous Question Time.  The situation has not changed in that respect in terms of the reply I made on that occasion.The opportunity for discussion today relates to developments in Northern Ireland and to the bilateral relationship between this country and Britain in general.  I wish to begin the political discussion and set up the relationship in a way that will enable us to make progress on a range of issues.On the question of commemoration, initiatives that have certain perspectives have intrinsic merit in their own right based on the current contemporary situation and then there is the question of how we use commemoration in as inclusive a way as possible.  That does not in any way indicate a reticence on our part to promote our own political solutions to the general matters that are under discussion, but the purpose of commemoration and what we are trying to achieve while doing so with pride and historical accuracy and giving due tribute to those whom we commemorate is to do so in as inclusive a way as possible.  There are other issues, initiatives and times for us to engage in other aspects of how we can promote the political philosophy we espouse.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	53	As I indicated to the Deputy a number of times the matter has been raised by the Government on a number of occasions.  I have no problem dealing with those matters.  I just do not wish to pre-empt the discussions I am about to have.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	54	I wish to ask the Taoiseach three questions.  First, I wish him well on his first formal visit to Downing Street to meet the British Prime Minister.  In light of the budgetary announcement yesterday by the Chancellor who indicated that there would be a specific review of the corporation tax rate in Northern Ireland, will the Taoiseach raise that with the British Prime Minister?  The implications for enhanced co-operation in terms of trade North and South is an important element.  The Taoiseach is aware that the Chancellor did indicate a reduction of 1% for each of the next four years in respect of corporation tax on mainland Britain and that the situation in Northern Ireland would be subject to review.  Does the Taoiseach intend to raise the matter in light of economic co-operation on the island of Ireland?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	55	With yesterday's budget the question of the economic and trade relationship between this country and Britain, which is an important one for both countries, is something I am sure will emerge in the discussions.  There is a specific commitment in the programme for government agreed between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats in the aftermath of the British general election to examine the question of corporation tax rates in Northern Ireland.  That is an issue the British Government will consider and I will endeavour to glean from the Prime Minister what the approach will be on the matter.Given the economic relationship and the impact of the UK budgetary decisions on Northern Ireland and the island of Ireland and the need, as co-guarantors of the Agreement, to encourage co-operation between the Northern Ireland Executive and the Government in terms of how we can work more effectively together, there is serious potential that has not yet been realised in respect of the level of co-operation that can take place where the political will exists and where the mutual benefit is obvious, in particular, in the constrained economic circumstances in which we find ourselves.  Efforts have been made by both the Northern Ireland Administration and Irish Government to identify sensible co-operative projects in which we should be engaged given the very serious impact of the recession on the Exchequer.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	56	I thank the Taoiseach for that response.  He is aware that Mr. Paterson was interested in this question prior to his appointment as Northern Ireland Secretary of State.  I would like the Taoiseach to raise with the UK Prime Minister the economic progress of the island of Ireland.Bearing in mind the publication of the Saville report, its clarity and the apology by the UK Prime Minister to the people for what happened on Bloody Sunday, the fact that the inquiry cost £200 million speaks for itself.  Since the publication of the report, there has been much comment on what should happen in respect of other incidents that occurred, both North and South.  I do not always agree with Deputy Ó Caoláin but we were party to the all-party motion, which I still support, and I share his views in that regard.Does the Government have a view on whether there should be a system or facility to bring a sense of closure in respect of other incidents?  I am not saying there should be an equivalent of the Saville inquiry in each case, but one should remember that sorrow and pain were inflicted on hundreds of people on both sides because of the loss of loved ones.  In a number of these cases, people are still exceptionally sensitive about the fact that they do not know where the remains of their loved ones are or about the difficulties that arose because of their loss.  Does the Government believe there should be an international view on this or some mechanism whereby people involved could tell their story, or have it told?  Is it the view that there should be other inquiries?  The cost could be horrendous.  We want to focus on the future while remembering the past, which is what the Taoiseach was saying in respect of the commemorative events.  Does the Government have a view on how issues of recent years, other than that of Bloody Sunday, should be dealt with?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	57	The Eames-Bradley process concerned how one deals with the past.  It needs to be revisited again and people need to consider how this can be done.  There is no doubt that there are many people who have not been able to find a means to move on after tragedies were visited upon them.  To find a mechanism that would be regarded on all sides of the community as appropriate and which would give them an opportunity to find a way to move on is difficult, not only to conceive but also to execute and bring to fruition.Various mechanisms have been used that would help people with historical inquiries, etc.  People have been able, in a private way, to obtain facts about the circumstances of the death of a loved one, thus enabling them to move on.  They find this helpful.  Therefore, there is an individual way to proceed.  Whether there can be a wider societal effort to deal with these matters has been exercising the minds of many for a long time.  A model that would meet with the approval of all has evaded everyone thus far.  The Eames-Bradley report is the most structured response we have seen to the issue.  Perhaps it can be revisited now in the aftermath of the Saville report as a means of dealing with the wider and more general issue to which Deputy Kenny referred.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  There is a possibility for progress through that mechanism.In Belfast on Monday, I met the Secretary of State and leaders of most of the parties for an up-to-date review on the current position.  I also met representatives of Co-operation Ireland.  Its chief executive, Mr. Peter Sheridan, gave a very fine presentation on what the organisation is doing to point vulnerable young people in communities in a different and better direction.  I understand the première of a movie that the organisation made on gangs and their impact will be in the ODEON this Friday.  The point being made was that the Governments on both sides should not pull out of the programme too early because recruitment is taking place again on both sides of the divide.  The Government should be very cognisant of this.  I was informed that the term "dissidents" is a misnomer because it puts people into a particular category and ascribes to them a certain way of life.  The term is not reflective of the reality of what can happen.  People should be diverted from its use and they should use instead "anti-Irish" or another such term.Perhaps the Taoiseach will review the involvement of the Irish and British Governments in the programmes that are paying dividends.  Co-operation Ireland, for instance, must do considerable fund-raising itself to keep the programmes in place.  The Government should not withdraw from the programmes too soon.  We all support the peace process and the institutions and platforms, but peace lines are being built again and significant elements of social housing are segregated.  Clearly there is a rising number involved in dissident activities.  The Aughnacloy and Dundalk bomb factories are clear evidence that there is no longer just talk but a movement towards practical destruction, with all its consequences.  Younger people who get sucked into this whirlpool at an early date could well be encouraged in time not to go down that road through the programmes in place.  I strongly suggest to the Taoiseach that the Government review its participation level in the programmes, which pay dividends.  It is of interest to the Government and everyone else that an escalation of violence not happen in the future.  Perhaps the Taoiseach would like to comment on that.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	59	The Department of Foreign Affairs has been involved for many years in liaising with all the community groups and Co-operation Ireland in respect of how they can assist with the rebuilding of communities in a divided society.  It is a great challenge and it will continue.  I take the point that the Deputy made that it is important that we continue to determine where we can assist, logistically and possibly financially, with the well-established projects, which are responsible for a lot of good work on the ground.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	60	I will be very brief and concentrate on one group of questions the Taoiseach answered on commemoration.  I read his speech and welcome it as a contribution to the debate.  It has a few rhetorical flourishes,——
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	61	They were to get the Deputy's attention.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	62	——which I am sure were welcomed also.  With regard to the intention of the speech, which was to make the case for an inclusive version of commemorations, I suggest that, in regard to Britain and Ireland, the greatest case for inclusion has been made in Britain by Mr. Eric Hobsbawm, for example, in respect of the working people who died in war.  In Ireland, there is a case in the new history for the working people who took part in the War of Independence and Civil War and who were victims of many of the actions.  The same holds true for those who took part in the Great War of 1914-18.  I welcome the Taoiseach's reference to this.  The project of inclusion should not be confined to constitutional statements.The next part in the preparation of this inclusion is the making available of the archives which would be of considerable benefit to the people the Taoiseach was addressing, both on the British and the Irish sides.  The other part of it is the Irish in this period who served abroad in international institutions and who continued to do so.  In other words, the commemoration should be about not necessarily the heroism of war as if it was inevitable but also those to whom I referred.It would be absurd to go through the period without celebrating the context to which the Citizen Army addressed itself, to which Seán O'Casey addressed himself — the slums and so forth — and the socioeconomic generations that were lost before the founding of the State and that continued to be lost.  I am making a case for inclusion widely defined to include the socioeconomic aspect to which, for example, the democratic programme of the first Dáil was addressed.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	63	Most of the commemorative events deal with our political past.  I am sure the Taoiseach is aware that this year is the centenary of the foundation of the ICA, which is an important organisation in this country.  Has the Government identified any events that would celebrate the centenary of the ICA or are there any plans to do so?  It is important that we should mark this event and as far as I am aware, there is no event of any significance that marked the establishment of this important organisation that has done so much for the women of this country, both urban and rural.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	64	I will address Deputy Deenihan first.  I understand that there was a significant event held at Dublin Castle when the Government made those facilities available to commemorate the anniversary the Irish Countrywomen's Association was celebrating.  I agree it is an important organisation that has reflected the societal and social changes in terms of the participation of women in our society to a far greater extent than the traditional role that they played in the past.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	65	I appreciate that.  If possible, the Government should do more than that.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	66	I am sure the organisation has centenary events arranged for the course of the year and I am not aware that there have been suggestions of insufficient support from Government where appropriate.  That is all I can say about that at present.On the matter raised by Deputy Higgins, I agree it is not a question of simply commemorating the events themselves in a suitable political context.  There was a strong social aspect to all of this and there is a need to use commemoration as an opportunity to enhance Irish social history and labour history.  These events are opportunities to emphasise those aspects as well as the political aspects.  I have no difficulty with that.  Often I have felt it is important that people understand the social origins of the revolution as well as its political outcome.

I seek clarification again.  I hope that having raised the matter yesterday, the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills will have given further consideration to my request for time to be provided between now and the summer recess in order for the House to address the serious matter of the concerns arising out of both the junior and leaving certificate examinations.  There were incorrect figures in the junior certificate business studies paper and missing pages from the leaving certificate accounting paper, which matters are important.  I appeal to the Tánaiste to afford an opportunity to the House to address these matters as there is no Question Time for the Minister for Education and Skills remaining in the current term and we must wait until the autumn, which simply is not good enough.A further issue is that from my inquiries since I have established that the papers were all printed by two printing firms in Britain.  Against the backdrop of the closure only last week of Future Print which announced the loss of 112 jobs, I understand EU regulations on tendering——

The Tánaiste is the former Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and no doubt she has not abandoned any interest she had then in these issues.  I appeal to her.  Will time be provided?  Will the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills allow time, either this week or in the fortnight remaining, to address the issue of the serious problems from the junior and leaving certificate?

It does not meet what is required.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	79	The Taoiseach indicated there is a short timeframe available now for the discussion of legislation and I do not anticipate time being made available to discuss this matter.  However, there are other ways in which this can be raised.  Also, the Joint Committee on Education and Science can take the opportunity to meet the State Examination Commission.I want to make one or two points.  First, I spoke with the chairman of the commission today and expressed my concerns about what has happened.  He indicated to me that he will be having a meeting with the commissioners tomorrow on this matter and the practice.  The issues will be examined and brought back to my attention to determine what further action, if any, must be taken.We always review the outcome of the examination process and procedure, which is a mammoth task.  It is unacceptable that young people who have been studying for two or three years for an examination would find themselves in this situation but I compliment the schools involved for the speedy way in which they were in a position to get the examination papers from the commission and to give that additional time to those young people.  I hope the situation was not a deterrent to their ability to answer the questions, but I reiterate that it was not acceptable.  I have spoken with the chairman about the matter.  The commission deals with the issue of printing, etc.  It is not necessarily that the process was inadequate, but that certain people did not do the job they were asked to do.  This matter will be brought back to me as quickly as possible, but the committee, which is active in the House, could have an opportunity to raise this matter with the commission.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	82	Deputy Shatter set out the reasons this proposal cannot be agreed to.  The Health (Amendment) Bill 2010 is deeply flawed.  The proposal is for Second Stage to conclude at 4.45 p.m. and Committee and Remaining Stages to conclude at 5.30 p.m.  While the review group comprises people of outstanding ability, the changes contained in the Bill will continue a stream of information between the HSE and the Minister, information that will then be kept secret and not published.  In the interests of finding out what happened to children in care and children at risk, this situation is not acceptable.As I pointed out previously, were the Government to engage in a proper consultative process with an Oireachtas legislative committee before introducing legislation such as this, this situation would not arise in the first place.  Instead, there would be political reaction on the broad elements of what is involved.  Irrespective of who produced the Bill, it is inadequate.  Forcing a guillotine on such a sensitive issue and a deeply flawed Bill is wrong.  For this and other reasons, I oppose the 5.30 p.m. guillotine being applied to No. 6.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	83	On behalf of the Labour Party, I also object to the guillotine being used.  The legislation is concerned with the files of children who died in the care of the State and the work of the independent review group.  It is extraordinary that, while the group was set up by the Minister for Health and Children, the only way it can get the information it requires is via a circuitous route through her to the HSE and back again.  She decides whether the group requires that information.Clearly, the legislation needs to be amended.  Three quarters of an hour will be provided to discuss the 19 amendments tabled by Deputy Shatter and myself.  This is entirely inadequate for an important issue, namely, the lives and deaths of children put into the care of the State.  On behalf of the citizens of Ireland, we are here to deal with this legislation, but we only have three quarters of an hour in which to do our best to strengthen the Bill in so far as we can.  It is emergency legislation, which should never be rushed through in this way.  If we get it wrong, the lives of the most vulnerable children in our communities will be affected.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I strongly object to only three quarters of an hour being afforded to deal with 19 amendments to important legislation.I wish to make a general point that was made by my party yesterday.  We are constantly having guillotines because we are nearing the end of the term.  The two applied yesterday were unnecessary because the business was done before we even reached the times at which the guillotines were to be applied.  We are using up valuable time on issues in respect of which we do not need guillotines while a guillotine is being applied to the important matter of the deaths of children in care.  Opposition spokespersons will have three quarters of an hour to try to deal with an issue.  As representatives of the people, we have a responsibility to deal with it in this Chamber.

Clearly, the Bill has serious flaws and needs to have some of its aspects revisited.The Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill 2008 concluded an hour before the allotted time under last night's guillotine.  If this Bill was to commence today, there would not even be three quarters of an hour for Report and Final Stages because an hour was taken up last night between 9.02 p.m. and 10 p.m. for the commencement of Second Stage.  I wonder how much time we could have secured today on the Order Paper.  Surely additional time could have been allocated, given that an hour was saved last night for the commencement of this process of address of this legislation.  The situation is wholly inadequate and unacceptable.  The guillotine is not the way to go in respect of critical legislation such as this.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	89	This is critical legislation.  I recall that, earlier in June, people were anxious, as were we, to ensure the Bill was introduced in the House to address the concerns about having investigations carried out.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	115	Exactly.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	116	——but to the future functioning of the health service.  It is a far broader Bill than was originally promised to the House.  If we took Committee and Report Stages up to 7 p.m., there would be some chance of teasing out some of the amendments.  The rational approach would be to conclude Committee Stage by 7 p.m. and take Report Stage next week.  The Bill would still pass in reasonable time.  If the Tánaiste is agreeable, I would raise no objection to closing Committee Stage down at 7 p.m. as long as Report Stage is allocated an hour or an hour and a half one day next week.  The Minister could have some time to consider what is stated on the amendments and we would be performing a legislative function not just rubber stamping legislation.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	117	I have already made the case for more time.  The Ombudsman for Children only responded to the Bill in recent days, so I am sure the Minister has not had time to consider the Ombudsman's important opinions.  It would be crazy of us to pass this legislation today if the Minister has not considered that important contribution to the debate.  We need more time on the Bill.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	118	While I acknowledge that the Tánaiste has responded in some measure to Members' appeal, only 30 minutes would be transferred from Second Stage to Report and Final Stages despite the number of amendments and the issues raised by Members and the Ombudsman for Children, Ms Emily Logan.  This is too important to be whipped aside in one evening.  With respect to the Tánaiste's offer, it is not an adequate response to the Members' appeal for additional time and a more programatised approach to this legislation.  There should be no guillotine, which is where the whole argument starts.  If there was no guillotine, we would be able to progress and process this legislation appropriately.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	119	Other items of legislation must be discussed in the House and the Seanad must also be afforded an opportunity.  I am tied on the issue of time but I was prepared to change the deadline for Second Stage to 4.15 p.m.  However, I am not in a position to go beyond the deadline of 5.30 p.m.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	122	We have only a short number of sitting days left before the proposed summer recess.  Will the Tánaiste outline the legislation proposed to be put through the House between now and its rising for the summer?  A number of suggestions have been made about legislation to be taken before the recess.  Can the Tánaiste indicate the legislative schedule for next week and the remaining two weeks?  It is important we know that because there is confusion about the mayoralty legislation, progress on the wording for the children's referendum legislation and so on.  Can the Tánaiste tell us the schedule for the remainder of the Dáil session in terms of legislation to go through the House?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	123	The expectation is that it will include the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill.  We are also dealing with the prescriptions Bill, the European Financial Stability Facility Bill and the Adoption Bill.  As the Deputy is aware, the Central Bank Reform Bill is on Report Stage and we hope to have that completed also.  The Wildlife (Amendment) Bill will be taken tomorrow.  It also includes the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill and the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	126	The Taoiseach gave a specific commitment in respect of legislation to deal with the racing industry and betting tax.  It should be noted that there is growing concern about the status of the racing industry.  There must be legal base to what the Taoiseach committed himself to and the earlier that is done, the better.  May I ask the Tánaiste if it is envisaged that this legislation will come into the House before the summer recess?Am I to understand from reports that the legislation dealing with a directly elected mayor for Dublin is to come into the House at the end of September or October and that the proposition is to have elections either in October or November?  We must have some clarity about that.  The Labour Party will move the writ shortly for the Dublin South by-election, which I will support.  Writs have been moved for two other by-elections — one in the Tánaiste's own constituency.There is much talk about the holding of the referendum on children's rights.  The Tánaiste has said that is of such importance it should be a stand-alone issue.  There are three by-elections, a mayoralty election and a referendum on children's rights pending yet there is no clarity from Government about any of that.  It would be in everybody's interest if the Tánaiste could specify what is to happen regarding those matters between now and the rising of the House for the summer recess.

It is not expected that legislation will be available before the summer.  Second, with regard to the referendum, it is not expected that the legislation will be in the House before the summer.On the issue of the election for mayor in Dublin, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is dealing with that matter and he will bring forward proposals in due course.

When I asked the Taoiseach last week about the date on which the House would rise for the summer recess, I understood him to say the Government's proposal was for 8 July.  Has the Government made a decision as to when the House will resume sittings after the summer recess?  Has it decided on a date for the budget?  Has it decided a date or a week for by-elections, elections for a directly elected mayor for Dublin or referenda?In today's the Irish Independent, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government was attributed to saying that the election for the Dublin mayor will be held in October.  The Tánaiste has just said the setting of such a date is a matter for that Minister.  It appears, whether the Government knows it, he has already decided on a date.  Will the Tánaiste clarify this list of dates I have raised?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	129	The Government has decided the House will rise on 8 July.  This matter will be brought to the House in due course.  The Government has not decided as to when the House will be recalled.  It is not usual for the Government to determine the date of the budget at this early time.  It will be determined in due course.  With regard to all the other issues raised ad infinitum in the House, no decision has been made by the Government on by-election dates.  The legislation concerning the Dublin mayoralty will be brought to the House in due course.

Every organisation has some idea at this stage as to what its agenda for the rest of the year looks like.  Yet the Tánaiste asks us to accept that the Government has decided the date the House will rise but has no idea when it will be recalled after the summer recess.  She also asks us to accept that it does not know when the budget will be or elections or referenda held.  If it cannot make up its mind on the timetable for the rest of the year, it leaves a poor impression as to how it is making decisions on more important matters.

Can she indicate if the Government has given serious consideration to the matters raised?  We have gone on at length about the important referendum on children's rights yet the Government continues to trundle out the same response that no decision has been made.  Is it actively considering, never mind actually coming to a conclusion, as to when this referendum will take place?  There is no evidence it has so far.The children's referendum was promised and committed to by the Government.  Time and again we have asked for it to be clarified that it will be held in 2010.  Will the Tánaiste inform the House if the Government can at least indicate it can give a date for the referendum?

The national tourism development authority Bill could have major and important implications for the tourism industry.  Have the heads of the Bill been discussed and agreed in Cabinet?

Will the Tánaiste confirm this Bill will be taken in the next session?In view of the mess the economy is in, brought about by the Government's squandering of taxpayers' money over some time, will the Tánaiste assure the House there will be no mini-budget between now and December?

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	182	Yesterday the Minister for Finance announced an inquiry into the operations of the Department of Finance.  Will the terms of that inquiry be published?  Will the inquiry examine the role of the Department of the Taoiseach in respect of economic policy over the ten year period that, apparently, the inquiry will cover?  For much of the relevant period, the Department of the Taoiseach and the former Taoiseach took the lead on finance on many occasions.  Will the inquiry cover both the role of the Department of Finance and the role of the Department of the Taoiseach?  Will the Minister publish the terms of the inquiry and will the Minister commit to publishing in full the results of this inquiry?
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	183	Will the Deputy consider a parliamentary question on the matter?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	184	No.  The Departments of Finance and the Taoiseach are the two lead Departments with regard to the economy and governance of the State.  A financial emergency has arisen as a result of Fianna Fáil's mismanagement.  The Minister has belatedly announced an inquiry.  I am perfectly in order to ask what the terms of the inquiry will be.  Will it be comprehensive and include the Department of Finance?  Will the terms be published?  Will the outcome and report of the inquiry be published in full?  I am totally in order to ask.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	185	This is a review of the Department of Finance, not the Department of the Taoiseach.  The Minister has indicated there will be an independent review to evaluate the systems, structures and processes used by the Department of Finance in its role in advising the Minister and the Government.  It will be carried out expeditiously and I do not anticipate that the terms of reference, etc., will be a matter of public discourse.  The matter is pertinent only to the Department of Finance.

#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	207	I move:That, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders or in the Resolution of the Dáil of 14 June 2007, setting out the rota in which questions to members of the Government are to be asked, or in the Resolution of the Dáil of 16 June 2010, questions for oral answer, following those next set down to the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, shall be set down to Ministers in the following temporary sequence:Minister for Social ProtectionMinister for Justice and Law ReformMinister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht AffairsMinister for Foreign Affairswhereupon the sequence established by the Resolution of 14 June 2007 shall continue with questions to the Minister for Defence.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	208	I move:That the Ceann Comhairle direct the Clerk of the Dáil to issue his writ for the election of a Member to fill the vacancy which has occurred in the membership of the present Dáil consequent on the resignation from Dáil Éireann of George Lee, a member for the constituency of Dublin South.This motion is in the name of the Labour Party Whip, Deputy Emmet Stag.  It is now more than four months since George Lee resigned as a Member.  When Deputy Seamus Brennan died in July 2008, the vacancy was left unfilled for a period of 11 months.  The people of Dublin South have been under-represented now for a combined period of more than 16 months during the past two years.  There has been a vacancy in Donegal South-West for more than 12 months arising from the election to the European Parliament of Pat the Cope Gallagher.  There has been a vacancy in the Waterford constituency for more than three months arising from the resignation of Martin Cullen.It should not be acceptable for vacancies in the membership of the House to be left unfilled for such a long period.  It is fundamentally anti-democratic that the people of Dublin South, Donegal and Waterford are being denied the level of representation to which they are entitled.  It also sends out a message that membership of the Dáil is not important, that politics is not important and that our democratic system is not important.In Britain, which has a similar system of parliamentary democracy, by-elections are held within a matter of weeks of the vacancy occurring in the House of Commons.  In fact, the practice in the early decades of Dáil Éireann was to have by-elections within a space of a few weeks.  For example, in 1927 Kevin O'Higgins was assassinated on 10 July and the consequent by-election was held on 24 August.  Even in recent decades, normal practice has been that a by-election is held within a couple of months of the vacancy occurring.  Two vacancies occurred during the lifetime of the last Dáil and the by-elections were held within about three months.  Let us consider the 28th Dáil, which sat from 1997 to 2002.  Some six vacancies arose and on no occasion was the by-election deferred for as long as one year.In the past, various Governments have been tardy about calling by-elections but this is the first Government to have adopted a policy that all by-elections should be delayed for as long as possible.  I have no doubt that if it believed it could get away with it, it would delay them indefinitely.The legal and constitutional rights of the people of Dublin South, Donegal and Waterford cannot be ignored indefinitely.  If the Government persists in refusing to hold the by-elections, other remedies may have to be considered.  From a case taken in 1994 by a Dublin South-Central constituent, we are aware that the High Court, in granting leave for a judicial review of failure of the Government to proceed with the by-election in that constituency, stated there was an "arguable case that the Government of Ireland has a constitutional obligation to set down and support motions for the issue of a writ for the holding of a by-election after a reasonable time".  The case never went to a full hearing because the by-election was held in the meantime.  If the Government persists with its current attitude, it may be only a matter of time before some aggrieved voters in one of these constituencies resorts to the courts and takes the matter out of our hands.In recent months, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party have trooped in here to defeat attempts to move the writs for Donegal South-West and Waterford.  The longer they deny the people their democratic rights, the more the anger of electors will grow.The country needs a fresh start and the people need new hope.  Events last week showed the skewed priorities of the Government again.  On Wednesday, the chief executive of Anglo Irish Bank admitted to an Oireachtas committee that the lion's share of the €22 billion of taxpayers' money that Fianna Fáil had put into the bank will never been seen again.  On the same day, the Government announced that it was putting another €250 million of taxpayers' money into the EBS.  At the same time, the Government was forcing through the Dáil the Social Welfare Bill that is supposed to be about reforming the social welfare system and supposed to activate jobseekers and lone parents.  However, without backing up these proposals with genuine job opportunities and access to quality training, education and literacy improvement, the effect will be simply to further impoverish people who are already living on subsistence levels of income.Earlier this month, figures were published showing that, for the 12th successive month, the number of people on the live register is more than 400,000, with the most recent figure at 438,000.  Another set of figures was published by the Central Statistics Office which disclosed that a total of 41% of those now out of work are classified as long-term unemployed.  In other words, they have been out of work for more than 12 months.  When I raised these shocking figures in the Dáil last week, all the Taoiseach could do was shrug his shoulders and state that it is not possible to go back to the low levels of unemployment we had before Fianna Fáil plunged the country into economic chaos.  The Labour Party will not abandon the unemployed and job creation will be the number one priority if our party is in Government after the next election.  The Labour Party has already proposed several initiatives to get people back to work.  One of our key proposals is for the creation of a strategic investment bank.  This should be a key plank in Ireland's jobs strategy.  Its structure and role would make a major contribution to the immediate task of promoting recovery, while also playing a central role in the transformation and restructuring of the economy.If the Government is so confident that we are turning an economic corner and that it is doing such a great job, then neither Fianna Fáil nor the Green Party should have any fear of facing the electorate.  Their continued refusal to allow the by-elections to be held shows they do not even believe as much themselves.  They are whistling past their political graveyard.  When the people get the chance to vote, there is no doubt about the political verdict they will pass on this discredited, demoralised and politically bankrupt Government.

When I have reached two and a half minutes, perhaps the Ceann Comhairle will inform me.I wish to start by saying that I believe that where there is a vacancy in any Dáil constituency, a by-election should be held within a reasonable period of time.  It is not unreasonable that, where a vacancy occurs, there is a two or three month delay before an election is held.  However, one gets to a point at which the delay is grossly unreasonable.  In the context of Dublin South, it is the third constituency in which there is vacancy.  Donegal South-West, of course, is the constituency in respect of which there is the longest vacancy.  It is my view that once we have this vacancy, there is a constitutional obligation on the Government to ensure that the vacant seat is filled within a reasonable period of time and that the electorate in Dublin South, those who live in Dublin South, have the full quota of Deputies, to which they are constitutionally entitled, to represent them in this particular House.Of course, the reason the Government has opposed the writs moved for the Waterford and Donegal South-West by-elections and the reason I assume it will oppose the writ for this by-election is that it knows it has lost all moral authority to govern in this State.  Essentially, what it wants to do is to put off permanently, if it can get away with it, the holding of any by-elections during its remaining term of office for very simple reasons.  I do not believe when the by-elections are held in Dublin South, Donegal South-West or Waterford that there is any remote possibility that a candidate supporting either of the Government parties will be elected.  I believe that the electorate will provide substantial support for the view overwhelmingly held among the general public that the time has come for this Government to leave office.  I have no doubt that the only reason the Government is refusing to move is for fear that if it loses all three by-elections, the pressure on it for the holding of a general election will be absolutely unstoppable.If the Government believes it has a mandate to rule, it should have the courage to allow these by-elections to take place.  If it believes there are measures that need to be taken, it should get the moral authority from the electorate.  It should not fear the electorate.  A government which fears the electorate will see the electorate reap a whirlwind of revenge on it when it is finally forced to go to the country and we have either the required by-elections or the necessary general election.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	210	Last month Fine Gael published a Bill requiring that by-elections be held within six months.  There was good reason for that.  If I was sitting on the opposite side of the House and enjoyed the level of support the Government enjoys, I would not rush to the electorate either.  There is always a reason for governments not to hold by-elections.  For that reason, we need to take it out of the hands of the incumbent Government and put it into the hands of the law because the law is always objective and does not serve special interests.The new politics which the public now demands must refocus not on the needs of the incumbent Government or on special interests but on the needs of the people we are supposed to serve.  Postponing by-elections serves only the needs of Government and it always disadvantages the people who are under-represented in the constituency that is under-represented.The Government has given us all sorts of excuses why it will not hold by-elections, mayoral elections, referendums, etc., but they are all red herrings and a distraction from the real reason it is not holding elections which is its fear of the electorate.  I understand the reason but it is putting itself in conflict with the Constitution, certainly in the case of Donegal South-West in which it is way outside the level of tolerance.  It is also in conflict with the spirit of the Constitution in all constituencies, and Fianna Fáil has always placed such store in the Constitution.What we want is a general election and not a by-election because the Government has no mandate for what it is doing and it has been totally rejected by the people for what it has done.  It was elected on the promise of being a safe pair of hands for the economy and the party that had the expertise to perpetuate the Celtic tiger.  That is what it persuaded the people to vote for but look at what they got instead.  They faced complete wipe out of their jobs, pensions, savings, share values and of hope.  Everything was wiped out.  Now the Government has us on a treadmill of a banking policy which can only lead to catastrophe.The Government is accumulating debt daily which will be a ball and chain around the necks of the younger generation.  Our sons and daughters lives will be blighted trying to repay the debt it has accumulated on their behalf.  Their families, homes and futures have been blighted as a result of that.If this Government had any shame, it would resign and slink away.  It should at least give the people what they are entitled to under the Constitution.  If it believes it has a mandate, it should put it to the test.

It does not have a mandate to govern because it stood in an election and did not put forward any of the policies it is now implementing.  What is even more bizarre is that we are discussing a writ for a by-election in Dublin South but one of the Members from that constituency is absent.  Where is the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan?   In the past, the Green Party position was to hold by-elections within a very short period of time.  I believe he, like Members of Fianna Fáil, is afraid of the electorate.What I find interesting in this debate and what has not been mentioned so far is that the convention is that when a by-election is required the party which lost the seat moves the writ and it is accepted.  I find it very strange that this motion was tabled by the Labour Party.  I thank it for moving it because writs should be moved within three months.  The writ was not moved by Fine Gael.  Is it also afraid of the electorate of Dublin South?  I do not believe any of the parties of the right or the Green Party represent the 11,000 people who are unemployed in the Dublin South constituency or the many more who are on low or reduced pay because of Government decisions.  I do not believe they represent the hundreds, if not thousands, of people who are close to losing their homes, who have negative equity or who cannot pay their mortgages or the thousands more who are on the housing waiting list.On 29 April 2009 when a motion was moved in regard to the Dublin South by-election, which returned a Fine Gael Member, I said the Government needed to prepare legislation or a constitutional amendment, if required, to ensure by-elections are triggered within three months of the death of a Member, the expulsion of a Member because of bankruptcy or the resignation of a Member.  In this instance, there should have been a by-election within one month.  There is no reason that by-election should not have been held.  To delay it further is undemocratic.The people in Dublin South are not fully represented in this House.  The massive anger reflected not only in Dublin South but throughout the State needs to be heard in this House and expressed by somebody elected to represent that anger.There is no mandate for the Government's actions in shackling future generations with a debt not of their making or of our making.  This debt was created by a Government decision to bail out a corrupt, zombie bank and those who gambled on the market and in that bank.  There is no mandate for slashing public service pay and for cutting public services.  As a former Minister, Deputy O'Dea, did at the weekend, there is no mandate to encourage emigration — to encourage our young people to leave our shores.I urge the Government to accept this motion and move the writ in order that we can have a by-election and the people of Dublin South can be fully represented.  I agree with others that rather than a by-election, we should have a general election at this stage.  However, given the Government is not willing to go for a general election, the by-elections should be held now not only in Dublin South but also in Waterford and Donegal South-West.

I will give eight minutes to Deputy Ó Caoláin.Earlier this morning we were endeavouring to get more time allotted for consideration of this legislation and particularly for Committee and Report Stages but we were not successful.

It seems this is an unbalanced use of parliamentary time.  I have to ask which is more important.  Why should more than three hours be given to one Stage of a Bill dealing with road traffic and three quarters of an hour in total given to Committee and Report Stages of a Bill dealing with children who have died in the care of the State?However, this Bill is progress and I do not wish to sound churlish about it.  It is designed to facilitate the operation of the independent group comprising Geoffrey Shannon and Norah Gibbons to carry out a full review of the deaths of children in the care of the State.  To that extent, I do not wish to impede the progress of the Bill in any way.  It is vital the review team is given the access to the information and files it requires in order to carry out this review.  However, the group is forced to take a circuitous route by accessing this information from the HSE by way of the Minister of State's office.  The HSE can decide that relevant information should be given and volunteer to provide it and supply to the review group by way of the Minister of State's office or the Minister can request the HSE to hand over certain information to the review group.  One of the main points made by the Ombudsman for Children is that, either way, the independent review group does not have the power to demand the files it requires to carry out the review.  This is a fundamental failing.The Minister of State will have taken legal advice and he may well say it is not possible to do this under current legislation and that further legislation may be required to give the review the full powers to access the information it requires rather than be forced to go through the Minister of State's office to the HSE.  In my view, public confidence would be increased if the group could access the information directly and if it was empowered to publish its report upon completion.  The Minister of State has said the report will be published and this is to be welcomed.  The public need to get all the available information.Dr. Siobhán Barry, a clinical psychologist, has stated that, in her view, the Children First guidelines should have required this information to be automatically transferred in any case.  The Child Care Act 2001 is being quoted as the reason the Government was given the advice it could not deal with this issue without introducing the legislation today.  Dr. Barry suggests that, because the primary interest of children is paramount, the Children First guidelines should have obliged the HSE to hand over the files to the independent review group without the need for legislation.  If the Children First guidelines were statutory rather than non-statutory provisions, they would at least have had parity with the Child Care Act 2001.  If these guidelines were statutory provisions, the issue in the Child Care Act 2001 would have been required to be dealt with in the House.  I ask the Minister of State when the Children First guidelines will be put on a statutory basis.Other issues raised in the context of this Bill include the issue of the in camera rule.  The Minister of State in his contribution last night referred to Carol Coulter’s review of the family courts and the effect of the in camera rule.  There has been a widespread debate about the effect of this rule.  Information of public importance and to the good of vulnerable children is not available because of the in camera rule.  It is the case that no appropriate record exists in the family courts to allow information be used either by the media, policymakers or public representatives who are people who have the interests of children at heart.  The very valuable information available in the family courts could be used for the development of policy in this area and in the interests of children.I know the Minister of State has an interest in this regard and I would like to see some progress as it has been discussed for a long time.  There seems no reason not to have more information available for policymaking than what is currently available from the family courts.  The in camera rule was never designed to preclude this kind of information from being used.  It is designed to protect the identity and interests of children and other vulnerable people in the context of family law cases.  This issue needs to be addressed quickly.We all want to see this review carried out as quickly as possible with the full information required.  Both Mr. Shannon and Ms Gibbons have stressed that this review is about learning lessons from what happened in the past and to ensure that procedures are put in place for the future so that children in care are properly cared for and they are not left vulnerable to go to Garda stations at night in order to seek shelter.  In some of the cases highlighted, young people were in and out of all sorts of different care provision facilities and completely inappropriate situations and with nowhere to go during the day time.  They were not protected from adults who preyed upon them in a variety of ways and ultimately, for example, this led to the death of Daniel McAnaspie and other heart-rending cases of young people in care who simply were not cared for.Last week during a debate the Minister of State correctly made the point that prevention is crucial in all these situations and early intervention is much more valuable than crisis management.  However, we still have a crisis management situation in our child care services.  I wish to highlight situations in which if a young person has problems, he or she only obtains intervention when the problem becomes almost insoluble because things have gone so far.  We need to be able to intervene with families at an early stage so that a problem does not become so great that it is insoluble and in many cases, it is the law rather than the welfare services that intervene.  There will be some opportunity, but not nearly enough, to tease out the issues in this Bill on Committee and Report Stages.  We need a lot more time to deal with this because it is extremely important for the future welfare of vulnerable children in our society.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	243	This Bill, as I have said today and previously, should not be necessary, but some have argued and we must now accept it is necessary in law for the reasons stated.  The Bill arises from the immediate need for the Health Service Executive to provide information to the investigation into the deaths of children in the care of the State established by Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews.  For that reason the Bill is welcome, because it facilitates an investigation that is necessary and urgent.The figures released by the HSE on 4 June brought to 188 the number of children who died in the past decade either in State care or who were known to the social services.  This is a shocking figure, which makes it all the more urgent that the HSE files are released to the special investigation team established by the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews.  I wish Norah Gibbons and Jeffrey Shannon well in their important work.  As I said when the figures were released, if legal obstacles to the release of the files really do exist, they should be removed as a matter of urgency.  To that extent, I welcome this Bill.Before going into the details of the Bill, I must point out that we are having this debate at a time when the Government is cutting back on social welfare, education, health and on social care services in a way that hits marginalised families and vulnerable children worst.  These are the essential supports which help address child poverty and neglect.  Undermining these services through cuts will condemn more children to the margins and to the risk of neglect and abuse.  I urge the Minister of State to use his voice at the Cabinet table at every opportunity to make these important and salient points to his colleagues in their respective ministries.This Bill should not be necessary.  Why should we have to legislate to compel the HSE to "ensure that the Minister is appropriately briefed by the HSE on all matters that he or she needs to be aware of in a timely and appropriate manner"?  Surely that should happen as a matter of course.  However, it clearly does not.  I believe that is a consequence of the role of the HSE as envisaged by the Government when it was established.  It was set up to insulate the Minister and to act as a buffer between the Government and its responsibility to be accountable to elected representatives and the public.There is clearly a bunker mentality in the HSE.  In an article in The Irish Times on 1 June, the Ombudsman and Information Commissioner, Emily O’Reilly, highlighted a case where the HSE spuriously used the in camera rule as the basis of its claim that an investigation by the Ombudsman, which had nothing to do with any particular child, was illegal.  The HSE dragged the issue to the courts, incurring substantial costs to itself and, after the court struck out the action, paying the costs of the Ombudsman and the other party as well.  As it turned out, the HSE implemented the Ombudsman’s recommendations anyway.  The Ombudsman described this as “a bizarre experience” in which the HSE “displayed a capacity for ill-founded legalism matched only by a lack of common sense”.  In response, in a letter to the editor, the HSE national director of integrated services, Laverne McGuinness, strongly refuted the Ombudsman’s arguments.  However, they are compelling arguments for anyone who wants to take note.Seeing two such important public bodies, charged with the protection of the lives and the rights of citizens, arguing in this way does little for public confidence.  Who is the arbiter here?  It must be the Minister, the Government and the elected representatives of the people in the Oireachtas.  It is elected representatives here who have brought the deaths of children in care to the fore, who have pressed the Government on it and who have caused the investigation to be initiated by the Minister of State.  That is the reason accountability is so important.We owe a debt of gratitude to the Ombudsman for Children, Emily Logan, for her timely and clear-sighted advice on the Bill.  I urge the Minister of State to take on board the three principal concerns raised by her.  Her first concern is that the independent group carrying out the investigation cannot directly source information and documents from the HSE, because it is the Minister alone who, under this Bill, determines what is relevant.  This may weaken public confidence in the investigation.  I have no doubt but that it probably will.  The Ombudsman for Children calls for a properly constituted statutory inquiry, with its own means of compelling documents and information rather than relying on the Minister's power to do so.  There is also a serious concern that the Bill will not permit the investigation team to publish any report it may issue.  This is because, under the Bill, the information goes to the Minister and only he may use it, including for publication.  The third point of concern raised by the Ombudsman for Children is the fact that the Bill does not allow the Minister or the investigation team to publish any information or documentation derived from in camera proceedings, even if it is considered to be in the public interest to do so.I urge the Minister of State to take these important reservations on board and to accept the relevant amendments, as tabled by my colleagues, on Committee Stage.  While accepting the urgency of the issues at stake, I regret the decision of the House earlier to force this legislation through by guillotine.  The legislation is rushed and like all rushed legislation, it has its share of flaws.  We must always guard against the danger of rushed and ill-considered legislation.  In light of the difficulties and information provided, including the legitimately held concerns and fears of many now known to the Minister of State, will he now accept the key amendments that seek to address the identified fault lines in the proposed Bill?   The Ombudsman for Children has considered the legislation very carefully.  The Minister of State has a responsibility to take these concerns on board and to reflect them in the course of the passage of the Bill.  It should be duly amended so that it has not only the support in terms of its intent of all parties in the House but the confidence of all voices who speak here in the interest of children across the board.I conclude by urging the Minister of State to take on board the important concerns that have been expressed not only by the Ombudsman for Children, but by all voices here across all Opposition parties.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	244	I am glad to be able to respond to the comments made by Members last night and this afternoon.  This is important legislation and I genuinely am glad the three Members who spoke welcomed it, albeit obviously and naturally with various caveats.  The purpose of the Bill is clear and focused.  Given the short available timeframe within which it was drafted, it was drafted with great care and went through a thorough and rigorous process.  I reject the assertion by Deputy Shatter that it is woolly, ill thought out or suffering from the problems that normally are associated with legislation that is introduced on an emergency basis.  This reflects its great importance.  The reason it is being brought forward so quickly is to enable the independent review group to receive important files that had been the subject of legal advice for the HSE and that had not been provided to it.I should also state that this is an important area in respect of balancing rights.  Everyone is aware that one must balance the rights of individuals to their privacy against the important public interest in this area.  I acknowledge there always will be a media interest in this kind of area, that is, the often tragic end to an individual who has been in the care system but who has been failed by the care system or by factors external to the HSE.  As I stated in a previous debate, as was acknowledged by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, I would prefer a little more focus on the manner in which one can intervene at an earlier stage to avoid such tragedies from transpiring.  Unfortunately, this has not been possible in the crisis management scenario that has obtained for some time.  Consequently, one must accept there always will be interest in this area and, therefore, one must set up a systematic way of examining cases of serious incidents and deaths in care.This is the reason I asked HIQA to provide guidance for the HSE in this area last July.  It did so by setting up an independent review panel under the chairmanship of Dr. Helen Buckley, which already has begun its work.  I also decided it was necessary to conduct a retrospective examination of the manner in which the HSE had both investigated and recorded information in this regard.  I was delighted that Mr. Geoffrey Shannon and Ms Norah Gibbons agreed to take part.  While it was unfortunate that a legal issue arose and that perhaps it did not arise in a sufficiently timely way, nevertheless this legislation underscores the Government's commitment to ensuring that a report will be produced that will provide an insight into some of the issues that have arisen over the last decade.I wish to deal with some of the specific issues that were raised by Members.  First, I refer to the question of whether the independent review group can get files directly from the HSE, which was raised by all three speakers.  I set up the independent review group specifically because I wish to introduce a degree of transparency that has not been in place heretofore and wish to introduce timely reporting.  I seek the restoration of public confidence in this area and that is the reason it would be ridiculous for me not to facilitate the independent review group in respect of any files it proposes to seek from the HSE.  Moreover, it should be made clear that the independent review group has been able to obtain files from the HSE, other than those that are restricted by the legal principles the HSE has been advised it must accept.  Second, the Health Act I propose to amend with this legislation deals with the relationship between the Department of Health and Children and the HSE.  It is naturally the case that were one to consider this within a wider sphere, one might look at six months of consultation or at a White Paper or beyond the position on which one has been able to focus so specifically with regard to this legislation.A question also has been raised in respect of publication and it is clear there has been a problem with regard to publication.  Moreover, such problems do not exist within this jurisdiction alone.  The publication of any such material always entails trying to strike the correct balance.  I make the point that the publication by Fine Gael of the TF case tipped the balance more heavily in favour of the public interest in transparency and tipped it away from the right of individuals to their privacy.  It was an act with which I sincerely disagreed, as did others.  For example, the Irish Foster Care Association made clear its dissatisfaction, as did the Irish Association of Young People in Care.  This simply underlines the difficulty associated with publication in this area and Members must be more mature about their discussions on this issue.  They should forget about censorship, secrecy and all narrative that is designed to deliberately undermine public confidence in a child protection service that in general works extremely well.  Thousands of children in foster care must listen day in and day out to comments being made, without great consideration, to the effect that our child protection system is chaotic.  However, this is not the case.I acknowledge there are deficits, as does the HSE and no one could argue otherwise.  Broadly speaking, however, the vast majority of children who are in our care system receive a good service. One need only look at the HIQA report into, for example, special care, which stated that almost all the children in special care were in receipt of a very good service, were highly conscious of their rights and were satisfied that they were receiving a good service in special care.  These are the most troubled children in Ireland and this is to the credit of the HSE.  Sometimes, Members do not talk enough about the positives.I am determined that the Government will publish this report when the independent review group has completed its work.  It will be my responsibility to publish it and this will be done in a timely fashion.  The in camera rule has been cited by the HSE as one of the reasons it was precluded from handing over the information to the independent review group and there has been some commentary about the need to elicit a lot more information about child care proceedings than has been the case in the past.  The Child Care (Amendment) Act 2007 was passed to allow me, as the responsible Minister, to appoint a person or persons to undertake an investigation of and to report on proceedings in the child care courts in order to have a better foundation for policy in the future.Deputy Ó Caoláin also commented on budgetary measures and how they are having an effect.  While he is correct, one also must acknowledge that the budgetary measures taken over the last 18 months have been progressive.  The burden has been weighed more heavily on those with higher incomes and protections have been afforded to those who are vulnerable such as pensioners and people with a higher reliance on social welfare.  All analysis points to this and even Fr. Seán Healy made comments in that regard about the budget of April 2009.  Moreover, one cannot forget that in the most recent budget of December 2009, the Government committed €15 million to provide for the delivery of the implementation plan arising from the Ryan report, including the appointment of 200 additional social workers to provide the kind of care that all Members seek to have in place.The question of the independence of the review group also has been raised and I repeat that the two individuals concerned, whom everyone wishes well, have reputations that no one can question.  Under no circumstances would they accept the task I have given to them, were their independence not absolutely guaranteed.  I will have ongoing discussions with them to ensure they are properly resourced and are in a position to provide for the conclusion of their investigations within the timeframe they envisage.I acknowledge this Bill constitutes emergency legislation.

As an island nation, with a peripheral location, our access infrastructure is of vital strategic importance to our economy.  Our airports have a critical role in supporting economic development by facilitating trade, tourism and inward investment.  Their operation as State agencies, albeit operating to a commercial mandate, ensures that investment decisions take account of the wider national interest in a way that could not readily be guaranteed were they under private ownership.  Any future consideration of the possible privatisation or part-privatisation of these assets would have to include the question of whether it would be possible to design a regulatory framework that could be effective in protecting the wider national interest.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	256	The last part of the reply seems to indicate that the Minister would consider selling off the Dublin Airport Authority given certain guarantees on regulation.  An article by Pat Leahy in The Sunday Business Post dated 13 June states that proposals for a broad asset sale are being drawn up in the Department of Finance without being discussed by the relevant Ministers.  Is the Minister aware of any such report or has he read the article?  If he has, what are his views on it?  Serious issues arise about the Dublin Airport Authority, its monopoly and the fact that it has three airports under its wing.  It has been suggested that they ought to be independent of the DAA.  I would appreciate the Minister’s answer to those questions, especially whether he is aware of the report, has read it or if he has been consultedon it.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	257	My answer to those questions is the same as the reply I outlined.  I have not had any discussions on selling off State assets, especially not the Dublin Airport Authority.  I do not have any plans to have any such discussions.  I have not read the article to which the Deputy referred and I am not aware of it.  The reference in the reply to future consideration was merely information for the Deputy.  He should not read anything at all into it.  I am not in favour of selling off an important State asset such as the Dublin Airport Authority.  There are strategic national reasons we should own such strategic infrastructure.  A privatised Dublin Airport, for instance, would have little incentive to pre-fund runway or terminal capacity or to provide a range of services to meet the needs of prospective rather than existing users, unless as I said, mechanisms were built into the regulatory framework that are not there at the moment.  We should learn lessons from past events such as the sale of all of Eircom's then assets which left us in a poor position to implement State and Government policy.  I would be very reluctant to go down that road with airports.  I do not think it would be a good idea.

Issues arise also about terminal 2 which will now be run by the DAA.  I accept that is part of a later question on a lack of competition.  A significant number of international airlines that work out of Dublin have not as yet agreed to move into terminal 2.  Serious questions arise about the DAA's monopoly.  It is losing money hand over fist and it is not competitive.  There ought to be some room for breaking up the company in certain respects.  Does the Minister have a view on the breaking up of the company?  Even if the company is retained in State ownership there could be different parts with separate accountability from the DAA.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	259	I do not accept propaganda by Ryanair on the matter.  Any objective assessment of the Dublin Airport Authority clearly indicates that the airport charges there are in accordance with the EU average and probably a little bit below that.  The attitude of a private firm such as Ryanair is precisely why I would not like to go down the route of having a privatised Dublin Airport.  As far as I can see the private sector would only be interested in profit.  It would not be interested in the good name of Ireland and the impression that might be given to first-time visitors to this country.  The airport is the first place they see in the country.  That would not enter into the reckoning for a private sector company.  It would be a case of how it could maximise the profits from the asset.Reference has been made to Dublin Airport being a monopoly.  There is only one airport in Dublin.  It does not make much sense to think one can have three or four operators there.  We tried to ensure that the terminals would operate as separate entities but that was not successful.  We now have to depend on the regulation of the Commission for Aviation Regulation to try to ensure the situation is competitive.  In fairness to the Dublin Airport Authority, it has produced a profit for the State on a regular basis.  The details are provided in reply to a later question which I will not anticipate.  The DAA has served the State well.On the question of whether there should be one company or three companies, that is due for review in 2011.

The five major inter-urban motorways and the M50 upgrade will be completed this year.  The Irish Rail fleet has been renewed.  The Cork to Midleton line and the first phase of the western rail corridor have opened and the first phase of the Navan line will open later this year.  The Kildare railway line has been upgraded and a number of new Dublin suburban stations have opened.  The Luas docklands extension opened last December and Cherrywood and City West are well advanced.  More than 500 buses have been purchased.The Transport 21 investment framework runs until 2015.  While not all of the projects originally identified in Transport 21 will be completed by 2015, no projects have been cancelled and Transport 21 continues to provide the strategic framework for capital spending on transport infrastructure into the future.  The capital funding allocation for my Department for 2011 will be determined as part of the 2011 budget process.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	261	Some days ago, serious concerns were expressed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, IBEC and representatives of the construction industry on the future of Transport 21 and key transport infrastructure projects.  Does the Minister share their concern that funding simply will not be available from 2011 onwards?During the last minutes of the Minister's last Question Time, he was very upset about a reported delay of three years that is to affect the interconnector.  He had met the board of CIE that morning.  Has he found out why the 3.5 year timetable for the interconnector has drifted to 5.5 years, thus postponing the completion date until 2018?  What is happening in this regard?  Is the Minister convinced Irish Rail has the capacity to deliver the interconnector, which is to be a major development for rail transport in the eastern region?With regard to metro north, when does the Minister expect the tranche of €500 million from the European Investment Bank?  Assuming metro north gets the green light in the next couple of months, as most expect, major funding will have to be provided for the preparatory works late in 2010 and throughout 2011.  Has the Minister any estimates on this and what has he done about it?What is happening with regard to phases 2 and 3 of the western rail corridor and the completion of the Navan line?  Are they being put on the long finger?With regard to capital spending under the transport Vote, the Minister secured €3.1 billion in 2008, €2.4 billion in 2009 and €2 billion this year.  In 2008, 67% of the allocation was spent on roads.  In 2009, it was 72% and it is to be 68% this year.  Next year the roads programme, including the construction of the interurban routes, is coming to an end.  We expected at this point to be able to direct the major funding towards public transport provision.  Is it now the case that the money will simply not be available?Has the Minister had lengthy discussions with the Minister for Finance about the necessity to maintain a major transport capital budget?  We are told by the ESRI that if we spend €1 billion on infrastructure, it leads to an increase in GNP in the order of €0.5 billion.  The cost benefit is quite clear.  We should make the investment.  How far has the Minister got in this regard and what can he tell us about these projects?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	262	As the Deputy will no doubt be aware, to be able to spend money one has to have it.  One has to make it and be in a position to borrow it.  The Government's strategy over the past couple of years was to try to ensure we would be in such a position.  We certainly do not have as much money now as we had two, three or four years ago. Within these constraints, we are spending this year €6.5 billion on capital infrastructure projects, a little over €2 billion of which is on transport projects.  The budgetary process will determine what we spend on them next year.I have laid out my priorities on transport.  The two major projects I want to see advanced are the interconnector and the metro, which will take six years to complete rather than the three and a half years we talked about.  Money is and will be required for both projects from this year on.Ironically, the fact that the interconnector and metro will take longer than expected to complete, for environmental and design reasons, will ensure that the next phases of the western rail corridor and the Navan line will proceed on time and perhaps a little ahead of time.  It is an ill wind than blows no good.I constantly stress the importance of capital investment, the capital programme and the transport programme to my colleagues.  Deputy Broughan is quite right in his reference to the spread of expenditure.  Next year will see the last of the payments.  While the motorway schemes will be completed in 2010, some payments pertaining to them will come out of the 2011 budget.  From then on and given the coming on line of the metro and interconnector and the continuation of the electrification of the Kildare line, the pendulum will swing back in favour of public transport rather than roads.  That will continue until 2015.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	263	I noticed in the 2010 Estimates that a payment of approximately €66 million is being made in respect of PPPs.  The Minister's civil servants told us when considering the Estimates that it is expected the payment will rise to approximately €600 million per annum as the big projects are developed over the years until 2015.  Given that PPPs will be involved in some of the major public transport projects informed by the Minister's policy, what impact will this have on the budgetary position for 2011?  Journalists talk about costs of €3 billion to €5 billion for metro north.  Must this be the annual impact or will the costs be spread over 20, 30 or 40 years?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	264	The repayments will be spread over a number of years.  Some of the earlier projects had a repayment lifetime of 25 years while those for some of the later projects can be up to 40, 45 or even 50 years.  We obtained approximately €2 billion from private sector investment in the roads system.  It must be repaid over time.  The discussion that will arise, certainly over the coming years, will concern whether it will be part of the normal Estimates process in the Vote of the Department of Transport or whether we should devise a mechanism whereby the money would be paid from the central Exchequer.  This has not yet been decided.  Either way, the money must be repaid.  If it is to be paid by the Department of Transport, in the way repayments are made by the Departments of Education and Skills, and Health and Children, it must be provided for in the Estimates each year.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	265	The Dublin Airport Authority has statutory responsibility for the operation of Dublin Airport.While the Government mandated Dublin Airport Authority to develop terminal 2 and undertake the other elements of the current investment programme as part of a long-term strategy for investing in the airport's capacity, airport operational issues such as the number of airlines that will use terminal 2 are the responsibility of the Dublin Airport Authority.With regard to a charge for passengers using terminal 2, the Commission for Aviation Regulation regulates airport charges levied at Dublin Airport.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	266	The key problem is that terminal 2 cost over €600 million to build.  The Minister commenced an operation in his Department to have competitive tendering for the right to run the terminal.  In that context, Dublin Airport Authority did not have to go through the initial phase.  It entered at the second stage and was in a position to compete against any player successful in the first phase.  At least three significant international players in airport management, many of whose airports are much bigger than Dublin Airport, entered the first phase but none of them came through the process.  This meant Dublin Airport Authority had no competitor to take on the running of terminal 2.  Will the Minister clarify whether he then decided that if a sufficiently strong business case could be put to the authority by the Department, he would fix or agree on an operational cost?  The key point is this: there is no clarity about how many international airlines will use terminal 2 and we must get a return for our money.  How can the Minister drive that agenda forward given the monopoly position of Dublin Airport Authority which, without competition, will decide what it will charge?

The regulator forensically goes through the plan and decides, on the basis of it, what he will allow to be charged against the cost, what expenses are allowed, whether it is being operated in an efficient manner or whether there is "fat" in the system, etc.  After every determination — I have been in this position for a couple of them — the airport is never satisfied and the airlines are never satisfied.  At this stage, it is probably reasonable to argue that the regulator gets it reasonably right.  If Dublin Airport Authority is inefficient or ineffective, the regulator is there to ensure that it does not get rewarded for that.In fairness to Dublin Airport Authority's management and union, they have sat down and agreed new fairly radical work practices, changes, etc., which make their operations much more effective and they will be carrying those practices into terminal 2.  In a situation where there is only one airport, it is regulated and the regulator looks after the competition element.On the competition that was run, the method chosen was to ask the Dublin Airport Authority to give its price, to ask others to bid and if another's price was cheaper than the Dublin Airport Authority, if the other had a legal bid in, then the other would get it automatically.We did not get beyond the first stage of that, as I explained previously in this House.  Deputy O'Dowd is correct that there were quite a number of operators who applied for this, but none of them met the financial or other criteria laid down.  I had no choice but to make the decision to allow Dublin Airport Authority confirm to me that it could do this within the regulated price, and at this stage it has done so.

He acknowledged, as we all do, that there were international players and it does not make sense that they failed the test they were put through.  I am not saying there was anything but a bone fide assessment of that.  It does not make sense that people who run multiple international airports right around the world did not pass an assessment.  None of them passed it.  That does not make sense when they are already doing the job elsewhere.  I am not suggesting there was anything mischievous or wrong in the assessment or the tests themselves.It does not make sense that none of these guys could get through.  We do not know the prices they quoted.  We do not know whether or not these major international companies would have been cheaper than the DAA.  That is the crux of the issue, that after all of this process there is no competition and we do not know why these major international companies fell at a particular fence.  As I understand it, although I do not have full knowledge of this, it was not on their ability to run an airport, their financial structure or their organisational capacity that they did not pass.  It does not make sense.I would be concerned at the present situation.  Notwithstanding the regulator, how can one benchmark a company that is a State monopoly?  Against what is the regulator benchmarking the DAA, except the operation of these private companies in other international airports?  It is a mess and the problem is there is an inadequate number of other airlines who would use it for international travel and they are not committed to going into it as a result.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	271	To my knowledge, there are no legal contracts entered into in the case of terminal 2 but that is only because discussions have not terminated.On Deputy O'Dowd's other point, this process was an unusually one, not one on which people have a firm grasp.  We had independent advisers advising us on this.  We set down a certain number of criteria which bidders had to meet in order to be able to submit a tender.  It did not get to the tender stage.  They had to satisfy what was like an expression of interest for the tender.While some of the companies of which we speak were involved in running airports in other countries, in some cases the financial backup was not being provided by these international companies to the companies or sub-companies which were bidding, and financial criteria did play a large part in this in that we were not satisfied.

If one of the big international operators submitted an expression of interest in this, and it was the international branch of the firm that did so, I am sure it would have met the financial criteria, but that is not the way they did it.  They had subsidiary companies bidding and some of them did not meet the financial criteria.  The criteria they had to meet were clearly laid out and none of them met the criteria.  There was no choice in this.  Deputy O'Dowd is not privy to the detail of it, but they did not meet the criteria.  Particularly with the strong advice that I got, there was no way that I could ignore criteria set down that were independently adjudicated on.  Once the criteria were not met, one could not go ahead with the tender.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	274	I have been briefed by Dublin Bus on the strategic overview of the bus network review.The objective of the redesign of the Dublin Bus network is to provide current and future bus customers with a service that will be modern, accessible, integrated, easy to understand, punctual and frequent.The redesign, which will commence in July 2010 and proceed on a phased basis at two to three month intervals, will deliver real and tangible benefits to the vast majority of bus users.  These benefits include: an improved traffic flow in the city centre; a doubling of the number of services with a frequency of ten minutes or better; 60% of customers will be served by high frequency services as opposed to 23% at present; a reduced layover of buses in the city centre resulting in improved traffic flows and an enhanced city centre environment; increased interchange opportunities with DART, and heavy and light rail; and more cross-city services.The redesigned network will be supported by complimentary measures such as integrated ticketing and real-time passenger information.These measures will result in the provision of high quality and efficient public bus services and reflect the commitment of the company to deliver better services at better value to the customer and taxpayer.It is a matter for Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann, within the resources available to them from fare revenue and from the National Transport Authority for loss making public service obligation services, to decide on service levels and changes to services.

The public generally is still gravely concerned.  First and foremost, it seems difficult to imagine that one can run a better service with the loss of 90 buses and 150 drivers.The cutbacks this year are on top of cutbacks that the Minister forced on the company in previous years.  For many, understanding how this could happen is difficult if there are to be fewer buses——
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	276	Could we have a question, please?  Supplemental questions are not about imparting information.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	277	How can this be done?  For example, the Nipper service is being withdrawn from different parts of the city.  Is the Network Direct project — I have the first three corridors in mind, namely, Dún Laoghaire, Blanchardstown and Lucan — not influenced by the fact that the PSO has been cut back by the Minister so significantly?  This is an attempt to dress up the cutback.The first direct route networks, located in the Finglas area, were proposed by Deloitte.  I expressed a concern about the Deloitte report at a meeting of the transport committee, namely, that some commuters would be left with a significant walk to a bus.  Instead of being five or seven minutes away, one could be ten or 15 minutes away.  Being significantly further away from a route is a serious disimprovement for seniors and parents in Dublin's districts.  Is it an attempt, at least in part, to dress up as improvements further significant cutbacks to the PSO imposed by the Minister?  Has the Minister made any proposal so that lower income communities, those most dependent on buses, will not have a less valuable service?  While a direct route might run through the community, the bulk of the community could have a disimproved service.  Is this not a great matter of concern?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	278	It would be if it were true but it is not.  We are going to double the number of routes with a frequency of ten minutes or better.  This is a considerable improvement.  Some 60% of customers will be carried on high-frequency routes, these being the ten-minute routes in each direction.  With the extra buses, some 23% are currently being carried.It is difficult for people to imagine that things can be done more efficiently and effectively.  In this country, we are slow to change and we like to stay with the tried and trusted.  However, this system will be better.  The aim is to ensure that, on average, no customer will be more than 300 metres from a bus stop.  This is due to the way in which the routes will be laid out.These are not just cutbacks dressed up.  They comprise a genuine effort to provide good value for the taxpayer because the PSO money is tighter than it was.  We cannot ask people to pay increased fares and we cannot subsidise an inefficient service.  We want to make it more efficient.  According to Deloitte, the estimated savings on the first corridor referred to by the Deputy will be as much as €3 million.  There are 14 corridors around the city and one would not save up to €3 million on each, but one could certainly save some money.  This would stay with Dublin Bus to provide an enhanced service.In fairness to them, management and unions at Bus Átha Cliath did everything they could to try to provide an effective service once the decision was made.  They believe that Deloitte's estimate on the Finglas route is slightly on the high side but they are confident they can save approximately €2.5 million on that route through the types of action we are discussing while simultaneously improving the service.  It is win-win for everyone.

Will we see them in 2011 at long last?A significant number of commuters may be 12 or 15 minutes away.  Did the Minister specify a target?  The British Government used to have targets for cities and the whole of the UK in terms of how long it took people to walk to a bus.  Has the Minister asked Dublin Bus for such a target?  In many parts of the city, including mine, one will be that bit further away on some routes.  If one is a senior or a parent walking kids to a bus, the additional inconvenience could be significant.  Dublin Bus's PSO is small relative to similar companies throughout the EU, so one can see why people are trying to make savings and be more efficient.  We all want Dublin Bus to be as efficient as possible but there is still concern that disadvantaged communities might be left worse off.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	280	Real-time passenger information will shortly be available via mobile telephone and on 500 on-street signs.  The initial phase will be delivered by the end of this year.The integrated ticketing project, integrating smartcards for Irish Rail, Luas, Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann and private bus operators, is progressing well.  A rigorous testing regime has been put in place and the project is being tested in every way possible.  We do not want to leave anything out because, if the system does not work from day one, there will be serious difficulties and the system could lose all credibility, which we do not want to occur.  Subject to successful testing, Dublin Bus and Luas annual passholders will be migrated to integrated smartcards from late summer of this year, followed by a similar exercise involving an e-purse or pay-as-you-go system, like a mobile telephone system, in respect of Dublin Bus and Luas services when the scheme has been sufficiently tested.The Deputy is right, in that there is no way to ensure everywhere currently in receipt of a service will have a better service.  A service might be a little further away in some areas, but I assure the Deputy that the certainty of when buses will arrive, the information available on them and so on will make the service a good one.  This is the way forward.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	281	The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources and are supplemented by State road grants paid by my Department.  Each year, as Minister for Transport I announce the allocation of grant funds to local authorities.  This year, a total of €411 million is being provided to local authorities for the maintenance and improvement of regional and local roads.Local authorities provided details of exceptional road-related costs that fell outside the normal financial provision for winter maintenance.  I took account of this information when deciding on the allocations for 2010.  My priority was to protect the significant investment of €6 billion in the regional and local roads network since 1997.  I decided to defer the planned rehabilitation works on regional and local roads in 2010 in order to provide greater flexibility to local authorities.  I requested that they carefully target resources to address, on a priority basis, the most urgently required repairs resulting from the extensive damage caused by the prolonged severe weather.The Exchequer grants are a supplement to expenditure by the local authorities.  I have repeatedly stressed the importance of local authorities allocating sufficient own resources for the improvement and maintenance of the regional and local roads network.  In recent times, I have received representations from a number of local authorities and public representatives seeking an increase in the funding for regional and local roads in their particular areas.  However, I must point out that all of those grants have been allocated.  In view of the current Exchequer position, no further funds are available from which additional allocations could be made in 2010.
#ShaneMcEntee	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-party	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-dob	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	282	I am always hopeful there are a few pounds somewhere.  I will still fight for that.  I take this opportunity on my behalf and on behalf of my party to congratulate the Minister, the Department, the Road Safety Authority, Mr. Noel Brett, Mr. Gay Byrne and everyone involved in road safety for receiving the award yesterday in Brussels.  The Minister accepted this on behalf of the people and he excelled in pushing things forward.  We always said our aim was to be number one and that will be the case with the support of everyone.However, on a daily basis we see a number of people on the sides of roads with punctures.  That is due to what is happening on our roads.  I saw one on the M3 the other day.  Local authorities have done everything to mend our roads after the winter but it remains a serious problem.  This will lead to serious road trouble and deaths if we do not get extra funding to continue the work done by the councils over the past four or five months.  The Minister said he looked for money.  Is it true he sought €25 million but was not given it?  Can the Minister go back for money?  Unless we fix this problem, we will go backwards in terms of progress on the number of road deaths.  I do not like to hear the Minister saying the door is closed.  Drink-driving and speed are being dealt with but road conditions are not improving.  A sum of €25 million will go a long way at the expense of any other Department.  It would be wrong for us not to seek it.  We know we cannot bring back anyone who died but we owe this to them if they died as a result of speed, drink-driving or careless driving.I ask the Minister to go back to the drawing board.  If the Minister has to rob any Department to do so, I will support him in every way.  I know what is happening and that is a major problem.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	283	I thank Deputy McEntee for his congratulations and comments on the road safety award.  I received it on behalf of everyone involved in road safety.  I thank Deputy McEntee, his party and other parties in the House, who have a share in this award.  It is important to say that and that was why I thought it was important to go and receive the award on behalf of the people of Ireland.  Everyone played a part in this — the Deputies opposite, the RSA, the Garda Síochána, officials at the Department of Transport and drivers on the roads who have changed their behaviour significantly.  I acknowledge that on their behalf.I will always seek more money if there is any hope of getting it.   I always ask the Minister for Finance for funds.  Unfortunately, we are in a financial situation that means there is no extra money rolling around in the State coffers.  The €25 million to which the Deputy referred was not a request but an estimate of the amount of damage done to national roads.  The NRA provided that estimate of damage.  Local authorities were also asked to provide estimates and submitted estimates of €180 million in damage between the floods and the severe weather.  An additional €9 million was estimated for gritting during that long period.  From the sum of €411 million, I allocated €240 million to local authorities to use specifically for the improvement of those roads.  The Deputy has acknowledged that local authorities have done a good job so far in getting to repair the roads.  I accept Deputy McEntee's point that some roads are still causing difficulties but these must be repaired from the resources of the local authority or from the allocation provided.  There is no point in holding back in the hope of getting more money because I cannot see myself getting any more money for that purpose during the course of this year.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	284	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 38 and 70 together.Since 1 December 2009, the implementation of the DART underground project is a matter under the remit of the National Transport Authority, NTA.  Officials from my Department and the NTA hold monthly monitoring meetings.  Following a request from my Department, the NTA arranged for a presentation by the DART underground team from Irish Rail to coincide with the monthly meeting on 25 May 2010.  Irish Rail advised that the change in the DART underground timetable is driven by practical and technical considerations.The first consideration is that the railway order application may take longer than originally planned.  This is based on the experience of metro north.  The second consideration is that construction and testing are now estimated to take longer than earlier projected.  This includes allowing for the extension of the project from Heuston to Inchicore and also arises from a decision to use two tunnel boring machines instead of four.  This change to fewer tunnel boring machines lessens the environmental impact of the project and reduces costs considerably.Irish Rail also advised that these are conservative estimates on the timeframe and it is possible that the PPP company may make substantial improvements to this programme by, for example, using innovative techniques.  It is also possible An Bord Pleanála can reduce the time taken to consider the railway order application, having regard to its experience on metro north.  The Government remains committed to the earliest possible start-up date and the speediest possible delivery of this project consistent with securing best value for money.  It will continue to pursue all available opportunities to shorten the delivery timescale.

The last day we had Question Time in the Dáil with the Minister, he said he was not aware of the statement by Irish Rail that the DART interconnector timetable had been significantly altered.  Who did the Minister meet from CIE that morning?  Is it true he was briefed on this issue by CIE that morning?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	286	No, that is not true.  The subject never came up.  I met the board members and the chief executive of CIE.  I try to meet the boards of companies under the aegis of the Department of Transport once a year and it was such a meeting.  In the middle of the day, I became aware of a statement issued by CIE and Deputy O'Dowd raised the matter in the House.  Deputy O'Dowd suggested CIE had changed policy and decided the opening of the project would be delayed until 2018.  Deputy O'Dowd asked if this was Government policy and I replied that it was not.  It was not Government policy then but it is a fact that in the design phase of this project, it was estimated the DART underground could be operational within four and a half years of construction.  However, when the project went into the detailed design phase, the company involved estimated the construction phase, including testing and commissioning, would take six years to complete.  That is where the matter arose.  It did not arise because of a change of policy or because CIE decided it would not follow Government policy.Government policy on this issue is that it is delivered in the shortest timeframe possible, and we are now informed this is the shortest timeframe possible.

It seemed as if he had been left in the dark by CIE.  That is certainly the impression he gave us, and the House.  How does that tally with the answer he gave to Deputy O'Dowd?The Minister gave us some information but the public expected that metro north with the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, and an interconnector with Irish Rail would go in tandem, yet we now find that metro north is much further down the road, so to speak, than the interconnector.  Has the Minister done any analysis as to the reason that should be the case?  The Minister then tells us that for environmental reasons they will use two boring machines rather than four but this would appear to be a significant reason for the delay.  How will we handle this major project if it is not done in tandem with metro north?  In terms of the stations — St. Stephen's Green and so on — we have shared facilities.  The RPA is building a box, as it calls it, for the interconnector but it seems to be haphazard.  Has the Minister confidence in Irish Rail that it can deliver this major project?On the big dig, we heard about the Broombridge line this morning.  The statue of Daniel O'Connell, our great liberator, is due to be removed from O'Connell Street in the near future to facilitate these works.  Can the Minister give us an updated report now from the big dig committee?  What is the position regarding the big dig committee?  It appears that, because of the slowness of the interconnector, we may be getting into a position where we will have chaos in the centre of Dublin for over a decade rather than a smart building programme over three or four years, which would get it done quickly.  Incidentally, I understand there is no chance of having metro north completed by the anniversary of the seminal event in 1916 which led to the foundation of our State.  Work will be ongoing on it when, hopefully, we will all be present outside the GPO for that ceremony.  It all seems very vague.  The Minister appeared to be flabbergasted that day and I wonder what happened?  What did they do to him?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	289	Whether I was flabbergasted is the Deputy's interpretation.  I made it clear there was no policy change because the question put to me by the Deputy was that the statement CIE had made had changed the policy.  I made it clear that CIE does not make policy; the Department and the Minister make policy.  As I said at the time, I was not aware of the statement before it was made, which is not the normal protocol with CIE on operational matters such as this one and, therefore, from that point of view, that was a breach of protocol as far as I was concerned but I was not flabbergasted.  I was at pains to point out that it was Government that decided the policy on this issue.  The Deputy might want to put down a specific question on that.If I meet somebody when I arrive to visit a State agency, even the person on reception, I will always say hello to them.  My recollection is that is what I did that morning.  I probably met a few personnel from Heuston Station.  I met with the board.  A number of officials were waiting to brief the board on whatever was on the agenda on that particular day.  They were the people I met on the day.  I had conversations with all of them but I did not have meetings with people and discuss interconnectors or anything else.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	290	As indicated to the Deputy in my reply to Question No. 77 of 5 May 2010, the annual report and accounts of the Dublin Airport Authority for 2009 were published on 27 April and were lodged in the Library of the Houses of the Oireachtas the same day.I noted that falling passenger numbers caused by the recession led to the Dublin Airport Authority's gross profit reducing by 10% on the previous year.  The Dublin Airport Authority's group profit in 2009, excluding exceptional items, was €38 million as compared to €78 million in 2008.Despite the 2009 results, I welcome the continuing efforts of the company to achieve efficiencies in the current difficult market conditions.  The success of the company's cost recovery programme reflects well on the contribution that employees can make to the Dublin Airport Authority's financial performance and to enhancing its ability to operate the airports more efficiently in the future.The recent appointment of a chief operating officer is an organisational matter for the Dublin Airport Authority and I have no function in the matter.In line with normal shareholder contacts, I met with the board and management of the company on 14 May last and discussed with them strategic issues and the company's plans for the future.

The debt it has now is closer to €1 billion, which is a great deal of money.  The company paid its chief executive officer €638,500 in 2009.  It appears many people are very well paid in this company.  Sixteen directors were paid €187,000 in fees.  The chairman will get almost €20,000 per annum.  The point is that these people are very well paid but they are not producing the goods.  They are losing money and they need a radical shake-up.  The approach of the Government and the Minister is not challenging them sufficiently.  I am aware these are difficult times for the airport authority but it is clear that while the executives are very well paid, they are not producing the goods on the ground.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	292	I would not agree with the Deputy.  The group operating profit before exceptional items was €62.7 million.  When the exceptional items are included, it recorded a loss of €13 million.  The two exceptional items were in respect of the DAA's cost recovery programme.  It spent money on trying to ensure improvements were made to all aspects of the operation of the airport.  That cost approximately €46.5 million.  There was a charge of €11.3 million on an asset impairment.  The first year it made a loss after exceptional items, and it would be unfair to say the Dublin Airport Authority is not doing a good job.  We are in the throes of a major problem internationally in the aviation sector.  The number of passengers passing through the airport fell significantly.  That is not a direct fault of the Dublin Airport Authority but a direct result of the general economic position we are experiencing.  It will have a sizeable debt.  That is on the basis of providing top quality, top class infrastructure at the airport for passengers and customers generally.  It is unfair to say that these people, some of whom are high profile and would not be making money on the basis of a €12,000 fee, are not doing their job.

#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	297	The Minister acknowledged that in 2009 overall passenger traffic was down.  At Shannon Airport it was down 23%, while in Europe and the UK it was down 13% and 7% respectively.The Minister meanwhile has shelved plans for granting autonomy to Shannon Airport management until 2011.  This is unacceptable for the airport's management as it is forced to work with one hand tied behind its back.  In the past the airport performed well when management could make its own decisions, particularly in the time of Brendan O'Regan and Liam Skelly.  However, a conflict of interest between the Dublin Airport Authority and Shannon Airport has arisen.  For example, the Dublin Airport Authority would like to have the Lynxs cargo company locate in Dublin when Shannon is vying for it too.Does the Minister plan to address this structural deficit or will he continue to leave Shannon Airport management in limbo?  It is to the detriment of the airport that its management cannot make its own decisions.

Due to the severe economic downturn and its effects on the international aviation industry, the chairs, boards and management of the various airports requested me to postpone the planned separation of the Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports from the one authority.  They believed it would not be prudent considering the economic positions in which they found themselves.Next year, it is intended to examine the various possibilities for separation.  I will listen carefully to the board and management of Shannon Airport if they want it to be separated from the Dublin Airport Authority to run their own affairs.  Their decision will carry much weight with me, so long as everyone knows the consequences of such a move.

#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	308	The Minister misunderstood my question but I believe he knows where I am coming from.  It is about Shannon Airport management making its own decisions without having to go back to the Dublin Airport Authority for approval.  There is a conflict of interest when it comes to both airports trying to attract new investment projects reporting to the one authority.

Some people would like to have no responsibility and just access to the cash.  I am not saying that applies to Shannon Airport management.  However, a subsidiary company cannot be able to spend moneys belonging to its parent company unless it is prepared to take responsibility.  The structure is not in place in the Dublin Airport Authority for this.  If we do agree to separate the airports, it will mean Shannon becomes responsible for all of its decisions, generating its own income and ensuring its own survival.

It is getting the balance right that is important.Next year, I would be open to the airports deciding to take the route of separation from the Dublin Airport Authority.

Is that appropriate for a State company?Is he concerned the authority was involved in a property development company, Turckton Developments, with Liam Carroll's group, Dunloe Ewart, which has substantial liabilities to a building society of €34 million?  Did the Minister approve of this or examine——

While I commend it on its work on terminal 2, the fact it is involved in this development company, Turckton Developments, raises some concerns.Mr. Declan Collier, chief executive officer at Dublin Airport Authority, will appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport this afternoon.  His overall remuneration package last year came to over €600,000 while his basic salary is €348,000.  Does that accord with the guidelines rightly laid down by the Government on executives' salaries in semi-State bodies, given the overall national fiscal position?

I am not aware it has broken any procurement laws or otherwise.  If the authority wants to set up subsidiary companies, a general policy is in place that they cannot be a drain on the main company and must operate separately to it.  It also cannot add to the costs of passenger travel, well supervised by the regulator.  I am not aware the authority is in breach of any laws.

A project schedule with key milestones has been established and the project is being progressed in accordance with that schedule.  To date, the second key milestone has been achieved, that is, the identification of the preferred route.  Overall, the expected completion date of the project is July 2015.

It was agreed at the time that there would be a dual carriageway from Derry to Dublin.  There is a missing piece and I seek clarification on the situation.  In particular, I refer to the road from Aughnacloy to Castleshane, which is still a difficult main road but not a dual carriageway.  Will the Minister indicate the progress, if any, that has been made and whether he will be in a position to fund the NRA to ensure that section of the road will be improved such that there will be a through road from Donegal and Derry to Dublin?

At the moment, the NRA is reviewing all the road projects identified for the coming five to ten years and the matter will be considered in the context of that review.  It will be based on a range of criteria, including the likely traffic numbers on the road etc.  The matter is under review.  When the review is finished, the NRA will be in contact with the Department and, when necessary, the subject of funding will be dealt with in the annual Estimates process.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	319	What is the Minister's view on this matter?  Does he accept that it is not reasonable or sensible to have a dual carriageway from Derry to Aughnacloy but not have a link up with the two and one road at Castleshane?  Development will depend on the Minister and his Department being prepared to fund the NRA.  What is the Minister's view on a common sense approach and the urgency of the matter?
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	320	I support the views of Deputy Crawford.  The A5 project is an exciting and interesting development, linking Derry to Dublin, one of our great cities.  I support Deputy Crawford's comments.  At issue is the Ashbourne road on our side.  The area in question is near the Ceann Comhairle's territory as well.  As Deputy Crawford remarked, we did not see the gap and the NRA maintains it has nothing on the matter.  We support Northern Ireland in this regard but we must look after our side of the road.  Will the Minister urge the NRA to come forward with the necessary plans to ensure we are ready to meet up at Aughnacloy?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	321	I would be pleased to receive anything from the NRA but I will not pre-empt what it decides as the best way to link the two roads.  That should be done in the most cost effective and efficient way possible and I await the NRA's proposal in this regard.  It would be unfair of me to pre-empt the matter.  I am not an engineer.  I foresee there will be a good deal of traffic involved and I have no doubt, given the expertise the NRA has, that it will take that fully into account before making a proposal to me.  Once the proposal is made to me and the Department, I will have to prioritise the projects I believe are the most important.  This is an important project.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

The matters raised by Deputies Margaret Conlon, Michael McGrath, Deirdre Clune and Olivia Mitchell and Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin have been selected for discussion.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	323	I made some remarks before the debate was adjourned and I intend to offer further clarification in this regard.  I refer to section 40B.  Deputy Shatter raised the issue of what "without delay" means.  It must be read in the context of the section which places an obligation on the HSE to monitor and keep under review occurrences and developments concerning matters relating to its objects and functions.  Given the requirement to monitor and keep such matters under review, there should be no reason for delay.  In any case if there is a delay, the Minister can invoke section 40C and require the HSE to provide information within a period which would be defined.  It was also suggested that ministerial specifications about classes of occurrences and any guidelines that may be issued should be subject to Oireachtas scrutiny.  These provisions are intended to give the necessary flexibility to the Minister to ensure the HSE is clear on the type and nature of the information required.  An analogy is drawn with section 10 of the Health Act 2004.Other proposals have been suggested for inclusion in the Bill.  However, as I remarked at the beginning of the debate, in the context of expedited legislation it is better to be as focused as possible and not to branch into areas that are not absolutely necessary.  As everyone is aware, rushed legislation can sometimes lead to bad law.  The narrower the focus, the more accurate the achievement of the aims of the Bill.I have also set out why the Government has chosen not to amend existing law on the publication of reports.  This belongs to the same category as that to which I have just referred.  The purpose of the Bill was very narrow: to provide a safe channel of communication.  This is what we set out to achieve.  Certain points raised by the Ombudsman were widely discussed in the media.  I refer to the conclusion of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children.  My intention is to seek further information through the avenue of the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2007.I refer to Deputy Shatter's freedom of information request.  The Department has undertaken a search of possible records and has identified approximately 500 electronic documents which may fall within the scope of the request and which, hopefully, will indicate the degree of intensity of my inquiries in this regard.  Nevertheless, the Deputy was provided with an estimate of the time involved, some 52 hours, to procure this information as well as the relevant cost.  It is important to remember that Ministers have no role in the determination of freedom of information requests.I thank Deputies for their contributions.  While there are issues for debate as we approach Committee and Report Stages, the Bill will help the work of the independent review group significantly.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	333	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 3, after line 32, to insert the following:"(i) any such occurrence of development that is likely to give rise to a significant risk to public health,".Any such occurrence of development that is likely to give rise to a significant risk to public health should be included in the information required of the HSE.  It should be the duty of the HSE to furnish such information.Most of us have spoken specifically about the context of the review group looking into the deaths of children in care but the scope of this legislation is much broader.  It relates to any inquiry being carried out and the duties of the HSE to supply information to whoever is carrying out the inquiry and, indeed, to the Minister, so it goes beyond inquiries.There are certain instances where the Minister will request information or where it is the opinion of the executive that the Minister would consider certain information significant to the performance of his or her functions.  We should also include this other category of information which is likely to cause significant risk to public health.In some ways, it is self-explanatory.  I would have thought it would have been something with which the Minister would not have had a problem in so far as it would be in the public interest that the HSE would inform the Minister of any information which is likely to give rise to a risk to public health.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	334	Section 40B states that the executive shall monitor and keep under review occurrences and developments concerning matters relating to its object and functions, as Deputy O'Sullivan said.  It is a much broader remit than the specific attempt by the Bill to enable the independent review group to receive information via the Minister from the executive.  It also provides that, without delay, it shall furnish the Minister with information regarding any such occurrence or development that, in the opinion of the executive, the Minister is likely to consider significant for the performance of his or her functions and as such the section has been very widely framed in order to capture all significant occurrences across the health system rather than having an exhaustive list in the legislation.  For example, one could be dealing with patient safety, primary care or public health, as Deputy O'Sullivan suggested in the amendment, which states: "any such occurrence of development that is likely to give rise to a significant risk to public health."Accordingly, acceptance of the amendment, while desirable in its own right, would simply raise the question of the need to specify more specific areas with the result that it might be inferred that any area not specified was not of significance.  I am happy that the text in section 40B(1)(ii) provides for the eventualities the Deputy's amendment proposes to capture in an appropriate manner and, therefore, I am not disposed towards accepting the amendment.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	335	There are more important areas in this legislation which we need to discuss, so I do not want to spend too much time on this one.  It would be helpful and would add to the Bill if this was specifically included.  I understand the Minister of State's point that the wording in section 40B(1) is very general and it can include risk to public health.I will not press the amendment on the basis that this is a wide element of the legislation and we want to spend as much time as possible on the areas of particular concern.

It would save duplication.  Amendment No. 4a is on the additional list circulated.  I think it would make sense.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	339	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 4, line 14, to delete "guidelines" and substitute "directions".I do not have any difficulty with Deputy Shatter's amendment.  My amendment proposes to tighten up the Minister's powers in regard to the furnishing of information and regular reporting of information by the HSE.  Amendment No. 2 proposes to use the term "directions" rather than "guidelines" because it is essential a Minister or Minister of State uses his or her political power in regard to these matters.  The term "guidelines" may or may not be implemented but the term "directions" is much more definite in regard to the power of the Minister.We really should not have to do this.  The Minister should be able to get whatever information he or she requires in the interests of the public from the executive which is meant to implement the policy direction of the Minister.  In a sense, it is quite farcical that we must introduce legislation to give a Minister of Government the power to tell an executive, which the Government has set up to implement its policies, that it must give certain information and provide certain documents to the Minister who, in turn, can pass them on to an expert group.  It is really farcical in a democracy that we have to do this.  We should use much tighter language in terms of the powers of the Minister.  That is why I propose the term "directions" rather than "guidelines".Amendment No. 4 also proposes the term "directions" rather than "guidelines" while amendment No. 3 inserts the following: "including as to the timing, manner and content of the furnishing of such information."  It extends the power of the Minister to require regular reporting and to identify the way the Minister wants this information to be reported.  Essentially, it gives the power to the Minister rather than leaving it in the hands of the HSE.Unfortunately, the Minister for Health and Children constantly hides behind the HSE in terms of answering questions and taking responsibility for the debacles which happen in the health service.  When something goes wrong we are told it is not a matter for the Minister but for the HSE.  Similarly, we still get answers to parliamentary questions stating that the Minister cannot answer them and that the questions have been referred to the HSE.If we can redress in this legislation the power relationship between the Minister for Health and Children and the HSE, then we will be doing a good day's work.  However, when it comes to such important matters as files relating to the deaths of children being handed over to an independent review group which has been given the job of producing a report and recommendations, then it is vital that the Minister is as powerful and strong as possible in terms of his or her relationship with the HSE.  It must be a relationship in which the Minister is the dominant person, not the HSE.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	340	These are important amendments and this particular section with which we are dealing, which is the new section 40B to go into the Health Act 2004, is very important because it starkly illustrates the disconnect between the Minister for Health and Children, the Ministers of State in that Department, the Department itself and the HSE.Deputy Jan O'Sullivan is absolutely right that, as other speakers have also said, it is quite ludicrous that in circumstances of a constitutional democracy, where there is a Minister responsible to this House for our health services, that special emergency legislation — this is what this is — needs to be enacted to compel the HSE to simply keep the Minister informed of important developments in the health service and in the child care services.It is quite extraordinary that we have in government a Minister for Health and Children who steered the legislation which established the HSE and who has been intentionally blind to the defects in that legislation for five years.  Frankly, and I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State for whom I have a great deal of time, despite the difficulties I give him on occasion, we have a senior Minister who has so little respect for the Dáil that she is not present for this Bill, which is not just about children.  It is about the political and accountability disconnect between the Minister and a quango, the HSE, which was deliberately established to immunise government from responsibility for things that go wrong.With regard to Deputy O'Sullivan's amendments, I can sympathise with her wish to replace the word "guidelines" with the word "direction".  Initially, it was my view that we should do that as well because I am conscious, as I have no doubt the Minister of State is, that we have the Children First child protection "guidelines", which he never fails to tell us are robust.  However, they are only as robust as they are implemented.  They have been in place since 1999 but they are still not implemented and applied by the HSE.  The executive has an appallingly scandalous and catastrophic record of failure to implement guidelines.  It is a consequence of its failure to do so that so many children in the care system died, particularly those who did not die from natural causes, and so many children about whom many concerns were expressed died.  If the child protection guidelines had been uniformly applied and properly followed, many of the children who are now the subject of the inquiry by the review group might still be alive.The guidelines produced about child protection services, despite my calling for them to be made statutory many years ago, have never been anything other than a wish list from the Department of principles and approaches to be applied in protecting children.  A statutory obligation was never imposed to comply with the guidelines.  Where subsection (2) in the new section 40(B) differs is a statutory obligation is imposed on the Executive.  It states: "The Minister may issue guidelines in relation to the furnishing of information under subsection (1) and, if he or she does so, the Executive shall comply with those guidelines".  The nature of the statutory obligation is that which should long ago have applied to the child protection guidelines and I presume this will feature in the legislation promised before the end of the year in regard to them.  I am not sure whether it makes any difference whether they are called "directions" or "guidelines" because what is important is there is a statutory obligation to comply with them.What happens if the Executive fails to fulfil its statutory obligation and fails to comply?  This is one of the lacunas in the Bill.  If the Minister issues guidelines and the HSE fails to comply with them, what happens next?  There is nothing in the Bill to indicate what happens next.  Will people lose their jobs?  It is highly unlikely based on the many scandalous failures within the HSE, which, to date, have not resulted in anyone being rendered unemployed.  Will a fine be imposed on the HSE?  Will the person or individuals who did not comply with the guidelines be the subject of inquiry?  Will there be a statutory process?  This is one of the many reasons this Bill is flawed.This is a well intended provision.  It is an outrage that we enacted legislation to create the HSE without these obligations being imposed on it but there is no point in saying someone is obliged to do something if there is no sanction if he or she fails to do it and no procedure to come to terms with such failure.  If guidelines are not complied with, there is not even a guarantee that anyone will ever be told because there is no provision in the Bill for publication of the guidelines.  We will not know when guidelines have issued or what their content is and no member of the House or the public will have a reason to know whether there has been a failure to comply with them unless there is another catastrophic revelation of that failure having a serious impact on the lives of one or more individuals.  There is no transparency in this and that is another defect.  This is not an issue about which one needs confidentiality.  If there are guidelines about the furnishing of the type of information specified in the legislation, which relates to occurrences and developments in the health service of importance and of public interest and in the child care services, at the very minimum, they should be published and, for example, if they are breached and if we had time to do it in the context of this legislation, there should be an annual report to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children and it should be laid before this House detailing the areas in which the HSE in any particular year failed to comply with guidelines issued.  This would bring transparency but that is not in the Bill.Amendment No. 4a seeks to insert two subsections following section 40B(2).  The first states: “(3) Any guidelines issued by the Minister pursuant to this section shall be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas upon issuing and shall be the subject of debate in each House and amenable to amendment by a motion passed in each House within 3 months of being so laid”.  That would bring transparency to the guidelines.  It would ensure their publication and that Members have an input into them.  I assume they will be carefully prepared by the Minister for Health and Children or her successor and most times will be simply accepted in the House.  However, there may be occasions that Members could valuably contribute to beefing them up and that should be open in a parliamentary democracy to some form of discussion in the national Parliament because this relates to the running of our health service.  The guidelines are principles to be applied by the HSE.I believe it is reasonable that the guidelines be published and laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas in order that Members of both Houses have an opportunity to propose amendments, which the Government of the day may accept depending on the nature of the amendments proposed.  That would be to the advantage of the Minister.  It is important that what is in these guidelines is publicly known.  For example, to whom will the Minister give the guidelines?  Will they simply go to Professor Brendan Drumm and be put in a drawer in his office or will they go to his successor?  How widely will they be distributed within the HSE?  Will they go to middle management?  Will they go to every employee of the HSE?  Will all the medical, nursing, social services and other personnel working within the executive be furnished with copies of the guidelines in order that if there is an occurrence of importance about which the Minister should be informed within their area of responsibility, that is communicated to someone in an appropriate management position in the HSE for communication to the Minister?  How will he or she ever know whether proper communication is operating in this context?  What will be the line of communication?  We know that, within the HSE, communications are seriously dysfunctional.I say this because, in principle, I welcome the legislation, but I want it to be more than just decoration and headlines.  I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to accepting amendment No. 4a, which would result in the addition of subsections (3) and (4) to section 40B of the principal Act.  The proposed subsection (4) states: “Any specification by the Minister in respect of an occurrence or development pursuant to subsection (1)(b)(ii) herein shall be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas by the Minister within 7 days of being furnished to the Executive.”The current section 40B(2) makes provision for requiring the HSE not only to monitor and keep under review occurrences and developments concerning matters relating to its objects and functions, which are basically to provide a health service and a child care service, but also to furnish the Minister with information without delay.  It also allows the Minister to obtain information regarding any other occurrence or development that falls within a class of occurrences or developments of public interest or concern that have been specified in writing by the Minister.There are two routes here: the Minister publishes guidelines with which the HSE has an obligation to comply — although, if it fails to do so, it does not appear to me that a whole heap happens — and, if there are other occurrences or developments that could be of public interest or concern, the Minister can specify these to the HSE to require, essentially, that she be kept up to date with what is going on.  Under my second amendment, any such specifications should be laid before both Houses.  In other words, there should be transparency, with the Minister making known to the general public and elected Members of both Houses the matters of concern about which she has asked to be kept informed.This Bill entirely lacks such transparency.  That is another reason it is defective.  It should be about more than private communications between the HSE and the Minister; it should provide for people to be kept informed and for the Minister to be facilitated with regard to political accountability to the House.  This is the ideal expressed for the Bill in the explanatory memorandum, which states: "The purpose of the Bill is to strengthen the legislative base for the provision of information by the Health Service Executive to the Minister for Health and Children so as to enhance the Minister's ability to fulfil his or her role and functions (including political accountability to the Oireachtas) and to create a ‘safe channel of communication' for sensitive information between the HSE and the Minister."  However, nowhere in the Bill are the words "political accountability" used.  Political accountability means that the Minister has an obligation to tell Members of the House — and, through Members, the general public — about events that have occurred that are of concern and about information that has been sought from the HSE.I promise I will not speak at such length on other issues, but this is a fundamental aspect of the Bill, which I believe is well intentioned.  However, no matter what work is being done behind the scenes, this Bill has been rushed out with the ultimate intention of forcing the HSE to keep the Minister and her colleagues in Government informed about what is going on in the health and child care services.  With all the disasters over which this Government and its predecessor have presided, the one lesson it has taken five years to learn is that the HSE does not keep Ministers informed about what is happening in the health and child care services; that, far too frequently, issues the Government believes are being addressed are not; and that disasters that occur are often concealed from the Government.  This is a direct consequence of the catastrophic failure to ensure proper lines of communication and accountability when the legislation was first enacted in 2004 to create the HSE.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	341	A number of matters were raised with regard to the four amendments under discussion.  Deputy O'Sullivan began by saying that none of this should be necessary, and there is a grain of truth in that.  It should not be necessary to extract information from an agency of the State under any circumstances.  However, in the case of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, it was clearly required that we create a statutory obligation for a person — in that case the Garda Commissioner — to provide information to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The HSE is required to keep the Minister informed of matters under the Health Act 2004.  What this Bill attempts to do is to create a much stronger obligation on the HSE to do this.  The human condition being what it is — all of us are human — such measures are sometimes required.It is essential to ensure that all staff in the biggest organisation in the State are aware of their obligations to keep the Minister for Health and Children and me informed; in turn, we can keep the Oireachtas informed.  The core purpose of this is to improve the accountability of the HSE to the Minister and of the Minister to the Oireachtas.  Having said that, it is impossible for the Minister to micro-manage the daily affairs of the HSE, although I am not suggesting this is being proposed by either speaker.The issue of the Tallaght X-ray cases which arose in March came to media attention through a whistleblower who himself said that no blame could possibly attach to the Minister in these circumstances, although the political system and the media, as its camp followers, tried to implicate her.  Fine Gael's own deputy leader — sorry, I am getting ahead of myself; I meant to say leader — described these events at the time as a national catastrophe.  I remember him using those words, but it has not been spoken of since.  The average national catastrophe usually has a news cycle of longer than one week.  However, that is the standard of terminology under which events are described as scandalous or catastrophic — words that easily trip off the tongue.We must be clear that we are dealing with a large organisation that works with the most vulnerable people, those who are sick and those who have disabilities.  It has a staff of more than 100,000.  The criticism that goes with running such an organisation and trying to ensure accountability must be borne by anybody involved in it, but there must be a change in the terminology that is sometimes used if we want to be fair, honest and generous about the attempts that are being made to improve things.It was not me who stated that the Children First guidelines were robust.  The review conducted by Helen Buckley in 2008 concluded that they were robust.  It was the Deputy's position at that time that mandatory reporting should be introduced.  Obviously, when the evidence changes, one is entitled to change one's mind, but now everyone accepts that the proper way to proceed is to put those guidelines on a statutory footing, and that is what I intend to do.Subsection (2) of section 40B is intended to ensure the Minister can, if she wishes, give guidance on how the HSE is to provide information.  This includes the manner of provision and the content of the information, as is proposed by Deputy O'Sullivan in amendment No. 3.  Subsection (1) of section 40B imposes a duty on the HSE to provide information of the type specified in the subsection to the Minister without delay.  The purpose of subsection (2), therefore, is not to direct that such information be provided, since the substantive requirement is contained in subsection (1).The provision is intended to ensure flexibility, so that the information required is provided in a way that best meets the needs of the Minister.  Accordingly, "guidelines" rather than "directions" is considered appropriate.  In any event, any guidelines must be complied with.  As Deputy Shatter mentioned, the issue is ultimately one of terminology and it probably makes no difference.On the question of timing, the section already requires that the information is to be provided without delay as set out in section 40C(1).  I am, therefore, satisfied that the current text meets the concerns of Deputy Jan O'Sullivan in that regard.With regard to amendment No. 4a, Deputy Shatter suggested that the guidelines issued about class of occurrences and development in any guidelines that may be issued under section 40B(2) should be subject to Oireachtas scrutiny.  I disagree because these provisions are intended to give the necessary flexibility to the Minister to ensure the HSE is quite clear on the nature and type of information she requires under section 40B.  They are not, therefore, the same as directions under section 10 of the Health Act 2004, which requires a copy of any directions to be laid before both Houses.  In any case, all of these documents are available under freedom of information legislation.  Deputy Shatter, in spite of the cost——

These documents are available under freedom of information as long as they do not belong in a certain category of documents which are not available under freedom of information for whatever reason.

While one might genuflect at the altar of transparency too easily, one can do that at the cost of having frank and proper deliberation of important issues of Government and the development of public policy in a way that can be restricted by freedom of information from time to time.  This is the basic principle of Cabinet confidentiality.  If it were to be held in a Big Brother scenario where everyone could watch the proceedings, there might not be the proper exchanges one would expect in those circumstances.The question was asked about what sanctions exist.  Ultimately, the purpose of the mandatory duty to comply is to try to improve the quality and timing of the information provided by the HSE to the Minister.  Ultimately, there is a sanction which is that a board may be removed under section 14 of the Health Act, but one would hope that this would not be required too often.  The general purpose of this section is to improve the general culture of the transposition of information to the Minister and, in turn, to the Oireachtas, in order to improve accountability.  For those reasons I do not intend to accept these amendments.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	346	I cannot help thinking of the reasons Ms Justice Laffoy resigned from the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and was replaced by Mr. Justice Ryan.  She could not get information out of the Department of Education and Science even though this was a statutory commission of inquiry.  She was so frustrated with the difficulties in getting the information she needed that she decided she needed to resign and she did this publicly.  It is all very well to establish a culture with regard to the transfer of information but it is important that the language is very precise with regard to what is required.  This is the reason I am looking for the word, "direction" rather than "guidelines" and I am looking for the power to be given to the Minister to specify the timing and manner and content of the furnishing of the information.The phrase "as soon as possible" might sound reasonable to anybody in normal circumstances but it can also be an excuse for not furnishing information and saying it is not possible to furnish it within a certain timeframe.  We need to word this section as tightly as possible to ensure that the information required is given, is handed to the Minister and subsequently to the independent review group.  From experiences like the one I have cited with regard to the Laffoy commission, there is a danger that such a large organisation, and particularly in the area of child protection because of the shortage of social workers, is under all kinds of pressure to do all kinds of things and might decide it is not possible to provide this information all that quickly.  It might decide these are only guidelines so therefore it will just provide a certain amount of information.  It might consider these are only guidelines on what it needs to do rather than being statutory requirements.We are framing legislation and this is not a case of just having a chat about what we think should be done with regard to this issue.  We are framing statute law that will oblige certain things to happen.  It is, therefore, important to get the language right, that it is as tight as possible and that there is no wriggle room or opportunity for any organisation to decide it cannot provide the information as quickly as it is needed by the Minister or that it can only provide certain items of information and not others.This legislation deals with children and we are talking here about the deaths of children in care.  We must ensure that the independent review group gets what it needs in a timely fashion and that the report is published in a timely fashion and is available to the public.  We must ensure that in the future we can develop a system in which people can feel confident that the most vulnerable children in our society are genuinely in care when they are in the care of the State and that they are not subject to some of the scandalous things that have happened to some of the children that have been in the so-called care of the State.  We must get the wording absolutely tight and right in this Bill.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	347	I will respond briefly to the Minister of State.  I want to come back to amendment 4a.  The Minister of State’s response was a little tautological.  He does not want to publish the guidelines because they are really between him and the HSE, but the guidelines, at any rate, can be accessed, according to the Minister of State, through the freedom of information legislation.  However, if one looks for the guidelines under freedom of information legislation, there is a possibility one will not get them because they will be regarded as confidential.  I am not sure what any of that means.  That is a summary of what the Minister of State said to me about it.  If the Minister of State is not prepared to lay the guidelines before both Houses of the Oireachtas for amendment, I would ask him very seriously to ensure their publication.  Guidelines directing the HSE as to what information and documentation it should provide and the circumstances in which it arises, are no more confidential than publishing guidelines for the protection of children.  If the guidelines are not published, how do the 100,000 people, whom the Minister of State describes as employed by the HSE, know what is in them?  He is not suggesting they are going to be secretly given to 100,000 people.  He is not even suggesting, I assume, that the HSE has the capacity to coherently communicate what is in the guidelines to its employees because for ten years it has not been able to communicate the child care guidelines.If this is a serious attempt by Government to ensure an organisation that has utterly failed on a whole range of crucial issues to keep Ministers and a Department informed of events is now going to change simply by the issuing of a guideline that no one sees, other than a few officials in the Department, whoever happens to be the Minister of the day and someone in the HSE headquarters, this is not going to work.  Indeed, no one should have to pay — I do not care if it is €5 or €20 — to get access to a piece of information that should be in the public domain.The Minister of State criticised the Leader of Fine Gael for referring to the X-ray scandal as a scandal and as catastrophic.  For a lot of people it was a scandal and they were concerned it could have catastrophic consequences.  We have had so many revelations of failures within our health service that emerge months after the failures have occurred, in some instances, years after the failures have occurred, and where the information is either drip-fed to the media as a consequence of a journalist getting some information or a victim of failure going public or the acts of a whistleblower, as the Minister of State describes them.  All of this has been happening because there is an ethos and culture of obsessive secrecy within the HSE and at middle and upper management levels, a cover-up mentality for fear that when things go wrong, someone might be held accountable.  Of course, the irony is that no one is ever held accountable.  This is an organisation where no one in a management position accepts accountability for everything.  Ministers and Ministers of State then say that because they cannot micromanage the service, they cannot be held accountable either.This is a philosophy of decent people whose political parties have been in Government for far too long and who are overwhelmed by an institutional ethic which believes the public should know as little as possible and by the desire to never be held accountable for anything that ever goes wrong.  It is part of what is rotten in our system of governance and it applies to the HSE.  This is not a criticism of the extraordinarily dedicated professionals working in frontline services or of some of the excellent people in middle and higher management.  Of course there are good people within the organisation — many good and dedicated people.  However, that does not take away from the fact that the structure of the organisation and the manner in which it operates has been consistently exposed to be dysfunctional in a broad range of areas, and certainly with regard to dealing with the public and issues of transparency and accountability where there are problems.If the Minister of State intends to issue guidelines on these issues, there is no coherent reason for them not to be published.  These are general guidelines.  If he has concerns because he does not want to be alarmist about something — which, ultimately, may prove not to be a real cause of concern — or concerns about publishing specifications on a particular issue before he knows the information he is seeking from the HSE, I would have some sympathy for those concerns.  The Minister of State could hear about something that would be a general cause of public alarm if it proved true and he might specify he was seeking information on it.  Then, when the information comes to him and assuming it is comprehensive, accurate and truthful, it may well be the case that there is no problem at all.  I can understand why some discreet specification about a particular issue should not necessarily be immediately published, but a general set of guidelines should be published.Deputy Jan O'Sullivan referred to the review group, as did I and other speakers.  It is important that all the information it requires is furnished to it.  When the group receives that information, who is to know how comprehensive it will be, particularly in the context of the revelations that have occurred with regard to the failure of the HSE to properly maintain files relating to children in care?  Files are maintained in a haphazard fashion, information is missing and photographs are found on the floors of storerooms with nobody knowing to which files they should be attached.  Who knows to what extent this information will be the comprehensive information required?Another defect of the Bill is the fact no statutory powers are conferred on the review group to interview or talk to individuals employed by the HSE who were involved with a particular child or young person in a care setting who has died in order to get additional information if required.  Nor is there any provision that ensures that both current and former employees of the HSE will co-operate in providing such information.  This is a huge lacuna which we will address later.I have a concern also about an issue that has not yet been addressed.  I have no doubt that when the Minister of State established the review group, he did it with the best of motives.  I know that he doubted the information he had been given at the time, because if he did not doubt it, the review group would never have been established.  The information we had been given was that 23 children had died in care and that is the information the Minister of State gave to the House.  I have no doubt — I may be able to confirm this if I can access the information through a freedom of information inquiry — that the Minister of State was vigorously trying to get the HSE to clarify that information but was coming up against a brick wall.  I have no doubt that he came into the House in good faith and told us that 23 people had died in care but thought the information was a bit dodgy and could not be relied upon and that is the reason he established the review group, to require the HSE to validate the information.  He told the House the group would complete its work by 31 December 2010.We now know that 188 people died in care, over 100 of whom died of non-natural causes.  I am concerned that the review group, which must examine all the papers and documentation and make such other inquiries as it deems appropriate, will be overwhelmed now by the volume of work it must do.  To what extent has that been considered by the Minister of State, the Government or the review group?  How can it carry out its task now?  It is quite a different matter to examine the files and papers relating to 23 deceased young people than to examine the files and papers relating to 188 young people, and possibly more if it turns out the HSE is still wrong about its figures.  Will the Minister of State say something to the House about that during the course of this discussion?

An impression that cannot be contradicted by mere fact has been created that the HSE is some monster living in a cellar somewhere that stalks the land and ——

Surveys suggest that in excess of 90% of people who have received service from the HSE have been satisfied with that service.  However, the figure representing those who feel the HSE is doing a good job is probably less than 10%.  The notion has seeped into the public mind that all of the good things that happen in the HSE happen in spite of the corporate body of the HSE.  People agree there are great people working in hospital wards, in social work and in middle management and that some of the people in higher management are well motivated, but that equity within the HSE is at an all-time low.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	352	Yes, we find it hard to sell our story.  It does not suit the narrative that is sometimes fed by comments made in the House.  Deputy Shatter is concerned about the volume of work involved for the review group.  I share his concern since the new figures were issued.  I have indicated to members of the group and in the media that I will provide the group with whatever additional resources it needs in order to complete its work.  It is an issue about which the group is concerned.  Whatever additional personnel, such as researchers, are required, we will meet those needs.I repeat my objection to the amendments.  The word "guidelines" is used specifically and deliberately to ensure that these allow the greatest flexibility possible to the HSE to provide the information.  The guidelines are distinguished from the "directions" under section 10 of the 2004 Act.  I should also make it clear that under section 40B, the executive shall provide information to the Minister without delay and shall comply with any guidelines that may be issued on the provision of information or on the class of documents the Minister specifies must be complied with.  That is a much stronger position than has been the case so far and the section can only be described as one that improves the accountability of the HSE to the Minister.  Any other interpretation does not hold water.The publication of guidelines is something that can be provided through freedom of information channels, if appropriate.  Deputy Shatter pointed out with some insight reasons that had not occurred to me with regard to whether to allow this information.  There are serious circumstances where it may not be in the public interest to release that information.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	353	However, that is in respect of the specifications and not the guidelines.  They are two entirely different things.

Section 40B(b)(i) refers to “any such occurrence or development that, in the opinion of the Executive, the Minister is likely to [require]”.  Consequently, this pertains to a proactive decision taken by the executive.  Section 40B(b)(ii) deals with a decision by the Minister to provide in writing for categories of documents.  Moreover, if these documents create a concern for the Minister, section 40C enables me or the Minister for Health and Children to specify what further action or inquiry might be required.  Although sections 40B and 40C operate separately, they can be read together and one strengthens the other in that sense.  For those reasons, I reject the amendments.

In page 4, line 20, after "functions" to insert the following:"including political accountability to the Oireachtas".As I mentioned earlier, the explanatory memorandum describes the purpose of the Bill as strengthening "the legislative base for the provision of information by the Health Service Executive to the Minister for Health and Children so as to enhance the Minister's ability to fulfil his or her role and functions (including political accountability to the Oireachtas)".  Those words "political accountability to the Oireachtas" are nowhere to be found in the Bill.  The approach taken by Government to the health service and to the child care services by the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, and the Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, is that their job is to articulate policy and the job of the HSE is to deliver a service.  They have been very good at articulating policy and where there have been failures, it has been in the service delivery.We are constantly told in this House that the Minister is not politically accountable for the delivery of service.  There is a disconnect between what the explanatory memorandum says the Bill is about and what the Bill actually does.  If, as the Bill appears to do, there is now going to be a requirement on the HSE to keep Ministers and Government informed of how service delivery is being affected and where there are problems in the context of political accountability, the Minister should be accountable to the Dáil to inform it of that information.We need to get away from the ridiculous situation that has arisen whereby, when a Deputy in any party tables a parliamentary question about the health service or the child care services, the reply he is given is that it is not a matter that falls within the functions of the Minister and that the Minister will inform the HSE, which will write to the Deputy.  The HSE may write within a month, two months or six months.  Sometimes one may have to table two or three further parliamentary questions to find out why the HSE has not responded.  If it has responded, too often the response is evasive.Until the HSE was created the Minister for Health and Children responded to issues relating to service delivery in this House.  I was Fine Gael spokesperson for health for three years from 1998 through to 2000.  When I tabled a parliamentary question about problems with service delivery, I got a substantive answer, which is as it should be.  That is the way it should be following the enactment of this Bill because there should then be no information that the Minister cannot obtain other than information that may relate to preserving the confidentiality of the name of an individual in certain circumstances.  However, there should be no information that is not accessible to the Minister in his or her role of being politically accountable to this House.I seek to amend section 40C to insert a reference to political accountability.  Where the Bill states, "The Minister may, where he or she considers it necessary in the public interest to do so for the performance of his or her functions", I wish to add "including political accountability to the Oireachtas".  I hope the Minister will take that amendment on board because there is a democratic deficit in the manner in which we are currently operating, to the detriment of the public.  This Bill must do more than simply provide a channel of communication between the Minister and HSE that, until now, has been either closed or defective.  That channel must be opened to the extent that the Minister can account to this House for the running of our health service and children's services.  My amendment will facilitate that.

Even if he does not, perhaps we can still use this legislation as a mechanism for getting answers from the Minister.  One of her functions is to be accountable to this Chamber, which represents the people.  It would tighten the legislation if Deputy Shatter's amendment were accepted.We have difficulty obtaining answers in the House.  Members of the Minister's party would be very pleased if they could be sure they could get an answer from the Minister for Health and Children whenever they table a parliamentary question.  The Department of Health and Children is the only Department in respect of which most of the questions tabled therefor are not directly answered by the Minister.  Instead, they are referred to the HSE.  Certain questions are not answered by the Department of Transport and are transferred to the NRA and other bodies.  Despite this, we generally get full answers from all Ministers with the exception of the Minister for Health and Children.  This has been a problem for every elected public representative of every political hue since the legislation establishing the HSE was passed, at which time the Minister gave powers away in terms of being answerable to elected representatives.I strongly support the restoration of the accountability function of the Minister whereby it would be made clear that she has the power and a duty to obtain the information asked for by public representatives in parliamentary questions.  She probably has the power anyway but does not exercise it.  She should have the power to obtain the required information and put it on the public record.  In that context, I fully support Deputy Shatter's amendment.  I hope the legislation extends, perhaps inadvertently, our ability to obtain answers from the Minister in any case.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	362	I doubt if the Office of the Attorney General has permitted an inadvertent provision of that scale in the legislation.  Deputy O'Sullivan said one of the Minister's functions is to be accountable.  Therefore, the question must be asked whether it is necessary to include what is proposed in the amendment.  By the Deputy's own admission, the text as it stands covers the fact that one of the functions of a Minister is to be accountable to the Oireachtas.The parliamentary questions paper on any given day contains many questions on medical cards.  These questions are very important to many individuals but their cases would not be matters of national significance.  One wonders whether the Minister should have to deal with queries at that level in a modern democracy.  While they may be legitimate, one must ask whether it should necessarily be the job of a member of the Cabinet to trawl through them.  This holds true not only for the Department of Health and Children but also for the Departments of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Social Protection.  The cases I describe are not anticipated in this legislation.  We are dealing with matters of significance rather than the kinds of issues covered by parliamentary questions on a daily basis.  There is a good reason the Minister enabled the HSE to deal with such matters directly.One of the major purposes of the Bill is to ensure accountability.  Sections 40B and 40C will strengthen the Minister's ability to discharge her accountability function to the Oireachtas.  For that reason, I am not accepting the amendment.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	363	I have difficulty with what the Minister is saying because I do not understand why there is a discrepancy between what the explanatory memorandum states the Bill does and the actual content of the Bill.  It is very unusual because these documents are prepared very carefully.  Those who drafted the explanatory memorandum felt, when referring to this very particular area, the need to include the phrase "including political accountability to the Oireachtas".  I do not understand why the Minister will not accept my amendment or why the Office of the Attorney General did not include that wording in the Bill.  If the Minister of State says the legislation is to facilitate political accountability to the Oireachtas, he should accept the amendment.  The wording I seek to include makes sure that the issues I am concerned about will be addressed.The problem is that the Minister does not regard herself as accountable for anything to do with the delivery of services.  That is an important issue and I disagree with the Minister of State's view on it.  The delivery of services is not just about the issuing of an individual medical card to an applicant who may be entitled to it, it is about a range of issues.  Included are the operation and management of accident and emergency units in hospitals, the reason beds may be vacant in a ward when there are people lying on trolleys in the accident and emergency section, and the reasons X-rays are not properly reviewed, which might affect hundreds of people.  These are issues about the day-to-day running of our medical services.The Minister does not regard herself as accountable to the House except when there is a great uproar and public scandal and it ceases to be credible to say in the House that she will send a letter to the HSE about it.  If the failure is of sufficient enormity, the fiction that the Minister is involved only in the development of policy and that the HSE is involved only in delivering the service is suddenly sidelined and the Minister comes into the House to report to it.When there is not a scandal, catastrophe or revelation about something that should have occurred and it is a general Dáil question about a matter of concern, it is referred to the HSE.The Minister of State mentioned medical cards.  If a Member asks a question now about the medical card, he or she will be told the Minister will write to the HSE.  Of course, the Member might be told, as we have been for weeks — the Minister of State might clarify where we now stand — that unfortunately we cannot even communicate with the HSE because there is an industrial dispute and it will not tell us anything.  I presume the industrial dispute is over.  I have not tabled in the past couple of days a Dáil question that would have generated, as questions did until last week, that sort of response.  The Minister of State might clarify whether the industrial dispute is at an end.We were in the ridiculous position where we had a Minister telling us that she did not really deal with this directly and she would communicate with the HSE but she cannot because there is an industrial dispute and if we are still interested in the issue, would we ever table the question again.  My colleague, Deputy Durkan, on a regular basis on the Order of Business, persistently and correctly pursued that issue.Let me tell the House something about medical cards.  I have a situation in my constituency in which, I think, the reply issued yesterday that the Minister was writing to the HSE and it would respond to me, where persons who are entitled to a medical card because they have certain serious illness and who get them on a discretionary basis are now having medical cards issued to them for two months at a time and they must keep on reapplying because the staff shortages dealing with the progression of medical cards are such that no one is willing to take responsibility to issue a medical card for 12 months.  I have one very elderly pensioner constituent who is a distressed individual who every two months thinks her medical card will be cancelled and must keep reapplying.To my mind, that might be an individual issue worth bringing into this House to which I should get a substantive response, not a Minister telling me she will write to the HSE, because that is an issue that does not just affect that individual.  How many other individuals does it affect and how much public money is being wasted in repetitive applications being processed and temporary medical cards repetitively being issued to individuals who should get their medical card as they did heretofore for a year or longer without having to repetitively apply, and individuals who are distressed by serious illnesses who do not need the worry, particularly when they are elderly, of fearing they might suddenly be deprived of their medical card?  That goes beyond the micromanagement of the health service.This is an amendment I would have hoped the Minister of State would accept but, of course, I have learnt in this Dáil that Ministers generally do not accept any amendments.  I usually get to this point in these sort of proceedings where I really wonder why I burnt the midnight oil tabling any amendments and maybe we should just abandon Committee and Report Stages.  I feel I have a public duty to raise these issues and I will continue to do so.  I will conclude because I want us then to move on and deal with some of the other amendments that need to be addressed.  I thank Deputy Jan O'Sullivan for her support for this amendment.

In some ways, it is a discussion which we should be having in a broader context because there is considerable frustration.  As health spokesperson I find it frustrating in terms of getting information on a wide variety of issues.  For example, the reports on reconfiguration of hospital services were secret until in my region the Labour Party managed to get its hands on it and decided to publish, and then the HSE published it.  That is just one example but it is extremely difficult to get information on the health services in general.  It would make life so much easier for all of us in our public function.  I do not mean we are trying to get this information as some kind of personal curiosity.  It is in our public function, as representatives of the people, that we need this information but it is extremely difficult to get it.Our quarterly meeting with the Minister and Professor Drumm is coming up in the next month and with the number of questions that have been tabled by members of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, these meetings are getting ever longer.  We have no way of getting the information, except in that quarterly face-to-face meeting.I do not want to spend all the scarce time we have left on this issue but it is one on which we need to have a full debate in some other context in the interests of our representative democracy so that people can get the information they require on the health services, which are such an important area of our lives and also such a significant element of public spending in the context of tight resources.  This is something that needs wider debate.  I support the amendment.

The only point I wanted to make, because we have argued this repeatedly here on several occasions, is that perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, might note for the future that over this past difficult period of work to rule and non-co-operation with elected voices some Ministers behaved with a degree of sane and sensible response by stating the Department noted the parliamentary question and will revert to the Deputy as soon as it is in a position to do so.  Only last week there was an example of proactivity on the part of the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Ó Cuív, who wrote to Deputies in advance of the resolution of these difficulties highlighting his intention to address correspondence and parliamentary questions that had yet to be resolved and to start the process in preparation for the responses to issue.However, with the Department of Health and Children time after time the responses were that if the Deputy is still interested, he or she may resubmit whenever this difficulty is resolved, putting the onus back on the Deputies once again to resubmit, which I have been doing since the indication of the ending of the work to rule.  That is indicative of a contemptuous disposition on the part of the Minister and those responsible in terms of responding to Members of this House and contrasts badly with the practice in other Departments.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	366	I also support this amendment.  The deeply worrying aspect of this Bill is that it misses such a great opportunity to do right in terms of completeness and my concerns, particularly around the fact that the Minister will be informed by the HSE which is something with which we all would agree and would want to see happen.  I am concerned about the Stalinist-type censorship that the Minister can then operate.  There is no onus on the Minister to make that information available to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children or on the floor of the House.Furthermore, we could find ourselves in a rather outrageous situation where an independent group is asked to review a particular aspect of the service, the Minister will be the one to provide the information which will come to him or her from the HSE, but he or she can decide to only provide part of the information thereby rendering the investigation useless and pointless.We need to include a line in the Bill, as my colleague, Deputy Shatter, has provided for, to ensure that there is political accountability.  While we are short on time, the other point I would make is that there seems to be no sanction here for failure of the HSE to provide information and no reasonable time period given in which it must provide the information.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	367	First, I want to clarify that arising from the Croke Park deal, the industrial action by IMPACT in the HSE has been lifted.  Unfortunately, the CPSU, which represents the clerical officers, is still engaged in industrial action and this can cause problems in getting parliamentary questions and representations sent on to the HSE.  However, I would take the point that Deputy Ó Caoláin makes about the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív.  Clarity is probably due to Deputies and Senators in regard to questions that are submitted.In any case, where a specific case of a child in care or a vulnerable child is submitted by way of question, the HSE has co-operated in providing information even during the course of the dispute.  It is important that I make this point.The Attorney General has made it clear in his analysis of the legislation that he is satisfied the text addresses the issue of political accountability.  As Deputy Jan O'Sullivan mentioned, being accountable to the Dáil is one of the functions of the Minister.  One would have believed it to be the central function.  What is captured in Deputy Shatter's amendment is already anticipated in the text and, therefore, the amendment is unnecessary.We have been through the general arguments about the HSE and have drifted a little.  The explanatory memorandum was written for a specific purpose.  Deputy Shatter's point that if something is in the explanatory memorandum, it should be in the legislation is an argument to transpose the entire memorandum into law.  I am not sure that makes sense.  The memorandum is meant to elucidate the Bill for people who might not have the capacity to read difficult statutes.  The argument does not hold up.  The Attorney General's office is quite clear that the text and the word "functions" include the issue of political accountability.Deputy Shatter gets annoyed because he seems to believe that amendments are tabled but not duly considered.  They are given every consideration, but one cannot accept unnecessary amendments and, from the Attorney General's advice, this amendment is unnecessary.

In page 4, line 21, after "otherwise)," to insert the following:"or the performance of the functions of any other Minister of the Government,".In the legislation, the power to compel the production of information relates purely to the functions of the Department of Health and Children.  For example, Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform functions might be available to the HSE, so information on them should be furnished under the Bill.  I suggest that the section be extended to cover the functions of any Minister, since the information required, while in the HSE's possession, could relate to the functions of Ministers other than the Minister for Health and Children.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	369	The purpose of the Bill is to address the issue of the provision of information by the HSE to the Minister.  It is tied to the Minister's functions under the Health Act 2004 and any other enactment, such as the Ministers and Secretaries Act.  In particular, section 40C is about the Minister being able to require information from the executive free of specified legal prohibitions.  In this sense, it is especially about providing a safe channel of communication for information that may on occasion be sensitive.In essence, the Bill is about strengthening the legal base for the provision of information from the executive to the Minister for the purpose of the latter being better able to perform her functions, including political accountability to the Oireachtas.  In such circumstances, it would not be appropriate for the Minister for Health and Children to be able to require information relevant to the performance of functions of other Ministers.

Some of these files would presumably contain information that relates to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in particular and possibly to the Departments of Social Protection and, in so far as housing issues might be involved, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  If the file contains information that relates to the functions of other Ministers, I want to be clear on whether the HSE will hand it over to the independent review group so that the latter might have all of the information pertinent to a case.  This is a relevant issue.  If the Minister of State can assure me the provision is covered in some way, I will accept that, but I do not want us to pass the legislation only to find chunks of files cannot be handed over because they relate to other Departments.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	371	In the exercise, the Attorney General is to try to get simple case files handed over to the independent review group.  The section on which the Deputy is focusing states: "The Minister may, where he or she considers it necessary in the public interest to do so for the performance of his or her functions (whether under this Act or otherwise)."  This section ensures that whatever the HSE is required to furnish to the Minister is in the public interest and not for a purpose that is not significant for the performance of the functions of the Minister.  It is a safeguard to the protect the HSE as well as to ensure that the information can be transferred.The Deputy is correct, as there will in practice be references to children who have been the subjects of detention or orders under the Children Act.  However, this would not prevent the information being transferred to the independent review group.  If this is the Deputy's concern, I assure her the transfer will not be hindered by the text.

In page 5, line 2, after "person" to insert "or persons".There is no chance the Minister of State will accept this simple amendment.  To be of help, I suggest that we take amendments Nos. 8 to 10, inclusive, with this amendment, given the relationship between them.  We will not get much further anyway.Amendment No. 8 relates to section 40D, which states: "Where the Minister has appointed a person to examine or inquire into any matter, and considers that any information or document that has been furnished under section 40B or 40C may be relevant to that examination or inquiry, the Minister may furnish that information or document to the person".  The Minister has appointed two people to the review group, so this is a very straightforward and simple amendment to make reference to the fact where the Minister appoints a person, or persons.  I would not think this is an exceptional amendment and I hope the Minister of State might accept it.Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 do something else.  The former proposes the inclusion of a section 40E, which would read: "Where the Minister has appointed a person or persons to examine or inquire into any matter and the person or persons so appointed consider that any information or document may be relevant to that examination or inquiry the Health Service Executive where it is in possession of said information or document or has access to it shall upon request furnish that information or document to the person or persons who requested that information or document."  In the list of amendments, the proposed section 40E is incorrectly printed a second time as section 40F, so I presume the numbers should be changed.  Section 40F should read: "Nothing contained in an enactment and no rule of law relating to the non-disclosure or confidentiality of information or documents or relating——"

There are other elements in the Bill which it might not be possible to commence and make operational within the proposed 12 month period.  I made reference at that time to what is now section 44 of the Bill, by way of example, which involved the out-sourcing of certain functions by the Courts Service and all that will entail in terms of IT, administrative supports and so on.  I am not prepared to take the chance, and the Deputy would not want me to take the chance, that the Bill will fall in 12 months' time because all sections have not been commenced.  That is the effect of what would happen if the amendment were accepted.  It is not to be awkward in regard to this matter but to try to ensure we have a safe and orderly passage of the Bill as quickly as possible and that it will not fall in 12 months' time.  For that reason I ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.

This includes alcohol and other drugs and any combination of drugs, whether including alcohol or not".This arose out of an effort on Committee Stage to include a definition of "drugs" in the law.  As there is no such definition it may create a loophole because a driver may argue that the substance he or she has taken was not a drug.The definition of "intoxicant" should be changed, therefore, to any substance or combination of substances which affects the central nervous system, leading to changes in perception or behaviour.  It would include alcohol, other drugs and any combination of drugs and alcohol.  I hope the Minister will consider this amendment favourably.

I examined it carefully and took advice from the Office of the Attorney General and the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.  Due to the nature and volume of challenges in the courts to all intoxicated driving offences and the current acceptance by the courts of the well-established meaning of "intoxicant" as provided for in the Road Traffic Acts, I was advised it would be foolish to accept this amendment.The next road traffic Bill will focus on drugs testing and I promise the Deputy I will have his amendment considered in that context.  However, I am not prepared to take the risk on it in this legislation.  I hope the Deputy will appreciate where I am coming from on this matter.

In page 8, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:""pedal cycle" means all human-propelled, pedal-driven vehicles including pedestrian rickshaws and electric assisted bicycles which can only be activated when the rider is pedalling and which is speed limited to 25 km/h;".On Committee Stage it arose that unicycles and pedal cycles with more than three wheels are not covered by the definition of "pedal cycle" in this legislation.  This amendment proposes to amend the definition to cover all human-propelled, pedal-driven vehicles including pedestrian rickshaws and electric assisted bicycles.Mayo County Council has a scheme for improving driver and cyclist performance whereby cyclists have a number plate, a sort of unofficial licence.  Recently, a District Court judge banned a cyclist from driving as there was no provision in the law to deal with alleged misbehaviour of a cyclist.  I accept an overall consolidation of traffic law will have to be introduced at some point but I urge the Minister to accept this amendment as a start.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	393	I acknowledge the Deputy is ahead of me in this matter and is anticipating future legislation.  However, as I explained on Committee Stage, the Road Safety Authority is examining the definitions of mechanically propelled vehicles and pedal cycles in road traffic legislation in the context of the development of a new EU framework regulation on type approval governing two and three-wheeled vehicles.  The authority will be making proposals for a legislative amendment in due course.  While I accept the principle of the amendment it is better practice to wait for the particular advice from the authority and incorporate it into later legislation.

In page 9, line 14, to delete "in a public place".There is no pressing policy reason to limit the offence of drink-driving to public places.  It could also create a technical defence in court to a prosecution.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	396	I clarified this since Committee Stage.  The definition provided for in section 3 of the principal Act states, "public place means any street, road or other place to which the public have access with vehicles whether as of right or by permission and whether subject to or free of charge."  I have been advised this covers the Deputy's concerns.The proposed deletion of the words "in a public place" would have the effect of introducing the offence of driving or being in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle while intoxicated on private property.  This would give rise to difficulties with a person's constitutional right to enjoy his or her private property.  For that reason, I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.

However, I have been advised against introducing such a term of imprisonment in summary trial cases as it would go against the overall intention of such trials.  The only instance in road traffic legislation in which a term of imprisonment of 12 months is provided for is in section 112 of the principal Act, taking a vehicle without authority.  There is a bit of history attached to that section.  Accordingly, I ask the Deputy to withdraw his amendment.

In page 13, to delete lines 11 to 18 and substitute the following:"(a) is of opinion that a person in charge of a vehicle in a public place—(i) has consumed intoxicating liquor, the member shall require, or(ii) (I) is or has, with the vehicle, been involved in a collision, or(II) is committing or has committed an offence under the Road Traffic Acts 1961 to 2010,the member may require,".Members will recall we had a detailed consideration of this provision on Committee Stage.  I made the commitment then to re-examine the section to see if it could be better drafted to address some of their concerns.  Amendment No. 13 provides for the restatement of what was section 8(1)(a), now section 9(1)(a), to remove any ambiguity and address the concerns expressed by PARC, the road safety group, on the absence of the word “or” in the section.I have been advised by the Attorney General's office that to make any further changes to this section, without a detailed consideration and consultation with key stakeholders, could seriously undermine preliminary breath-testing provisions in general and lead to significant legal challenges.In summary, the section now provides that where a member of the Garda Síochána is of the opinion that a person in charge of a vehicle in a public place has consumed intoxicating liquor or has been involved in a road traffic collision in which injury was caused, the garda shall require a preliminary breath specimen.  Also, where a member of the Garda Síochána is of the opinion that a person in charge of a vehicle in a public place has been involved in a road traffic collision not involving injury or has committed an offence under the Road Traffic Acts 1961 to 2010, the garda may require a preliminary breath specimen.  The effect of the amendment I have moved is to try to meet some of the genuine concerns Members raised.  The advice I have received is this is as far as I can go at this stage.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	403	I welcome the fact that the Minister accepted a key amendment I moved earlier on behalf of the Labour Party.  The formula he has arrived at comes a good deal closer to the introduction of mandatory testing for collisions, accidents involving serious injury and tragic fatalities.  I warmly commend the PARC road safety group, a group of activists which has campaigned so steadfastly for improvements in road traffic legislation in recent years, all the leaders of which have suffered terrible tragedies.These sections remind us of what we are trying to do, that is, to reform fundamentally the law and to change the culture of drinking and driving.  We should not forget that the Minister represented us yesterday at the award ceremony where Estonia and ourselves received recognition for the fall in the level of deaths and casualties on our roads during recent years.  However, the figures for recent months are disturbing.  The data for May of this year were almost as bad as for May 2009, with only one less casualty.  There have been tragic cases of young men in particular involved in one person vehicle collisions and who have lost their lives in recent times.We are aware from the work of our experts, including Dr. Declan Bedford, that alcohol has been a factor in 37% of fatal collisions, that 42% of drivers who died had alcohol levels deemed to be a contributory factor and that 34% of killed drivers were over the then legal limit.  We are also aware that 92% of survivors were not tested for alcohol in their systems.  This is the system we are trying to change.  We do not want those circumstances to occur again.  I urge the Minister to consider the amendments.The Minister is sticking with the phrase "is of the opinion".  I am a member of the Garda Forum for Dublin city and Fingal County.  The Commissioner of the Garda Síochána appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts last week.  I inquired generally about the view of the force on this issue.  There is a view that there must be some discretion.  I believe this could be best formulated on the basis of the Northern Ireland legislation in which the term "suspects or having reasonable cause to suspect" seems to give a stronger version of the term "is of the opinion" or that used in the previous legislation, "forms the opinion", which we believed to be rather problematic.  A formula involving "suspects" would still give a slight flexibility.  Deputy Ahern referred to minor tips on the road and so on during the previous debate.  We should ensure drivers involved in collisions are tested and that there is mandatory testing.One last time I call on the Minister to consider whether he could make the language stronger with regard to mandatory testing.  Ultimately, the whole discussion has been about forming a different culture.  If one wishes to enjoy a drink that is fair enough but, as Dr. Bedford's research shows, it is not possible to drive safely afterwards.  His research also shows that if there is a blood alcohol level of greater than 0.04%, there is impairment.  We want to change that to bring our limits into line.  On Committee Stage, we heard that the UK Government, through the North Commission, was going to introduce the 0.05% limit as well.  All other countries in the European Union have a limit of at least 0.02% or below.  Some have 0.0% which seems very difficult to manage.  Most countries have a limit of 0.02%.  We are planning to move to 0.05% and the UK appears destined to follow us.I call on the Minister to make the formula "is of the opinion" stronger to ensure mandatory testing.  We seek mandatory testing for collisions.  It is necessary for a new culture of driving in the country and to avoid the shocking tragedies that have occurred.  Even this year, the death figures stand at 93 or 94.  Each one of these cases represents an appalling personal tragedy and devastation for a family and we should never forget that fundamental point.  As Gay Byrne, the chairman of the Road Safety Authority, stated yesterday when he accompanied the Minister, we need to get the number of fatalities as low as possible.  Strictly speaking, no one should die in a form of transport; that is ridiculous.  We should aim for zero fatalities and this is our purpose tonight.  This is an important step we must take.

It has a double edge in this regard.  Speeding and drink are our two main killers.  I call on the Minister to listen to the remarks of Deputy Broughan and to consider the matter.Education is working with regard to drink driving, speeding and so on.  We can do two things with one measure in this case.  A person will know the chance of an accident is far greater if he is speeding.  However, if that person is also aware that if he has a tip he will be tested for drink driving, the incentive is stronger.  I call on the Minister to back the two of us in this regard and to consider the matter.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	405	We held a long discussion on the matter.  This will provide for mandatory testing in certain circumstances.  The legislation refers to where a member of the Garda is of the opinion that a person in charge of a vehicle in a public place has consumed intoxicating liquor, that member "shall" require and so on.  That is mandatory and there is no way out of it.I made the point the last time in respect of other circumstances in which a test could be carried out that I did not take the view, nor do I still, that it is a good idea or a good use of Garda resources to provide that someone who committed an offence under the Road Traffic Acts, other than in the circumstances outlined here, such as a parking offence should be mandatorily tested in such a case.  I have not changed my view on the matter.  I have gone as far as I can in the current circumstances.  I agree with Deputy Broughan that we should try to ensure in whatever way we can to reduce the number of people killed on the roads.  However, we must balance this against practicalities, resources and ensuring the legislation we pass in the House is acceptable and has a degree of public support.We have taken a major step forward with this legislation.  No doubt as we move through other road traffic Bills in future the law may be tightened somewhat more but this is a far as we can go.

I had a look at it following the discussion we had on Committee Stage.  What has been clarified for me is that the provisions of section 7 directly address the Deputy's concerns.  The section provides for powers of entry to the Garda Síochána in the particular circumstances about which the Deputy spoke.  Where a person has been injured and is perhaps in a doctor's surgery or elsewhere, the gardaí can enter such premises without warrant in order to obtain a preliminary breath specimen, so this is covered.We had much debate about this and the Deputy was very strong on it.  I may have misled him somewhat but what he is looking for is contained in section 7.

In page 13, line 40, to delete "may" and substitute "shall".This is an attempt to strengthen the mandatory aspect of the Bill.  The Bill states "where the member does not have such an apparatus with him or her, to remain at that place in his or her presence or in the presence of another member of the Garda Síochána until such an apparatus becomes available to him or her ... the member may then require the person to provide, by exhaling . . .".  Why does the Minister not use the word "shall"?  It is the same point as——

That is the reason the word "may" rather than "shall" is used.  For that reason, I cannot accept the amendment.

In page 15, line 34, after "opinion" to insert "or suspicion".I moved these amendments on Committee Stage.  Amendment No. 20 inserts the words "or suspicion", again to strengthen the mandatory aspect of the legislation.  This relates to preliminary impairment testing where a member of the Garda Síochána forms the opinion that the person in charge of a vehicle is under the influence of an intoxicant.  I wish to develop that further to read is of the "opinion or suspicion".  In light of the UK and Northern Ireland legislation, it would legally strengthen the position for the garda in question and give a stronger basis on which to ask for an impairment test.  Has the Minister thought about that over the preceding few days?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	414	I have done so and, as the Deputy rightly said, there was considerable debate on Committee Stage about the use of the phrase "is of the opinion", which is currently provided for in the road traffic legislation, and the proposed addition of the words "or suspicion".  We had a good discussion and I did not have much of a problem with it.I said I would see if it would have implications for other road traffic legislation.  Again, mindful of the considerable level of challenges, in particular in intoxicated driving cases, I did not make any promises other than to look at it, which I did.  The advice received from the Office of the Attorney General was against changing the existing terms.It appears there is a significant difference between the two phrases about which we are speaking, with completely different requirements in terms of proof in presenting evidence in prosecutions.  Perhaps there is not much difference at the end of the day but the phrase "in the opinion of" has been well tested in the courts and it is the one with which people feel safest.  For that reason, I have been advised not to change it, in particular in this legislation.

In page 15, after line 48, to insert the following:"(4) Where the outcome of testing under this section indicates that the person is incapable of having proper control of a vehicle, that outcome shall be evidence in a prosecution under section 4(1).”.I propose to add an additional provision to tie in the preliminary testing in order that it can be used as evidence in the prosecution.  From what the Minister said, he believes it will be problematic.  I do not know if he thought about the formula I have in the amendment.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	416	I had a look at it but the problem remains the same in regard to court challenges and so on.  To apply an evidential status to the results from the roadside tests I am advised could cause very severe difficulties in the overall evidential process.  These are meant to be preliminary roadside tests similar in status to the breath screening devices, the breathalyser one gives to a person.  The results of that are used to form the opinion but they do not provide evidence for use in a subsequent prosecution.  The impairment test would be solely used to form the opinion so that when the judge asks how one formed the opinion, one will be able to state that this test was done.  That is only a part of the process.The real scientific part of the process, which stands up as evidence in the court, is the test that takes place afterwards.  Introducing this as part of the evidence would leave too many loopholes which I know the Deputy does not want to happen.  For that reason, we cannot accept the amendment.

In page 16, lines 22 and 23, to delete "at the option of the person,".This amendment relates to the obligation to provide the breath, blood or urine specimen and to perform impairment testing following an arrest.  I propose to delete the phrase "at the option of the person", again to strengthen the procedure in giving the specimen.  I am sure the Minister has thought about it since Committee Stage.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	419	I have done so and there is a difficulty with accepting the amendment.  I am sure the Deputy will understand that we all want to try to prosecute anybody who has taken a drink and drives.  However, circumstances can arise and there can be very valid reasons a person who is required to provide a sample is unable to do so.  There can be valid reasons a person who is required to provide a sample is unable to do so.  For instance, there can be difficulties obtaining an appropriate vein or passing urine.  These issues have to be addressed and, for that reason, the person must have an option to select one or other of the tests.  Making it compulsory that a garda must decide or the individual cannot have a choice would be too much of an onerous obligation on the individual.  Courts could take a particular view of that and, for that reason, I do not propose to accept the amendment.

In page 16, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:"(7) As soon as practicable after the passing of this Act the Minister shall make regulations applying section 9 to random testing of saliva to ascertain whether persons in charge of mechanically propelled vehicles are under the influence of illegal drugs.".I appeal to the Minister to provide whatever resources are required to introduce a reasonable test for drug driving.  On Committee Stage he said this would need another Bill but, in recent years, the states of Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales in Australia introduced a saliva test, which enables testing for cannabis, MDMA and related drugs.We are making a major amendment to drink driving legislation but there is a great deal of evidence that drug driving is also a serious problem.  A CSO survey in July 2009 highlighted an 81% drug driving increase on the previous year and the Medical Bureau of Road Safety's figures show the number of specimens tested for the presence of a drug increased from 569 in 2004 to 747 in 2008, 879 in 2006, 1,555 in 2007 and 1,900 in 2008.  I do not have to hand the 2009 figure but I am sure it increased.  Aviva carried out a study in 2008 which showed that more than 20% of drivers under the age of 35 had driven while under the influence of drugs.  It is a significant problem and many people have been considering the issue over the past year or two following a number of tragedies.The Minister said there were problems with the European Union in this regard but some of our European partners have begun programmes of drug testing.  A saliva test is used in Australia.  I wonder why the Minister is not moving on this and, therefore, why he will not accept the amendment.

I guarantee that as soon we have a reliable test, I will introduce the legislation.  We are moving on this legislation to make it much more explicit from the drugs point of view.Deputy Broughan is correct that tests for drug driving are used in Australia but, as I pointed out on Committee Stage, different atmospheric conditions affect the test.  We do not have a reliable test at European level but we are working with our European counterparts to ensure one is introduced.  As soon as we have a test, we will provide for it in legislation.The Deputy quoted statistics but the lack of a roadside test does not mean drivers get away when they have drugs in their system.  If they have a drug other than alcohol in their system, the blood test can show that and people are being prosecuted.  I accept the comments of both Deputies.  The impairment test goes some way towards addressing the issue but if we could secure a saliva test or another test, it would be better.  As soon as we do, we will move on it.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	432	The principle outlined in the amendments is contained in the legislation.  The amount referred in the section will be prescribed by the Minister.  It is not intended that it will reflect the total cost of prosecuting a case but it will be a reasonable reflection.  It is similar to the provisions in section 22 of the 1994 Act, which provides for the payment of a prescribed amount towards the cost of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety in intoxicated driving cases and that is made payable to the Exchequer.The decision on whether to apply the provisions contained in section 22 is at the discretion of the court.  I have examined the proposed amendment further and I am advised that to accept such a change at this time would not be desirable but further legal advice and consultation is required in advance for providing for any changes to the section.  I will examine this further in the context of the next road traffic Bill.  The experience so far is that judges are not very much in favour of section 22 but there comes a time when the House has to make decisions on this.  I do not disagree with the Deputy's principle of making offenders pay for this but I cannot do it at this time.  However, it is a subject to which we will return.

In page 26, line 39, after "breath" to insert the following:", provided that such apparatus does not operate to allow a standard deduction from the recorded reading of the concentration of alcohol in the breath".These amendments related to the practice of using a standard deduction of 17.5% from the recorded breath alcohol content, BAC, reading.  The road safety campaign group, PARC, has raised the issue of intoxilyzer machines used in Ireland.  It strongly contends that there is a 17.5% reduction inbuilt in the readings, which means the evidential reading used in court could be 20% to 25% lower than the BAC at the time of testing.  On Committee Stage I asked whether these deductions would be allowed in the recalibrated machines.  The Minister addressed this at length and he forwarded a briefing note to me, which he also sent to Ms Susan Gray, the chairperson of PARC.  I am concerned about whether a standardised method is used for these machines across the EU.  The Minister outlined the reasoning for the deduction and why it was important in the legal process and so on.However, I still was not quite clear on whether we have a standardised method and whether we are in complete conformity with international practice.

I mentioned to the Deputy during the previous debate cases such as Director of Public Prosecutions v. Syron, Director of Public Prosecutions v. Curry, and Ashley McGonnell, Oliver Quinlan and John Purcell v. Attorney General and Director of Public Prosecutions, which are extensive judgments and have stood up to all challenges.  Thus, there is a strong basis for the system.Other European countries have made similar allowances.  The principle is the same, although the amount deducted may not be the same for a variety of reasons.  In the Netherlands the allowance is of the order of 20% for 36 mg per 100 ml.  There are also allowances in Sweden and the UK.  We did discuss this extensively and there is absolute certainty, from our point of view, in this course of action.  It will stand up to court challenges.  For that reason I ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.

The amendment proposes to delete the whole of subsection (2) of section 29 on the basis that there does not seem to be a good reason specified that persons should receive a slap on the wrist.  Many people feel that everybody needs to be left in no doubt of the significance of driving under the influence of alcohol.  The Minister addressed this on Committee Stage.
#ShaneMcEntee	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-party	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-dob	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	443	I hope this is the right time to bring up penalty points.  We have all been supportive in the campaign against driving under the influence of alcohol.  I would like to ask the Minister one question about fixed penalty notices which confer penalty points.  If a person receives penalty points for driving with a blood alcohol level of between 50 and 80 mg per 100 ml, they will stay on the person's licence for five years, while penalty points for speeding, which is also a massive killer, remain for only three years.  Did the Minister consider this?  Could he reduce the period of application of the penalty points from five years to three years in the interests of fairness?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	444	I will deal with Deputy McEntee's point in a minute.  With regard to amendment No. 31, what Deputy Broughan is proposing is that the offer of a fixed penalty notice to specified persons for certain offences be removed.  The introduction of the lower blood alcohol limit has been the subject of much debate and discussion and I am anxious that, particularly in the early stages following its introduction, a certain amount of fairness should be applied to allow drivers to adjust to the new lower limits.  There is a certain amount of truth in what the Deputy says, in view of the fact that the offence incurs three penalty points rather than the penalty that applied previously.  However, I was persuaded by the arguments put by a wide variety of people that initially, because there may be an element of doubt about whether one is over the limit, we should be reasonable about giving people a fair warning.  If somebody is caught, he or she will know the next time that a glass of wine is too much, or whatever.  On that basis, I do not wish to withdraw the option of a fixed penalty notice.Deputy McEntee mentioned the retention of penalty points on a person's licence for five years as specified in section 29(5).  This has been raised by a few people and I have considered the fact that the points are imposed for five years rather than three years.  If the House is willing to agree, I do not have a difficulty with reducing this to three years.  The points may remain on a person's licence for five years, but he or she has had a warning and received three points, so it is almost irrelevant whether they remain for five or three years.  If the House is agreeable I will amend the section to specify three years instead of five.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	445	The proposed amendment referred to learner and professional drivers, for whom there is a blood alcohol limit of 20 mg per 100 ml.  For learner drivers, it is important that driving education is begun in the right way.  The Minister has yet to introduce the graduated learner driver system, which we look forward to.  It is important to have a good education so that a person remains a good driver throughout his or her life.  In addition, professional drivers have a serious responsibility to their passengers.  This is what inspired the amendment.  However, the Minister made his argument to me on Committee Stage and it is reasonable enough.With regard to the length of time the penalty points remain on a person's licence, the important thing is the 50 mg per 100 ml blood alcohol limit and the fact that penalty points are incurred for breaching this limit.  It is a "one strike" system, which was felt necessary in order to change the culture.  It is up to the Minister to introduce amendments.  There has been intense lobbying around the House today by vintners, who are perhaps seeking to water the Bill down.  This is not acceptable, given the fact that since 1960 we have lost 20,000 people through road deaths, and so many families have been damaged.  As I have mentioned, the research clearly shows that alcohol was a factor in almost 40% of these collisions.  It is the Government's duty to govern and to propose and it is the duty of the Opposition to respond.  Is the Minister now proposing that it be three years instead of five years?  Is it possible for the Minister to table an amendment now or must he wait until the Bill goes to the Seanad?

I should say it is not actually up to the Government because I have accepted amendments from the Opposition.  However, in deference to what has been said by the Deputies, I am willing to change the provision to allow for maximum acceptability.  In section 29(5) I propose to change the words in line 21, to remove the words "five years" and replace them with "three years".  I will move that amendment.

At times I had to decide for myself what was right and what was wrong.  Our young people want to be educated in how to do the right thing and they are acting in that way.  I have no problem with the vintners telling it as it was but I do not accept it was a vintners' lobby.  It was not really pointed out to me and I accept that.  I will go in the interest of fairness, and specifically so that people will realise that speed kills as well.Speed is a massive problem and it is caused by drug drivers at this stage.  They get their cheap drink in an off-licence, they take their drugs and they get into a car and they kill themselves at speed.  I am delighted that the three of us are ad idem and I support the Minister’s proposal.

In page 40, between lines 43 and 44, to insert the following:"38.—As soon as practicable after the passing of this Act, the Minister shall present proposals to the Oireachtas for the application of fines under the Principal Act based on the means of the offender rather than of fixed maxima that apply to all cases.".This was discussed on Committee Stage.  It is a practice in foreign jurisdictions that the wealthier people pay a higher fine.  I asked the Minister to consider such a provision.  In countries such as Germany and Switzerland, variable fines are applied depending on the income of the individual.  If a person flagrantly breaks the law, there is some method of redress which will hurt a person who may be very wealthy or a millionaire.  I ask the Minister to consider such a provision.

In page 43, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:"(3) A member of the Garda Síochána may arrest without warrant a person who in the member's opinion has committed an offence under subsection (2).”.I was trying in this amendment to strengthen the situation where a traffic warden is attempting to carry out his or her business by providing that a member of the Garda Síochána may arrest without warrant a person who in the member's opinion has committed an offence.  I was thinking in particular of foreign drivers or drivers of foreign vehicles.  A traffic warden might need to call on the Garda for backup.  I ask if the Minister has considered this proposal since Committee Stage.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	465	As the Deputy said, it refers to offences enforced by local authority traffic wardens.  They are mainly involved in the use of mechanically propelled vehicles.  In such cases where the name and address of an alleged offender is not available or is refused on the demand of the local authority traffic warden, the registration number of the vehicle is available for use in pursuing the identity of the owner.  This may not always be practicable, particularly, as the Deputy said, if it is a foreign car.  However, to arrest a person who refuses to give a name and address for an alleged parking offence might seem to be a little disproportionate.  In any event, the current situation allows the local authority traffic warden to call the Garda to assist in such circumstances.Section 75 of the Bill provides for the arrest by the Garda, if so required and without warrant, of persons who refuse or fail or give false or misleading details.  I may not have made it clear on Committee Stage because I was not clear on the matter in my own mind but it is covered in section 75 of the Bill.

timing, method or manner of payment or appropriate arrangements for making payment or matters relating thereto;(c) whether the payment is to be accompanied by the notice and, if so, the details to be completed on the notice;(d) options for payment (including the possibility of cash payment where in the circumstances and at the material time another means of payment is not possible) so as not to unduly delay a person, who is willing to pay the payment deposit, on his or her journey;(e) the issue of a receipt in respect of payment;(f) applications for refunds of payment deposits, including time limits for such applications;(g) the refund of payment deposits, in whole or in part;(h) directions which may be given by a member of the Garda Síochána or a transport officer in connection with matters relating to payment, the arrangements for making payments or the vehicle concerned or any load on it;(i) any other requirements relating to payment of the payment deposit, as the Minister

officer, and(ii) in accordance with regulations under subsection (10)—(I) affixed to the vehicle an immobilisation device and a notice (referred to in this section as an "immobilisation notice") stating that the vehicle has been immobilised and shall not be moved, and(II) the vehicle detained or impounded,until payment or a satisfactory arrangement for payment is made in accordance with the directions of a member of the Garda Síochána or a transport officer or the address is given, as the case may be.(9) (a) A prohibition notice and an immobilisation notice shall be in the prescribed form.(b) The Minister may prescribe such persons or class of persons who may be nominated persons for the purposes of subsection (8).(10) For the purposes of this section, the Minister may by regulations provide for all or any of the following:(a) matters relating to the immobilisation, detention and impounding of a vehicle, including the release of the vehicle upon payment of the payment deposit concerned and any release and storage fee and, where the payment deposit remains unpaid, the disposal of the vehicle and any load on it and any fees relating thereto;(b) satisfactory arrangements for payment, after any deduction for fees referred to in paragraph (a), where appropriate, of the amount obtained from disposal of the vehicle or its load, to the appropriate person;(c) the recovery of the difference from the appropriate person, if the amount obtained after such disposal is less than the amount due for fees referred to in paragraph (a).(11) A member of the Garda Síochána or a transport officer may, for the purposes of this section and any regulations made under it, give directions to the driver or person in charge of a vehicle served with a payment deposit notice or a prohibition notice (including directions requiring or permitting the movement of the vehicle to such place as the member or officer may direct).(12) A person who fails to comply with a direction under this section commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding €2,000.(13) A person who, without the permission of a member of the Garda Síochána or a transport officer—(a) drives or attempts to drive a vehicle—(i) in respect of which a prohibition notice has been served, or(ii) to which an immobilisation notice has been affixed or which has been immobilised, detained or impounded,under subsection (8), or(b) where the vehicle has been immobilised, detained or impounded under subsection (8), interferes with or removes any immobilisation device attached to the vehicle, or removes or attempts to remove the vehicle, commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding €5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or to both.(14) A member of the Garda Síochána may arrest without warrant a person who in the member's opinion is committing or has committed an offence under this section.(15) Where a person who has paid a payment deposit and has also been served with a fixed charge notice relating to the same alleged offence agrees to make payment of the fixed charge specified in the fixed charge notice, any amount paid by the person in respect of the payment deposit shall be deemed to be payment or part payment, as the case may be, made in respect of the fixed charge. The remainder (if any) shall be returned to the person.(16) Where, in proceedings for an offence to which this section applies, a person is convicted any payment deposit he or she has paid shall be applied towards payment of any fine imposed. The remainder (if any) shall be returned to the person in accordance with regulations.(17) Where, in proceedings for an offence to which this section applies, the person is not convicted any payment deposit he or she has paid shall be returned to the person in accordance with regulations.(18) Where proceedings are not brought or, if brought, are withdrawn or otherwise discontinued in respect of an offence to which this section applies, any payment deposit paid by the person concerned shall be returned to the person in accordance with regulations.(19) A transport officer when exercising any power conferred on him or her under this section shall produce his or her warrant of appointment as such under section 15(1) (inserted by section 117 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008) of the Road Transport Act 1986.(20) In this section—"fixed charge", "fixed charge notice" and "fixed charge offence" have the meanings given to them, respectively, in section 47;"prescribed" means prescribed by regulations;"regulations" means regulations made by the Minister;"transport officer" means a person appointed under section 15(1) (inserted by section 117 of the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008) of the Road Transport Act 1986 to be a transport officer.".I indicated on Committee Stage that I was planning to introduce, subject to obtaining clarification on a small number of issues, the amendment I have now moved.  I regret that time has not permitted the full briefing of Members on the substantive issues included in the amendment, but hopefully I can explain them sufficiently now.  We sent a note inquiring whether Deputies needed any clarification on what we were trying to achieve here.This amendment arises because of the number of foreign drivers from the Continent, who may be caught for a variety of offences we have outlined, who because of the current situation escape paying fines.  We propose to put in place a payment deposit scheme that will deal with issues, focused on drivers' hours, tachographs, haulage operation offences and so on, in order to ensure there is a level playing field for everybody in the country.Provision has already been made in the Road Traffic Bill to include offences under the Road Transport Act 1933 not tried on indictment and under any regulation made under the European Communities Act 1972 within the fixed charge system to assist in the enforcement of those offences by both the Garda Síochána and the RSA's transport officers.The main purpose of the proposed enabling provision is to provide for the payment by the driver or registered owner of a vehicle, in respect of certain detected road transport offences — initially those offences relating to driver's hours, tachographs and operator licensing — at the roadside, and as a condition of permitting the vehicle to resume its journey, to a member of the Garda Síochána or an RSA transport officer of a sum of money — either a fixed charge, if appropriate to the offence, or a deposit against any fine that may be imposed by a court in a subsequent prosecution.  It will also provide for the immobilisation or detention of the vehicle, where a fixed charge or deposit is not paid, until such time as payment is made.  It is proposed that any payment deposit received will be treated as a fixed charge or as a deposit against a prosecution and will default to being a deposit against any fine imposed by the courts if no selection is made by the driver or registered owner within the prescribed period of time.Where a prosecution is not taken, the State would return the payment deposit, but not the fixed charge that has been accepted by the driver or registered owner and the same applies where a prosecution is taken but the driver or registered owner is not convicted.  Where a prosecution is taken and the amount of the fine imposed by the court on conviction is less than the payment deposit, the State would return the balance of the payment deposit.  If the fine imposed by the court is greater than the payment deposit, the driver or registered owner will have to pay the balance.  Any penalty points to be endorsed would be so endorsed on payment of the fixed charge or following a conviction in court.The drafting of the proposed enabling provision has been the subject of extensive consultation with the key stakeholders, including the Garda Síochána, the Courts Service, the Department of Justice and Law Reform, the Road Safety Authority and the Office of the Attorney General.  It had been intended to introduce the proposed amendment on Committee Stage, but due to the complexities involved in drafting the enabling provision, it was not possible to introduce it at that time.

What range of deposits are we talking about in this regard?  I note there are no regulations on deposits provided at the end of the Bill and that the Minister has not provided for additional tables relating to how this will operate in practice.  What kind of payments are we talking about?  It is past time the State began to invigilate heavy goods vehicles, HGVs, properly.  I am aware they are part of an important industry and play an important role in our economy.  There has been a feeling that the working time directive has been flagrantly ignored and that tachographs have not been properly invigilated.  There has been criticism in this regard from PARC and other campaigners.  They have complained that at one stage we only had two gardaí in the country who could read the tachographs.  There is evidence in this area from the British road safety authority, the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency, VOSA.  It has consistently registered a high level of defective Irish HGVs.  VOSA's 2007 survey found that over half of our vehicles were defective.The Minister has introduced transport officers and has promoted the general development of powers for checkpoints at which a transport officer is present.  Most people would agree that we must get this right.  Other countries seem to have a more effective system, although some countries mirror Ireland.  I recall a discussion of the new European legislation on European bus companies, such as Polish bus companies, and on European HGV operators at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport.  At that stage, our system did not seem to offer any kind of invigilation.  Tragically, HGVs have been involved in some horrendous collisions and have been responsible for a significant number of deaths.  It is important that the working time directive is observed and that vehicles operating on our roads are in top class condition.We did not get a briefing note on this amendment, but we had asked the Minister to do something in this regard.  I have an amendment later which proposes action in this regard.  This amendment is a first step in the effort to invigilate this area and is important for the country and the economy.  We must ensure this area is run on the highest possible standards.  The Minister seems to have covered most of the key points, but will there be a schedule of payments and what will these involve in practice?

We must come into line with what is happening in Europe, although I know there are not as many lorries doing business on our roads as we would like now.  As I said on Committee Stage, I have noticed a marked improvement with regard to enforcement of regulations in this regard and have seen lorries being pulled in for checks.  I urge the Minister to do everything in his power to get everything in line and to encourage lorry drivers.  Drivers need help and some of them must work around the clock to make a living.  A few hours sleep never did drivers any harm and they will still arrive on time.  We have a bad reputation in Europe and we must get ourselves into line in this regard.  Fine Gael will support that.  We have raised the issue further down the line, but I will leave it to the Minister.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	476	I am glad to make a short contribution to this debate.  I come from the west of Ireland, where tourism is very important and where as many people are employed in tourism as in other industries.  I come from a town that has 11 hotels and certainly, over the years, we have promoted our product.  We have a great product and places such as Westport should be used as an example of how one brings tourists into an area.  At a time when the town had two or three hotels, planning permission was required from the council to build additional hotels and people stated they would not survive.  However, what happened was that it made them more competitive and caused them to increase their efforts to sell their product.  As someone who lives in the town of Westport, I have noted the number of people who have visited it in recent weekends.  Those who do so come for two or three reasons, namely, to get value for money, to visit a most beautiful part of the country and because all the hotels are providing greater value for money.  While they may not be making much money, at least they are trying to sell a product and to bring people into the area.This evening, I wish to raise a few issues that the Minister should consider.  First, she must talk to local authorities.  They are not helping or promoting business in Ireland.  At all times, they think businesses are soft touches, regardless of whether they are big or small.  However, the day has gone when small businesses, such as hotels or those involved in the food industry or in tourism itself, can be a soft touch whereby local authorities in need of funding can simply levy that charge on them.  Local authorities must learn to live in the real world.  Businesses are struggling at present and are under pressure.However, our tourism product is great.  I believe I have only left this country once in 30 years.  Personally, I go to County Kerry, which I love, as I do west Cork.  I would holiday in my own locality but given the job I am in, I simply cannot do so.  Nevertheless, Ireland has a great product.  Although we may not have the weather, we have the facilities.  One can golf, swim or walk.  The Minister's colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, visited Westport recently and provided some departmental funding for walks under the smarter travel initiative.  The Minister should see the walks that have been established around the town of Westport, as well as the number of people who visit from outside the county or the locality to sample these walks.  The things that people want are all simple.  The number of people who are cycling and are using such facilities is wonderful.My point to the Minister this evening is that she must consider ways to try to help and support people in the hotel industry in particular with an emphasis on rates.  Ways and means of reducing rates for such hotels must be considered.  The expectations on such establishments are highly unfair in some cases, as some of them open for six months per year while others open throughout the year.  They are crippled by water charges, rates and stealth taxes.  Such businesses should be helped because they will be needed to get people back into the workplace, to promote our counties and country and to induce people to visit them.  The Minister must speak to the Minister for Finance, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the local authorities to discontinue all the stealth taxes levied on small businesses.  Tourism will be the product that will get more people into the workplace.  It will play its part in getting us out of the current recession.  We have the product, the country and the people and all that is needed is some support from the Government to help and promote businesses.
#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	477	I support the motion tabled by Deputy Upton on behalf of the Labour Party.  It is timely in the sense that figures for the past 12 to 18 months show a reduction in the number of tourists coming to Ireland.  The essential point of this motion is that the Government cannot simply sit on its hands and cite the amount of money that has been spent on marketing and so on.  We have wonderful resources for tourism.  Like Deputy Ring, I am from County Mayo and from the west of Ireland and one great aspect of tourism is that many of the resources are located in places that are on the periphery, rather than in core areas.  However, it is important that features such as landscape, beaches, water, activities, culture, sport, music or whatever all must be marketed to the maximum.  My question is whether they all being marketed in the proper manner.  While I am sure the Minister will cite figures on how much has been spent, could it be spent better?  Could it be spent on a regional or local basis?  I have in mind a few local and particular examples, such as the Ballina Salmon Festival, which was launched last week and which has a branding.  In other words, I refer to the branding associated with particular areas.  The Volvo ocean race event in Galway last year was driven and derived its sense of identity from the local area.  As for the millions of people in the Irish diaspora abroad, sometimes the connection is better made from a local area rather than on a wider scale as a target that is too wide sometimes tends to be missed.As Ireland is an island nation, the importance of accessibility is huge and the air travel tax has been a contributory factor.  While the Minister makes the point that it is not the major factor, it is a contributory factor.  For example, I wish to illustrate the importance of Ireland West Airport Knock as a contributor to tourism in the west.  Goodbody Stockbrokers drew up a study for the airport recently, which revealed that 190,000 inbound tourists passed through the airport in 2009, spending a total of €62 million.  This supported almost 800 jobs directly and indirectly and the potential in this regard is enormous.  For example, there is a potential for €1.5 billion in revenue and 2.5 million bed nights in the region.  Members can imagine the boom this would bring, were it possible to exploit it, both in County Mayo and throughout the west and north west.  Moreover, this example pertains to one small regional airport.  For all this to happen, the Government must be proactive, inventive and supportive of the tourism industry and I fully support this motion.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	478	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  The fact that 35,000 jobs were lost last year from the tourism and food industries serves as an example of the impact on this country of 1 million fewer tourists.  This downturn clearly was caused by the economic problems in the marketplace.  However, to some degree it also was caused by the travel tax and the State's failure to provide proper broadband in more rural areas, which is absolutely essential for tourism and constitutes a major disadvantage for small hotels and guesthouses.The fact that Graeme McDowell won the US Open the other day cannot be ignored.  He and Pádraig Harrington are fantastic examples of what can be done for Ireland and for the portrayal of Ireland as the world's golfing Mecca.  We must ensure that the recent great win and these great statesmen are used to our advantage.Some people come to Northern Ireland just to see the Giant's Causeway and Belfast.  In the current peaceful situation, I urge the Minister to ensure that Border areas are properly promoted by cross-Border structures.  I was in Belfast the other day and was impressed by the tremendous willingness to co-operate among Government agencies.  We must make proper use of that.  ICBAN, the Irish Central Border Area Network, and the east Border region are already promoting that.I welcome the fact that Bord Fáilte is considering taking Cavan and Monaghan out of the western region, which includes Donegal and Sligo, because we never got fair play there.  When the new region is set up, I hope a better effort will be made to promote tourism because we have much to offer.  We have 11 first class hotels, from the Slieve Russell in Ballyconnell to the Nuremore in Carrickmacross and all in between.  There is also tremendous lakeland, hills, walks and many other attractions and facilities such as Castle Leslie.  I could go on.  People try to make out that there are not tourist attractions in those areas but we have the hotel structures along the Border area.  We can work with Northern Ireland.  I urge the Minister to ensure that when she is engaged in cross-Border talks that we maximise INTERREG and other funds to build up a tourism industry of which we can be proud.  I wish her well in that job.

We are all familiar with the phrase "only an hour from Dublin".  At the time when Navan was only an hour from Dublin, Galway was three and a half hours from Dublin.  In its advertisements in the newspapers a well-known Clifden hotel is now saying it is only two hours from Dublin to Galway.The new M6 motorway might not be counted as direct investment in tourism but those in the tourism industry can see its value and potential.  When we refer to investment in the tourism industry let us look at the broad range of service and infrastructural development in Ireland.  These developments, including the M6 across from the east to the west coast, make travel easier and quicker and that helps tourism.  The new motorway from Shannon to Galway will be another important link for tourism in my part of the country.  If we could get the outer bypass of Galway city developed, the hotelier in Clifden could tell people that the journey from Dublin to Connemara is even shorter.There have been major investments by Government in recent years that will benefit tourism in my part of the country and elsewhere.  It is to the Government's credit that the budget directly given to the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport this year, in effect, remains the same as it was last year despite the economic difficulties.  There has been a fall-off in tourism in 2009 but, unfortunately, it comes against a backdrop of what has been described by leading economists as the worst international economic recession since 1932.  Such a major economic change would have to be reflected in the tourism sector and similar type reductions have occurred in leading tourism destinations such as Cyprus, Greece and the Iberian Peninsula.  The figures for the first quarter of this year when, unfortunately, we have had a 22% decrease in numbers, must be seen in context.  The severe weather in the early months of 2010 curtailed travel and the volcanic ash crisis followed that.  However, the industry remains resourceful.Examples of that are evident in my region in Galway.  The group "Lets do it Galway" had a major task on hand when it set out to bring the Volvo Ocean Race to Galway, but it was successful and it did it a second time.  The Government and Taoiseach gave them strong support.  I compliment the Taoiseach who provided €8 million when he was Minister for Finance for the 2009 Volvo Ocean Race to support Galway.  That must be acknowledged.  It is estimated that the Volvo Ocean Race Galway stopover had an economic impact of more than €55 million in this country.  There were approximately 45,000 visitors from this country and more than 40,000 overseas visitors in Galway for the occasion.  There was a worldwide television audience in excess of 1 billion looking at events in Galway.  That came from a great local initiative in Galway.  It is worth noting that a survey shows 99% of those who came to Galway for the event said they would like to come back.  They will have an opportunity in two years' time when the race comes to Galway again.  The Government strongly supported the campaign for the 2012 Volvo race stopover and has committed funding of approximately €4 million to the event.  I congratulate the chairman of "Lets do it Galway", John Killeen, on being made a freeman of Galway city recently.Going further west into Connemara, I see that the campaign "Wild at Heart" is extending its work and holding an important meeting in Oughterard next Wednesday.  That is a very good concept which is being strongly supported by Fáilte Ireland.  It is linking up different groups such as hoteliers and activity centres to carry out marketing in co-operation with each other.  The "Wild at Heart" campaign also helps with training in aspects of the industry such as Internet marketing and ecotourism.  The funding for "Wild at Heart" is based on a 50% contribution from the local tourism sector and 50% from Fáilte Ireland.As in all sectors, Fáilte Ireland has had to do with less money, but it is using what it has well.  A total of 120 people from the tourism sector locally attended a seminar on Internet marketing organised by Fáilte Ireland western region in Galway last week.  The seminar was wholly funded by Fáilte Ireland.  That is a local example of the national strategy to provide advice and training on the use of the Internet in the tourism sector.  A total of €11 million has been allocated in direct support for training and advice of this kind for the industry in 2010.The broadband services that are needed are coming on-stream.  The Government's strategy — in tandem with the 3 company — to bring broadband to all parts of the country is bearing fruit.  Only last week I heard news from communities west of the towering Twelve Bens in Connemara that their broadband services had improved greatly.  All sectors would like more money but the €44 million available for the tourism marketing fund this year is a considerable sum in the current economic circumstances.I am confident that the initiatives such as I outlined in Galway will continue to energise tourism despite difficulties.  I expect the Government will support such initiatives as strongly as possible in the current economic environment.  In flying the home flag I remind Members that it is only two hours from Galway to Dublin.
#PeterKellyFF	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-party	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-dob	unknown-#PeterKellyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	482	The current economic climate has impacted the numbers of people travelling globally, not just in Ireland.  The US and most European countries are in recession.  People have lost their jobs and have seen their living standards fall both at home and abroad.  Naturally, that has had an enormous impact on the tourism industry.  The CSO statistics published in May last showed that tourism numbers have dropped by 22% on the 2009 levels.  That is hugely disappointing, but it must be viewed in the broader context of the global downturn.The weather last winter provided a setback for the industry, which was already facing significant challenges.  First, we had the arctic weather conditions at the beginning of the year and then the freakish volcanic ash incident saw European air space on virtual shutdown for several weeks.  Those events were unforeseeable but unfortunately they provided another setback to an industry already struggling.  With that kind of a start 2010 was always going to be a challenging year for tourism.  The Government and its agencies are working extremely hard to tackle those challenges and maximise business for the tourism industry.  The Government believes that a vibrant tourism sector is vital for economic renewal, which is the reason the tourism budget was increased last year by 3% even though there was severe pressure on the public finances.  That has ensured the State agencies have received support to market Ireland, support festival and sporting events and to attract business people to come here.To assist the tourism sector, an extensive range of marketing, product development, festival and sporting events, training and business supports are being put in place by the tourism State agencies under the tourism services budget of the Department.  Earlier this year the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, Deputy Hanafin, launched a €20 million marketing campaign designed to attract overseas tourists to this country.  The campaign involves hundreds of tourism businesses including B&Bs, hotels, golf courses and national institutions.Fáilte Ireland is working across five regions and has a budget of €4 million to encourage people to holiday at home this year.  This campaign is centred on family promotions and offers, available both on-line and through a special offers brochure.  The tourism industry has responded remarkably well to the recession.  Businesses have reduced their prices, become more competitive and are devising imaginative and good-value offers to attract and retain visitors.  Special offers, such as early-bird menus, mid-week special offers and family deals, are helping the industry to meet the challenges it faces head-on.A Fáilte Ireland survey in The Irish Times found that 81% of people with children favour an Irish break.  Forty-three per cent indicated they may take to foreign shores.  The importance of the domestic market cannot be underestimated as it accounts for 65% of business in the intensely competitive hotel market.  Recent research has indicated that Irish people now see Ireland as a good-value destination, with consumers acknowledging the excellent offers and value for money now available in the market.Ógra Fianna Fáil is doing its bit.  A group of energetic young people is involved in a countrywide promotional campaign to encourage people to holiday at home.  Its website, eye-catching postcards and literature are well designed and humorous.  I commend the group on its enthusiasm and their initiative.There are over 200,000 people working in the tourism sector in Ireland.  Overseas tourism alone contributes some €4 billion per year to the economies on this island.  It is an extremely important sector.  The recent report of the tourism renewal group has highlighted that marketing, along with renewed investment in the tourism product, including in respect of accommodation, food, attractions and support services, is vital to sustain and grow the sector.We have a great product to sell.  Our sports facilities, transport infrastructure, the new national conference centre and our cultural attractions are all great additions to the Irish brand.  However, we must remain competitive and the industry is addressing this challenge.I invite Members to the beautiful, natural harbour in the picturesque village of Clondra, County Longford, where the Royal Canal will be opened on 30 September 2010.  It will be a very historic occasion in the Thirty-two Counties and will be attended by a Minister from the North and the South.  There has been a €1 million investment in the harbour.  The canal runs from Clondra all the way to Dublin.Members should not forget the Johnny Keenan banjo festival this September in Longford town.  If they have time this Sunday, they should come to Lanesboro on the River Shannon in County Longford and see the powerboats.  They should come to Longford for the weekend.  It has great bars and restaurants.  Next Sunday, Longford will play Mayo in Pearse Park in Longford town.  The people of Longford offer céad míle fáilte to all their Mayo friends on both sides of the House.  That is all the good news.  The bad news for Mayo is that I predict a Longford win.

Coming from a county such as Mayo, which has a great number of tourist attractions, I realise Mayo can more than compete with Longford.  With the manager of the Mayo team opposite me, I will definitely not agree with Deputy Kelly's statement.  There is no doubt that Mayo will be victorious in Longford next Saturday.I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important debate.  Coming from a county that depends so much on tourism, I am particularly conscious of the role it plays in economic renewal.  I compliment the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, who I believe can make a significant change in this area, which is of such considerable importance to the economy.  We know its importance because it accounts for 4% of GNP, employs 200,000, brings in revenue of €4 billion and tax earnings of €1.3 billion.  This gives us some idea of the significance of tourism to the economy.  It is important that we have a Minister driving tourism at the Cabinet table.  We have such a Minister in Deputy Hanafin.I welcome the fact that the Government has placed tourism at the centre of its plans.  It is very much part of the framework in Building Ireland's Smart Economy.  It formed a very significant part of the global Irish Economic Forum in September.  The Taoiseach, in his recent speech on employment policy, stated tourism is one of the ten areas of the Government's economic renewal plan.In last year's budget, tourism services comprised one of the few areas that secured an increase.  Its increase amounted to 3%, bringing the spend in that area to €153 million.Let me outline important initiatives.  The employment subsidy scheme was open to the tourism sector and many hotels in County Mayo applied and were successful under it.  I would like to see a further round of the scheme because it played a very significant part in maintaining jobs in the hotel and tourism sectors generally that might otherwise have been lost.There are a few areas on which I want to focus that are causing considerable problems for the tourism industry.  The first concerns the implications of NAMA and NAMA-run hotels for the industry.  I am conscious of this because I am from a county with a great number of family-run hotels.  The reason the hospitality and tourism sectors were such a success in Ireland was that they were very much dominated by family-run businesses.  When people come to Ireland to experience the tourism product, they remember the family-run hotels.  The very idea of NAMA running hotels will cause a problem.  There is over-capacity in the marketplace.  Bearing in mind that the price of hotel rooms is being driven down, which is welcome in terms of attracting visitors, it will be an awful shame if some of the NAMA hotels succeed while driving many family-run hotels out of business.It is not that I am trying to see any hotel closed down because I am not; I am just saying we must be very conscious of this.  When NAMA is dealing with hotels, we must protect the family-run hotels that have been with us for 30 or 40 years, and sometimes longer.  Family-run hotels are a feature in County Mayo.  I have spoken to the Irish Hotels Federation on this matter and know my concern is shared throughout the country.The supply of credit to family-run businesses is a serious issue.  Recently, despite the fact that banks are protesting they are providing money to viable businesses, they have in reality cut back severely on the working capital and overdraft facilities of many businesses.  They have told the businesses that their overdraft facilities will be reduced and have asked them to convert those facilities to term loan facilities and work with a much smaller overdraft facility.  The banks say they will extend money to viable businesses.With regard to the appeal system in respect of credit supply, how does one assess a viable business?  If one evaluates many retail businesses and individuals in the tourism sector over a period of only six to 12 months, one will find that none is or very few are viable.  However, how can one argue that businesses that may have been in existence for 30 or 40 years do not have a viable future, certainly in the medium term?  We must be aware that banks have been involved in some sharp practice, and this is making it very difficult for businesses to continue.  The support given by the Government to the banking sector out of necessity to stabilise it must not be given at the cost of putting out of business many small businesses, particularly those in the tourism sector.The issue of rates has been raised.  There is a great burden on businesses because of the fixed charges imposed by the Government and local authorities.  Rates play a considerable role in this regard.  There is a double dilemma because local authorities are starved of money also.  They are trying to derive revenue from rates but this is putting massive pressure on the business community.  We must determine a mechanism to deal with this.  There is no flexibility regarding the payment of fixed charges.  If we could do something to help, by way of having a deferral or discount system applying to rates, it would make a massive difference to the tourism sector.  If this alone could be addressed tonight, it would be a very positive step.

It has set up a website, holdayathome.ie, and is promoting all the towns and counties in Ireland as destinations for holidaying at home.  It has issued a postcard and has a poster campaign.  I commend it on the campaign.  It is only right that is said here.I welcome the opportunity to voice my concerns about, and support for, the tourism industry through Private Members' Business this evening.  I commend the Labour Party on bringing forward its motion, hence bringing the importance of tourism into focus here this evening.  I concur with the sentiments expressed yesterday evening by the Minister, Deputy Hanafin,  in that this industry will rise to the challenges and come out of this downturn even stronger than before.  In recent times, with the good weather there are signs of that, particularly with the idea of holidaying at home.Tourism is something about which I am passionate.  It is an industry that affects every small village and town in rural Ireland, every one of which is going through difficulty at present.  We have a great deal to offer as a country in terms of tourism.  We have a most stunning landscape, not least in my home county of Donegal.  We have unspoilt beaches and amenities.  We have a rugged coastline offering breathtaking views.  We have all the natural beauty for which any tourist could yearn.  We must ensure now more than ever that we are competitive in order to remain successful.Naturally, our tourism industry is being affected by the domestic economic situation but it must be realised that much of the tourism comes from external markets that are experiencing similar economic difficulties.  Tourism figures are down all over Europe and the US.  The number of overseas visitors to Ireland declined by almost 12% in 2009, which is difficult for the industry to endure.  However, according to recent reports, particularly the OECD report, Malta, Hungary, Cyprus, Greece and Finland have experienced higher reductions in visitor numbers, and France, Portugal and Spain have experienced reductions of between 8% and 12%.  To further compound the frustration being felt by the industry, the first quarter of this year saw very difficult weather conditions, as mentioned earlier.  The eruption of the volcano in Iceland, in particular, compounded travel restrictions.On a more positive note, more than 60% of our overseas visitors normally come between May and September.  Tourism Ireland has been hard at work overseas selling the Ireland brand.  As others mentioned earlier, the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, launched a €20 million summer marketing campaign on behalf of Tourism Ireland, which targets our key markets, such as the UK, the US and Germany, to attract as much business as possible during the peak season.  Fáilte Ireland is continually working with the industry to engage the Irish holidaymaker with attractive and accessible offers, highlighting the value and quality available in the country.  I welcome the bed and breakfast accommodation revitalisation programme which is being rolled out by Fáilte Ireland, a tourism feature that is unique to Ireland.I sense that many more Irish people intend to holiday at home this year, and this trend must be captured and encouraged by the industry.  Having holidayed at home for the past couple of years given that I have a young family, I concur with the sentiments expressed by some of my Mayo colleagues.  I have been there recently, and there is certainly good bang for your buck in Westport at present.Many overlook the inherent beauty of our country and the natural assets that are being utilised for the benefit of the tourist.  Those involved in the industry should be competitive in terms of value; tourists will appreciate it and it will pay us dividends in the future.  We priced ourselves out of the market in terms of tourism.  Unfortunately, we were too expensive, but I think we are turning that around.Our welcoming and friendly nature is widely recognised throughout the world and is something that should be encouraged.  It is one of our strong assets.  More can be done by communities to market themselves as a destination.  Too often, individual amenities do a solo run in terms of marketing which does little to encourage tourists into an area.  The general action of a tourist in this modern era is to research their destination on the web.  It is important that complete sources of information on various geographical areas are available on the web to make research simple.  Each amenity in any area should be viewed as complementing each other rather than in competition with each other.  I would consider this a simple measure easily enforced by any community, and one that can make a difference.I commend the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, on taking the step to chair the new renewal implementation group which is to be established to ensure the recommendations of the renewal group are implemented.  This Government has put tourism to the top of the agenda and will continue to do so, and I support the amendment to the motion.

Like my colleague, I thank the Labour Party for initiating the discussion.  I would not agree with much of what is in its motion and clearly that is why I will be supporting the amendment.  We have achieved a lot and, obviously, we have a great deal more to do——

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	488	——and I am sure we will continue in that regard.To me, tourism is a vital cog in the economy as I come from a county which benefits from the level of tourism activity, whether it be through the airport or through the many tourism facilities and products.  The Deputies across the way, as two Clare persons, will be familiar with the facilities that we have in the county.There is a domestic and an overseas component to tourism and often the capacity of overseas tourism in terms of inward investment is underestimated.  We spend much time talking about trying to ensure we get foreign direct investment to support job creation.  Tourism does that in a benign, but yet important, way in maintaining people in their local communities and we must focus much more on attracting people to this country and encouraging people to stay here.The downturn in our economy will resolve the domestic component of it.  People will not be as anxious to take the weekend breaks that were available through low fares.  While the exit from the country was relatively cheap, it was not cheap to visit well-known tourism destinations such as Barcelona for the weekend.  There is a greater realisation among the public now that one can have a good time at home.  One can retain money in the economy and still have a good time.We have a job to do, even in convincing the media.  I was taken aback when the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, was appointed to her current post and the media tried to suggest it was a downgrading, a demotion, of her role.  It was nothing like that.  It was a recognition that somebody with her stature and skill was needed to deal with an important component of the economy.  She has taken up that challenge and is working extremely well with it, and we look forward to seeing many more of her initiatives in terms of ensuring that vital part of our economy is exploited to a much greater extent.  The exploitation that must come forward here is the development of our tourism product.  We go back to the great innovators of the past and look to persons such as Dr. Brendan O'Regan, with whom many would be familiar, who was instrumental in developing many of the attractions within the Shannon region.  I refer to the Bunratty Folk Park, the medieval experience at Bunratty Castle, the development of the Old Ground Hotel and other iconic projects that attracted people to these shores.  That was then and this is now.  We must stop trying to sweat the asset that is already there.  Places such as the Cliffs of Moher are well recognised.  The various different experiences that have been around for some time are well recognised on the world stage.  We must be innovative.  We must put money behind the development of a new wave of product to attract people to this country.  We must, in my view, carry out a needs analysis of our tourism product.  We must look to existing and emerging trends in what attracts people to travel to various locations, and we must put money behind that.We must then create competition between the regions within the country.  We should not try to be all things to all men.  We should not try to do a little in each county; we must go for the big bang approach.  We must look at some of the more iconic-type attractor products, develop them on a regional basis, and build around that theme a support infrastructure from which we will benefit.  We will be successful with having a more strategic approach rather than the scatter-gun approach which was the way of the past whereby everyone got a small piece, almost like the sports capital programme, which works well because one needs a field, a playground and such facilities in each community.  That latter approach, in my view, does not work from a tourism point of view.  One needs a big attractor to get people into the regions and if we can do that, it will work well.There has been a good approach by the Government.  Just last week, the Taoiseach visited east County Clare and launched the Shannon region discount card, an effort by tourism operators to attract people into the region and give them value for money through a 25% discount at various centres.  This co-ordinated and visionary effort is concerned with ensuring people visit and stay in a region because of value for money.  It is not a question of making Ireland a cheap destination, but of giving value for money.  As other Deputies stated, value is returning to the market in terms of the reduction in the cost of labour and the more sensible approach taken by joint labour committees to Sunday trading, making it more accessible and, therefore, less expensive.The Taoiseach was also involved in the launch of the CANTATA project, a European programme in which funding is provided to assist bed and breakfasts and so on to build networks.  They can develop websites to allow them to market themselves in a micro way.  I also wish to be associated with the Ógra Fianna Fáil campaign, a fantastic idea in which many others have been involved previously.As Deputy Flynn stated, we must watch the costs.  The introduction of the €200 charge on second properties has been an extra burden on those who provide holiday homes in the sector.  Holiday homes used as tourism products instead of as private dwellings should get special treatment in terms of exemptions.

The various Fianna Fáil Deputies who spoke were in agreement with many of her proposals, but we want Government action on these issues.  By and large, a number of measures have received much cross-party support, but we need them to be implemented.  I will concentrate on the travel tax.  In the Minister's contribution last night, she indicated that she might be able to deal with this issue in some way.  Maybe I was being hopeful in reading into it that she would address the matter.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	494	The Minister, Deputy Hanafin, is not the Minister for Finance, but I will cite her colleague, Deputy Dooley, who stated that she had stature and skill.  I suggest she use these to get this insidious tax abolished forthwith, since it is doing so much damage.  Other Deputies referred to the example set by the Dutch and other European governments.  Statistical evidence suggests the tax does more harm than good, given its cost in terms of revenue lost to the tourism industry.  The Minister's tourism renewal group strongly urged the air travel tax's removal.  This consultative group was set up by the Government.  The chairman of Fáilte Ireland stated that the tax is costing the economy more than €30 million annually.  The Minister has plenty of ammunition for the tax's abolition to take to her ministerial colleague.I am concerned about my region of the mid-west in particular.  The tax has had a dramatic effect on Shannon Airport.  Michael O'Leary of Ryanair stated he would pull a number of routes out of Shannon mainly because of the travel tax.  Unfortunately, he pulled them.  We now have little connectivity between Shannon and mainland Europe.  We have flights to Britain and across the Atlantic, despite the bad announcements in respect of the latter recently.  The travel tax has had a significant adverse influence on Shannon Airport in particular.  The reduction in traffic through it is greater than at Dublin or Cork Airport.My colleague, Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, has been informed by EU transport Commissioner, Siim Kallas, that the latter is examining the travel tax and may believe it to be in breach of EU rules.  I hope it is in breach and that the Government will be forced to withdraw it, but I would prefer the Government to withdraw it voluntarily, given the negative effect the tax is having on tourism, particularly in the mid-west region.I wish to refer to one or two other matters.  I understand that the EU will next week issue a tourism policy on marketing the EU.  It describes the European tourism image as an ensemble.  In other words, the policy will market Europe.  This is a significant step and I would like Ireland to play a leading role.  I have the Asian market in particular in mind.  In Deputy Upton's policy document on behalf of the Labour Party, she singles out the potential within the Asian market, given the large size of its population.  Many Asian people visit Ireland, but one sees hordes of tourists from the East in European capitals.  We need them to visit Ireland.  We need to grow the Irish tourism product in Asia, as that is where the great potential for the future lies.  I urge that we take a lead in the European concept so that, while tourists might visit Paris or Rome, they would also visit Ireland.  We need to be in that loop.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13713	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	495	Our motion seeks to build the capacity of the tourism product and to take a more lateral view of its potential to create wealth and jobs and sustaining communities.  No longer can we rely solely on the US dollar and the busloads of Americans that graced traditional hotspots like Killarney and Bunratty.  We must diversify the product range.  The Labour Party motion, under the stewardship of Deputy Upton, seeks to develop Ireland's capacity as an eco-tourism destination.One of Ireland's natural advantages is the unspoiled 3,500 miles of coastline.  It is so indented that one is never more than 80 miles from the sea.  Add to this the 800 lakes and rivers.  Paddle sports like sea kayaking and river kayaking are, as yet, an untapped potential.  While organisations such as the Irish Sea Kayaking Association, ISKA, are active in promoting these sports, the time is right for them to be included in a new consultative process that develops capacity in this area.We have underestimated the potential for eco-tourism, particularly as a maritime nation.  The report of the tourism renewal group recognises the need for domestic marketing.  It states:Domestic demand has a vital role in helping enterprises survive the current international downturn and particularly the current negative impact of the sterling exchange rate on our largest and nearest market.  Similar arguments apply to the economic rationale for domestic as to international marketing. Domestic destinations compete directly with overseas destinations for Irish tourists.We take a more lateral view than that articulated in the review in respect of the marketing target.  Ireland always seems to tailor its product towards the UK or North American market.  The Labour Party believes that, in order to build the capacity of the tourism product, we must move away from the narrow focus of selling, for example, a weekend by the lakes of Killarney, although there is a market segment for that product.  We need to examine minority sports such as kayaking and develop them into segments.Given our natural environment and easy access to the sea, an eco-tourism product is there to be developed.  To assist this process, we must build a stakeholder model that allows groups such as the ISKA, which has led expeditions all over the world, to develop a product to encourage kayakers to visit this country.  Such organisations have the necessary contacts, intelligence gathering and viral networks to assist in creating a domestic and international product that will bring people to our shores.  I refer to sea-kayaking but we can develop a model for other such niche ecotourism products like surfing, mountaineering and hill-walking.  The idea is to bring these people in as part of the stakeholder process.These people have the necessary contacts on the international stage.  I have sea-kayaked and gone mountaineering in other parts of the world.  One does this through building up contacts through membership of various organisations.  We need to bring these people together as part of a stakeholder group to develop the product domestically and use those contacts in the existing marketing framework to slowly develop the markets we need in order to bring people to our shores.  This is taking a more lateral view of building products in niche areas.  That is the future for the specific ecotourism product this country has the potential to develop.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	496	Considering the range of subjects covered under tourism, what we are really talking about is how one markets one's country so that others will wish to visit.  In terms of sports, history or literature, we have everything.  We are a small but unique country.  If one goes to far-flung places like China and mentions Ireland, people know it for several reasons.  The first thing people know about Ireland is Joyce, the second is Roy Keane and the third is Blarney.  As a brand, Blarney is known throughout the world but despite this, its connection with Ireland, and the unique quality it holds in the psyche of people, it has been badly served by Fáilte Ireland.  People in Blarney want to know how much marketing goes into areas abroad.  This applies particularly to the United States and England, our natural markets.  One needs several elements and Blarney has them in abundance.  One needs a product to sell and a brand that is known.  I have seen people fight tooth and nail in court cases in order to retain a name or brand because they recognise the value of the brand and what it takes to put a brand in place.There is one tourist office in Blarney, which is sufficient.  The person who works there for 14 weeks of the year is extraordinarily helpful and is commended by everyone who uses the service.  The Minister heard me right, the office is open for 14 weeks of the year.  The days when people travelled only during the summer are long gone.  People now travel more during off-peak periods than during peak periods yet the tourist office in Blarney, one of our biggest marketing tools abroad, is open for 14 weeks.  If Fáilte Ireland could, it would hand it over to the local community because it does not think it can sustain the office.I was more than surprised when the people in the area came together and asked their public representatives to meet to ask how to ensure the tourism industry will continue in the Blarney area.  That is very sad and I could not believe when they told me the tourist office was under threat and is only open for 14 weeks of the year.  That was astonishing.  The brand, the product and the unique village, with a village square and all that goes with it, is in place.  As far as those promoting the village are aware, Fáilte Ireland representatives have never visited the area.  These people asked me to extend an invitation to the Minister to visit the area and see what is on offer.  Perhaps she will be able to persuade Fáilte Ireland to promote it.

I appeal to the Minister to visit the area.  She will be astonished at a unique group of people who are hard-working and prepared to put in whatever effort is necessary.  They find they are not getting the support they need from Fáilte Ireland.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	504	Ar an gcéad dul síos ba mhaith liom mo chomhghleachaí, an Teachta Mary Upton, a mholadh as ucht an doiciméad a d'fhoilsigh sí an mhí seo caite, Extending The Welcome: Labour's Plan to Sustain and Develop the Tourism Industry.  Tá an doiciméad sin ar fheabhas agus tá an rún atá os comhair na Dála bunaithe ar sin.I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Mary Upton, on the publication last month of her excellent document, Extending The Welcome: Labour's Plan to Sustain and Develop the Tourism Industry.  Deputy Upton is to be complimented on the motion, based on that document, before the House.  The greatest problem facing the country is unemployment.  This motion is about sustainable job creation and is both visionary and practical.  When implemented, it will make a significant contribution to our major national need, namely, jobs.  As usual, the Government is rejecting the motion based on that document for no reason other than that it did not come from the Government side.This is a particularly opportune time to discuss this in the context of the constituency of Waterford.  Yesterday we saw the rebirth of Waterford Crystal.  Some 18 months ago, the area was devastated by the closure of Waterford Crystal and its visitors' gallery.  Some 480 remaining jobs were lost, with terrible consequences for the workers and their families, but those providing ancillary services were also affected.  Tourism was badly hit in Waterford and throughout the region.  The large number of visitors to the visitors' gallery at Waterford Crystal no longer came.  In October 2006, a woman from Virginia became the 6 millionth visitor to the visitor centre.  Some 315,000 people visited every year.  When Waterford Crystal had problems, the Government was approached to contribute less than €40 million to help rescue the plant.  There were jobs in manufacturing and ancillary services but the related visitor numbers were of benefit to Waterford, the region and the country.  The Government decided not to assist.  It is a pity Waterford Crystal was not a bank because the Government seems to have endless money to throw in that direction.  The event yesterday happened through the initiative of the company that took over and the city council.Once again, crystal is being manufactured in Waterford and visitors will come back.  They are already coming back to the city, and they will move on then through the region.Joined up thinking is not something of which one could accuse this Government.  I will always believe the Government could have saved a great deal in Waterford had it not sat on its hands and decided to do nothing.The paper prepared by Deputy Mary Upton examines many of the practical shortcomings and it is interesting, and so damning of the Government, that the level of broadband penetration in the country arises again and again.  Deputy Upton makes the important point that we need the penetration in the rural areas because, as she rightly says, the bed and breakfast sector must be protected and developed.  It is obvious that, in the world we live in today, having a high level of broadband connectivity in rural areas will assist this industry that needs a great deal of help.  It is a basic industry when one considers that the Government allowed all the hotels to develop, many of them in the capital, but with deregulation and the cheap air flights, people were flying into Dublin for short holidays and not leaving.  There were issues regarding the tourists who brought their cars to Ireland on the ferries, particularly from the United Kingdom.  Everything was allowed to drift in that regard.  There was a lack of vision, control and knowing what was going on.Deputy Mary Upton's document seeks to redress problems such as the simple one involving tourists from the Far East facing virtually insurmountable problems in getting their visas to come to this country.  We have all had representations, as I am sure has the Minister, from that sector.  If that problem was addressed, it would improve the numbers coming here, which is what we want.  We want people to come here.  That is what tourism is about.I compliment Deputy Mary Upton.  I lament the fact that, as usual, the Government does not want to hear ideas.  It prefers to throw money at banks, but it is a pity it did not throw some of that money in the direction of Waterford Crystal at the opportune time.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	505	I, too, would like to congratulate Deputy Mary Upton on putting together a comprehensive motion and producing an excellent document extending the Labour Party's welcome proposals to sustain and develop the tourism industry, which she has published.As previous speakers said, there is much concern about the failure of the Government to take the appropriate action to create the environment necessary for promoting the tourism industry.  The statistics are stark.  Tourism generated €5.2 billion for the economy last year.  It is a vital part of our economy.  It constitutes 4% of GDP and created almost 120,000 jobs.  That was a drop of 12% on the previous year, and some 35,000 jobs have been lost as a result.  Almost one quarter of the jobs in the previous year were lost to the tourism industry, with 1 million fewer visitors.  It is clear that the industry is in freefall at present and it is vital that the Government acts to deal with the fundamental problems in the sector that are inhibiting potential growth and, more importantly, threatening the jobs that already exist.Last weekend, I attended the World Street Performance Championship event in Merrion Square here in Dublin.  It occupied the square and the surrounding streets.  The entire area was a blaze of colour with tents and marquees everywhere, street performers and people selling all sorts of food and goods.  Over 100,000 people, mainly families, attended and had a wonderful time.The idea was the brainchild of two young Dublin brothers.  Dublin City Council came on board, as did AIB, and created a major tourist event which will move to London this weekend and on to other European capital cities throughout the year.  It will return to Dublin and will operate on an annual basis.  However, despite the fact that this is the type of creative thinking and job creation that is required, to the best of my knowledge the Government and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation made no contribution to the event.  It was done on a shoestring by other agencies.  This was something of enormous benefit in terms of creating jobs in the area.There are numerous ways the Government can contribute substantially to creating the right environment for job creation and the tourism industry.  At the heart of the tourism industry are good communications.  Deputy O'Shea already spoke about broadband.  It is scandalous that we do not have the necessary broadband penetration essential for modern day tourism.  That has been pointed out over the years and nothing has been done.Likewise, interactive tourism applications for mobile Internet devices and computers are essential but we do not have them.  Better Internet access also allows different tourist amenities in an area to work together and support each other.  For example, why do we not have a WiFi directory that tourists can use?  Tourists are crying out for areas where they can access WiFi, and free WiFi.  Also, why are there no interactive maps for tourists to use as they travel around Ireland?  They would be enormously useful for tourists but there are none.  Simple ideas such as that would facilitate travellers in Ireland.We are an island nation but an air travel tax at the point of entry-exit is foolishly erecting barriers to overseas visitors.  This travel tax should be abolished.  It is not assisting the aim of getting money into the economy; it has the opposite effect.Despite the promises made in the past decade, Ireland still has little or no integrated ticketing system.  Every developed country in the world has managed to overcome that minor obstacle and introduce integrated ticketing.  It is available in all the capital cities in Europe.  It is essential that a person can hop on a bus and transfer to the Luas, DART and rail.  That should be a basic requirement in all our cities.  The Government has failed to take the necessary action to ensure that is available for tourists travelling the country.Another matter which has been referred to is the question of the obstacles to overseas tourists getting visas.  The Schengen Acquis was introduced not for the purpose of providing a barrier to tourism, but that is what it is doing.  All the countries that are part of the Schengen agreement — we are not part of it — are experiencing difficulty in having visa applications processed and substantial delays are occurring.  Most of the tourism would be from Europe, Britain and the United States and it must be remembered that there is a diaspora of 80 million that have to be tapped into, but on the other side of the world — China, Asia and the Middle East — huge numbers of potential tourists find it extremely difficult to get visas.  It is almost as though the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister's Department are trying to keep people out of Ireland in many cases rather than encouraging them to come here.Small and medium-sized businesses need funding to be able to operate in this area.  We have statements from the SME sector to the effect that funding is not coming through and the banks are not making credit available.  They need regular funding.  There are many operations dealing with tourism that need a steady flow of credit coming through, but that is not available.  It is high time the Government got its act together and stimulated this area.  It has not done so to date.

The tourism industry, all Members agree, is an important indigenous economic sector which has the potential to contribute to Ireland's economic recovery.  Several suggestions and proposals made by Deputies during the debate's course will be further considered.The Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, Deputy Hanafin, outlined the importance of the sector and the Government's determination to have in place policies and programmes to develop the industry.  The Government, the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport and the tourism agencies understand fully the unprecedented difficulties confronting tourism businesses.It is quite extraordinary when one examines the external environment facing Irish tourism since the start of 2008.  There has been retrenchment by domestic and overseas consumers in the face of the worst economic downturn since the 1930s.  Uncertainty in financial markets has affected the availability of credit along with fluctuating fuel costs, adverse currency movements, poor weather conditions in the early part of the year and a volcanic eruption.However, the Government has affirmed its confidence in the tourism industry and its ability to respond to these challenges.  Despite the pressure on the public purse, we maintained our investment in tourism and marketing.  The tourism agencies are doing all in their power to support industry partners through these difficult times.  Our marketing efforts will continue right through the summer in markets across the world.  There are innovative plans for the third quarter too.  The Minister will launch an intense autumn marketing drive towards the end of the summer.We need to be optimistic in our approach and bold in our thinking and strategies.  There are grounds for optimism.  We have on this island overcome far greater challenges which should help to motivate us in addressing the challenges we face in putting tourism on the path to recovery.The prize is a great one, consisting of a strong and sustainable future for this great industry of ours, for all those who work in it, for the communities at its heart and for all those who partner with us overseas.There are many related activities that support tourism.  One is the film industry in which the Irish Film Board, assisted by tax incentives, promotes film-making in Ireland, presenting a country that is interesting and beautiful to visit.  Another is culture and heritage, both of which are strong points across the island.  The Office of Public Works is conscious of the importance of the well-distributed archaeological and historical sites it manages and operates for the tourism industry and our important home visitors.Like agriculture, fisheries and forestry, tourism is an indigenous and employment-intensive industry.  There is no strong economy in the world, no matter how large, and no city that does not value its tourism industry and which would not be infinitely poorer without it.Ireland has much to offer.  While many of us like to travel abroad, we should also spend plenty of time enjoying different parts of our country, its festivals, parks, sites and amenities.  When launching the Fáilte Ireland summer home campaign, the Minister pointed out that four out of five Irish families with children are likely to take a holiday in Ireland this year.  For my part, I have always taken a home-holiday somewhere along the west coast from Cork to Sligo every year since my parents could first afford to book us into Mrs. Fitzgerald's bed and breakfast in Sneem in 1961.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	512	This debate is somewhat like going back to the future, rediscovering economic capacities that were fundamental to our development.  Now with the economic mess Fianna Fáil has delivered, these will become fundamental to our recovery.  Like in the 1980s, and other times, when Ireland faced serious economic challenges, we must go back to tried and trusted economic activities in which our competitive advantage is somewhat significant.Ireland has three great strengths in tourism, unparalleled elsewhere.  It has a cultural and sporting heritage.  Its landscapes and countryside are naturally beautiful and extremely attractive.  Members of many expatriate communities living in Ireland have reasons to get their relatives to visit them, while abroad a large number of people across the world with Irish associations want to visit Ireland.These key strengths leave us well positioned to use tourism as a key driver of economic recovery and job creation.  The Government, however, needs to get beyond the warm fluffy rhetoric and down to brass tacks.  It needs to take positive steps to remove the different obstacles holding back the tourism sector.Our key strengths also provide the opportunity to expand our tourism sector into newer and expanding high-value added areas such as eco-tourism.  While we have done well in providing sporting-tourism facilities such as golf courses, we have not yet tapped into the potential for younger tourists in areas such as walking and cycling.A negative image is associated with Ireland when it comes to walking and some other outdoor activities because of difficulties with access rights in remote parts of the country.  On the Continent, a strip no more than three to six feet wide is left in every field to allow access across it without presenting difficulties to local farmers and landowners.  I accept there have been negotiations about access rights in Ireland.  However, the image internationally is negative.  On top of this, it is too dangerous to walk and cycle on Irish main roads.  We have natural advantages to allow people to enjoy walking, cycling and other outdoor activities.  We need to ensure access and supports for them.The air travel tax needs to be removed.  Ireland is an island nation with most of its visitors arriving by plane.  Imposing a tourist tax on every visitor when they fly in and out, does nothing to improve our value for money reputation.  Given that most people book their airline flights on-line, the tax is very much in one's face when one sees the final cost of booking a flight to Ireland.Most western economies, from where the majority of our visitors come, are weak with incomes under pressure.  More than ever we need to take every available opportunity to restore our reputation as a value destination.In the 1980s, Ireland had a reputation as a top destination for good value holiday experiences, along with its attractive natural attributes.  Ireland also had many fine hotels and guest houses offering a wonderful and authentic Irish experience to visitors.  At the height of the economic boom, however, this was lost sight of.  Much of this had to do with the training of hotel catering staff.  If they are not from the area they are serving, they must be trained in highlighting its tourism potential.In a globalised world, visitors expect to be able to arrange their visit on-line from the comfort of their homes.  They want to check the site, view the rooms and the surrounds and to see what the property looks like.  They want to see images of the local restaurant where they might go to have an evening meal.When they come to Ireland, they will be unable to stay in contact with their people back home, their clients and colleagues.  Global communications technology and next generation broadband are at the centre of developments but Ireland is not yet at the races in this regard.  Despite a succession of Government reports and promises, we remain near the bottom of the class when it comes to broadband.  This undermines Ireland's attractiveness as a destination not only for tourists, but for much-needed investment and this is an area the Minister must examine.  The Labour Party has put forward several proposals for small businesses, which are the backbone of the tourism industry.  For example, we made proposals for a PRSI holiday for employers which take on new people and we have also put forward proposals to incentivise employment.  I note that, belatedly, this weekend, the Taoiseach picked up some of the Labour Party's policy decisions.  I welcome this development, even if it is not as comprehensive as we would have wished.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	513	I thank all the Members who have contributed to the debate.  In particular, I express my appreciation of the work of my colleague, Deputy Mary Upton, not only in presenting this motion to the House, but also in presenting and publishing an outstanding policy document for the Labour Party in this important area of tourism.I am disappointed my constituency colleague, the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, has not accepted the motion we tabled.  I would have expected the motion from the Labour Party to have been of assistance to her in fighting her corner for the tourism industry and its importance, especially at this time of the year.The motion is about jobs and getting people back to work.  Unlike the Government, the Labour Party does not believe it is possible to cut one's way out of a recession.  One cannot sink €22 billion into a zombie bank, such as Anglo Irish Bank, and expect such an approach to steer one out of recession.  The Labour Party has been consistent from the beginning.  The only way to get out of this recession is if we work our way out of it.  What is more, the people want to work their way out of it.Through its recklessness and privileging of vested interests before the national interest, this Fianna Fáil Government precipitated our economic disaster.  We were the first into recession and we will be the last out of it.  It will be deeper and our debts greater because of the mistakes it made and its mismanagement.However, this economic disaster is also a human disaster.  The hundreds of thousands of families and individuals affected by unemployment during this recession will be scarred, perhaps for years to come.  At present, there are 439,000 people on the live register, unemployed or under-employed.  The most recent quarterly national household survey shows that 41% of all people unemployed have been out of work for more than one year.  One in every three young men in the labour force is out of work.  More than 1,400 businesses went to the wall last year.The Labour Party first began discussing job creation, through investment in a school building programme and the retraining of construction workers in summer 2008, before the banking collapse.  Since then, we have proposed a series of practical measures to create jobs in our economy and to head off the emergence of long-term unemployment through training, work placement and work sharing schemes.  One such measure is a €1.15 billion jobs fund comprising three pillars: funding for infrastructure projects which are ready to go, such as school renovation, urban regeneration and flood reliefs that will create jobs and useful, lasting resources; up to 60,000 new education and training places that reflect our future skills needs, including 30,000 graduate and apprentice work placements; and investment for sectoral job strategies in green energy, tourism, agrifood, creative industries and other areas where we already have a competitive advantage.We have also proposed a PRSI holiday for employers who create new jobs that are filled by people who have been on the live register for six months or more.  We proposed this in April 2009.  Last week, the Government announced with much fanfare that it was finally adopting the same idea.  We proposed a new law to ban upward-only rent reviews for new and existing commercial leases to save jobs and viable businesses in the retail sector.  The Government voted down our proposed legislation.  We proposed a State investment bank that would provide investment capital for new start-ups and to expand existing, home-grown industries.  All of these ideas have been costed.  We believe they are affordable and that we cannot afford to do nothing.  Every person on the dole for a year costs the Exchequer €20,000 in welfare benefits and lost taxes.  That money would be better invested in getting such a person back into sustainable employment.The Labour Party's latest policy blueprint for the tourism industry, published by Deputy Upton, contains 29 practical suggestions for sustaining and growing one of our most important sectors.  Some 15 of these ideas are put forward in this motion.  These include the abolition or reduction of the travel tax, which arguably costs more in lost tourism revenue than it raises; protection of the tourism marketing budget as a key instrument in developing new tourism markets, for example, in Asia; and a strategy to deal with the phenomenon of zombie hotels, which had been encouraged as a tax avoidance mechanism by the Fianna Fáil Government.As my Labour Party colleague, Deputy Mary Upton, highlighted, the tourism sector in Ireland is a major employer.  In 2009, the tourism industry employed almost 120,000 people and contributed €1.2 billion in tax revenues.  It is a truly national industry, employing people in every corner of the country across a range of age and skill levels.  What is more, we are aware that we have a good tourism product.  Despite the fall in tourism numbers in recent years, tourism has been a domestic success story underpinned by small businesses and entrepreneurs.One point often missed in high-flown lip-service paid to the smart economy is that a smarter economy has to stretch from the grassroots up as well as from cloud computing down.  The Labour Party's policy blueprint highlights several ways in which we can improve the delivery and marketing of our tourism product through mobile applications, better integration of services on the web, specific web portals for popular activities in Ireland, such as surfing or golf, and better penetration of broadband such that rural businesses can take full advantage of the Internet.We welcome the Government's statements on the smart economy and green technology but thus far statements are all we have got.  While this Government is highlighting what it will do, it is ignoring the economic winners we have on our own doorstep.  This is why the Labour Party has been advocating sectoral job strategies which consider how we can expand existing, successful industries, such as tourism and food and culture.  Ireland has great potential in emerging industries, such as clean tech.  The Labour Party has put forward a strategy in our 2009 policy document, The Energy Revolution.  However, it will take time to grow these new, high-tech sectors, some of which are still in their infancy.  In contrast, we can create the conditions to grow established, nationwide industries relatively quickly.Tourism, for example, does not require further expensive infrastructure or lengthy lead-in times.  It takes advantage of skills which our labour force already has well honed, such as customer service, food production and information technology skills, to name but a few.  If we do this right, it is a sustainable source of jobs, both environmentally and in its longevity.  If we steward our tourism industry well, it will prove to be an immensely valuable renewable resource.No one in the House believes repairing our economy will be easy.  However, it will be impossible if we do not staunch the loss of jobs throughout our economy and if we do not take urgent measures to prevent mass long-term unemployment.  That is the critical purpose of this motion and I call on every Deputy on the Government benches to consider carefully his or her response to the Labour Party's positive, job-focused proposals on the tourism industry.

In page 48, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:"(a) in Part I, by the addition of an entry assigning 4 penalty points to all haulage related offences including any breach of tachograph and drivers’ hours regulations, and the EU Working Time Directive;”.I have changed these amendments slightly since I tabled them on Committee Stage.  Before we suspended the sitting, we had a discussion on the failure to invigilate tachographs, the EU working time directive and the dangers of HGVs.  As a response to this, will the Minister consider assigning four penalty points to all haulage offences of this nature?Amendment No. 48 was proposed by people working in the disability sector who are outraged by able bodied people parking in disability parking bays.  The Minister said on Committee Stage that he would prefer sanctions for such an offence to be those set out by local authorities such as clamping.  I was strongly urged to make this offence attract penalty points because it is a serious offence.  We had intended to seek two penalty points for the offence but, given a driver will be given three penalty points for his first drink driving offence with a blood alcohol level of between 50 mg and 80 mg, one penalty point would be appropriate.  Will the Minister consider these amendments?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	516	The Deputy's description of the regime applying to the hours of haulage drivers, tachographs and so on was true some years back but over the past number of years there has been a sea change, with an increase in activity regarding all these offences.  There was a time we were not up to date in discharging our EU obligations and so on but that is no longer the case.  That has changed significantly.When the Deputy raised these issues on Committee Stage, I said it was my intention to examine the range of offences that attract penalty points and the penalty points system itself to ascertain whether a readjustment needs to take place.  Work is under way on that in the Department.  An examination of the operation of the current penalty points system is currently taking place with the aim of identifying priorities for the roll-out of the next stage of the system and any changes generally.  The Deputy's amendment is a little premature because we are not finished work in this regard.  I do not want to do this in a piecemeal manner.The fixed penalty charge for illegal parking in a disabled bay, at €80, is twice the amount of the general parking fixed charge penalty, and this signifies how seriously we take it.  With the sole exception of dangerous parking, which is likely to cause injury or death, all of the general traffic offences that are or will be included under the penalty points regime are moving offences, and I do not want to change this.  For all these reasons, as well as those I outlined on Committee Stage, I do not intend to change the penalty points system.  However, I am more than willing to engage with the Deputy and the committee in discussing how it might be changed in the future.  I would rather change the system in its totality than do it piecemeal in this Bill.

In page 59, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:"(2) It is an offence to present a foreign driving licence to a member of An Garda Síochána for a motoring offence if the motorist also holds an Irish driving licence.".This has been the subject of complaints in the past.  Some drivers holding both a foreign and an Irish driving licence have presented the foreign one to avoid incurring penalty points or a disqualification on their Irish licences.  This could be remedied by making it an offence to present only a foreign driving licence.  In addition, where a person presents a foreign licence, the Garda should be empowered to search the driving licence database for a matching Irish licence.  This issue first arose in collisions involving cyclists where there had been dangerous or careless driving.  I put this point to the Minister on Committee Stage and I wonder whether he has reflected on it.  Would it be a useful addition to the Bill at this point?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	527	We had a discussion on this.  The principle of the Deputy's amendment is accepted by me and is already incorporated into the Bill.  Under section 53, the definition of a driving licence will now include a foreign driving licence.  Thus, if a person applies for a driving licence while holding another licence, following the passing of this Bill, the application will be rendered fraudulent.  This automatically creates the offence that the Deputy is trying to establish in this amendment.  Section 57 provides that in such circumstances a member of the Garda Síochána may seize a driving licence.  The Deputy's intent was to make sure that if a person is stopped he or she cannot produce a foreign driving licence instead of his or her Irish one, but this is already covered in these sections.The shift to a credit-card-style licence, for which the Deputy has indicated his support, will be helpful in this regard.  Under that system, all driver details will be in a central database, which will be of assistance in prosecuting offenders.

In page 59, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:"61.—The Minister shall by regulations apply the Principal Act and the Act of 2002 with whatever modifications are appropriate so as to fully enable the mutual recognition of penalty points between the State and other members of the European Union and such other jurisdictions as may be prescribed.".This seeks to facilitate the Minister in mutual recognition of penalty points among EU partner states.  I am seeking to insert this provision in the Bill so that the Minister can set up a system of mutual recognition in the future without the requirement for further primary legislation.  I thought it would be appropriate to insert such a provision at this stage.  I am aware the Minister is working on the issue of mutual recognition with the UK and other states, and I thought this would be of help.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	530	I appreciate what the Deputy is trying to do and I would love to be able to go along with it because it would probably save us a lot of time in the future.  Having listened to the strong arguments the Deputy made on Committee Stage, I reconsidered the issue and took advice from the Office of the Attorney General.  However, unfortunately, case law is stacked against us.  The Deputy might remember the particular case that was mentioned previously when we were working on sea fisheries legislation, although I cannot remember it.It is not possible to put a broad general provision such as this into the Bill without having clearly laid out in advance the principles and procedures under which the new provisions will operate.  The advice from the Attorney General is that it should not be provided for in primary legislation in advance of the agreement of those principles and procedures.  We have some way to go on this.  The UK authorities are leading in this area.  I look forward to meeting my counterpart in the UK as soon as possible, and this is one of the issues we will discuss.  There are bilateral arrangements between the UK and Ireland under Article 15.4 of the 1998 EU Convention on Driving Disqualifications; these have been in place since 28 January.  However, unlike driving disqualifications, which are fairly straightforward, there is no agreed international framework for dealing with the recognition of penalty points for driving offences.As I said, the UK is the lead authority in this regard.  I raised this issue when I met a previous UK counterpart and was assured it was being worked on.  However, it will take some time before we can finalise it.  Thus, it is not appropriate to try to provide for it in this Bill.  I hope that by the time the next Bill is going through the Oireachtas, the principles and procedures will have been established and we will be able to include such a provision.

In page 69, line 4, after "is" to insert "or is likely to be".This is another amendment which was proposed by Deputy Broughan on Committee Stage to the dangerous driving provisions contained in this section.  While my advice with regard to this proposed amendment at the time was that it would have the effect of diluting the provision, I undertook, as the Deputy will recall, to re-examine the proposal for Report Stage.  Having consulted with the Attorney General's office, I have brought forward an amendment which I hope goes a considerable way towards addressing the Deputy's concerns and brings additional clarity to the provisions.  I hope the Deputy will agree I have gone as far as I can.  I thank him for raising this important issue.

We are dealing with certain dangerous driving offences.  This will strengthen the role of the Garda Síochána and assist prosecutions.  I thank the Minister for bringing forward this amendment.

In page 69, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:"54.—(1) Where a vehicle overtakes another road user in such a manner as to create danger or alarm for such other road user, the person in charge of the first-mentioned vehicle commits an offence.(2) (a) Where a mechanically propelled vehicle, moving at a speed of 30km/h or above, overtakes a pedal cycle or pedestrian at a distance of less than 1 metre, the driver shall be presumed, until the opposite has been proven, to have committed an offence under subsection (1).(b) Where a mechanically propelled vehicle, moving at a speed of 50km/h or above, overtakes a pedal cycle or pedestrian at a distance of less than 1.5 metres, the driver shall be presumed, until the opposite has been proven, to have committed an offence under subsection (1).(3) A person who contravenes this section is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding €5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both.".This is a major amendment I moved on Committee Stage and the Minister said he might reflect on it.  It deals with the offence of dangerous overtaking by moving vehicles of cyclists; it is a provision to protect cyclists.  I have not found this specific offence of dangerous overtaking of cyclists by cars listed in the existing road traffic law.  It is a common complaint all across the cycling community.  We are all cyclists at different times and at different times in our lives.  I am referring to dangerous overtaking at speed and very fast left-hand turns in front of a cyclist.  The Acting Chairman will be aware in Dublin North and Dublin North-East of various junctions with a cycleway which goes through a major junction.  A vehicle will turn left through the cycle lane and this is an extremely dangerous situation which is not provided for in traffic law.  I ask the Minister to consider making it a serious offence with summary conviction and a fine not exceeding €5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months.  The Minister has said the distance at which a vehicle must stay away from a cyclist is too wide in this amendment, at 1 m and 1.5 m, but cyclists are vulnerable road-users.  I know that some cyclists do not obey the rules of the road but in general, cyclists need serious protection and this amendment is an attempt to add to the law in this regard.  I ask the Minister to consider adopting this amendment.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	537	We had a good discussion on this issue on Committee Stage.  The Deputy made some well-made points.  However, the difficulty still remains.  It is not a question of the distances which the Deputy proposes in the amendment but rather of proving after the fact that those distances were breached.  It would be difficult to present evidence and there could be a conflict of evidence.  This is one of the difficulties raised in this amendment.I accept the principle of what the Deputy proposes in trying to offer a higher level of protection to road-users who are considered more vulnerable, such as cyclists and pedestrians.  However, having considered this proposal again and having taken legal advice, under article 10 of the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations 1997 and the SI 182/1997, there is an existing offence of dangerous overtaking and this is set out in those documents.  The legal advice is that the creation of a duplicate offence could cause difficulties and it would not be appropriate.  It could cause difficulties because it would reduce the clarity of the legislation.  This is not what the Deputy intends.  There would also be a difficulty in enforcement when it is a case of measurements.The Deputy was also concerned about this particular offence being stipulated in secondary legislation.  However, it carries equal weight to primary legislation.  A range of road traffic offences are set out in secondary road traffic legislation, including failure to stop at a stop sign, failure to yield, failure to obey traffic lights and driving the wrong way down a one-way street.  These are all very dangerous practices which are dealt with by the Garda without any great problem.  The Deputy's submission on Committee Stage regarding the protection of vulnerable road-users is a valid one.  I have asked the Department to examine the principles and in the context of a Bill which would be more suitable than this Bill.  I hope to introduce a sustainable travel Bill to be published before the end of this year.  I will undertake to the Deputy to try to include such provisions in that Bill.

The Minister has come forward with proposals for promised legislation on a number of issues in the past.  On that basis, I will reluctantly withdraw the amendment.  However, the definition of a bicycle and pedal vehicles needs to be covered.

In page 70, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:"(2) A person shall not engage in the sale or distribution or placing of any material or any commercial or promotional activity on or adjacent to a public road in such a manner as to have the potential to distract motorists or endanger road and public  safety.".The Acting Chairman and all Deputies here would be very familiar with the sale of goods at busy junctions.  Newspapers are among those goods.  People walk in between cars when stopped at busy junctions.  I ask the Minister to consider this amendment.  There is a tradition of newspaper sellers on the streets and in kiosks but the practice of working at junctions can be dangerous for the workers involved.  People collect money for charity in this way but often constituents ask me why it is permitted to sell at junctions.  I ask if the Minister has given this proposal some thought.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	540	It was only when the Deputy raised this matter on Committee Stage that it struck me his proposal was a good idea.  In the time since Committee Stage I have not been in a position to bring forward any amendments.  I am advised that under article 46 of the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) Regulations, and SI 182/1997, the existing offence of pedestrians not exercising care and not taking all reasonable precautions to avoid causing danger or inconvenience to traffic and other pedestrians, is set out clearly.  Therefore, it is covered in the regulations and I do not want to duplicate it.  However, this is an area we should take a good look at and clarify further.  The Deputy is aware this will mean we will also have to stop the practice whereby charities raise money at junctions.  However, we must consider what a life is worth because it is a dangerous practice.  I ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment on the basis that the issue is covered currently.  I agree it is an issue we need to revisit.

During the most recent election and the previous one, the former Taoiseach urged his supporters to canvass at junctions.  There is significant territory to be covered and I would appreciate the Minister doing further thinking on the issue.  However, I will withdraw the amendment.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	542	I move amendment No. 67:
In page 73, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:"73.—Section 78 of the Principal Act is amended by inserting the following subsection after subsection (3):"(3A) Without prejudice to any other aspect of the terms agreed from time to time between the Minister and the Bureau in respect of the Bureau, those terms shall include an undertaking that the Bureau shall treat for all purposes third-party claims in respect of mechanically propelled vehicles as if the defence of automatism did not form part of the law relating to civil liability.".".This issue was drawn to my attention by Deputy Howlin and a number of other colleagues.  It relates to a situation where a driver suffers a blackout or an epileptic fit.  This creates a difficulty with regard to a subsequent collision because the insurance bureau and Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, agreement does not cover the circumstance for this to be used as a defence in court proceedings.  This defence is known as "automatism".  There seems to be a big gap in civil law in this regard.  I tried in this amendment to bring forward a solution through the following wording:Without prejudice to any other aspect of the terms agreed from time to time between the Minister and the Bureau in respect of the Bureau, those terms shall include an undertaking that the Bureau shall treat for all purposes third-party claims in respect of mechanically propelled vehicles as if the defence of automatism did not form part of the law relating to civil liability.The Minister said he would think about this issue.  This is a serious gap which has been identified by Deputy Howlin.  In the context of the MIBI, has the Minister given it any consideration?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	543	We looked at this issue on foot of the Deputy's amendment and on foot of the discussion on Committee Stage.  With regard to the proposed amendment, it is important to state that the MIBI operates with the intention to ensure equality of treatment between the victims of both insured and uninsured drivers.  The imposition of a requirement such as that proposed in the amendment on the MIBI,  without the imposition of a similar obligation on insurance companies would distort the principles under which it operates.  In addition, I said previously that the MIBI agreement is concluded on a voluntary basis between the Minister for Transport and the MIBI.  It is in everybody's interest that it works in this way and that the agreement exists.  If we introduced a compulsion in law that would require the MIBI to sign up to specific terms in its agreement, that would attack the basis on which the agreement was reached, namely mutual consent.  For these reasons, I cannot accept the amendment.  It would not fit in this Bill.However, an issue remains that injured victims are not compensated following a successful defence of "automatism".  Question arise, therefore, as to how they should be compensated, by whom and by what mechanism that could be achieved.  Those questions must be considered.  This is something that will not just involve the Department of Transport, but will also involve a number of other Departments.  At this point, I cannot accept an amendment to deal with the issue in this Bill.  However, it is an issue with which we will have to deal.

It also raises further questions in terms of responsibility for collisions.  Would the Minister consider accepting the principle and the issues relating to it if it was brought forward as a Private Members' Bill.  Would he consider asking his colleagues to support that?

In recent discussions in Dublin city and other counties we found we did not have provision for a 40 km/h speed limit, which meant that people who wanted to slow down traffic to below 50 km/h had to go to the 30 km/h limit.  Many years ago I proposed to Dublin city Council that we should have a 25 mph home zone system for all the estates around Dublin city and pedestrian shopping areas where the 30 kmh zone has been introduced.  I thank the Minister for introducing his amendment.  I understand we will shortly have a new 40 km/h or 25 mph speed limit which will be helpful to councillors throughout the country when introducing speed limits.

I have no difficulty acknowledging that this matter was raised by Deputy Broughan and that I was happy to support it.

In page 76, line 41, after "Reform" to insert the following:", the Minister for Transport or a local authority,".—This amendment relates to extending the powers under section 62(7) whereby the Minister can sign contracts of private and other operators to operate the safety cameras.  I commend the Minister on bringing about a framework at long last whereby we will have the new speed or safety cameras, by, hopefully, next October, at locations which will be determined by a Garda superintendent.  The Labour Party believes local authorities should also have the power to decide on positions for speed and red light cameras and to give evidence in court, because speed management is a key element of the local authorities' traffic management structure.  We have been giving local authorities' more power in this regard.  The Minister mentioned this afternoon that real time information on buses in Dublin city and throughout the county — something that happens already in Galway city — would be the prerogative of the local authorities and that they would be responsible for the signage.  This amendment suggests the same prerogative for local authorities with regard to speed cameras.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	553	Section 77 deals mainly with enforcement of speed limits and the use of speed detection equipment by the Garda Síochána.  Enforcement comes entirely within the remit of the Department of Justice and Law Reform and the Garda Commissioner.  I understand the point being made by the Deputy, but this Bill is not the appropriate one to deal with the issue.  Neither I, as Minister for Transport, nor the local authorities have any role in the enforcement of speed limits.  Therefore, the proposed amendment is not appropriate for this section.

In page 77, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:"(b) The Minister shall as soon as practicable after the passing of this Act bring forward a scheme to facilitate the roll-out of the national speed camera programme in terms of physical infrastructure and road signage.”.I mention this to again encourage the Minister to roll out the speed and safety cameras for which Members have been waiting so long.  Will there be further slippage from the October target?  Will Members still talk about speed cameras and safety cameras after Christmas?  As this is a key element of enforcement, will there be further slippage?

I have worked on this issue since I came into this Department.  It is the responsibility of another Department in which a number of Ministers have held office during the time I have held this portfolio.  While there has been goodwill on all sides in this regard, for a variety of reasons, including contractual issues and so on, we have been unable to get it over the line.  I hope these cameras will be in position by the end of October.  Much work is under way in preparation for them and I sincerely hope Members will not be talking about the roll-out at Christmas or thereabouts, except in retrospect, as it then will be operational.

In page 80, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:"(2) Section 9 of the Act of 2004 is amended by inserting the following after subsection (2)—"(2A) All special speed limits shall apply to all public roads and public places within the area defined by the local authority to which the special speed limit applies, including roads in residential housing estates that have not yet been taken-in-charge.".".The purpose of this amendment is to amend section 9 of the Act of 2004 to provide that all special speed limits shall apply to all public roads and public places within the area defined by the local authority to which the special speed limit applies, including roads and residential housing estates that have not yet been taken in charge.  As I have told the Minister, my predecessor as Labour Party spokesperson on transport matters, Deputy Shortall, pursued this issue vigorously.  However, five or six years later, no clarity has been achieved in this regard because under the Road Traffic Act 2004, speed limits can only apply to public roads.  However, roads in housing estates that have not yet been taken in charge by the local authority are classified as public places, rather than as public roads.As previously discussed, this issue arises in respect of estates in the Minister's constituency of Meath West and my constituency of Dublin North-East.  Similarly the Ceann Comhairle and my other colleague, Deputy O'Dowd, also probably have experienced the phenomenon whereby estates which have been built and occupied for eight to ten years still have not been taken in charge.  All Members have experienced great difficulty while attempting to secure traffic signage and traffic rules, for which residents continually ask.  As I noted, my predecessor in this role, Deputy Shortall, brought up this issue a number of times with the Minister's predecessor, Martin Cullen.  However, it appears as though there is a problem in this regard that should be addressed.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	567	The amendment seeks to insert a new provision into section 9 of the Act relating to special speed limits that would provide that local authorities could apply special speed limits to roads and residential housing estates that have not yet been taken in charge.  It is probable that all Members have experience of such estates, which have not been taken in charge.  However, a fundamental principle under road traffic law is that where regulatory provisions apply to a road, the road in question must have the status of being a public road.  All road traffic offences form part of the criminal code, that is, that a person is liable to a penalty or to be summonsed to court when he or she contravenes a road law provision.  Consequently, it is not appropriate to introduce a parallel process, as proposed in this amendment, whereby a local authority could apply special speed limits to a road that was not a public road, without any provision being made for enforcement of infringements.  Questions arise such as, for instance, who would enforce the speed limits on what is essentially private land and private property and in respect of the difficulties to which this would give rise.  Any such provision would be open to challenge on the grounds of a lack of legal clarity or certainty.  However, once the road is taken in charge, the speed control provisions of the road traffic legislation can be applied by the road authority and enforced by the Garda Síochána.The issue with which the Deputy is attempting to deal is completely separate and relates to the failure of local authorities to fulfil their obligations to take roads in charge.  I acknowledge that this is an issue that must be pursued but I have been unable to do so within the time available and it must be pursued at a later stage.  However, this is not an appropriate Bill into which to include this provision and this is not an appropriate amendment for this Bill, no matter how much one might wish to have provisions in law to try to deal with this issue.  Consequently, I ask the Deputy to withdraw his amendment.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	568	The point of the amendment simply is that because traffic legislation is the most serious aspect of taking in charge, it should be done first.  As soon as a place is occupied, the local authority should be allowed, to take it in charge for traffic purposes.  While the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government also could be involved in this regard, it appears to me as though a huge gap exists.  It is highly annoying for parents with young children and the Minister is familiar with the problems that arise, such as visitors to the estates whizzing around the place in cars.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	569	I accept the Deputy's point and this is a matter that must be discussed by the relevant Departments, namely, the Departments of Transport and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  It struck me that the Deputy's suggestion is not unreasonable.  Perhaps a legislative provision could exclude roads from the process of taking estates in charge. Perhaps the thing to do, which would involve planning law, would be to oblige developers building estates to put in place the roads first, possibly thereby getting a reduction in one's development levy or whatever.  The council then would be obliged to approve those roads with the effect as soon as the houses were built, even if the estate was not absolutely complete, it could be deemed to be a public road.  It could be something along those lines.  I certainly will ask my officials to contact their counterparts in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to ascertain whether something like this could be put in train.

In page 80, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:"(2) Section 9 of the Act of 2004 is amended by inserting the following after subsection (13)—"(13A) The Minister shall make regulations requiring the City or County Manager of each City or County Council to produce and publish once in each calendar year a report on the speed limits of all roads in the Local Authority Area.".".This amendment is based on a suggestion from the British road safety charity, Brake, that encourages all local authorities in the United Kingdom to publish each year a clear audit of their speed limits.  This is related to a point I made on Committee Stage on the manner in which some people either appear to be or will claim to be unsure of the speed limits.  This often will be the case in rural areas and even in urban areas, people in Dublin city who are asked the speed limit on James Larkin Road or the Howth Road in Raheny, for example, may get it wrong.  All the speed limits within Dublin city should be 50 km/h, with perhaps a dozen or 15 exceptions.  Clarity should be brought to signage.  Roads should interact with the driver.  There should be constant interaction and one should never not know the speed limit.  This amendment seeks to bring about a new regime and I ask the Minister to consider it again.

Work is ongoing in the Department on the preparation of guidance for local authorities on the setting of speed limits under the road safety strategy.  Once the guidance is in place, local authorities will be requested to audit their speed limits.  We have made provision so that it can be done.  I am wary of creating a statutory obligation currently in that respect but I agree that no driver should be left in any doubt as to what the speed limits are in particular areas.  The guidance should help in that regard.  The speed limits are less than clear at the moment.  However, from my experience of driving on the Continent and even in the United States at various times, while we are not better, we are no worse in many cases.  The use of intelligent transport systems will increase.  Work is ongoing in that regard in the European Union.  We will publish the guidelines first and then we will encourage local authorities to carry out audits.

In page 80, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:"(2) Section 9 of the Act of 2004 is amended by inserting after subsection (13) the following—"(13A) The Minister shall make regulations requiring an audit by Local Authorities and national upgrade programme for road speed signage signs including signage for charging points for electric vehicles, parking places for club cars and partial footpath parking areas.".".This is a similar amendment to the previous one.  Many of the remaining amendments are aspirational.  This one relates to electric vehicles.  The Minister made a contribution on the matter on Committee Stage.

In page 81, after line 24, to insert the following:"89.—The Minister shall as soon as practicable introduce regulations to fully implement the Graduated Driving License Scheme.".Will the Minister indicate when we can expect the graduated driver licence legislation?  I accept he has dealt with other legislation in recent months but I would like to see the introduction of such legislation as driver education is critical.  It is important to ensure drivers begin with a good driving culture from the outset.  When will the Minister introduce the legislation which is necessary under the road safety strategy?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	579	The RSA had a public consultation process and it submitted proposals to me which I considered for further development and the implementation of a comprehensive, graduated driver licensing scheme.  I approved the proposals in principle but a number of issues needed some refinement especially in terms of implementation as we will introduce many of the measures through a pilot scheme.  Many of the proposals that have been brought forward in recent months in this context will require primary legislation and cannot be done through regulation.  Much of the work on graduated driving licences is based on the consultation and the agreements with stakeholders.We must wait for the next road traffic Bill to include provisions to implement a graduated driver licensing scheme and create the statutory obligation on the Minister for Transport to make regulations to implement the scheme.  It would be inappropriate to do that without knowing what we are going to implement and what primary legislation we need.  The preparation of draft legislative proposals to implement compulsory basic training for motorcyclists is nearing finalisation within the RSA.  I expect to receive those proposals shortly.  The enabling provisions for that aspect of it, to which the Deputy referred previously, is in place so creating a statutory obligation on the Minister for Transport to make regulations is not necessary in that instance.  We need primary legislation in one set of circumstances and we have the legislation to allow for regulations in the other.  I ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.

Perhaps the Minister will return to the issue.  On the basis of his response, I will withdraw the amendment.

In page 81, after line 24, to insert the following:"89.—The Minister shall as soon as practicable bring forward a scheme to facilitate the implementation of the national electric car strategy including electric charge points, signage, parking facilities and a national information campaign.".Again, this is an aspirational amendment on electric vehicles.

In page 81, after line 24, to insert the following:"89.—The Minister shall as soon as practicable bring forward regulations to facilitate the setting and enforcement of speed limits and parking regulations on private property including guidelines to allow owners of private roads to set speed limits and arrange for the enforcement of these limits.".The amendment again relates to estates.  Has the Minister reconsidered the matter?

In page 81, after line 24, to insert the following:"89.—The Minister shall direct each City and County Manager to review the operation of residential parking permit schemes in their Local Authority area.".In the amendment I draw attention to the current legislation on parking in residential areas which are situated near areas of high demand, for example, near a DART station, quality bus corridor, university or major shopping centre and the limited options available to local authorities.  No legislative provision currently exists for residents-only parking.  One can install residential disc parking but in that case there is a charge for both residents and visitors and there is a requirement that a majority of residents would accept the situation.  There is a difficulty in this area and even though the charge in a residential disc area is low, it can be difficult to get agreement.  I am trying to introduce a new system.  I ask the Minister to respond.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	587	It would require me to direct local authority managers to review the operation of the residential parking permits scheme.  The introduction of that type of compulsory provision without regard for local authority resourcing is inappropriate and is probably disproportionate to the problem.  I accept what the Deputy said but there is an option available to the Minister for Transport to request local authorities to review the operation of parking schemes without the introduction of compulsory provisions in primary legislation.  In the same way as the Deputy, I am more in favour of local authorities exercising their own responsibility.  In light of that, I ask him to withdraw the amendment.

In page 81, after line 24, to insert the following:"89.—All public transport vehicles engaged in the carriage of passengers on any Quality Bus Corridor networks shall have priority at all traffic junctions.".This is another aspirational amendment to give priority to traffic on quality bus corridors.  There was an element of that in the SCATS system.  The aim is to give a strong impetus to buses travelling on quality bus corridors.  I would like to hear the Minister's response.

In page 81, after line 24, to insert the following:"89.—Within one month from the passing of this Act the Attorney General shall refer the issue of residents only parking as opposed to residents permit parking to the Law Reform Commission for examination.".This amendment arises from the previous amendment on residents' parking.  Perhaps the Minister will consider this thorny area.  We, as local and national representatives, are often involved in these kinds of issues.  Will the Minister do what I suggest?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	592	I will undertake to write to the Attorney General to express the Deputy's view and see whether the former will consider it, or consider referring it to the Law Reform Commission.

In page 81, after line 24, to insert the following:"89.—The Minister shall immediately review the use of the CT68 form or any similar form in the collation of data after a road collision to include the recording of any vehicle defects or the testing of a driver for alcohol or any illegal substances.".We had a long discussion on the CT68 form, or similar form, on Committee Stage.  The Minister was saying we should not be referring to specific types of forms in primary legislation.  The CT68 form is completed by a garda who attends at the scene of a collision.  It pertains to preliminary opinion only and does not form part of the investigation file.  The Opposition considers it to be a cursory, basic form and that it should be much more detailed and give real insight into what has occurred.  I refer the Minister to the similar type of form in use by the police services in Northern Ireland and Britain.  Has the Minister re-examined this matter?  While difficulties arise over addressing this in primary legislation, we need to examine this area.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	594	The Deputy is correct that this arose on Committee Stage.  I indicated to him that it was not appropriate for me to do anything about it directly in primary legislation and that it is entirely a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  I indicated I would bring the Deputy's concerns to the attention of the Garda Commissioner and the road safety committee.  It is an item on the agenda of the next meeting of the committee, which will be some time before the end of this month.  On that basis, I ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.

In page 81, after line 24, to insert the following:"89.—The Minister shall as soon as practicable introduce a pilot programme to trial the use of Alcolocks as part of anti-drink driving educational programme including drink-drive rehabilitation schemes.".I proposed on Committee State that the Minister should introduce a pilot programme on the use of Alcolocks as part of an anti-drink driving educational programme.  I referred to the use of Alcolocks in many other EU states.  We referred earlier to the utilisation of technology to improve road safety.  This is an area in which we could dramatically improve road safety.  We could give people options to be safe by introducing the Alcolocks system to Ireland.  This is a major step we could take.  There may be issues of jurisprudence to address.  Perhaps we should start making moves to introduce Alcolocks now.  Will the Minister consider this?

#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	599	I move amendment No. 90:
In page 81, after line 24, to insert the following:"89.—(1) Any person who knowingly or recklessly makes any adjustment to or stops or disengages the odometer on a vehicle, and thereby misrepresenting the true mileage of the vehicle in question, shall be guilty of an offence.(2) A person guilty of an offence under subsection (1) of this section shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding €5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months, or to both such fine and such imprisonment, or, on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding €10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or to both such fine and such imprisonment for each and every occurrence.(3) It shall not be an offence within the meaning of subsection (1) when an odometer is adjusted to reflect the true mileage of the vehicle.”.The amendments relate to the offence of interfering with an odometer on a car, known as car clocking.  I sought to introduce three new provisions in the Road Traffic Bill such that "Any person who knowingly or recklessly makes any adjustment to or stops or disengages the odometer on a vehicle, and thereby misrepresenting the true mileage of the vehicle in question, shall be guilty of an offence".  I raised this on the Order of Business, as the Ceann Comhairle may recall.  It was prompted by Cartell.ie and AA Ireland.  Cartell.ie did major studies of car clocking and discovered prima facie evidence that approximately one fifth of used imported cars had been clocked in some form.  The Minister referred me to the National Consumer Agency and general consumer rules about people buying products that are what they are meant to be.After one's house, one's vehicle is the biggest item of expenditure.  Many pay back car loans for a long time.  It is tragic that a significant number of people, according to the evidence of Cartell.ie, are paying for a vehicle much older than the one they believed they purchased.  This requires specific legislation.  The Minister is saying that, in general terms, this matter is covered.  Clocking is a specific offence that needs to be considered.A year or two ago, when this offence was highlighted again, most of us believed it was no longer possible to clock odometers, and that the old odometers were easy enough to interfere with by comparison with the modern ones.  It was believed that, with computer systems in cars, clocking could not be done.  We now know that virtually anything can be done with computers and that problems with security arise.  There is very significant evidence that car clocking is occurring.  While I know the Bill deals to a large extent with moving vehicles, car clocking is a serious offence and an attack on people's rights.  The legislation suggested by Cartell.ie, which checks odometers on vehicles entering the country, and by AA Ireland is worthy of support in this House.  I may introduce a Private Members' Bill with my amendments at its heart.  We should do this.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	600	I agree with the Deputy that car clocking should be condemned outright.  It certainly deserves to be legislated for.  That legislation is in place.  It focuses on consumer protection legislation and it is enforced by the National Consumer Agency.  The Consumer Protection Act 2007 makes it an offence for a trader to engage in a misleading commercial practice, and this includes the falsification of information on a product's usage or prior history to the extent that the information would be likely to cause the average consumer to make a transactional decision he would not otherwise make.  This is the legal position.  The National Consumer Agency enforces the legislation and provides advice for prospective buyers in its guide to buying a car.  Car clocking is considered to be a misleading commercial practice within the meaning of Part 3 of the Act.  I am not sure the practice is as widespread as the Deputy is saying.  His evidence is anecdotal and he is not quoting scientific data.  The agency received 112 complaints from consumers over car clocking in 2008.  There were 84 complaints in 2009 and 21 so far this year.  I hope this is a sign that a practice that I accept was pretty common four or five years ago is declining on foot of the legislation of 2007.The agency has the power to get undertakings from a trader to comply with the requirements of the Act, usually a commitment to cease the offending practice and compensate affected customers.  If he does not give an undertaking or renege on the terms, the agency can apply to the Circuit Court for a prohibition order or take a prosecution.  In 2008, there were four undertakings from traders and one conviction.  In 2009, the agency obtained one conviction for car clocking.  So far in 2010, the agency has obtained one prohibition against a trader and one undertaking from another trader.  The penalties for this range from a maximum fine for a first offence of €3,000 — compensation to the consumer must also be considered — to €60,000 for convictions on indictment and there are higher fines for repeat offenders.The one area Deputy Broughan referred to as well which is something I will consider is where the practice results in a car that is clearly dangerous getting on the road.  Where that can be proven, there may be something that we could do from a road safety point of view in this road traffic legislation rather than in consumer legislation.  However, I am reluctant to provide — we had this point previously — for two different sets of legislation covering the same offence.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	601	The other point to stress is that this practice is so dangerous because, particularly with modern cars in the past four or five years, one can easily interfere with the brakes and with other key systems in a vehicle.  Certain marks of car are very much computer aided.  It is also a very dangerous practice.  I accept what the Minister is saying, although maybe it should be somewhere in primary legislation.  Cartell.ie, AA Ireland and others have made some good points.  On that basis, I will withdraw the amendments.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	602	I thank the Members opposite for the constructive approach to this legislation.  On the various Stages there was much discussion about particular provisions in it, and perhaps a strict focus on one area, whereas there are many important provisions in the Bill that will help road safety.I thank my colleagues across the floor of the House.  I have said it before and it is worth saying again, that this is one area where all-party support is very important.  It is an area where everybody has contributed positively and I want to acknowledge that here in the House.I thank the Ceann Comhairle and his staff for facilitating it and thank my own staff in the Department for the work that they have put into this legislation.  I hope the Deputies opposite found the staff open and willing to co-operate and to provide as much information as possible.  I thank everybody for their co-operation.

We all worked together on this Bill to perfect it as best we could.  The Minister dealt with most, if not all, of the issues, although issues will continue to arise.I also pay tribute to PARC, particularly the ladies who contacted us and campaigned so long and so hard on behalf of their loved ones who died tragically due to issues in regard to drunken driving.  Their sincerity and dedication drove this agenda, as did many members of the public who contacted us.Notwithstanding all of that, it is important that the Oireachtas makes judicious positive constructive new legislation to make the roads safer for everybody regardless of anything else and that the greatest good for the greatest number will result from this legislation.  I welcome the passing of this Bill.  I thank everybody concerned, those in all parties and  the officials aswell.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	604	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his courtesy during the passage of this Bill.  I also thank the civil servants in the Department of Transport.  Road traffic legislation is a difficult and hugely contested area and I thank the officials for the great work they have done on it.  I also thank the Minister for accepting a number of amendments from the Labour Party where we tried to invigilate and to strength the Bill.It is an historic night in the context of road safety.  A good job of work has been done in getting this Bill through Dáil Éireann.  I pay particular tribute to the women committee members of the PARC road safety organisation who briefed me extensively and supported me on Labour Party amendments.  I commend them on the terrific work they have done to bring this legislation forward.Mandatory testing is the core of the Bill.  The new 50 mg limit is the core of the Bill and I hope that the Minister will ensure, on its final passage through the Oireachtas, that this core aspect of the Bill stays as it is.  I thank the Minister.

I think that the Minister is not aware of the serious effect this will have in rural areas.  I want to know will the Minister show any leniency for the people who are living in Ballydehob.  One must remember that whether one lives in Ballydehob or in Ballsbridge, one is entitled to the same privilege.  We have no Luas service in west Cork.  Neither have we a CIE service every ten minutes or a taxi service.The Minister should take into consideration that we have almost the lowest rate of road deaths in the European Union, according to statistics that are coming out today.  The 80 mg limit, when it was imposed correctly by the Garda, has proven results.  Why, at this stage, ignore the rest of the country?

#MargaretConlon	unknown-#MargaretConlon-party	unknown-#MargaretConlon-dob	unknown-#MargaretConlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	611	I am pleased to have the opportunity to bring to the attention of the House a matter which is of serious concern for constituents in my constituency, namely the provision of day services at the Darley Health Centre in Cootehill.  I have had numerous calls about this from concerned persons and from Councillors McCarey, Igoe and Smith in Cootehill.I, with my Oireachtas colleagues, attended a public meeting in Cootehill on Monday night last where we heard at first hand the concerns of the service users and their families.  There were 300 people present, which shows the seriousness with which they took the matter, and they highlighted clearly the benefits which the senior citizens receive from attending the day centre, as it currently exists.The Darley Health Centre opened its doors to the senior citizens in November 2006 and it continues to provide what is considered by health professionals and service users and their families to be a service of excellence.  Is that not what we all are looking for?  I look forward to witnessing this for myself on Friday when I visit the centre, and I would wonder how many local area managers have taken the time out to visit this wonderful facility.The confusion results from a proposal to look at how day services are delivered in counties Cavan and Monaghan.  I believe there has been misinformation or, at best, inaccurate information.  This fed the rumour mill and, suddenly, the word was spread that the services are closing on 1 September.When I contacted the HSE, it confirmed this was not the case.  I accept the HSE's statement in good faith, but the services will not be provided in their current form.Once again, the HSE has been reactive rather than proactive.  I am led to believe that service users and service providers were given different information on the same night.  This is unacceptable and has led to the current confusion.  The users and their families need certainty and clarity.  Surely they are entitled to these.  I accept that the HSE is considering the introduction of enhanced services at Cootehill, which is certainly deserving of additional services like occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech and language therapy and so on.  As a town, it has potential for delivering these services to the people of counties Cavan and Monaghan, but this does not mean the current day services must move.For those who use the service, the words of praise were high.  For many, the social interaction was as important, if not more so, as the other services provided.  Many spoke of the benefit of meeting their friends.  For many, it was their only opportunity to meet people on a weekly basis.  Moving the service and its users to other rural locations would not work.  The service would be fragmented and the same quality would not be provided.  The Darley unit might become unsustainable.  The other units would not be in a position to provide the same level or quality of service with the same expertise.I watched the recent programme on the treatment of Alzheimer's patients.  Many such patients avail of this service.  The programme was emotional, but it made clear how any change in routine or venue would have significant consequences for patients.  Are we not to put the patients first?  If we learned anything from the programme, it was that services of excellence should remain where they are.  This is the case in respect of Cootehill.We need a proper consultation process with service users at its heart.  They should continue to receive the same excellent service, which is delivering good outcomes.  If it is not broken, it does not need fixing.  I would be critical of many other aspects of health care provision and service delivery and action is required in respect of them, so let the HSE focus on fixing them instead of causing confusion, anxiety and worry for elderly people.  I do not want the HSE to use this as a reason to prevent the acquisition of new services in Cootehill.  The services can be located in the new premises.The complete breakdown in communication must be remedied with immediate effect.  It is unfair to all stakeholders, including those providing the new premises.  They have invested time and money and adapted the premises to suit the HSE, but they have been treated unfairly.  It is time for honest, frank and open communication between all stakeholders.  Only then will a satisfactory solution be found.  I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	612	I am taking this debate in the absence of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.The Government's overriding policy is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their homes and communities for as long as possible.  Where this is not an option for whatever reason, the HSE supports access to quality long-term residential care, as appropriate.  In accordance with this approach, a priority of the Government in recent years has been to develop a range of community-based supports, such as home help, home care packages and day-respite care.  Between 2006 and 2010, additional investment of more than €200 million was provided to the HSE to develop such community supports for older people.  Without these initiatives, many older people would experience inappropriate admission to acute hospitals or would be admitted to residential care earlier than might be required.The HSE service plan for 2010, approved by the Minister in February, commits the executive to providing agreed levels of service nationally for these key community support areas.  The plan includes day-respite care, often available through various day care facilities or as part of a home care package.  Such services can be delivered directly by the HSE or in partnership with local voluntary or private providers.Broadly speaking, the level of community supports for older people in 2010 is in line with the 2009 provision.  This includes an increase in the number of home care packages available due to additional funding of €10 million provided in the last budget for this specific purpose.  The key activity targets contained in this year's HSE service plan are almost 12 million home help hours to approximately 54,000 people, an increased home care package provision from 8,700 recipients at any one time in 2009 to 9,600 in 2010 and a total of 21,300 day care places, estimated to cater for up to 80,000 people.  While this last target is slightly down from a comparable figure of 21,600 places in last year's service plan, the respite-day care levels agreed would generally be compensated for in 2010 within the overall home care supports component of the plan.  It should be noted that any changes to these national target commitments, as part of the agreed HSE service plan for this year, would need to be notified to the Department of Health and Children.Other important initiatives are also being undertaken at a strategic level to improve community-based services for older people.  Arising from an evaluation of home care packages published by the Department in December, the HSE is progressing various improvements in home care provision.  The Department accepts the need for a more standardised approach to home care generally, whether by public or private provision.  It is worth noting that, this year, the HSE intends to finalise standardised access and operational guidelines for the delivery of home care packages, adopt a voluntary code of quality guidelines for home care support services for older people, progress a procurement framework for home care services and introduce procedural guidelines for the home help service to standardise access to and allocation of home help hours.As the Deputy is aware, the HSE has operational responsibility for the delivery of health and social services nationally.  She will appreciate that all developments relating to older people, including day care services at individual centres such as Cootehill, must be addressed in light of the current economic and budgetary pressures.  The executive has been asked to rigorously examine how existing funding might be reconfigured or reallocated to ensure maximum service provision is achieved.  This requires a stringent ongoing review of the application of the resources currently available.The HSE recognises the challenges ahead in meeting the increased volume and complexity of need within our ageing population while also attempting to address the demand for integrated, co-ordinated and appropriate services based on the principle of maintaining older people at home for as long as possible.  From this perspective in the Cavan-Monaghan area, the HSE is examining options to bring additional services into Cootehill for the benefit of people in the town and surrounding areas.The local health manager established a strategic planning group for services for older persons in counties Cavan and Monaghan in March 2010 to consider, among other matters, the manner in which day care services for older people are being delivered across both counties.  As a result, there may be some changes in the method of service provision.  There are different possibilities with regard to the future provision of these services, each of which is being explored and negotiated currently.  In the case of day care services for older people, it is the aim of the executive that older people requiring this service would access it as close to their homes as possible and within their communities.  Day care services are provided at the Darley Centre to older people from Cootehill town and the surrounding community.  The majority of older people attend weekly or bi-weekly on a rotational basis.  I understand many users of the day care service in Cootehill also currently access other local day care services.  There is capacity to increase this option to them.An information session was held on 25 May, led by the general manager and key HSE personnel, to inform the current service provider and the voluntary organisations representing the local views of the older people of the proposed review of the day care services.  A decision has been taken that the existing older people will continue to be provided with the same frequency of day care services, whether at the Darley Centre or a different facility.  It was emphasised that it should not mean a reduction in service for any person currently attending day care in the Darley Centre.  Every effort will be made by the HSE locally to meet the needs of each individual in the best way.The timeline for bringing the new and changed day care service into operation is by the end of the first quarter of 2011.  The HSE will continue to work with local services and people from Cootehill in developing new services.  It is a matter for the executive to manage this service, bearing in mind all relevant factors, such as overall resources, local circumstances or evolving service priorities.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	613	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important matter for the Adjournment debate, which concerns waiting times for people wishing to see an orthopaedic consultant in the Cork area.  Having researched the matter, it is not unique to Cork but appears to be particularly acute there.  Before a person is added to a waiting list for orthopaedic surgery, he or she must see an orthopaedic consultant.  That is where the bottleneck exists.  The outpatient waiting list for those waiting to see an orthopaedic consultant is 3,356, according to the latest figures from the HSE for Cork University Hospital, CUH.  Only 248 people were on the waiting list for orthopaedic surgery.  Even a cursory analysis shows the bottleneck in the system is the outpatient appointment system.  Looking closer at the figures, some 1,500 of the 3,356 people are waiting for at least 12 months.  It is a very long time for someone in need of a hip operation or knee replacement surgery.  Of those people, almost 350 are waiting to see an orthopaedic consultant for two years or more.  This is a real problem in Cork that must be grappled with as an urgent priority.  I am aware the problem exists elsewhere as well.What is the root cause of the problem?  Is it the lack of orthopaedic consultants in Cork?  Do consultants spend too much time on private patients rather than public patients?  Are they not complying in full with the new consultant contract?  A constituent contacted me and told me he will almost certainly need a hip replacement.  He has been told by the CUH that it will be at least two years before he sees an orthopaedic consultant.  It is only at that point that he can join the waiting list for surgery.  The National Treatment Purchase Fund cannot help him because it deals only with those on waiting lists for surgery for at least three months.  While there is an outpatient initiative in place, it does not help those waiting to see an orthopaedic consultant in Cork this year.  If he has money and is able to go to a private hospital and pay for the procedure, he can get it done quickly.  Otherwise, he must wait at least two years before he sees a consultant and joins the waiting list for surgery.  There is not equality of access in respect of treatment for that man or thousands like him.  We must address the issue of orthopaedics urgently.I ask the Minister to consider extending the role of the National Treatment Purchase Fund to take on outpatient cases.  From my work on the Committee of Public Accounts, it is clear the quality of the outpatient waiting list data is very poor.  When representatives of the National Treatment Purchase Fund appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts some months ago, they gave evidence that when they probed the data it was of poor quality.  Many people on the outpatient waiting list data provided by the hospitals were deceased.  Many had treatment carried out elsewhere and others did not need the treatment anymore.  In many cases, the contact information was out of date.  There must be a national audit of waiting lists and waiting list data must be validated.  Waiting lists will not be as long if we establish the true picture in that regard.A recent article in the Sunday Business Post stated we have a ratio of one orthopaedic surgeon for 54,000 people, the lowest ratio in western Europe.  Many countries have a ratio of one surgeon to 15,000 people.  There is an issue in CUH but also other areas of the country.  It is not fair or reasonable to expect someone who urgently needs to see a consultant and subsequently needs to have surgery carried out to wait at least two years before going on the waiting list for surgery.  I hope the Minister of State can shed some light on the situation and give people in Cork hope that they will not be waiting so long to see a consultant and gain access to the surgery they so badly need.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	614	I am replying this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children.  The division of trauma and orthopaedics at CUH is responsible for providing trauma and elective orthopaedic services in Cork.  Trauma services are delivered in CUH, while elective orthopaedic services are currently provided at St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital.  Currently, there are five permanent consultant orthopaedic surgeons engaged in the trauma and elective service, with two locum consultants engaged in the trauma service only.At present, just over 300 are people waiting for elective orthopaedic treatment in the CUH, the majority of whom are waiting for less than three months.  The HSE estimates that 97% of elective orthopaedic cases are treated within six months.  For most of the remaining patients, there are specific individual reasons why surgery has not been completed.  The HSE indicates that approximately 3,500 people are on the waiting list for orthopaedic outpatient appointments in CUH.  Work is in progress to validate the waiting list to establish whether all of the people concerned still require an appointment.The HSE is working to reduce orthopaedic waiting lists and a recent initiative is the establishment of a physiotherapist-led assessment clinic to triage patients waiting longest to be seen.  Evidence shows that many patients on outpatient waiting lists can have their needs addressed by a physiotherapist working in a team led by a consultant orthopaedic surgeon.  The HSE is optimistic this initiative will result in an appreciable reduction in the number of patients still awaiting treatment and in the waiting period involved.  The HSE is also making arrangements with the National Treatment Purchase Fund for orthopaedic outpatient appointments to be offered by the fund to approximately 400 people who have been waiting longest to be seen at the CUH.The business plan of the HSE south for 2010 prioritises the reconfiguration of acute hospital services in the region.  This plan involves the creation of a single acute hospital system across the region, to achieve the best possible health outcomes for the people of Cork and Kerry.  As part of this process, the HSE will reorganise some services across the six acute hospitals in the region.  While complex care will tend to be centralised, the roles of local hospitals in the areas of day surgery, diagnostics and outpatient care will be expanded.In May 2010, the HSE announced its intention to relocate orthopaedic services, including elective inpatient, rehabilitation trauma and day surgery, from St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital to the South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital, Cork.  This change, which is planned to take place in 2011, will result in all orthopaedic services being provided in an acute hospital setting, with related specialties, including rheumatology, on site.  Patients from Cork, Kerry and the wider Munster area will benefit from improved treatment and surgery for conditions including spinal and skeletal injuries and deformities, in addition to rehabilitation for damaged joints and muscles.  The redeveloped facility will have three dedicated orthopaedic theatres, compared to two in St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital.  It is also intended, following the move, to recommence orthopaedic surgery for children, for which HSE south patients must currently attend Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin.  Trauma and emergency orthopaedic surgery will continue to be delivered in CUH, as is the current practice.The HSE is working to develop national quality and clinical care standards across a range of hospital services and specialties and to improve the performance of outpatient services generally.  The measures I have outlined represent a structured approach to improving access to orthopaedic services in the Cork area and to the longer-term organisation of services in this key specialty on a safe and sustainable basis.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	615	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this important case.  It concerns a young boy in my constituency.  He is 14 years of age and he needs a serious operation to control severe scoliosis of his spine, which has been described as potentially life-threatening because the curvature in his spine is now affecting his lungs and his heart.Last December, the consultant in Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin decided that this boy would need this operation but he has been unable to give the parents, and the young boy, a date on which it can be carried out.  This boy's life could be at risk from something as simple as a chest infection from a cold or flu, and the severe pain he is enduring on a daily basis is causing untold anxiety, worry and heartache for his parents who are watching him in distress.  They are looking at his condition deteriorate in front of their eyes.  They are helpless in getting a solution for him.Last week they had a return visit and the consultant said that from an initial assessment this boy's condition had worsened since the examination last December but he was unable to give a commitment for the surgery.  I have contacted Crumlin hospital and the consultant has said the reason for the delay is the closure of St. Joseph's Ward, where there is severe limitation on the orthopaedic beds that will be required to aid this boy's recovery from surgery.  This is a difficult position for the consultant and for his staff.  There are other children who are deteriorating and have to be progressed more urgently, and their needs are being addressed.There is also a limit on the number of patients who can be treated because they have to be put on a traction bed in St. Brigid's Ward after the surgery.  There are currently two such beds.  One consultant operates one and the other, who is the consultant dealing with the child in my constituency, has the other.  There is severe limitation on bed space, and that is adding to the difficulties.I would like the Minister to indicate what can be done for the boy in this case.  Is it possible to get the procedure done outside the country under the National Treatment Purchase Fund?  This boy has been on the waiting list for quite some time.  His health is deteriorating.  He is in constant pain.  A cold or flu could be potentially life-threatening for him.  I find it heartbreaking to deal with the parents who continue to get the same reply that nothing can be done due to cutbacks.  The facilities and the services are not available for him and he is deteriorating on a daily basis in front of his parents' eyes.  That is causing huge concern and distress, and I share their helplessness and frustration.  They are intent on doing something for their child to improve his quality of life.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	616	I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.By way of giving some background detail, hospital care for children is provided in Dublin at three hospitals: Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, the Children's University Hospital, Temple Street, and the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght.  The priority of the Health Service Executive and hospital management is to ensure that services for children at each hospital are maintained at an optimum level.Scoliosis is a very distressing and disabling condition for young patients and their families.  Corrective surgery for scoliosis is carried out where it is clinically indicated.  Last year, the HSE and the paediatric hospitals put in place measures to assess the clinical position of children with scoliosis attending Our Lady's Children's Hospital with a view to determining the most appropriate treatment in each case, including surgery where indicated.  Those children requiring surgery have had their pre-operative assessments completed and surgery has been assigned based on clinical priority.To date in 2010, in excess of 125 scoliosis procedures have been carried out in Our Lady's Children's Hospital and approximately 30 have been undertaken in the Children's University Hospital, Temple Street.  Some 46 patients are currently on the waiting-list for treatment in Our Lady's Children's Hospital.The National Treatment Purchase Fund has agreed to fund eight paediatric scoliosis surgery cases in 2010.  The surgery will be carried out in Cappagh hospital; Our Lady's Children's Hospital is at present working to identify the patients who will be treated under this arrangement.  The three hospitals are continuing to work together to address these issues.  In addition, the HSE has informed me that a working group involving the three hospitals and chaired by the HSE is working on all the processes involved in treating children who have scoliosis and require surgery.  That group is working to ensure the best use of resources in the three hospitals to address this issue.  It is also working on the involvement of other hospitals outside Dublin in the case of patients who have been operated on to help increase the surgery rates in the three Dublin hospitals concerned.Preparation for corrective surgery for scoliosis includes pre-operative assessment and may involve HALO traction.  HALO traction is used in preparation for spinal surgery.  It involves fitting a frame to the head, neck and body in order to immobilise the area.  Patients may be in traction for six to eight weeks before they are ready for the next phase of treatment, which is the actual surgery.Treatment of this type requires extensive physical space around each bed and, as a result, only a limited number of patients can be treated at any one time.  Our Lady's Children's Hospital currently has two patients in HALO traction.In terms of the specific case mentioned by the Deputy, I am not aware of the full detail and I do not want to give any false commitments because there is a waiting list but the reply is a standard reply and I would prefer to have a meeting with the Deputy some time tomorrow, if that was suitable to her, to discuss the case in more detail.  I emphasise it is not at my discretion to allow someone jump a waiting list but there are more important aspects to the Deputy's presentation than is contained in the response and therefore I would like to discuss it with her some time tomorrow afternoon.

#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	618	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this issue which, as I am sure the Minister will appreciate, is very much on the minds of the pupils affected by this incident, albeit that it involved only 200 pupils who were largely constituents of my own.  Many of the parents have been in contact with me.I appreciate that the Minister has called for a report into what happened, and that is as it should be.  It is important to establish how this happened to prevent it happening again but my concern is not to apportion blame but to ensure that the 200 pupils, who are primarily boys although some girls were affected, do not suffer as a result of a below par performance which inevitably is what they would have given following such an event happening to them.I regret I have not so far heard the Minister indicate that she understands and acknowledges the impact on performance this incident has had on pupils who were already exhausted, as they approach the end of the leaving certificate.  Many of the pupils involved had a physics examination in the morning and the accountancy examination in the afternoon, and were already over-tired at that stage.  They were in the middle of doing what must be the most trying and stressful of examinations.  After all these years I still have nightmares that I am doing the leaving certificate Irish poetry examination.  I am sure there are very few people who do not have nightmares about the leaving certificate.As a former teacher I am aware there are two immutable rules that every teacher drums into students facing into the leaving certificate examination.  First, before they go in they should have a time management plan and stick to it and, second, before they start writing they should read the entire paper.  These students could do neither.  Even if they were fully compensated in terms of the time lost, and they were not, they had already lost out on those two important rules that must be in every child's head going into an examination.Many parents have contacted me to relay their distress and that of the family at what has happened, and I am not sure the Minister fully appreciates how upsetting this incident has been for them.  The leaving certificate is the most demanding examination any of us will ever have to do.  The entire family is stressed and in a high state of tension during this very difficult time.  All of the students affected are bright, higher level students who are hard-working and ambitious and, significantly, they are highly conscious of the importance of the points they need to get from this particular examination.  What has happened to them is unforgivable and the only thing the Minister can do now is to assure them that the wrong that has been done to them will be righted in the marking process.The Minister must direct that the marking scheme will be used to redress the damage done to the prospects of those 200 pupils.  It is vital the Minister ensures they will not be penalised as a result of this blunder.It was a monumental blunder for these students because the leaving certificate is a life-changing examination with no second chances.  If this were a nationwide problem, it would have been all over the newspapers and the Minister would have moved to set minds at rest.  However, because only a few hundred pupils have been affected, it has been downgraded.The whole point of having a standardised examination is that everyone is treated the same in so far as that is possible.  These pupils were not treated the same.  Even from school to school, this problem was dealt with differently.  One school was given a mere five minutes to compensate for the disruption, the consequences of which are incalculable.  The Minister must give peace of mind to the pupils affected and their parents so they will not have to suffer as a result of a problem not of their making.

There needs to be an investigation into the operation of the State Examinations Commission, SEC.  Many have asked through various media if it is properly resourced and organised.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills has a responsibility to fully address these questions in the House.There were major errors in this year's examination papers including incorrect figures in the business studies junior certificate paper, causing confusion and distress to students, and missing pages in the leaving certificate accountancy paper, causing confusion and a 45-minute delay to the examination in some Dublin schools.  How was this allowed to happen?  We need the answers to these questions not just through an Adjournment debate, but through a full question-and-answer session with the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills.As I stated earlier today on the Order of Business, the SEC and the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills also need to account for the fact they allowed the printing of this year's State examination papers to be awarded to two firms outside of this jurisdiction in the neighbouring island in Britain after they were put out to EU-wide tender under EU rules.  Did this lead to the errors in the papers?Irish printers say the tenders could have been broken up to ensure the business remained in Ireland.  In this economic climate, the decision to put the tenders out to Britain has cost jobs.  Last week, another Irish printer, Futureprint in Baldoyle, County Dublin, closed down with the loss of 112 jobs.We need the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills to be accountable for these matters.  We need assurances from her on the accuracy of the papers.  A line must be drawn in the sand.  The Minister must also give a response to the House on future printing contracts.  These were avoidable mistakes which should not be allowed to repeat themselves in next year's examinations.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	620	I am replying to this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills.  I thank the Deputies for raising this matter and apologise to the students affected by this incident.  We fully appreciate this is a highly stressful time for students taking State examinations.  Everything possible should be done to ensure the smooth running of the exams for candidates.The matter is being taken extremely seriously by the Department of Education and Skills and the State Examination Commission, SEC.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills has spoken to the SEC's chairperson who advised her it is reviewing the issues which arose with examination preparation and production this year.  The chairperson has assured the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills that he and the other members of the commission will be considering these issues as soon as possible with a view to making any changes needed to avoid a recurrence.  The chairperson will be reporting to the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills on the outcome of this work.Due to the review being in progress, it would not be appropriate to comment on the matter in detail until the report of the review has been completed and presented to the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills.  It is expected that a report relating to the production and collation of the examination papers, and what future steps can be taken to reduce the risk of recurrence, will be available by the end of July.The three-hour leaving certificate accounting examination took place on Monday afternoon, 21 June.  Accounting was offered as a subject in 514 schools for 5,171 candidates at higher level nationwide.  A production error in the examination papers affected 207 of these candidates across 16 schools in south Dublin, 4% of the higher level candidates.Upon learning of the error, arrangements were immediately made by the SEC to provide the students affected with the correct version of the paper by fax and e-mail.  The SEC gave an instruction that students should start the exam using the original paper provided and be given the correct version as soon as it became available in the school.  The SEC also advised the school authorities that additional time should be given to students to make up for any time lost that may have arisen as a result of a delayed start to the examination, or otherwise, as a result of dealing with this error.The length of time each of the 16 schools took to deal with the error would obviously vary depending on several factors such as the time taken to contact the SEC for instructions, the time involved in collecting the incorrect paper and distributing the correct paper and the number of candidates in the centre.While arrangements were being made in the affected schools to provide copies of the correct papers, the SEC gave the instruction that candidates should be advised to commence working on the paper which had been provided to them as it contained the entire section 1 of the examination.The SEC has also apologised to schools and candidates for the error.  It has operational responsibility for the operation of the certificate examinations.  Running the examinations is an immense logistical operation.  The 2010 examinations involve over 116,000 candidates in over 4,700 main examination centres and 8,000 special centres.  Over 250 different test instruments, 90 curricular and 15 non-curricular subjects, over 6,000 examiners, 3 million individual exam papers comprising over 34 million pages, and just under 2 million test items are involved in this process.  Of the 3.1 million examination papers produced by the SEC, approximately 85% are printed by external printing companies while the SEC has the capacity to print the remaining 15% of the requirements internally.In the case of the leaving certificate accounting higher level paper where a production error affected 207 candidates in 16 schools, the SEC can confirm that those papers were printed internally.This gives a background to the scale of the operation which is undertaken by the SEC each year in providing the State examinations across 13 days each June.  While not negating the impact on the students who were affected by this incident, it is important to keep in mind the majority of State examinations take place without any difficulties.One of the key objectives of the SEC is the provision of an examinations system of the highest possible quality.  The aspiration of any examining body, including the SEC, is to preside over a system that is completely error free.  Although the SEC has in place a range of procedures to enhance reliability and to minimise error, it is an unfortunate fact that errors can occur on examination papers.  Such errors are most regrettable.  When the error in the leaving certificate accounting paper higher level was brought to the attention of the SEC on Monday last, it immediately took steps to address the issue.  In a large-scale, point-in-time examination such as exists in this country it is inevitable that unforeseen circumstances will arise in the course of the examinations.  Although the SEC has in place a range of procedures to enhance reliability and minimise error, it is an unfortunate fact that errors can occur on examination papers.  The issue for the SEC is how to deal with these errors as they occur.In light of the huge volume of papers, some 3.1 million examination papers made up of 34 million A4 pages, produced each year the SEC has a formal process for scrutinising examination papers after they have been printed.  The issue with the leaving certificate accounting higher level was a production error which was not identified by the SEC as part of its quality assurance processes.  Once alerted to the error, the SEC took all reasonable steps to ensure the examination could proceed for the candidates concerned.I confirm to the Deputies that a review of the issues that have arisen this year with regard to examination paper preparation and production is being carried out by the SEC and this will be the subject of early consideration by the chairperson and members of the commission.  The review will also address any concerns in respect of the SEC processes that may have given rise to these issues and will inform any actions deemed necessary to prevent the recurrence of such difficulties in the future.  The Tánaiste has asked the commission to keep her informed of its actions and its ongoing reporting to her on the conduct of the examinations will make specific reference to these particular issues.As previously stated, this incident will be reviewed thoroughly by the commission and the Department looks forward to receiving a report on the matter and details of any changes in procedure to help ensure this will not recur in future.  I thank the Deputies again for raising this matter and I apologise once again to the students concerned.

The Commission for Aviation Regulation is responsible for the administration of the Travellers Protection Fund.  The fund is used where the bonds provided by tour operators and travel agents fail to cover the full costs of repatriations, refunds to customers and administration costs of the Commission in the processing of claims.At the end of 2009, the value of net assets contained in the draft Traveller Protection Fund accounts was €5.7m compared to €6.5m at the end of 2008.  While this is a notable decrease in the level of the fund, the fund remains in a considerably healthy state.  Officials from my Department, the Department of Finance and the Commission are engaged in discussions to explore what arrangements may be put in place to address the issue of insufficient funds being available in the Traveller Protection Fund should such an unlikely situation arise in the future.

I expect to be in a position to commence the relevant provisions Public Transport Regulation Act 2009 after the summer.With regard to the application referred to by the Deputy, the processing of that application was completed without prejudice to any court proceedings, in accordance with legal advice received.  The legal proceedings have since concluded.  I can confirm that following the consideration of the application under the provisions of the Road Transport Act 1932, and in line with my Department's own guidelines relating to the grant of licences, a licence was granted to the bus company concerned on 21 April 2010 for the operation of a express service linking Galway to Dublin City and Dublin Airport.  My Department is aware that the licence holder has sub-contracted service provision to another bus operator.  This arrangement, which is a common one in the bus industry, was notified to my Department in accordance with the procedures set out in the current bus licensing guidelines.

The findings of this study were published in August 2009.  It highlighted the strategic importance of Dublin Port to our national economy, with over 40% of national tonnage passing through the port.  The study provides the most recent analysis of future traffic and capacity projections at our commercial seaports. It concluded that significant additional port capacity would be required by 2025-2030.  An Bord Pleanála in its recent decision regarding Dublin Port, noted that the expansion of the port would not be contrary to a number of Government policies and studies, including the study referred to earlier, but refused permission on grounds related to the environmental impact of the proposal.

The National Transport Authority was established in December 2009, under the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009.  The National Transport Authority is tasked with the development of all public transport services and its specific objectives include the development of an integrated transport system which contributes to environmental sustainability and social cohesion and promotes economic progress.I regularly meet the Chairpersons of all State companies and agencies under my responsibility and I have also taken the opportunity to meet the full Boards.  In that regard I met the Board of CIÉ on 5 May last; I met with the Board of the Dublin Airport Authority on 14 May and I will be meeting with the Boards of Dublin Bus, Iarnród Éireann and the Railway Procurement Agency in the coming weeks.

However, because of the changed economic circumstances, it is now likely that not all of the projects originally identified in Transport 21 will be completed by 2015. Therefore transport investment priorities have been reviewed.  These priorities, which are set out in the Renewed programme for Government, are as follows:Future national road prioritiesthe progression of the Atlantic Road Corridor, andthe improvement of other key strategic routes.Public transport priorityincreased long term capacity, particularly throughthe construction of Metro Norththe construction of DART Underground and the implementation of the associated electrification, signalling and rolling stock investments.It is also a priority to continue planning other projects for earliest possible delivery when the economic situation improves.  No projects have been cancelled and Transport 21 continues to provide the strategic framework for capital spending on transport infrastructure into the future.

Until this statutory investigation by Railway Accident Investigation Unit is complete, it would not be appropriate for me to make any comment on the causes of the bridge collapse or the actions that are required as a result.Concerning the safety of the railway infrastructure the prime duty of care in this regard is with Irish Rail as the infrastructure manager for the Irish railway network. I understand following the bridge collapse Irish Rail immediately undertook a detailed inspection of 105 structures over water. These surveys were completed in April 2010 and found no further potential for collapse or catastrophic failure of these assets. Follow-on programmes, such as, a detailed review of bridge foundations on the rail network, continue to be carried out.With respect to the wider network, Irish Rail has developed a suite of key indicators for monitoring track and structural assets, as well as, safety critical activities for the maintenance and inspection of these assets. These performance indicators are monitored and reviewed on a weekly basis.  In addition, I understand that the Railway Safety Commission has independently carried out a compliance audit of Irish Rail to identify any organizational issues, actions or foreseeable failures, which may have contributed to the event.  A number of recommendations have been made and are being implemented by Irish Rail; the process is being monitored by the Railway Safety Commission.

I understand that the Consumer Protection Act 2007 makes it an offence for a trader to engage in a misleading commercial practice, which would include the provision of false information in relation to a product's usage or prior history to the extent that the information would be likely to cause the average consumer to make a purchasing decision that he or she would not otherwise make.  I understand that the National Consumer Agency enforces this legislation and provides advice for prospective buyers in its Guide to Buying a Car.

The company carried out its own review of corporate governance in 2007 and has confirmed to me that all recommendations have been fully implemented. In September 2008, I also appointed a new chairperson and five other directors to the board of the company.  State companies are required to show leadership by displaying best practice in corporate governance. My Department has introduced a number of initiatives to improve its own procedures for monitoring corporate governance in the bodies under its aegis.  I understand the payment referred to in the Deputy's question was related to a legal action.

My Department has been examining the recommendation contained in the report in relation to the merger of the Railway Procurement Agency and National Roads Authority into a single entity.  I have established a Steering Group and this group has had its introductory meeting.  Pending completion of this work it is premature to estimate the annual savings, which may accrue from the merger.However, the Government's continuing examination of all opportunities for rationalizing the numbers of State Agencies also forms part of the wider Government Agenda deriving from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development report on the public service.  As such it is not focused simply on cost savings arising from such mergers but on the broader synergies that can flow from such a process.

In the period from 1 June, 2009 to 31 May, 2010 the NVDF provided details on 163,495 vehicles covering 86 recall events.Not all vehicles for which details are provided may be subjected to recall because the manufacturer may determine that they are not affected. There may also be some recall events, particularly in the case of newer vehicles, where NVDF data is not requested from my Department because manufacturers' own records have up to date ownership particulars.  All recalled vehicles must have had EC Whole Vehicle Type Approval in order to have been registered in Ireland or in any EU Member States.  The Type Approval system sets minimum standards and testing processes which vehicles must comply with in order to be sold in the EU.  The tests cover minimum safety, environmental and construction standards.In addition to the system of Whole Vehicle Type Approval, EU Directive 2001/95/EC relating to general product safety provides a high level of consumer protection, with robust systems provided for between Member States to allow monitoring of vehicle manufacturing, enforcement of standards and sharing of knowledge between Member States. These measures allow Member States to order or organise, immediately and efficiently, the withdrawal / recall of unsafe products already placed on the market.  The National Consumer Agency informs the public of recalled products. Its website contains details of the products and the nature of the faults or defects.

At the first such meeting by video conference on 19th April, Ministers agreed measures that allowed for the progressive and co-ordinated opening of European airspace from 20th April centred on the designation of zones based on ash concentration levels.  These measures were immediately implemented by the Irish Aviation Authority with regard to operations in Irish airspace.  Data gathered from test and observation flights and airline operations since the volcanic eruption began and further discussions with airframe and engine manufacturers enabled the IAA and UK CAA to jointly implement a revised zonal system announced on 18th May which will considerably reduce the threat of further significant disruption.The Commission will be making a detailed presentation to myself and my fellow EU Transport Ministers at tomorrow's Council meeting outlining the EU's response to the consequences of the volcanic ash cloud on air transport. I anticipate that the discussion at tomorrow's Council will be a wide ranging one and will include a report on various initiatives underway to better prepare for, and alleviate, the impact of any future volcanic eruptions.  These initiatives include the accelerated implementation of the second phase of the Single European Sky initiative, an examination of the Regulation on air passenger rights to take account of experience during the crisis and a review of the ICAO Volcanic Ash Contingency Plan.

The implementation of individual national road projects, including service areas, is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Act, 1993 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  Section 54 of the Roads Act 1993 specifically provides for the NRA or a local authority to provide and/or operate service areas.In 2005, the then Minister for Transport asked the NRA to review its policy of generally not providing service areas on national roads, particularly on the expanding network of access-controlled motorways and dual carriageways.  Arising from this review, the NRA developed a programme for the provision of up to 12 service areas on the major interurban routes (MIUs) as well as the N6/N18 junction and the N11 route at intervals of approx 50-60 kms. Two documents relating to the NRA's policy on the provision of service areas are available on their website at www.nra.ie.  The documents are "Policy for the Provision of Service Areas on Motorways and High Quality Dual Carriageways", published in October, 2007, and "Service Areas on National Roads: NRA Policy and Status Update", published in February, 2010.Last year the NRA signed a contract under a PPP programme for the construction and maintenance of the first three service areas (two on the M1 and one on the M4).  Work has commenced on these and they are due to open later this year.  A further service area at Gorey on the M11 will be constructed as part of the N11 Rathnew/Arklow and N7 Newlands Cross Junction Improvement Schemes (a combined PPP Project).  Work on this PPP is due to commence in late 2010/early 2011.  The NRA proposals for other service areas across the network are progressing through the planning process.  However, the construction of these service areas is heavily dependent on the availability of funds and the prioritisation of projects within a reduced capital budget.  In the light of this, I have indicated to the NRA that they should consider other options to finance the provision of service areas which do not require Exchequer funding.

Speeding has been recognised as the single most important cause of traffic death and injury across Europe. The conference was addressed by a range of experts, from home and abroad, who have particular experience and insights into speeding on our roads, its consequences and the use of safety cameras as a deterrent. There was a wide-ranging discussion about the sale of vehicles in the EU with the capability of driving at well above the maximum permitted speed limits. This is a matter to be addressed at EU level under the vehicle type approval system. As far as I am aware, there are no proposals to employ speed limiters, as used in Heavy Goods Vehicles and buses, in private cars.Under Action 106 of the Road Safety Strategy 2007 — 2012, the Road Safety Authority monitors research on in-vehicle technology. One aspect of that research is on ISA (Intelligent Speed Adaptation). ISA uses information about the road on which the vehicle travels to make decisions about what the correct speed should be. I understand the Road Safety Authority's Policy Advisory Panel are currently reviewing the research available on all in-vehicle technology at the moment including ISA.

These programmes are subject to both internal and external audits.  Given the scale of investment in Transport 21, monitoring arrangements supporting the framework are in place to ensure that the projects and programmes identified are proceeding as planned and are properly appraised and provide value for money.  Structures are in place in my Department to provide these assurances.Every project in Transport 21 is required to be evaluated in accordance with the Department of Finance capital Appraisal Guidelines and Value for Money criteria, and my Department's Common appraisal Framework.  Most of the projects must also go through statutory approval processes, which usually means a public hearing before an independent inspector where the case for the project, including the overall business case, is set out.  Only when statutory approval is given can the implementing agency award the relevant construction contracts.A High Level Monitoring Group has been set up comprising representatives of the relevant Government departments and assisted by the Chief Executives of the State agencies with responsibility for implementing the projects in Transport 21. The main role of this Group is to monitor the implementation of projects and programmes provided for in Transport 21 and to review compliance with the Department of Finance's Guidelines.  My Department has appointed independent auditors to carry out reviews of a representative selection of projects.  These reviews look at capital appraisal and physical implementation of projects.  As part of ensuring value for money five Value For Money Reviews have been carried out by my Department since 2007.

No. 477 of 2006) vehicle testing arrangements and the contract for same are matters for the Road Safety Authority.  There is regular and ongoing contact between the RSA and my Department on matters pertaining to the National Car Testing Service (NCTS). My Department receives reports from the RSA from time to time regarding the number of tests booked and carried out and waiting periods.The management of the contract for the operation of the NCT is a matter for the RSA. I understand from the RSA that the contract with the NCT operator requires that a number of specific performance standards be met in a wide range of operational areas. The contract sets out the penalties, which can be imposed in the event that the contractor fails to meet the performance requirements.  I understand that the NCTS have employed additional vehicle inspectors, two new test centres have opened, and in addition certain test centres have increased opening hours. The NCTS also has further plans to increase capacity, which will improve customer service and ensure they are in a position to deal with demand on an ongoing basis.

A progressive approach is being adopted to allow customers to familiarise themselves with using the new system and to permit transport operators to undertake the necessary testing with the integration of the technologies involved. The project is now firmly in the implementation phase and extensive testing of elements of the system is already underway.Subject to successful completion of the testing that is currently in train, a number of Dublin Bus and Luas annual pass-holders will be invited to participate in a customer pilot from late Summer.  This will be followed later in the year by similar testing for ePurse (pay-as-you-go) users of Dublin Bus and Luas services. The pay-as-you-go system will be fully launched when this testing proves that the entire system is sufficiently robust. When this system goes live, it will facilitate cashless travel on services of participating operators, Dublin Bus and Luas initially.  The integrated smart card will subsequently be rolled out to cover services provided by private bus operators, Irish Rail (DART and commuter rail) and Bus Éireann following completion of the necessary development, testing and commissioning of their systems. Testing and roll-out for these service providers will commence in early 2011.The overall capital budget for the integrated ticketing project is €55.4 million. This expenditure encompasses project management, design and development costs and operator contributions for the development of the single smart card. To date €31.8 million has been spent on the project.  The name and branding of the integrated ticketing smart card is being developed by the Project Team in the Railway Procurement Agency and will be announced closer to the launch of the scheme.

As is the case with national roads, all regional and local road grants have now been fully allocated and there are no further funds available from which additional allocations could be made.  I have not yet had sight of the Chambers Ireland policy document referred to by the Deputy.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	651	I understand that Aer Lingus recently launched four new routes from Shannon to the UK, under its Aer Lingus Regional franchise with Aer Arann. I also understand that extra capacity will be deployed at Shannon for winter 2010 with a larger A321 aircraft to service the Shannon Heathrow route.  The Government regrets the decision of Aer Lingus to suspend transatlantic services from Shannon for 11 weeks in winter 2010/11. However, I am satisfied from a meeting I had with the Aer Lingus CEO on 15 June that the airline is maintaining employment at the airport and I welcome the fact that Aer Lingus has reiterated its commitment to the Shannon market.With regard to aviation connectivity generally, the Deputy will be aware that the market for air services in the European Union was fully liberalised in 1992. All European carriers are free to compete and operate on an equal basis within the European market. Decisions on the operation of commercial air services from any particular State Airport or Regional Airport are entirely a matter for air carriers, in conjunction with the relevant airport authority.Within the European Union, Ireland has consistently supported market liberalisation measures and has also sought to influence the wider international framework for aviation to ensure that it continues to promote competition and innovation in the market-place. In this context, the development of our bilateral aviation relations with emerging economic powers, such as China and India, is one of my Department's key long-term goals. The development of airport infrastructure and US preclearance facilities at Shannon and Dublin, which are unique in Europe, complement this strategy.

Under updated EU legislation governing these services, more stringent conditions will apply to future PSO arrangements, having regard, for example, to the availability of other transport connections and especially rail services with a travelling time of three hours or less.I have recently received a Value for Money review of Exchequer Expenditure on the Regional Airports Programme  which I am considering at present.  This Review was carried out to assist me in evaluating the appropriate scale of a regional airports programme in subsequent years bearing in mind my aviation policy objectives, the updated EU legislation, the improved surface transport links under the NDP and Transport 21 and the need to address the difficulties with our public finances.  I understand that all the regional airports, including Galway Airport, were fully consulted and were invited to make submissions in connection with the Value for Money Review.  I have recently received a request for a meeting from Galway Airport's Chairman and Managing Director which I am considering at present.

They detain any of these ships which have serious safety or environment related deficiencies. The inspections include enforcement of the provisions for living and working conditions.Following recent assessment visits by the European Maritime Safety Agency, EMSA, the Commission found that Ireland needs to improve in some areas including the reporting of ship calls and inspections out-of-hours. The steps which I am taking to improve our system include enhancing Ireland's maritime single window web portal "SafeSeasIreland." This will facilitate the reporting of ship calls and the targeting of sub-standard ships. Considerable effort has gone into developing this system and informing the industry of the requirements, including industry seminars and individual workshops provided by the Marine Survey Office.  In addition, as it may be necessary to carry out inspections at weekends, negotiations have started with the unions to provide for such cover. Moreover, as there is an obligation on the shipping industry to report ship movements, my Department has issued Marine Notice No. 13 of 2010 in this regard.From the 1st of January 2011 a new port state control regime will be introduced called the New Inspection Regime. This will be supported by a new information system THETIS that will be integrated with SafeSeasIreland. This new regime will strengthen port state control and it will focus on sub-standard ships and the companies operating them. It will include the provisions of the appropriate International Labour Organization Conventions.

Following a detailed study and impact analysis of various options in relation to the implementation of the Directive, and in line with that study's recommendations, the European Commission made proposals to amend the Directive, including a proposal to exclude genuine self employed bus and truck operators from the scope of that Directive.  On that basis Ireland supported the Commission's proposals, as did the majority of other Member States.I understand that following the recent rejection by the European Parliament of the Commission's proposals in relation to self-employed drivers, the Commission is now reviewing the position. The outcome of the Commission's review is awaited and when their position is known, I will assess the situation at that time.

However, claims under the Scheme can only be processed if a company is legally insolvent within the definition of the Act and a "relevant officer" — normally a receiver or liquidator — has been appointed and certifies the claims.I understand from correspondence from the person to whom the Deputy refers, that he has pursued the debt owing to him through the civil courts. An order granted by the court was referred to the Sheriff. However, the Sheriff was unable to execute the order as the employer had ceased trading and had insufficient funds to meet the debts due.A key issue raised in this case relates to company law. As outlined in Minister O'Keeffe's reply to previous correspondence in this case, there is no provision under company legislation which automatically prevents directors of a dissolved company from being or seeking to be directors of another company. If, however, the correspondent believes that there has been a breach of companies' legislation, it is open to him to refer the matter to the Office of the Director Corporate Enforcement (ODCE) who may be contacted atPostal Address:  Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, 16 Parnell Square, Dublin 1;Telephone: +353 (0) 1 858 5800;Fax: 353 (0) 1 858 5801;Email:  info@odce.ie;LoCall: 1890 315 015;Dx Number: DX145003, Parnell House.

All applications are processed in line with the Employment Permits Act 2006.Due to the tightening of Employment Permit rules in June 2009, the number of Appeals in relation to work permits has increased substantially from seventy-three in August 2009 to a current level of one hundred and six.   The Appeals Officer is currently dealing with appeals received in the second week of March 2010.  A decision is expected to be made on the appeal referred to by the Deputy within about 4 weeks.  I wish to advise the Deputy that there is currently only one Appeals Officer in the Employment Permits Section of my Department, whereas formerly, three Officers were available to process Appeals.Due to the prioritisation of the business needs of my Department, it was necessary to redeploy a significant number of staff in the Employment Permits Section to the Redundancy Payments area in early 2009 where there is a strong need for additional resources to process payments to those who have lost their jobs.  This has resulted in currently higher processing times for some of the permit types and appeals.  In the priority high skills area of Green Cards and Intra Company Transfers, applications are still being processed within 15 working days.  In relation to Work Permits, Spousal applications and appeals, steps are being taken, including allocation of scarce overtime resources, to reduce the current backlog to more acceptable processing times.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	657	My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.  I can confirm that my Department received a statutory redundancy lump sum claim on 15 February, 2010 in respect of the above individual.  This claim awaits processing.  In respect of redundancy lump sum payments paid directly to employees, such as in this instance, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from November 2009.In relation to Redundancy claims, the scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims in 2009 amounted to 77,001 which represents a threefold increase over the level of claims lodged in 2007 and earlier years.  In 2007, claims received were of the order of 25,000.  Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for Redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken in the Department in 2009 to alleviate the pressures on the Payments area include:Almost doubling the number of staff through reassignment to a current level of 52 full time equivalents;Prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget towards staff in the Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;Establishment of a special call handling facility in NERA to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses concerned about their payments.Better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website;Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against existing outstanding tax  liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.The backlog and waiting times remain at unacceptable levels.  However, improvements are evident.  I should point out that my Department has, in 2009, processed 50,664 claims, up 70% on 2008.  In the period 1 January 2010 to 31 May 2010 new claims amounted to 28,587 — a fall off of almost 20% on the corresponding 5 month period in 2009 when 35,559 new claims were lodged.  The reduction in incoming claims is most welcome.  Inroads are being made in the backlog of claims reducing from 42,591 in December 2009 to a current level of 34,881 at end May 2010.  In the first five months 34,036 claims were processed, up 130% on the same period last year.Responsibility for the payment functions arising under the Redundancy and Insolvency payment schemes is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	659	As I have mentioned in replies to several previous PQs from the Deputy and others, the third country provisions of the proposed Directive were the most contentious issues of the negotiations. I have also stated that the agreement on a general approach which was reached recently at Ecofin, represented a balanced, workable approach. I still believe that the Council's text on Article 35 represents the best solution on this difficult issue. However, as negotiations with the European Parliament are continuing under the co-decision process, I can not rule out the possibility of any further alterations to Article 35. My preference would be to maintain the text agreed in the Council general approach.The Deputy once again refers to Article 5 of the proposed Directive. In my reply on 9 June I had assumed that he was referring to Article 35. Article 5 is a technical provision which sets down the procedure for granting authorisation to all EU managers of alternative funds. As I noted in my earlier reply, this Article does not refer to non-EU managers. In substance there is not much difference between the approaches being adopted by the Council and the European Parliament on this issue.The proposed Directive deals with the managers of alternative funds, rather than, as the Deputy suggests, the funds themselves. The extent to which agreement can be reached between the institutions on the treatment of non-EU managers will be crucial in determining the success of the new regime. There are indications that agreement on an appropriate approach will probably be the most difficult issue in the negotiations with the European Parliament and will only be possible in the context of an overall global compromise.

This system builds on existing systems where possible, including the Civil Service Staff Information Portal (CSSIP).  The Public Service Numbers System uses December 2008 as its base and it records information on a quarterly basis.In the context of Budget 2010, the Government also decided to move to a new, more rigorous approach to controlling public service numbers, centring upon the establishment of agreed annual numbers ceilings, to be managed in accordance with Employment Control Frameworks for each Ministerial Vote Group.  The relevant numbers information is set out in Table 1 together with the end-2008 figures.  The Ministerial Vote Group ceilings for 2010 and 2011 are subject to technical amendments and further Government consideration in certain cases and are, as always, subject to any future Government policy decisions and priorities in regard to public service provision.For the period 2002 to 2009, aggregate information is available on a Departmental  basis for non-industrial civil servants and on a functional classification basis in respect of the defence sector, the education sector, the health sector, the justice sector, local authorities and non-commercial semi-State bodies (NCSSBs), which fall within the aegis of the various other sectors.  Table 2 sets out the public service numbers by functional classification for the period 2002-2009 and again includes the 2010 and 2011 ECF ceilings.  Table 3 sets out the Departmental breakdown of non-industrial civil servants for the period 2002 to 2009.  The figures for end March 2010 are also included.Table 4 sets out the non-industrial civil servants by grade for the period 2002 to 2009.  The figures for end March 2010 are also included. A grade breakdown is not available for other sectors on a similar basis, given the heterogeneity of grading of grading and responsibilities involved, and the fact that responsibility for managing staffing issues in these areas lies with other Departments (e.g. staffing of Local Authorities is primarily a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government).  Under the new Public Service Numbers Policy adopted by the Government in the context of Budget 2010, the distribution of staff by grade is a matter for each Vote Group to manage in line with their needs and priorities, subject to overall staff ceilings and other constraints set out in ECFs.End 2008 — ActualEnd 2009 — ActualEnd 2010 — ECF CeilingEnd 2011 — ECF CeilingEnd 2012 — ECF CeilingFinance Group10,1439,2919,3559,3249,295Taoiseach's Group1,6951,5991,5971,6661,493Justice Group25,60824,90124,58624,44624,306Environment Group37,23034,09334,27334,21834,168Education Group96,81395,05195,84795,92397,102CRGA Group810797834828824Foreign Affairs Group1,5441,5241,4861,4641,442CENR Group1,0691,0431,016993970Agriculture Group6,4025,7805,6815,4235,316Transport Group1,1391,0921,0461,0211,006Health Group112,632111,377110,760109,200107,640Enterprise Group5,5515,0945,0724,8724,815AST Group1,4801,3931,3971,3221,307Defence Group11,66711,11111,16411,12411,094SFA Group4,8165,0915,2065,2045,202Oireachtas Commission496471484475466319,095309,708309,804307,503306,446Note: There may be minor discrepancies between tables due to rounding2002200320042005200620072008200920102011ActualActualActualActualActualActualActualActualECF CeilingECF CeilingCivil Service37,79637,27636,86736,53337,15638,20039,31337,31637,38137,104Defence Sector11,65011,55911,45511,32011,33011,26311,26510,73610,77610,736Education Sector75,72076,98979,88183,43589,26390,45694,66392,98493,70693,806Health Sector95,67995,80098,723101,978106,273110,600111,025109,753109,100107,580Justice Sector12,64212,77313,37313,39214,10914,82715,38515,11714,80814,777Local Authorities34,17533,84533,39434,06734,68134,98735,00832,04432,20032,175NCSSB11,61211,36711,09411,40411,70011,79812,43311,76011,83411,325Total279,274279,609284,787292,129304,512312,131319,092309,710309,804307,503Note: There may be minor discrepancies between tables due to roundingDepartment/Office — Serving Non Industrial Civil Servants by WTEDec 2002Dec 2003Dec 2004Dec 2005Dec 2006Dec 2007Dec 2008Dec 2009March 2010Agriculture, Fisheries & Food4,5234,4904,5404,4994,1634,2944,2043,8413,734Attorney General114112116114115129128124122Central Statistics Office743688679749888825847793747Chief State Solicitor203223221226233237245230230Public Appointments Service172150147125148151146112108Commission For Public Service Appointments68891298Communications, Energy & Nat.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	661	I introduced a number of measures in the course of 2009 that have secured significant reductions in public service numbers since the end of 2008.  The first was the introduction of the moratorium on recruitment and promotion at the end of March 2009.  This measure has succeeded in ensuring that most of the natural turnover in staff has resulted in reductions in staff numbers, and has underpinned the focus upon greater efficiencies and restructuring of operations across the public service.In addition to this measure, I introduced two further measures to allow for targeted reductions in staff numbers.  The Incentive Scheme for Early Retirement (ISER) and the Special Incentive Career Break Scheme were launched at the end of April 2009 with initial deadlines of 1 September 2009 and 1 July 2009 respectively.  The deadline for the ISER was subsequently extended until 16 October 2009.  Both Schemes incorporated a strict non-replacement rule.The overall effect of these measures has been a significant reduction in staff numbers in the civil and public service.  Based on the information supplied to my Department, staff numbers have been reduced by around 10,000 between the end of 2008, when the numbers stood at 319,092, and the end of March this year, at 309,106.  These estimates, which are on a whole-time equivalent (WTE) basis, are subject to revision.  In the context of Budget 2010, the Government also decided to move to a new, more rigorous approach to controlling public service numbers, centring upon the establishment of agreed annual numbers ceilings, to be managed in accordance with Employment Control Frameworks for each Ministerial Vote Group.  Employment Control Frameworks work by setting ceilings on the level of staff, on a WTE basis, that each Vote Group can have at the end of 2010, 2011 and 2012.  These ceilings are set out in the table below.End 2010 — ECF CeilingEnd 2011 — ECF CeilingEnd 2012 — ECF CeilingFinance Group9,3559,3249,295Taoiseach's Group1,5971,6661,493Justice Group24,58624,44624,306Environment Group34,27334,21834,168Education Group95,84795,92397,102CRGA Group834828824Foreign Affairs Group1,4861,4641,442CENR Group1,016993970Agriculture Group5,6815,4235,316Transport Group1,0461,0211,006Health Group110,760109,200107,640Enterprise Group5,0724,8724,815AST Group1,3971,3221,307Defence Group11,16411,12411,094SFA Group5,2065,2045,202Oireachtas Commission484475466309,804307,503306,446The precise ceilings in each area are subject to technical amendments and further Government consideration in certain cases and are, as always, subject to any future Government policy decisions and priorities in regard to public service provision.

The Government has already acted to set up the National Procurement Service and has achieved some important savings in this respect. The Group's Report will serve to guide us on the next steps to take in securing further value for the State.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	663	My Department worked with the Special Group on the development of its recommendations for shared ICT services.  These recommendations are far-reaching and ambitious.  The Special Group recognised that greater sharing would have to be commensurate with improvements in the skills and knowledge of ICT staff.  Consequently, the recommendations will take considerable time and effort to implement and generate savings.  Accordingly, the Cabinet Committee on Transforming the Public Service has instructed all Departments and Offices to examine how they can enhance internal ICT capabilities and to develop ICT staffing plans in accordance with the Special Group's recommendations in this regard.  This work is underway.It's worth noting that a good number of shared ICT approaches and services are already underway.  Examples include the nationwide Government Networks, the shared integrated digital radio solution for the emergency and security services of the State, the Civil Service's HR Management System, the Local Authority Payroll and HR Management System, the Death Event Publication Service, a central ePayments solution (in the Local Government Computer Services Board), digital certificate authentication services (in Revenue), and framework procurements for a range of ICT commodities and telecommunications services, etc.In addition, a number of the largest data centre operators (such as Revenue, Agriculture and the Local Government Computer Services Board) have made their data centre facilities available to other public bodies in accordance with the Special Group's recommendations in this regard.  For example, the Revenue Commissioners have already taken systems from 6 other public bodies into its data centre and is in the process of evaluating systems from 7 more.Late last year, my Department embarked on an extensive research programme with a number of multinational hardware and software vendors to work out the best architectural and value for money approaches for Government use of cloud computing.  This next generation of computing models, which has sharing and multi-tenancy at its core, has the potential to consolidate hardware and software usage through "Infrastructure as a Service" and "Software as a Service" delivery.  If this research can identify approaches that are appropriate to the public service and are sustainable over time, it will fundamentally change the nature of ICT services delivery in the public service in the coming years and will facilitate the delivery of the additional shared ICT services detailed in the Special Group's recommendations.

To date, 16 agency rationalisations have been completed and information on these proposals, including estimated savings in terms of expenditure and staff reductions, is set out in Appendix 1 below.Information on a range of other agency rationalisations is set out in Appendix 2.  In summary, 7 measures have target completion dates in 2010, while two measures have target completion dates in 2011; and progress is also being pursued in respect of five other measures.  The Deputy will note that some of the measures marked down for completion in 2010 and 2011 have already been partially implemented.  As regards projected savings, the experience to date is that it is often difficult to make definitive savings projections when the functions of agencies and bodies are being transferred or consolidated.  Such matters only tend to become clear at, or shortly after, the commencement of the implementation phase.In addition to the general round of agency rationalisation referred to above, there have also been a number of other developments.  These include:(a) the rationalisation of functions of the Affordable Homes Partnership, National Building Agency and the Centre for Housing Research, together with certain functions of the Homeless Agency;(b) the absorption by the National Economic and Social Council of the National Economic and Social Forum and the National Centre for Partnership and Productivity; and(c) (i) the transfer of functions and resources of the Advisory Council for English Language Schools in Ireland (ACELS) to the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI); (ii) the transfer of the functions and resources of the International Education Board Ireland (IEBI) to Enterprise Ireland and the Higher Education Authority (HEA); and(iii) the decision by the Government that the National University of Ireland (NUI) would be dissolved and that the legislation amalgamating the NQAI, HETAC and FETAC will contain the provisions required to dissolve NUI.Finally, the question of further agency rationalisation, which would take the recommendations of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes into account, is under active consideration in the context of preparations for the 2011 Estimates.Completed Rationalisations — No. refers to the number of the proposal in the Budget measures.Savings 2009 (estimated figures in advance of outturns)Savings  2010Long-term Savings on an annual basis — after bedding downMax.

Under the Drugs Payment Scheme no individual or family pays more than €120 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.  In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.   Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	694	I propose to take Questions Nos. 126, 127 and 130 to 132, inclusive, together.Since the establishment of the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) in 2002, it has received funding totalling €597.782m for the treatment, to date, of over 170,000 patients. A table setting out the NTPF's annual allocation since its establishment is attached.   In each year to date, 95% to 96% of NTPF funding has been spent directly on patient care.  The balance covers the administration of the organisation, 2% to 2.5% of this being for salaries of staff.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's Report for 2008 examined the NTPF's arrangements for the procurement of treatment. The Report concluded "The examination suggests that, relative to the casemix benchmark, procedures purchased from private hospitals by the NTPF generally cost less than those carried out in the publicly funded hospital system".The NTPF's service plan for 2010 provides for 20,000 inpatient treatments (consisting of both inpatient and day case procedures) and 8,000 first-time outpatient appointments. Where clinically appropriate, treatments are increasingly carried out on a day basis.  The ratio as between adult and child cases is dependent upon how many paediatric cases are referred to or apply to the NTPF in any given year.  The Fund estimates that paediatric cases will account for 10% to 15% of activity in 2010.The number of referrals from individual hospitals each year is determined by the NTPF, having regard to a range of factors. These include the resources available to the Fund, the numbers and locations of persons waiting longest for treatment, the volumes of patient self-referrals and GP referrals received, overall casemix and the incidence of cases where high costs are incurred.  The approach is refined throughout the year to ensure that the maximum number of people gain access to faster treatment within available resources.  If any hospital or region does not use all available treatment slots, these are re-allocated.My Department has no role in relation to the operation of private hospitals and does not collect activity data for this sector.  Therefore I am not in a position to provide information on the proportion of private hospitals' activity accounted for by NTPF patients.Year€m20025.000200330.000200444.000200564.000200678.000200791.7502008104.640200990.300201090.092Total597.782

In a global market, which is fully liberalised within the EU, the scope for measures to provide direct support to airports and carriers is very limited.  The focus must therefore be on managing through a severe downturn and being well positioned for an upturn when economic circumstances improve.Looking to the future, the challenge will be to ensure that Irish aviation is well positioned to take advantage of the economic recovery when it comes.  To that end, the Government will continue to support the development of an innovative-friendly, pro-competition regulatory framework for aviation.  The continued roll-out of DAA's investment programme, most notably the opening of T2 later this year, and introduction of US preclearance facilities will greatly enhance the experience of customers using Irish airports and will provide airlines with opportunities to develop and grow new services.  My Department is currently engaged in measures to enhance our bilateral aviation relations with emerging markets such as India and China in support of the Government's Asia strategy.

The major inter urban roads programme, linking Dublin with Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and the Border with Northern Ireland, is on target for full completion in 2010. The upgrade of the M50 motorway is also on target for completion in 2010.On public transport, new railway stations have opened on the Kildare line and Irish Rail has completely modernised its intercity rolling stock under Transport 21. The Cork commuter rail line from Glounthaune to Midleton and the Luas line extension to the Docklands opened in 2009. Both Phase 1 of the Western Rail Corridor and the Kildare Rail Project opened early this year. Construction continues on other projects such as the Luas lines to Cherrywood and Citywest, and the first phase of the Navan rail line between Clonsilla and Pace.The start and completion dates for National Development Plan projects that have not yet commenced will be subject to the relevant statutory and procurement and contract award processes and will also be determined by the funding allocation available during the current difficult economic climate, having regard to the priorities for transport investment set out in the Renewed Programme for Government.  The vast majority of National Development Plan projects completed to date have come in on or under budget. A small number of projects ran over budget largely due to changes in the scope of those projects.

As part of the annual estimates process my Department critically examines the value for money aspect of all expenditure programmes.  These programmes are subject to both internal and external audits.Given the scale of investment in Transport 21, monitoring arrangements supporting the framework are in place to ensure that the projects and programmes identified are proceeding as planned and are properly appraised and provide value for money.  Structures are in place in my Department to provide these assurances.  Every project in Transport 21 is required to be evaluated in accordance with the Department of Finance capital Appraisal Guidelines and Value for Money criteria, and my Department's Common appraisal Framework.  Most of the projects must also go through statutory approval processes, which usually means a public hearing before an independent inspector where the case for the project, including the overall business case, is set out.  Only when statutory approval is given can the implementing agency award the relevant construction contracts.A High Level Monitoring Group has been set up comprising representatives of the relevant Government departments and assisted by the Chief Executives of the State agencies with responsibility for implementing the projects in Transport 21. The main role of this Group is to monitor the implementation of projects and programmes provided for in Transport 21 and to review compliance with the Department of Finance's Guidelines.  My Department has appointed independent auditors to carry out reviews of a representative selection of projects.  These reviews look at capital appraisal and physical implementation of projects.  As part of ensuring value for money five Value For Money Reviews have been carried out by this Department since 2007.

Transport 21 is made up of two investment programmes — a national programme and a programme for the Greater Dublin area. The main objectives of the programmes are—to create a high quality, efficient national road and rail network consistent with the objectives of the National Spatial Strategy;to provide for a significant increase in public transport use in Dublin and provincial cities;to strengthen national, regional and local public transport services;to enhance safety and security facilities at the regional airports.Due to the changed economic climate Transport 21 investment priorities have been reviewed.  The priorities for future investment, which are set out in the Renewed programme for Government, are as follows:National road prioritiesthe progression of the Atlantic Road Corridor, andthe improvement of other key strategic routes.Public transport priorityincreased long term capacity, particularly throughthe construction of Metro Norththe construction of DART Underground and the implementation of the associated electrification, signalling and rolling stock investments.It is also a priority to continue planning other projects for earliest possible delivery when the economic situation improves.  Transport 21 continues to provide the strategic framework for capital spending on transport infrastructure into the future.

As the six regional airports are owned and operated independently, operational costs at these airports are similarly a matter for each airport.In relation to comparative charges at other Airports in Europe, I have been informed by the DAA that a number of benchmarking studies have been conducted or referenced by the Commission for Aviation Regulation (CAR) concerning operating costs at Dublin Airport.  The most recent report, conducted by Indecon-Jacobs during the 2009 regulatory determination process, which is available on the CAR website at www.aviation.reg.ie, demonstrated that operating costs per passenger at Dublin Airport were the second lowest of the sample of comparator airports in Europe in 2008.

Issues relating to the scheduling of passenger services and freight facilities are entirely day to day operational matters for Iarnród Éireann.  The next step will be for Iarnród Eireann to undertake a detailed evaluation of Phases 2 and 3 with a view to arriving at precise costs to undertake the works.As I have indicated previously, the current funding environment is very difficult and it will not be possible to progress all the projects in Transport 21 in accordance with the ambitious timescale envisioned at its launch.  Despite this, I am seeking to progress planning of the Western Rail Corridor Phases 2 and 3, to ensure that Iarnród Eireann would be in a position to move speedily to construction at the earliest possible date. In relation to the final section of the line, it is currently being preserved under the Clár Programme and Iarnród Eireann will look again at its reopening when Phases 2 and 3 are completed.

Between 26th and 30th April, 2010, as part of Operation ‘Kingfisher', these premises were visited by members of An Garda Síochána and 16 were found to have closed or ceased trading, with a remaining 86 outlets operating nationwide.On 11th May 2010 regulation of certain psychotropic substances was introduced and a number of these premises subsequently closed down. As of 14th June, 2010, records at the Garda National Drugs Unit show a total of 44 headshops operating nationwide, with 42 having closed since 26th April, 2010.  The situation is being closely monitored by the Commissioner, his senior management team and the D/Chief Superintendent, of the Garda National Drugs Unit.As the Deputy is aware the Minister for Justice & Law Reform has published the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Bill 2010 which he hopes to have enacted within weeks.  Under the Bill, the sale or supply of substances which are not specifically proscribed under the Misuse of Drugs Acts, but which have psychoactive effects, for human consumption will be a criminal offence.  The Bill will give appropriate powers to An Garda Síochána and the courts to intervene quickly to prevent outlets from selling these products by way of appropriate prohibition orders. The Scheme will also contain full search and seizure powers for the Gardaí and Revenue's Customs Service.The Bill is part of the Governments multi-pronged approach targeting the activities of head shops. On foot of the Government Order of 11 May, the Minister for Health and Children made the necessary statutory instruments to make the sale of substances commonly sold in head shops subject to criminal sanctions under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.

In accordance with Section 9 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended), he was entitled to remain in the State until his application for asylum was decided.  His asylum application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 30 April 2010, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.  In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision. Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.

A certificate of naturalisation issued to the first named person referred to in the Deputy's Question via registered post on 11 February, 2009.  Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that further processing of the second named person's application is ongoing and the file will be submitted to me for a decision in due course. All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants.  The average processing time from application to decision is now at 26 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale.The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks. There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.

Passport Service staff continue to work overtime to assist in keeping the number of applications in the system to a minimum.  In the last week, additional staff have commenced work in the Passport Service and will be working to clear this backlog.  While this will take some time, every effort is being made to minimise the inconvenience to the travelling public.The Passport Service has announced that it is now in a position to re-introduce a guaranteed turnaround time for passport applications.  Applications submitted via the Passport Express service (Swiftpost in the Republic and NIPX in the North), available through local post offices, are now guaranteed to be processed within 22 working days.  This 22 working day guarantee will be kept under review and it is intended that this will reduce over the coming weeks.  The new guarantee turnaround time will help re-establish trust in the operation of the Passport Service.A new service to prioritise applications for those with immediate travel plans has also been introduced.  Applications with proof of travel are now guaranteed to be processed within three working days.  Applicants should make contact with the Passport Service & provide this proof where applicable.  An additional fee may apply in respect of such new applications.  This is the fastest turnaround time for all applications except for those whose travel is required for urgent humanitarian reasons.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	717	I propose to take Questions Nos. 155 and 156 together.The Kimberley Process (KP) is a cooperative effort between governments, civil society and industry groups to stem the flow of "conflict diamonds."  Conflict diamonds are defined as rough diamonds used by rebel movements to finance wars against legitimate governments.  The Kimberley Process involves the control of diamond production and trade through a certification process and is implemented through a peer review mechanism.  There are 49 members of the Kimberley Process, with the EU and its member states counting as an individual member.  Its membership includes all the major diamond producing, trading and processing countries.Since its launch in 2002, there has been growing discontent among civil society regarding the credibility of the KP.  A major criticism is that the definition of conflict diamonds does not acknowledge the central role that human rights have and should play in the Kimberley Process nor does it recognize that governments, in whole or in part, could engage in acts of terror or criminality.  In light of this, the civil society coalition in the KP has sought to amend the founding documents of the Kimberley Process to include references to human rights.  This proposal was supported by the EU at the November 2009 KP Plenary; however, it was ultimately unsuccessful following resistance by other members, notably China and India.  A number of non-governmental organisations have subsequently made an alternative proposal to include human rights references in an operational document and the EU will support this proposal.  However, it is by no means clear that the new proposal will succeed.Zimbabwe's compliance with the Kimberley Process became the focus of international attention in 2009 on foot of widespread illegal mining and smuggling in the Marange diamond fields as well as reports of violence and human rights violations caused by Zimbabwe's military trying to regain control of the fields.  In November 2009, the KP plenary meeting in Swakopmund, Namibia, agreed with Zimbabwe on a Joint Work Plan to bring diamond mining in Marange into compliance with the minimum requirements of the KP.  Under the plan, exports of Marange diamonds are subject to prior verification by an independent KP Monitor.Following two fact finding missions, the KP Monitor for Zimbabwe, Mr Abbey Chikane, issued a report at the end of May which concluded that, under the terms of reference of his missions, Zimbabwe had satisfied KP minimum requirements.  At the same time, a number of reports issued by civil society called for the suspension of Zimbabwe from the KP on the basis of a number of concerns, including the continued lack of transparency of diamond mining in Zimbabwe as well as ongoing human rights abuses.  The EU, while taking note of the KP Monitor's conclusion, believes that, in light of the concerns expressed regarding transparency and abuse of human rights, further discussion is needed before any conclusion of the Joint Work Plan may be possible.In that connection, the arrest and detention of Mr Faria Maguwu on 3 June raises serious concerns regarding the protection of the role of civil society in the Kimberley Process.  Mr Maguwu is executive director of the Centre for Research and Development, the leading civil society group in Zimbabwe that monitors smuggling and human rights abuses in Zimbabwe's diamond fields.  I understand that the arrest follows a meeting on 27 May with the KP Monitor, Mr Chikane, during which Mr Maguwu was alleged to have handed over a restricted document to Mr Chikane.  Mr Maguwu has since been charged with communicating false statements prejudicial to the State and his case is scheduled to be heard today.  I am also concerned by reports of Mr Maguwu's treatment while in custody, which have raised fears for his health, as well the reported conduct of the Zimbabwean police and security forces before and after his arrest.The EU is seeking through the Kimberly Process to clarify the circumstances of Mr Maguwu's case and to highlight its implications for the role of civil society.  The EU delegation will also raise Mr Maguwu's case at the KP inter-sessional meeting in Tel Aviv this week.  Our Embassy in Pretoria has also communicated Ireland's concerns to the Government of Zimbabwe.  While we are unable to attend Mr Maguwu's hearings, we will continue to monitor the case closely.

It has been allocated funding of €80,352 in 2010.  Contracts with the various organisations which are being funded under this Scheme are due to expire on 31 December 2010.  Officials in my Department are currently carrying out a review of the Scheme and I hope that this process will be completed by the autumn.  On the basis of the findings of the review, I will consider the options available to me.All organisations involved in the Scheme, including the one referred to by the Deputy, are being consulted as part of the review process.  It should be noted that I am planning to meet this week with representatives of ‘Voices that Matter', a grouping of national networks and organisations. The organisation referred to by the Deputy is a member of this grouping.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	720	As the Deputy is aware, the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme and the Community Development Programme were my Department's two main social inclusion/community development programmes. These came to an end on 31 December last and have been superseded by a new integrated programme, the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP). A key difference between the new LCDP and its predecessor programmes is the fact that, when fully implemented, it will be delivered nationally on an integrated basis by a reduced number of companies.My Department has set out a national model involving full integration of CDPs with local development companies (LDCs), but has made it clear that other options can be considered and that it is not a question of ‘one size fits all'.  The only option not acceptable is one that seeks to preserve the status quo: some models proposed by CDPs and other parties in the period since the launch of the LCDP have had to be rejected on that basis. However, my Department has been able to respond positively to a number of other alternative models put forward by both LDCs and CDPs. While agreement has not yet been fully finalised in these cases, I am satisfied that the real possibility for agreement exists. Additional proposals from other CDPs and LDCs are also being considered positively but are less developed at this stage.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to respond positively to all constructive proposals that it receives and that my officials will continue to be available to meet with the boards of projects.I am aware that some CDPs have a range of concerns about assets, the impact on local service delivery, local buy-in and accountability. However, I am confident that those issues can be addressed in the implementation process previously outlined by my Department and now under way. In this regard, an information session for stakeholders was held by Pobal, on my Department's behalf, on 10 June last.

I have no proposals to revert to the old system as a person who cannot obtain a mortgage in respect of the purchase price from either a commercial lender or a housing authority is unlikely to have sufficient means to meet the full costs of home ownership, including maintaining and insuring the property, by any other method.

I understand that large-scale rainwater harvesting systems have already been installed in some schools. The Department of Education and Skills has indicated that it will continue to address water conservation issues in the context of the design and construction of new schools or where major renovations are being carried out to existing schools under the schools modernisation programme.  The introduction of a grants scheme for any purpose must be managed within current budgetary constraints and, insofar as the funds administered by my Department are concerned, there are no plans to introduce a scheme for the installation of Rainwater Harvesting systems.

The various supports available are detailed on my Department's website, www.environ.ie.In terms of the options available for households who have had their home repossessed, it is open to such households to apply to their local authority to have their needs assessed. In certain circumstances, householders who have had their homes repossessed may be eligible for social housing support. The assessment of housing need and the setting of allocations policies are matters for individual local authorities.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	733	An application under the 2010 Single Payment and other Area Based Schemes was received from the person named on 11 May 2010.  While there are three parcels listed on this application, none of the three are situated in a Less Favoured Area (known as Disadvantaged Areas in Ireland), as designated under the provisions of the governing EU Directives and Regulations.The Commission is currently conducting a review of Less Favoured Areas across the EU, having been mandated by the Council of Ministers to conduct that review. The object of the exercise is to establish an EU-wide system, which will allow comparisons between regions; the proposal represents a move away from designation based on socio-economic factors, (declining rural population, low productivity and low farm incomes), to a methodology favouring physical characteristics, (soil type, poor climate, slope and altitude of land). While the Commission review is ongoing, it is envisaged that any changes to the Scheme will not be introduced before 2014.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	734	At the meeting on 15th April last, the Taoiseach advised the religious congregations of the Government's view that it would be a fair and reasonable outcome in all the circumstances for the State and those responsible for the residential institutions, to meet the final costs of responding to residential institutional abuse, which are estimated to reach some €1.36bn, on a 50:50 basis.As the Deputy is aware the Congregations are offering significant additional contributions, which they have valued at €348.51m.  While more detailed work and discussion is necessary with the Congregations in relation to the detail of their property offers, assuming these contributions are fully realised, the Congregations' collective contributions to date, when account is taken of the original €128m contribution under the 2002 Indemnity Agreement, amount to €476.51m.  This leaves a target of over €200m to reach the 50% share of the overall projected costs, of some €680m.  The Government requested that additional contributions be provided to the greatest degree possible in cash as a contribution to the planned National Children's Hospital.  Officials are engaging with each of the Congregations in relation to their current offers and how the objective of a 50:50 sharing of the overall costs will be achieved.The Government announced its proposal to utilise the cash element of the Congregations' current offers of contributions, which will amount to some €110m over the next few years, to establish a Statutory Fund, in keeping with the all party Motion passed by Dáil Éireann, supporting the proposal for a Trust for the support of victims and to other education and welfare purposes.  Following consultation with the Congregations and the former residents as to the exact nature of the fund, how it will operate and the uses to which it will be put, the arrangements for the Statutory Fund will be considered by the Government.  This Fund, which will be to support the needs of survivors is separate and distinct from the compensation scheme operated by the independent Residential Institutions Redress Board, which provides fair and reasonable awards to victims of institutional childhood abuse.

These discussions are continuing.  My officials are willing to meet with representatives of the college to which the Deputy refers, if requested.I wish to assure the Deputy that I am committed to supporting Protestant education, while at the same time ensuring that funding arrangements for schools under Protestant management are in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.  I am committed to continuing this engagement with members of the Protestant community, as I believe that these issues are best resolved collaboratively.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	736	The staffing schedule is structured to ensure that, on average, one mainstream classroom teacher is allocated to schools for every 28 pupils. Improvements to the staffing schedule arising from the additional posts in the renewed Programme for Government mean that one mainstream classroom teacher is allocated, on average, for every 27 pupils in medium to larger schools as these schools are typically under greatest pressure in relation to class sizes.Posts allocated on the basis of the staffing schedule are specifically for mainstream classes and should be deployed accordingly. School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment etc.). In particular, school authorities should ensure, as far as possible, that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	737	Rainwater harvesting systems were first introduced for major school building projects in 2008.  Since then all major school building projects, where site conditions and circumstances allow and where economically viable to do so, can incorporate a rainwater harvesting system into their brief.  While fitting the systems in new schools during construction is relatively straightforward, retrofitting them in existing schools is much more difficult and expensive because of the various dedicated pipe work systems both within the building and externally underground and the amount of making good work that is required in each instance.For existing buildings it is more cost effective to minimise the demand for water firstly through push type spray taps, low flushing toilets, urinal controls, repairing leaks, etc.  In that context, as the Deputy will be aware, schools were invited to apply for funding for water conservation measures as part of the Summer Works Scheme for 2010.  I announced details of the successful applicants under the mainstream Summer Works Scheme on 19 April last.  The applications for water conservation measures as part of the Scheme are to be processed separately.  However, work on processing these applications has not yet begun due to industrial action on the part of some staff in the Department.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	738	I can confirm to the Deputy that the school to which he refers has made an application to my Department for large scale capital funding.  The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned a Band 1 rating.  Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, is now available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners.  There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.  Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's website.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.  In order to meet the immediate accommodation needs, the school authority was sanctioned an all-in grant in December 2009 to build 4 mainstream classrooms.  In addition, the school authority received approval earlier this month for funding to alter existing rooms to form an Art /Technical Graphics Room.

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  I have arranged for the details supplied to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.  I wish to assure the Deputy that SNA support will continue to be made available to schools which have enrolled pupils who qualify for such support.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-23 00:00:00	Prelude	741	The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is an independent agency with responsibility for determining the appropriate staffing levels in relation to the support of pupils with special educational needs in all mainstream and special schools.  This includes determining the level of SNA support in schools.  The NCSE operates within my Department's policy in allocating this support.  Neither I, nor the Department of Education and Skills, interfere with the allocation decisions taken by the NCSE in schools — whether such decisions result in an increased or reduced allocation to the schools.All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.  I understand that the school concerned has contacted the SENO regarding this matter and that considerations are ongoing regarding appropriate staffing levels for special needs assistants at the school.
