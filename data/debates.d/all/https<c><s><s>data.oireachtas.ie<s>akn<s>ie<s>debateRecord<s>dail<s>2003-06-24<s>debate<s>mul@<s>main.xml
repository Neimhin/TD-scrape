What plans does the Taoiseach have to expedite the business of the tribunals given that the estimated costs in some cases for the Flood tribunal are as much as €500 million? Does the Government have a set of proposals to precipitate the process? For instance, if three judges are appointed to a tribunal, they could deal with individual modules.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_12">Such a proposal would accelerate the work of the Moriarty tribunal or any other tribunal. Mr. Justice Moriarty said that the tribunal has been sitting for over 18 months but not one scintilla of direct evidence has been produced yet. Will the Taoiseach expedite the matter or should there be an interim report in the public interest?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_5">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_13">I do not have details of the number of files, but generally files are requested by the tribunal and all requests for information are dealt with on a confidential basis. I think the Deputy will understand that I must respect that.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">In March 1999 my Department brought to the attention of the tribunal a number of records relating to naturalisation for investment which were among working papers on special projects in the Department from the IDA and CII. Records were delivered to the tribunal on 5 March and I dealt with them in the House at that time. There may have been other requests but that was the last one – I am subject to correction on that – that related to naturalisation for investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">I cannot recall any recent requests, although I will check that. There were issues early in the process where the Moriarty tribunal sought information, and the Flood tribunal has also requested information.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">The Government has no fixed position on the tribunals. It is still intended that the Moriarty tribunal will finish its evidence this year, as I have said previously, but that does not mean its report will be written up this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">On the Flood tribunal, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, has today forwarded to the Clerks of the Dáil and the Seanad a letter dated 16 June from Mr. Justice Feargus Flood. In that letter, Mr. Justice Flood states that he considers himself  unable to continue to act as chairperson of the tribunal. He has set out four reasons that are contained in the letter, which will be circulated to Members of each House. However, Mr. Justice Flood also stated that he does not consider himself unable to continue to act as an ordinary member of the tribunal as permitted by the relevant legislation and subject to the resolutions of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">In his letter of 16 June, Mr. Justice Flood has made it clear that the duties and responsibilities of being chairman, and particularly the determination of the costs issue, will require of him "significant levels of physical and mental stamina and capacity to carry out exceptionally demanding work over an extended period of time." He also stated that his continuing to act as chairperson would impose an undue strain on him.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">It is proposed in the letter that The Honourable Mr. Justice Alan Mahon, senior counsel, will be appointed as the new chairperson of the tribunal and will deal with the issue of costs. Our legislation on tribunals enables these changes of rules to occur. However, the Houses of the Oireachtas are required to pass resolutions making provision for these changes and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, then issues an amended instrument. Accordingly, the Dáil and the Seanad will have to consider the content of Mr. Justice Flood's letter because it is not just a matter for the Government as the tribunals are set up by the Houses. Indeed, Mr. Justice Flood notes in the letter that "his continued involvement in the tribunal must be a matter for the Oireachtas."  That is the reason I bring this matter before the House because this letter was discussed this morning at Cabinet on the return of the Attorney General from The Hague, where he was last week when the letter arrived. I thought it appropriate that I should bring it to the floor of the House immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">The Government today considered the contents of Mr. Justice Flood's letter and a number of issues have arisen as a result of the letter which require further clarification and in that context, the Minister, Deputy Cullen, will write this afternoon to Mr. Justice Flood. It is obvious that this House will take whatever steps are necessary, as expeditiously as possible, to ensure the correct procedures are followed and that future determinations of the tribunal are valid and legally sustainable. This will include passing amending legislation on the costs issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">In the context of this changed set of circumstances, it may be appropriate at this time for this House, with the assistance of the tribunal, to address the short and long-term implications of this development for the operation of the tribunal. I am not a legal expert but it has been pointed out to me by many of my legal colleagues that this opens up many issues which it is probably not appropriate for me to go into now. I may not be capable of dealing with all of them because  they are legal matters. As this is a matter for the Houses of the Oireachtas, I would be prepared to share my advice, which I have not yet received, with the party leaders in order that the House can make a decision on these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">The present state of play is that Mr. Justice Flood has dealt with all of these issues and if he does not deal with the costs, a question clearly arises. I do not want to say anymore than this. I have not had an opportunity to study all the legalities in the few hours since I have been made aware of these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">A second aspect is that many modules are in train. To answer Deputy Kenny's question, I understand there are something like 15 years of modules in train. There are already issues of costs that to my knowledge, the last time I checked – and I have not checked for many months – could be of the order of €50 million or €60 million. I tried to check it again in the past half hour but nobody could give me an assessment.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">I thought it appropriate that I bring this matter to the House and I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the time to do that on this question. As soon as I came out of the Cabinet meeting, I instructed the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, to pass the letter to the Clerks, and they will be put into the public domain. However, my sense is that the House should not rush the matter but we should look at it. I would be glad to consult the leaders of the other parties. In the first instance, we have written to seek the clarifications we require. These are, I believe, similar to those the party leaders would require and I will be glad to exchange this information when we receive it. My preliminary view is that we should spend some time over the summer considering the issue.</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_25">I thank the Taoiseach for bringing this matter to the attention of the House. This is an important public issue and it is proper that the Taoiseach, as Head of Government, should bring it back to the Houses of the Oireachtas which set up the Flood tribunal in the first instance. Mr. Justice Feargus Flood is to be complimented for having the stamina to sit through an avalanche of material from a wide variety of sources and for producing an interim report of an exceptionally high standard. However, this development calls into question the legality and functions of the tribunal, as established by Dáil Éireann, in terms of its intent and future remit. Persons already interviewed before the tribunal may well challenge its findings because Mr. Justice Flood will no longer be <i>in situ.</i>I agree with the Taoiseach that the matter should not be rushed. In its review of the tribunal and its workings, Dáil Éireann should re-examine its remit. While nobody wants to place restrictions on finding the truth, there is a public interest requirement to have efficiency, effectiveness and response in determining it. In so far as my party can offer advice to the Government or  the Taoiseach in that regard, we would be happy to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">It appears from some quarters as if the Flood tribunal may have assumed a remit to continue for the next 20 years and examine all sorts of decisions by local authorities throughout the State. I do not know if that was the original intent of the Oireachtas in setting up the tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">We all want to stand by the truth and see no obstruction placed in the way of finding it. The Fine Gael Party will be happy to offer its support and assistance to the Government to allow the tribunal to continue to find out the truth in a speedy and cost-effective manner.</p>

        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_8">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_29">I was not aware of this development. Does the Taoiseach agree that, given Mr. Justice Flood's age, the time he has applied to the position, the manner in which he was obstructed virtually at every turn and the threatened duration of the tribunal, it is understandable if he might want to be relieved of the duties and pressures of being chairman of the tribunal and seek that the House agrees to the proposition he has put to us? Is it not also the case that it would be reasonable, when doing the sums on the tribunal, to take into account that Mr. Justice Flood has made a considerable contribution on the other side of the balance sheet in terms of taxes procured for the Exchequer, arising either directly from his work or indirectly as a result of the matters into which the tribunal inquired?</p>
          <p eId="para_30">The Taoiseach appeared to indicate that Mr. Justice Flood has proposed that he not be seised of the cost issue and that this be passed to the new chairman in due course. Is that correct? Will Mr. Justice Flood make a second interim report before the baton is handed over?</p>
          <p eId="para_31">I agree with Deputy Kenny and with what the Taoiseach has said about the need to reflect on this. We are all a great deal wiser now and had less grey hair when these tribunals were established. There are 15 year modules already in train, and we have not yet got to Donegal, Cork, Kerry or Galway—</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_33">—or Mayo. Given what has recently happened in Loughrea, there is no reason, on the same logic that caused Dublin to be examined, not to consider Loughrea and other places. On that estimate Deputy English will be on the pension by the time it concludes. This clearly requires consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">What is the status of the speeches made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about alternative systems of inquiry? Are legislative proposals likely to emerge soon? The public is asking if it is not feasible for persons other than  top-flight senior counsel to do the preliminary work and establish whether a <i>prima facie</i> case lies in any instance. The public is also asking why skilled senior counsel, whose purpose is to present evidence in a courtroom, are carrying out this preliminary inquiry work.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">Is the Taoiseach saying that it is feasible for the Houses of the Oireachtas to intervene and cause some of the outstanding modules to be done more efficiently through an alternative mechanism? Is it not the case that persons whose names have already been mentioned at any of these tribunals would presumably have cause for action if they were not given their day in court? Some of them may not want to have their day in court, but that is a different issue. Where modules have been opened or where evidence has been adduced that would seem to reflect adversely on a person's reputation, presumably these persons would have a grievance if they were not given the opportunity to vindicate their good name. Is the Taoiseach saying it is within the capacity of the House to intervene on foot of either Mr. Justice Flood's letter or a second interim report to see if the runaway horse can be brought under control in terms of future exposure to the Exchequer?</p>

          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_38">I appreciate that you have given latitude in that regard. I thank Mr. Justice Flood for the work he has done. In the interim report and in his patience and tenacity in light of the rebellions he faced from the witness box, he has shown how a tribunal can be dealt with effectively, even if it is a frustrating experience for him. It brings to mind the election slogan "Much done, more to do". On the future operation of the Flood tribunal, will the changing of the chair be factored into, for example, the terms of the commission of investigation Bill to provide for that eventuality? This may not be the only time we have to countenance this situation. It is, therefore, important to be prepared for it. Does the Government intend to await the conclusion of the full term of the tribunal before moving to introduce legislation to remove the greed factor which has landed the country with the cost of these tribunals in the first place? Will the law be changed to remove, for example, the high profiteering factor of rezoning as will be proposed by the Green Party in Private Members' business later today?</p>
          <p eId="para_39">Does the Government intend to act before the conclusion of the Flood tribunal to allow court cases to be heard, as mentioned by Deputy Rabbitte? Not only will Deputy English be drawing a pension by that time but, more seriously, quite a number of witnesses may be dead and we will be wondering what would have been their evidence and the outcome of the tribunal. It will be unsatis factory for those who may pass on, as well as their relatives, if the matter is not concluded speedily. Will the Government act now rather than wait interminably for the tribunals to conclude?</p>

          <p eId="para_40">I note the Taoiseach's remarks on Mr. Justice Flood and the Flood tribunal. This again invites a focus on the exorbitant and unacceptable rates, of the order of €2,500 per day, that certain tribunal counsel are drawing. Does the Taoiseach not recognise that while there is undoubted public concern at the duration of tribunals, the real focus of public concern is their exorbitant cost arising from the exorbitant fees demanded and received by lawyers and legal firms taking part in the process? Will the Taoiseach use this opportunity, heralded by Mr. Justice Flood's indication to him, to introduce legislation to properly regulate the fees of legal advisers up to counsel level who are involved in tribunals? It is imperative that this be done. I am concerned that in recent times a spin has been employed – I do not know whether it comes from Government circles – that the tribunals, in their plurality, might very well be drawn to an early cessation. There is much to be inquired into, and these are important vehicles for getting to the truth, not only in regard to the focus of the Flood and Moriarty tribunals, but on matters of malpractice in a raft of areas from health to planning that have occurred and continue to take place within our society. Will the Taoiseach indicate whether he intends to introduce legislation to regulate the fees being paid to the legal participants?</p>

          <p eId="para_53">The tribunal legislation enables changes in roles to occur, but the Houses of the Oireachtas are required to pass resolutions making provisions for these changes. That comes about by an amended instrument. I am advised that is the position. Mr. Justice Flood made that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">If it was the case that Mr. Justice Flood was not dealing with a cost issue I am advised we would have to pass amending legislation to deal with it because he is the justice who heard all those issues. A sizeable amount of money is involved. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has provided the figures. The legal costs to date amount to €26 million, which excludes costs for those claiming costs, which come to very substantial amounts of money.</p>

          <p eId="para_57">That is so. There are difficulties with that, but I do not wish to go into them. However, it would take legislation. It could also give rise to further issues by people, but we will not go into that now. It raises legal questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">There are no indications in these proposals of an interim report up to Mr. Justice Flood's change of position. That does not arise in this suggestion. For that and some other reasons, the Government has sought clarification on those points and when we get it I will make the party leaders aware of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">Deputies Kenny, Rabbitte and Sargent asked me about the commission investigation Bill. I answered questions about the legislation in the past few weeks. It was to be ready during the summer recess and, if I recall, was to be circulated in July and taken in the autumn. The legislation will not apply to existing tribunals but will deal with new cases that arise. There have been no conversations whatsoever about any of the mod ules of any of the tribunals. There are approximately eight tribunals or inquiries, such as the Laffoy Commission. They are to finish their deliberations and the legislation will only apply to new ones.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">Deputy Rabbitte's point is salient. I am not sure about the legalities in the way the tribunals work in terms of those who have been named or have made submissions, even though these may have occurred some years ago. People incurred considerable costs in making their legal submissions and defences to the tribunal as did the tribunal itself in dealing with matters to date. How can one take them out and place them before another investigative system? I have long held the view, which does not arise from the events of today, that it must be possible to deal with some of these issues individually through judges, or by some other means. Difficulties arise when people attempt to remember what happened 15 years ago. If one waits another 15 years to investigate them, the witnesses may not even be about. It becomes a fairly difficult position to be frank.</p>
          <p eId="para_61">I do not know about the legality of taking on issues which have been raised in a tribunal. It has been the view for a considerable amount of time – it is my information, but I am not sure if it is correct – that the modules in place may be there for in excess of seven years and I have heard people suggest up to 15 years. Nobody has said less than seven years. Members can take it that in 2010 we will be dealing with modules which are there presently. Deputy Rabbitte asked if I would agree to propose taking some of those modules to deal with them under some other system, which seems eminently sensible. We began to address some of these issues regarding 1997 and they have moved a long way since.</p>
          <p eId="para_62">All those aspects have to be looked at, but the immediate issue is the way in which we deal with matters raised by Mr. Justice Flood. I acknowledge that he has put in six extraordinary years of work leading up to his interim report of last year. He has investigated many cases. The costs issue has been outstanding for some time and Members will be aware that there has been pressure in this regard from a number of people. People are agreed that we should look at all of these aspects and take legal advice to try to determine a course of action. The House will have to deal with it. My sense is that we must take time to reflect on these issues when we receive the full information. When there is dialogue between the Houses of the Oireachtas through the attorney and the Clerks of the Houses who dealt with the tribunal from the outset we will discover if it is possible to come to an agreement on the circumstances in which it is appropriate for us to assist the tribunal and to take it forward. I will keep party leaders updated regarding any matters which arise. Having listened to the legal arguments put to me, it is not my view that I should charge into the House this week or next week to try to resolve  these issues. That does not appear to me to be the right thing to do.</p>

My Question No. 3 relates to the legal fees arising from the Moriarty tribunal and if, a Cheann Comhairle, you allow me to finish my original sentence, it will be apparent that my point fits 100%. I ask again if the Taoiseach will clarify that the recent media spin which suggests tribunals will be wound up prematurely due to legal costs has no basis in the Government's position. Can the Taoiseach tell the House his opinion of the source of such suggestions in the media in recent weeks? Does the Taoiseach agree that it is imperative that the work of the tribunals continue, including the Moriarty tribunal which has been addressing the existence of a golden circle of politics and business for a considerable amount of time? Does the Taoiseach agree that stricter legislation is needed to curtail the legal costs that accrue to the legal advisers involved in the tribunals? Does he accept that there must be proper regulation of the fees being claimed and that this is a major concern for the public? Will the Taoiseach undertake to introduce legislation to regulate these fees now and for the future?</p>

          <p eId="para_78">I only had one sentence out of my mouth and it was about the questions. The Taoiseach has made statements that have serious implications for the future of tribunals. My first question to the Taoiseach would have been asked by now if the Chair had not interrupted me. Does the Taoiseach accept the first principle that alleged corruption at the interface of business and politics must be investigated? That is the reason there was huge support for the establishment of proper investigations. Does he agree that something has gone seriously wrong when the story moves from millionaires being investigated by the Moriarty tribunal to the creation of new millionaires as a result of the fees being paid by the Moriarty tribunal? This is what needs to be examined. Why did the Government not move long ago on the scale of barristers' fees and provide for the ordinary remuneration with which the rest of us live?</p>
          <p eId="para_79">Why is it not possible to deal in a much shorter amount of time with the evidence submitted, to provide an opportunity for rebuttal by those who might be implicated and to draw conclusions? This happens in ordinary courts every day. Why does a tribunal require years? Is it not clear that new structures for investigating allegations of corruption in public life must be established which will respect natural justice but where every witness arriving at the investigation does not need half the Law Library in tow, dropping invoices as they go? That is what is needed in this situation.</p>

This is particularly important for the commission of investigation Bill, which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform told us would be published before the summer recess. Wherein lies the delay in publication of the Bill?</p>
          <p eId="para_83">In the light of files requested and that area of questioning, does the Taoiseach recall the request from the Green Party that an auxiliary judge be appointed to the Moriarty tribunal? We requested this in January to allow for an investigation into the Glending controversy in Wicklow. Does the Taoiseach appreciate that Mr. Justice Moriarty would have a difficulty in this regard and that it is important that somebody without an interest in Glending would investigate the matter? Would he therefore acknowledge that the appointment of an auxiliary judge is warranted and has he had any further opportunity to discuss or reflect on that matter?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_84">In response to Deputy Ó Caoláin, I do not consider there are any grounds on which matters that are under investigation should not be investigated. Neither the Government nor anyone else holds that view. These matters have been under investigation for six years and investigations are ongoing and will continue. On Mr. Justice Moriarty's report, I said at the outset that my latest information is that the public hearings will end towards the end of the year and then, presumably, the report will have to be written. I do not see any reason whatsoever why there should be any change in that tribunal. For that matter, I would not have thought there was any change in any of the other tribunals. The only reason I raised the matter is because it was being raised by the chairman, who was formerly a sole member; we were asked to change that to three members, which we did some time ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">Deputy Sargent asked about the commission of investigation Bill which is almost ready. It was to be published in early July, which is next week, and it is on target and will be available for examination over the summer. As I have stated before, the fees payable to legal staff at the tribunal have remained unchanged since 1997. It was not envisaged then that the tribunals would sit for such a long time and during the five year period from 1997 to last year, the rates generally increased significantly in the legal profession and the legal staff to the tribunals have been pressing for an increase to reflect this. When the Morris tribunal was being set up last year, the fees negotiated by the Office of the Attorney General office reflected the rates prevailing at that time and the outcome provided a basis for an adjustment of the fees of staff in the existing tribunals. In the case of the Moriarty tribunal, adjustments were  agreed last August and operated from 24 May 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_86">In normal litigation, barristers are paid by way of a brief fee, a one-off lump sum for preparation of the case, reading documents, reading the brief, and a refresher <i>per diem</i> for each day. At tribunals, a brief fee is paid to reflect the extensive reading in and the reading of material documentation, and a <i>per diem</i> refresher is paid in respect of sitting and non-sitting days. The <i>per diem</i> rate reflects the work done on the tribunals on the sitting days but also the work done on non-sitting days during the private investigation stages which is crucial to the work of the tribunals.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">A great deal of preliminary investigative work has been carried out in respect of the tribunals and that is why these issues become costly. It is also a fact – and the barristers have argued this – that similar to Members when they are away from their own work for a period, private practice effectively disappears. If barristers are away from the Bar for a few years, it takes time to re-establish their practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">Obviously, they will not carry out that work if they are not remunerated for it. That argument has been put forward and accepted. I know that we would be criticised in the House if we did not pay the rates to get the senior people whom we had. It is perhaps unfortunate that we have had so many tribunals over the last five years, with so many people caught up in them. It has cost a great deal of money. However, one must pay those rates to get the individuals involved, for they would command that kind of remuneration in private practice if they were not on tribunals. That is the case that has been put for the last five or six years.</p>

      <b>Minister for Health and Children</b>
      the way in which it is envisaged that the proposed new health structures will impact on the nature of and timetable for, delivery of the Government's health strategy.
      [17705/03]

        </question>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_50">
          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p eId="para_91">The health reform programme has its origins in the health strategy. It provides a central platform for the six frameworks for change which were identified as key to advancing the goals and objectives of the health strategy. Those are: strengthening primary care; reform of the acute hospital system; funding; developing human resources; organisational reform; and information. Those reforms are essential to the advancement of the strategy as a whole. Without  them, the health services would not be able to respond adequately to their strategic objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_92">For example, the reformed structures are built around the need to create a system within which the primary care model could develop and grow. Regarding hospital services, it clears the way for a reorientation of the hospital sector around national priorities, high quality, best outcomes and better value for money. Regarding the information deficit, it restates the need to establish an independent authority to support the development of information systems which are inextricably linked to the quality agenda in health. That strengthening of information systems will also provide a greater evidence base for proper monitoring and evaluation of system performance.</p>
          <p eId="para_93">It deals with the repeated criticisms regarding accountability within the system, with greater clarity between roles, clearer lines of accountability and best-practice governance. Regarding efficiency and value for money, it also provides for the development of shared services, where economies of scale should lead to resources being freed for front-line services, improved standardisation and a pooling of expertise and best practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_94">The delivery of some actions in the strategy will be linked to investment, something that will continue to be true. However, improving value for investment made and structuring the health system so it can more easily achieve its goals, is a vital step. It will ensure that the system can absorb additional investment effectively and help to demonstrate to the taxpayer and my colleagues in Government that any additional money invested will be well spent in delivering an improved service to patients and clients.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">The new structures must have a positive impact on the delivery of the Government's health strategy. That is their central premise.</p>

          <from>Ms O. Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_96">I accept the Minister's point that the delivery of the strategy requires new structures. I would not argue with that. However, many of the strategy's promises are already overdue. I believe it was the Secretary General of the Department who pointed out recently that, over the next 18 months, the priority focus of the Department and the health boards would be the setting up of the new structures. Given the current state of the health service and the crisis that exists, it seems that it should not be the entire focus of attention for the Department and the health boards. If all the concern, attention and resources, both financial and human, are merely directed to structural reform, the delivery of the strategy itself will fall further and further behind. Does the Minister share that concern? If I may ask a supplementary question, I would like to pursue the points made about the IT strategy.</p>

          <p eId="para_97">First, about 70% of the 121 actions to which we committed ourselves in the health strategy are under way and have commenced. We have made significant progress on several fronts. On others we have not made as much progress. I  regard structural reform as an essential prerequisite for the full realisation of the strategy over the next decade. After all, we said initially that we would start off with the health strategy. The key analysis then was to assess whether the existing structures were adequate to respond to the objective of the strategy itself. That exercise has now come to fruition in the form of the Prospectus report, and the Commission on Financial Management and Control Systems in the Health Service has come forward in the context of financial management and planning. One cannot separate structures from services. There is a link between the two. A significant effort will be made over the next 18 months to implement the structural reform programme as announced last week by the Government. In tandem with that, the normal Estimates campaigns will continue. The Department will continue to promote its agenda regarding financial allocations and need in line with our health strategy, and that must obviously be considered in the context of overall Government budgetary considerations.</p>

          <p eId="para_98">The IT strategy is behind and on hold. In the context of the new structures, whereby hospitals and most of the health service will be delivered centrally from a Dublin office – I presume it is Dublin and not Cork – or from a central hospitals agency or executive, I would imagine that information is vital. Whatever local knowledge one might have in a health board about the needs of hospitals, populations and employees, it is difficult to have it in Dublin. What is happening about the IT strategy? I know that there will be funding, for I understand the sums of money involved are enormous. I am told that €200 million will not even suffice. That is the critical investment—</p>

We have suffered from historic underprovision regarding a comprehensive information database for health and the ICT dimension. There has been investment in ICT over recent years. As the Deputy is aware, the proposal in the reform programme is to set up the health information quality authority, known as the HIQA. The health information strategy was delayed pending publication of the reform programme. The idea is that we should have an independent body responsible for quality assurance and the gathering, compilation and publication of data pertaining to health and related matters. I expect that we will be able to publish the health  information strategy or at least to bring it to Government within the next few weeks.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_57">
          <from>Mr. Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_103">As the Deputy is aware, the Eastern Regional Health Authority is charged with responsibility for commissioning health and personal social services on behalf of the population of the region, and also on behalf of those outside the region who are referred for specialist treatment. The level of services to be provided at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in 2003 is, therefore, in the first instance a matter for the authority and the hospital, having regard to the level of resources available.</p>
          <p eId="para_104">The approved level of spending nationally for health services in 2003 is over €9 billion. Of that, over €500 million relates to capital spending, with the remaining €8.5 billion available for revenue spending. While that level of funding is significant, it is recognised that the authority and the health boards have had to take some difficult decisions in the current year on their service provision and priorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">Nevertheless, it must also be recognised that, even in the prevailing economic climate, the health services have once again received the highest increase in funding across all Departments. This is a clear indication of this Government's commitment to maintaining the quantum and quality of services in difficult economic circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">The Eastern Regional Health Authority has a total of €1.154 billion available to purchase acute hospital services in 2003. That figure includes additional funding of €9.450 million to support the consolidation of acute hospital services agreed and funded in recent years. That is the basis upon which the authority developed and agreed its own 2003 service plan with the Department. Additional funding has also been provided to meet the costs associated with the recruitment of additional consultants in emergency medicine and consultant anaesthetists, and for cancer, cardiology and renal dialysis services.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">The authority accepts that 2003 will be a difficult year for the acute hospitals sector. There is a clear need for tight management of cost and activity in 2003 in the context of working within available resources. The chief concern of all parties is to minimise the impact of financial issues  on patient service provision. However, because acute hospital activity in 2002 was significantly above the approved level, there will be a percentage reduction in some services this year to enable the hospitals to operate within approved 2003 funding levels. I am aware of the concerns expressed regarding the closure of beds at Our Lady's hospital. I would like to stress that all opportunities to maintain services will continue to be explored by the ERHA with the hospital management at Crumlin. The emphasis will be on ensuring that the availability and standard of care provided is accorded the highest priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">I assure the Deputy of my commitment, and that of the authority, to the redevelopment of Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin. I recently met with the New Crumlin Hospital Group, which is composed of parents of children who attend the hospital regularly. It was this group that commissioned the recent Pollock report on facilities at the hospital. As this House is aware, I have supported the establishment of a project team to advance the preparation of an outline development control plan for the Crumlin hospital site. I have also emphasised the need to address a number of key development priorities, including the areas of haematology/oncology, cardiology and the provision of the new MRI facility. I look forward to these developments being progressed over the coming months.</p>

          <p eId="para_109">Given that the Minister for Health and Children has declared a vote of no confidence in the Eastern Regional Health Authority and is setting out to dismantle it, will he consider giving a more informative and specific reply since he has ultimate responsibility for what happens in our hospitals? Does the Minister consider it acceptable that 25 beds, one in ten beds, in a major children's tertiary hospital are closed and, it appears, will be closed for the remainder of the year? It would appear that approximately 2,000 procedures will not be proceeded with. The ripple effect of these closures in the hospital is considerable regarding the care of desperately sick children. Does the Minister accept he has a responsibility to address this issue? Does he recall that at the Joint Committee on Health and Children he criticised the hospital for making this decision? He seemed to consider he was expert enough in the area of hospital management to declare it was wrong to close beds, but at the same time he refused to provide any alternative route to saving money for the hospital. He said at that time that he was working with the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the hospital in all these issues. What is the outcome of this work? How does he intend to ensure these beds are reopened and that no further bed closures occur in this hospital?</p>

          <p eId="para_114">It is well known that the reform programme had its genesis in the health strategy and that people were asked to look outside the box and to come up with a greenfield solution to a structural reform of the health service which would help realise the objective of the health strategy. That is the context in which the reforms were presented. It was not a case of saying we will take out this board or that board as such an approach would be erroneous. Under existing legislation, the Eastern Regional Health Authority is the statutory authority and it has to deal with the agencies under its remit with an even hand. It also has to deal with the agencies in the context of the 1996 accountability legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_115">Some Members have expressed concern about that legislation and its impact upon services but nonetheless it is a real constriction on the ERHA and other health boards because there has to be some sense of dealing even-handedly with all the agencies under their remit. Some hospitals came in on budget while other hospitals significantly exceeded their budget. Most people would accept that if one took the view that we could ignore the 1996 legislation and signed a cheque equivalent to the amount by which hospitals had exceeded budget, clearly that would have implications for how other agencies and hospitals would manage their affairs. The 1996 legislation was brought in by the rainbow Government, supported by all parties and successive Governments which had a hand in the preparation and formulation of the 1996 accountability legislation but it has a real impact on how we manage. Its real impact is that it has to be used as a first charge on the following year's activities. I would be concerned in a hospital such as Crumlin, which is our national tertiary service for children, to see if the ERHA within its existing allocation can work with the hospital to try to resolve the difficulties to the end of the year within the context of the legislative framework I have outlined to the House. It should be borne in mind that activity levels in the hospital have increased very significantly in recent years—</p>

      <b>Mr. Connolly</b>
      asked the

      the action he proposes to take in respect of the Cavan-Monaghan hospital; and the implications that this will have for hospital services in Cavan and Monaghan, and for the recruitment processes on both the hospital site and for the possibility of the Monaghan site coming back on call.

          <from>Mr. Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_131">Responsibility for the provision of services within the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group rests with the North-Eastern Health Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">Arising from the report of the independent review panel into the circumstances surrounding the death of baby Bronagh Livingstone, in December 2002, I appointed Mr. Kevin Bonner, management consultant and former Secretary General of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to recommend an appropriate management structure for Monaghan Hospital, which operates within the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group, and to assist the North-Eastern Health Board in implementing the structure. I am aware that Mr. Bonner has been working closely with the board and relevant parties to facilitate a  resolution to outstanding issues pertaining to the provision of services at Monaghan Hospital, with particular reference to emergency services. It is anticipated that Mr. Bonner's report will be finalised shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">As regards training posts, my Department is advised by the North-Eastern Health Board that it has been informed by the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland that the RCSI council, on the advice of its basic surgical training committee, is to cease recognition of five posts in the department of surgery, Cavan General Hospital, for basic surgical training with effect from 30 June 2003. It was brought to the attention of the BST committee of the RCSI, through hospital inspectors' reports and through the regular counselling sessions for all trainees on the BST scheme, that interpersonal problems at the level of consultant surgeon in the unit were creating an environment that is not conducive to training.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">The health board further advises that a group was set up by the BST committee to interview the Cavan trainees. The interviews highlighted a number of serious concerns. The chief executive officer of the North-Eastern Health Board is currently examining and considering a number of concerns and complaints relating to the unit which have been brought separately to his attention by the consultant surgeons.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">I am informed that the chief executive officer sought the advice and guidance of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland regarding clinical issues raised. The response of the RCSI is currently being considered by the chief executive officer with a view to restoring recognition of the basic surgical training posts.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">The North-Eastern Health Board advertised for fully registered candidates for the five posts in the department of surgery at Cavan General Hospital. Interviews have now taken place and a sufficient number of fully-registered candidates were selected to fill the available posts. The health board hopes, therefore, that all posts will be filled and services will continue as heretofore.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">As regards Monaghan General Hospital, my Department is advised by the board that there are currently no vacant NCHD posts in the department of surgery at the hospital.</p>

        <speech by="#PaudgeConnolly" eId="spk_79">
          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_138">Will the Bonner report be superseded by the three reports, two of which are at hand and one of which is coming on stream, and, if so, what are the implications for Bonner? Bonner has stated that the report has cost implications but the difficulty is that he cannot get a meeting with the Department of Health and Children to discuss the implications. Monaghan General Hospital is now one year off call or, more importantly, off ambulance call. There is the ridiculous situation where an ambulance can pull out from Monaghan General Hospital, collect a patient, but not take the patient back to Monaghan General Hospital, instead the patient must be taken to Drogheda, Dublin or wherever. If this situation is to persist at the hospital, will the Mini ster address the issue? Lives have been lost in transit. Lives have also been saved because people can arrive at Monaghan General Hospital by car and be admitted to the accident and emergency department. They can walk in wounded and be treated at Monaghan General Hospital. When will the Minister allow Monaghan General Hospital back on call? The off-call status has had a negative effect on the rest of the North-Eastern Health Board. At Cavan General Hospital, the increased numbers at its accident and emergency department, has had a negative effect on its elective surgery performance. During the past 12 months elective surgery has had to be cancelled at Cavan General Hospital. In Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital there is a similar problem where there are ongoing industrial relations problems because nurses cannot attend to patients with head injuries for a two-hour period. This is making a complete nonsense of the golden hour rule in medicine, that the sooner the patient is treated the better the outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">What will the Minister say to parents in Monaghan who have a child with an asthmatic attack, or a parent or relative who suffers a heart attack, or someone suffering a haemorrhage? Should they drive for two hours and arrive with a corpse? Last night on "Questions and Answers" the Minister said that people should be stabilised first. That is the type of service which should be provided to the people of Monaghan and to 22 other towns like Monaghan. When will Monaghan have an on-call service again?</p>

          <from>Mr. Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_140">There is a significant history to this issue. The North-Eastern Health Board tabled proposals last September which were not accepted by all parties concerned. I appointed Mr. Bonnar to deal not only with the management structure at Monaghan Hospital, which is necessary as I communicated to the board, but also to try to resolve the outstanding issues and to engage in a process with all the parties involved in the catchment area of Monaghan Hospital to see if we could bring about a consensus in terms of the way forward <i>vis-à-vis </i>the provision of services, not least emergency cover.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">Mr. Bonnar has not reported to me yet although I understand he will do so shortly. We will facilitate the presentation of that report. His report will be in the context of the forthcoming Hanley report to which the Deputy's question appeared to allude. I expect the report will have some relationship to what is likely to come down the tracks and will fit into that template.</p>

      <b>Mr. Neville</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Health and Children</b>
      the democratic accountability built into the proposed health service reform programme to remove public representatives from health boards.
      [217858/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_83">
          <from>Mr. Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_145">Both the Prospectus and Brennan reports recommended considerable changes to the current governance of the health system. The Government has accepted the argument made by Prospectus regarding the complete abolition of health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">As we have an Exchequer-funded health service with centrally determined resourcing decisions, Oireachtas Members should have a responsibility to ensure that there is a match between funding of services and national priorities. Democratic input would best be represented at regional level through at least twice yearly meetings with the director of the regional health office and his or her senior management team, together with other members of the HSE or its offices as appropriate. This mechanism is advanced as complementing and reinforcing the role of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children in reflecting the views of public representatives in the ongoing oversight of the health system. The emphasis is on ensuring that democratic input at regional level should focus on the delivery of national priorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">I have agreed to bring more detailed proposals to Government on the representation arrangements following the completion of the communications process over the coming months.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">The Deputy should also note in this context that Prospectus also emphasised the need to strengthen existing arrangements in relation to consumer panels and regional co-ordinating and advisory committees in representing the voice of service users. These groups, which include patients, clients and other users, or their advocates and families, work to provide a bottom-up approach to understanding the needs of the groups at regional planning level. These existing models are at different stages of development and will continue to be enhanced.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanNeville" eId="spk_84">
          <from>Mr. Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_149">I thank the Minister for his informative reply. Democratic accountability is an important part of this issue. The Minister is aware of the enormous input of the two Ministers of State, Deputies Tim O'Malley and Callelly, to their health boards as representatives of their association and the people. I have worked on a health board with Deputy O'Malley and I am  aware through the association of health boards of the work of Deputy Callelly.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">Does the Minister accept that democratic accountability is important and that the views and concerns of ordinary people must be brought to the notice of the controllers of the delivery of the health services? However the present arrangements may be criticised, health board representatives became knowledgeable about the workings of the system and were of great help in bringing the views, concerns and difficulties of the people to the knowledge of the management of the health board system. This was an important input, despite the criticisms we have heard. Will the Minister confirm that there will be a mechanism for this important input at local level? Will local information on how patients and people experience the delivery of the service be brought to the attention of whatever body is eventually in control? Does the Minister accept that while it is important to consult the consumer panels, they are not democratically elected?</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_85">
          <from>Mr. Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_151">An important point I keep reiterating as I travel around the country to talk to the employees of the various health boards is that the health strategy was the basic starting point for the structural analysis and the new construct which has emerged. We did not start out, and Prospectus did not start out, with a pre-ordained notion that we must get rid of public representatives from the boards or that we must abolish certain boards. If that was the case we could have done it two years ago and carried on. What happened was that a new construct emerged of which the boards were not a part. If one agrees with the National Hospitals Office, with which most parties seem to agree, one immediately takes about 50% of the activities and budget away from the existing health board structure.</p>

          <from>Mr. Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_153">I will come to that. We will endeavour to facilitate the articulation of public representatives' views on the health service, both at regional and national level. It is already facilitated at national level in the form of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children on which we will take feedback. At regional level we will facilitate the articulation of issues pertaining to health and will have a consultation process which will facilitate the presentation of plans etc. to public representatives in a given region, on an ongoing basis, regarding planning, implementation and how things are working out.</p>

          <p eId="para_158">The strongest voice we have heard in recent times about mental health has come from those who have used the services over the years. They disturbed us, provoked a response and were powerful. What we are trying to do with consumer panels is use people who have direct experience of disease, conditions or a particular issue such as disability, mental health and old age, and bring them in with officials and with those who administer and take decisions to guide them and give them the direct fruits of their real life experience of these situations. That is a good and positive measure. It got a bad start when the idea of consumer panels was originally launched in the health strategy. Public representatives seem to take the view that it might represent the professionals at committees, but it is primarily for those who use the services who can bring a distinct voice to the table.</p>

          <p eId="para_160">The Government has already identified the need to make an early start on the reform programme and, in particular, the prioritisation of the reform of the hospital sector. Therefore, it has been agreed to establish the interim board of the Health Service Executive and its hospital wing, the National Hospitals Office, on an administrative basis in the autumn. The appointment of the interim board for the HSE will help to expedite the overall reform process and, coupled with the establishment of an interim national hospitals office, will allow particular tasks in relation to the reform of the acute hospital sector to be advanced. It is my intention to establish both interim structures in the autumn.</p>

          <p eId="para_161">Deputy Neville's question touches on mine and the responses I have heard do not satisfy me or alleviate my concerns. The establishment of the Health Service Executive and the National Hospitals Office are key elements in the Government's so-called reform programme. I use the word "so-called" because all it provides for is bureaucratic change. There is, as yet, no signal led determination to challenge the real problem which is at the core of our health service, namely, the perpetuation of the two-tier delivery of health services, and particularly hospital services. Will the Minister tell us the composition of the HSE board and the National Hospitals Office and whether these boards will  include democratically elected public representatives and representatives of health service users? Will there be guaranteed and effective representation for patients who are suffering because of the mismanagement of the health services or will there be a regrettable perpetuation of the dominance of health service professionals on both of these bodies?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_94">
          <from>Mr. Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_162">The composition and disciplines of members of the boards have not yet been decided upon. However, the guiding principles have. We do not envisage a representational model for the Health Service Executive or the National Hospitals Office. Rather, we will fit the right calibre of person with the tasks set for both bodies. They will not be unwieldy bodies. If we went down the route of picking one representative for every particular interest group, we would end up with a large body, which would not be a good managerial model. The Health Service Executive board will be charged with management of the health services nationally and the people on it will be required to have the appropriate expertise to undertake that task successfully. The same will apply to the National Hospitals Office.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">When I was talking about the input of patients and users of services, I envisaged that would happen primarily through the consumer panels that will be established at various levels throughout the structure.</p>

          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_164">The Minister's reply confirms that democratically elected public representatives will not participate on the boards of these bodies and the position in regard to the service users representatives is equally unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">What role will the HSE board and the National Hospitals Office have in regard to the drawing up of new contracts for consultants and will they have such a role in their interim designation? Does the Minister agree that new contracts for consultants are essential if we are to tackle the two-tier system which operates in our public hospitals whereby private care is delivered by piggy-backing on the public health care system? We need consultants in our public hospitals who are absolutely dedicated to providing public health care services.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">On the occasions I have met the Minister on issues concerning the North-Eastern Health Board, of which I am a member, with hands outstretched, he has bemoaned the fact that he has had a restricted input in determining the configuration of health and hospital care delivery. In what he has outlined to the House today, the Minister does not appear to be grappling with that reality. The electorate returned the Government and the Minister has been democratically appointed.</p>

          <from>Mr. Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_189">I propose to take Questions Nos. 87, 103 and 140 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">Arising from concerns about the use of symphysiotomy in obstetrical practice in the past, the chief medical officer, CMO, at my Department, in April 2001, asked the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists for its comments and advice on the matter. The institute represents obstetrical and gynaecological opinion in Ireland, acts as an advisory body on matters relating to education, research and administration in the specialty and seeks to raise standards in obstetrics and gynaecology in this country. The institute replied in May 2001 to the CMO and confirmed that from around 1920 until around 1960 symphysiotomy procedures were carried out on selected patients, mainly at the National Maternity Hospital and the Coombe Hospital in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">My Department does not have details of the numbers of women who underwent this procedure throughout the country, but my Department has asked the regional chief executive of the ERHA and the chief executive officers of the  health boards to reply directly to the Deputy in this regard. The institute advised that excellent results were claimed for the procedure which had the effect of permanently enlarging the pelvis and allowing women to undergo normal delivery. This was at a time when caesarean section had a high mortality rate due to sepsis – sepsis was one of the leading causes of maternal death at that time. The institute stated that in properly conducted cases, complications were rare. Published medical reports of the time indicated favourable results for the procedure. Many of the cases referred to in these reports were emergency admissions with obstructed labour where sepsis following caesarean section would have carried a significant risk of maternal death.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">From 1950 onwards, the operation of symphysiotomy for obstructed labour was gradually replaced by the modern caesarean section, as antibiotics were available by then to treat infection and sepsis was less of a hazard. The institute also stated that "the operation of symphysiotomy remains an accepted indication for the management of a trapped after coming head of a breech" but that caesarean section is now recommended for all mature infants who present with a breech presentation. We must be cautious about judging procedures and interventions which were used in previous generations in light of current knowledge and experience. Enormous medical advances have been made in obstetric practice since the 1950s and procedures were not as advanced then as they are in Ireland today.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">Under the circumstances, I have no plans to establish an inquiry into the use of symphysiotomy in obstetrical practice. I am aware that a request has been made by a group representing women who have experienced this procedure for a meeting in relation to the issue and I expect to be in a position to respond at an early date. We must be cautious about judging procedures and interventions which were used in previous generations in the light of current knowledge and experience.

          <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_194">When will the Minister meet members of this organisation that represents a very considerable number of women who have endured what are called "properly conducted cases". I do not even know what "properly conducted cases" means. The answer given by the Minister is identical to that given to Members of this House some 18 months ago and to an answer given to me in this House some weeks ago. Not one word has changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">The Minister has been advised that this practice ended around the 1960s. I assure him that it continued into the 1980s. This is where an investigation is needed; if the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists thought that this practice finished in the 1960s, who then is responsible for the brutality that carried over into the 1970s and even as late as 1983, when I understand three operations were carried out in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, and others at The Coombe Women's Hospital? As for the assertion that the results of these operations were very good, there are grounds for inquiry there too. If the Minister were to meet representatives of the group, he would know that the results were not very good. I asked the Minister to meet them some time ago.</p>

          <p eId="para_201">We refer to the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists for advice in terms of standards and quality of care on a range of issues relating to obstetrics, gynaecology and such matters. The institute has written back to me, as Minister, on such matters. Regarding any practices that took place even as far back as the 1970s, changes have occurred since then in a range of medical areas and disciplines. Retrospective judgment in terms of the wisdom or efficacy of a particular procedure is fraught with difficulty. That is the point I made. One must proceed with some caution in this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_202">Does the Minister agree that the reply he has given in the House today is very much a cut and paste job? I raised this issue over two years ago, and the exact phrases he used today were in the reply then and, indeed, in the letter sent to me on 1 October 2001. I first raised this issue in May of that year. Does the Minister agree that the reply received in the Department by Dr. Kiely, from Dr. John Bonnar, was totally inadequate? It consists of a number of paragraphs and a reference to some journal, the <i>British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology.</i> It is really quite insulting, particularly to the women who have suffered so much from this operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">Does the Minister recognise that there has been great suffering and that, to this day, some womencannot walk properly and experience pain as a result of the operation? I am glad the Minister intends to meet them, but does he believe that the issue now warrants a public inquiry? That  is what these women are demanding.

The information the Minister has is inaccurate. The procedures went on quite extensively later than the 1960s. Does the Minister accept that simply leaving it to the institute to provide an overview on this issue is not confronting what many people would feel was a value-laden decision to carry out the procedure in certain instances? It is important to recognise that health care and hospital care have moved on. That is not to say that judgments were always made purely on medical grounds. Issues relating to this procedure need to be investigated and considered, rather than simply leaving the matter to an institute of professionals.</p>

          <from>Mr. Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_213">Let us be clear that the question opened up here is potentially enormous. I am talking about any area of medical procedure that can be quite clearly examined retrospectively and declared to be wrong. I take Deputy McManus's point on the question of there being a value-laden approach to this particular procedure, and whether that was the motivating factor behind it. If so, that would certainly be a matter for con cern. We are opening the door to a scenario of returning to the 1960s, the 1950s and the 1940s and raising the possibility of instigating inquiries about procedures adopted in hospitals in other medical areas. Why would one investigate one such matter and not another? We would have to grapple with that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">I will meet the group. We will acquire information during that meeting and take it from there.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#OliviaMitchell" eId="spk_134">
          <from>Ms O. Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_215">I support the request for a meeting. I am not seeking a statutory inquiry at this stage because I do not think we know enough to make that call. I met some of these women today for the first time – the most harrowing meeting I have ever had with any group – and judging by what they said and what the Minister has said, some of the Minister's information is factually incorrect. There is no reason to believe that what these women are saying is wrong. The operations were not carried out in lieu of caesarean sections, but in addition to them. The operations were also carried out without any consultation and in some cases by stealth, with some women not being told that the procedure was being carried out.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">I accept what the Minister says about practices being different in the 1950s, but I agree with Deputy McManus that we do not know what was the motivation. It was definitely suspect. I ask the Minister to bear in mind that this totally barbaric and unacceptable practice, carried out by stealth without the permission of the women involved or their husbands, continued to be carried out in this country up to the 1980s. Before the Minister makes a decision, I ask him to keep an open mind and to go beyond the initial reply he received from Dr. Bonnar. There is more to this issue than meets the eye. I would not say that lightly. The Minister should keep an open mind until he has met these women.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_135">
          <from>Mr. Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_217">I will take note of Deputy Olivia Mitchell's comments. I will meet the women concerned and revert to her and other Deputies.</p>

        <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_136">
          <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_218">I commend the Minister on agreeing to meet the group. That is very progressive. At this stage at least, he is not the bad guy and has the possible solution to the problem. If it is a case that wayward and semi-insane consultants conducted this crazy stuff on these female victims, the Minister certainly has it within his power to do something about it. If he were to hear some of the cases of these women and if they could get through the wall of the Civil Service to allow him hear what happened, he would take steps to initiate a solution. I submit that what these women suffered is on a par with institutional abuse, albeit on a smaller scale.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">Irrespective of what doors are opened through action taken, a small number of people are being asked to carry a very heavy load. This is grossly  unfair and unjust. Will the Minister bypass the institute to reach out to these people and find out what is happening? If he is a fair-minded person, I am satisfied that he will come to the same conclusion as many on the Opposition benches.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnGormley" eId="spk_137">
          <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
          <p eId="para_220">Will the Minister agree that we can take this in stages? I have submitted a request that we deal with this in the Joint Committee on Health and Children. That would be the first step and we could then examine the possibility of a non-statutory inquiry. We could take it step by step and that would be the most reasonable approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">The Minister appears to indicate he is taking the matter seriously. Will he listen carefully to what these women are saying, and will he ensure that what they say is not dismissed? The fact that their concerns were dismissed has added to their pain. Is the Minister aware that, the first time their concerns were raised in the House, the reply I received from the then Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Dr. Tom Moffatt, was quite insulting? The women were completely insulted by the approach adopted.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">This matter cannot be dismissed. Will the Minister take it seriously and give an undertaking to the House that he will meet the women sooner rather than later?</p>

          <from>Ms McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_223">It is important that this matter be investigated further. Will the Minister agree in principle to an investigation? The idea of a statutory inquiry at this point may be premature, but does he accept that to refer back to the institute, a professional body that clearly will have a view from a certain perspective, is an inadequate response from him? This is especially so when the Minister has resources within his Department to conduct even a limited investigation or inquiry to examine what was possible at the time in the provision of care for women, and what was the driving force that led to what most people now recognise as a barbaric practice when there were possibilities of alternatives?</p>

          <from>Mr. Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_224">I said I would agree to meet the group concerned but I will add a number of qualifications. Notwithstanding the serious issues raised and concerns expressed by the group, it is difficult to go down the road of retrospective analysis of medical procedures 20, 30 or 40 years ago. Once that door is opened, other issues may come through, such as the advisability, acceptability and effect of a range of procedures that may have been carried out in different specialities in years gone by.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">Deputy Morgan said he would place this issue on the same level as institutional abuse. We must learn lessons from the processes we have put in place to inquire into those issues. I was involved in the Department of Education and Science in establishing such commissions and processes. I am sure victims and survivors of the institutions in question, if they had their time over again,  would wonder if the long period that has elapsed since the commencement of those inquiries has not created its own stresses and strains.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">My experience of three and a half years as Minister for Health and Children and as Minister for Education and Science before that has been that the easiest action to take is to announce the establishment of an inquiry of some description. The pain, trauma and so on that occur thereafter can be quite significant. I put it to the House that the models we have used to date may not be the best for the future—</p>

          <p eId="para_233">IDA Ireland's latest annual report informs us that Ireland is moving up the value chain and that the foundation for future success will be based on innovation, education, skills and research. This week the Science Foundation Bill  is being discussed on Committee Stage in the House having passed Second Stage by agreement. Today we find that by a schizophrenic decision of the Government, 300 teaching posts are to be cut in the area of physical sciences. On the one hand, IDA Ireland is setting out future strategy for the development of skills and innovation in our country, while on the other, the Government is cutting back 300 concessionary teaching posts in the area of physical sciences. How can the Taoiseach justify this?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_145">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_234">I have seen the report. My information is that the number of teachers in the second level system will increase from 25,307 in the previous academic year to just under 26,000 for the academic year beginning in September. The number of pupils in the second level system has decreased by more than 32,000 in recent years, from 371,000 in 1996-97 to 339,000 in the academic year just gone. The pupil-teacher ratio at second level has fallen from 16:1 to 14:1 since 1996-97, and the projected ratio for the current school year is 13.6:1. More than 1,200 additional teaching posts have been created in the second level sector in the past four years.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">The point made about curricular needs is that, traditionally, second level schools have been given an extra teacher allocation to meet curriculum needs where it is shown that such needs cannot be met from the normal staffing complement. Such allocations are made on a concessionary basis and are over and above a school's normal staffing allocation. Schools are expected to make every effort, and always have, to address their curriculum needs within their normal staffing complement. For the forthcoming school year, the Department of Education and Science informs me that the number of wholetime equivalent teaching posts being made available for curricular concessions is 699, which represents a reduction from 871 posts in the current school year. The curriculum issue, however, cannot be viewed in isolation from the overall school needs and staffing allocations for which I have just given the figures.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">For the first time this year an independent appeals committee was established to consider appeals from schools regarding their allocations for curriculum needs. A total of 143 second level schools from almost 750 applications have submitted appeals and the committee has granted 65 posts. Those are the facts and figures.</p>

          <p eId="para_239">Does it mean that 300 concessionary teaching posts will be axed in September? Does it mean that pupils who are currently studying minority subjects will suffer as a result? Does it not make a mockery of the task force estab lished by the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, on physical sciences that stated that science education should be addressed in every school plan and that the teacher allocation should be enhanced in post-primary schools with low physical science enrolment? If this report is true, does it not mean that 300 posts are being axed? It is directly contradictory to the IDA's report and the report of the former Minister, Deputy Woods, and means that students following minority subjects will suffer from September onwards. They are being condemned by a tunnel of darkness that the Government should not stand over. It is a completely schizophrenic decision and I would like the Taoiseach to confirm whether it is true. I do not need a litany of figures and statistics, I want to know if the Government is to axe 300 concessionary posts in September.</p>

          <p eId="para_240">The report suggested that the number of teachers being lost to the system is close to 600. I gave the bottom line figure, that for the forthcoming school year the number of whole-time equivalent teacher posts being made available for curricular concessions is 699, a reduction from 871 posts in the current school year. The point was made that the curricular issue could not be taken in isolation from the schools' overall needs and staffing allocations. The figures for staffing allocations were up, the number of pupils was down and the pupil-teacher ratio was down. We also made the point that 1,200 teachers were provided over the past few years.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">Minority subjects, particularly science and engineering, are important and we have emphasised that in the programme. I have given the figure for the reduction but, in the overall figures, I have also given the number of extra teachers in the second level system.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_243">The Taoiseach announced the most topical matter today on Question Time in respect of the future of the Flood tribunal and the request of Mr. Justice Flood to be relieved of his position of chairperson from a current date. I received the letter a few minutes ago and have not had the opportunity to take advice on it but the Taoiseach said the Cabinet discussed the matter today. Two separate questions arise, the chairperson of the tribunal deciding the question of costs and the future of the tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">I understand that last Easter it was indicated that the question of costs would be disposed of. Then we heard that former Minister Ray Burke was asserting he had a deal on costs with the tribunal. Following that there was a statement from Mr. Justice Flood categorically denying a deal. Will the Taoiseach tell the House if he has established what happened since last Easter? There have been no public hearings and now we read in this letter that the issue of costs has not been  decided. Does the Taoiseach have information on why the costs have not been decided?</p>
          <p eId="para_245">The Taoiseach got this letter last Wednesday or Thursday. What advice has he received, in so far as he has had the opportunity to take advice? How is it proposed that someone who did not hear the case or several cases can now be asked to decide costs? This is an issue of public interest in terms not only of the prospective recoupment of a significant amount of money to the Exchequer but also in terms of the punitive value of that facility to levy costs against persons or companies who obstructed the tribunal to encourage them to be more forward in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">The House wants to be assured because the issue of costs is major. We need to hear unqualified assurances that the Taoiseach can pass the chair on to someone who was not seized of the issues when they were being heard at the tribunal.</p>

        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_152">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_247">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me earlier to give a detailed account of the circumstances surrounding the letter from Mr. Justice Flood and the questions that arise from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">I cannot answer Deputy Rabbitte fully until all the matters are looked at but in the first instance he is correct. In the spring, around St. Patrick's Day, the staff in the Department of Finance and the Attorney General's office had to work over two weekends because there was a rush to get all the work related to costs done so they would be dealt with at that time, but they were not dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">I cannot answer for the tribunal but it was made clear that the issue of a deal with Ray Burke was nothing to do with that and it was clear there was no such deal, irrespective of other issues. Mr. Justice Flood's letter explains some of the reasons for that. Mr. Justice Flood, who has done an excellent job in this matter, has not found it possible to deal with the strain arising from these issues and the burden of work that arises as chairperson.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">As Deputies Rabbitte and Kenny said, costs are a major issue that could result in enormous liabilities to the State, although that is not necessarily what will happen. I am advised that it would create difficulties if another person takes the chair on this issue because the judges who are now involved were not there for the evidence in these cases. Legislation would be required, but issues could still arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">I understand and respect the reasons set out by Mr. Justice Flood, but my advice is that concerns exist about the prospects of legal challenges to future reports of the tribunal in light of the contents of what Mr. Justice Flood puts forward. The Government is concerned about the risk of legal proceedings related to a report produced by a tribunal and the difficulties that might arise if the issue of costs were dealt with by someone else.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">I do not want to get into legal issues but the Government, following the meeting this morning, set down its concerns and is sending them to Mr.  Justice Flood. Let me be clear that the Government would prefer if Mr. Justice Flood was in a position to decide the question of costs and we will set that position out in a letter. As soon as Mr. Justice Flood has a chance to deal with this issue, I will be glad to exchange that information with the leaders of the Opposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_253"/>

        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_153">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_254">I agree with the Taoiseach. If Mr. Justice Flood, having laboured long in the vineyard, wants to be relieved of this onerous responsibility, my party will agree to that but we would need assurance on the question of the costs. I note Mr. Justice Flood is indicating that he will stay on as an ordinary member of the tribunal and in that regard it is remarkable that the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence)(Amendment) Act 2002 contains a subsection which states:</p>
          <p eId="para_255">If the chairperson of a tribunal is for any reason unable to continue to act as such chairperson, another member of the tribunal may be designated as its chairperson, and the former chairperson may continue to be a member of the tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">It is almost as if someone foresaw this set of circumstances. We are not normally so insightful in the matter of amending legislation in the area of tribunals of inquiry. Is it not the case that one would expect that the costs would follow on the report, and the report is in the public domain?</p>

          <p eId="para_265">The Deputy asked if the Government is dealing with the issue of costs in the letter. We are dealing with a number of issues but costs is a very important one. We are making it clear that the Government would rather see Mr. Justice Flood deal with the issue of costs. On the reading of his letter that is unlikely – I accept Deputy Rabbitte, like myself, has had only a brief opportunity to go through it – but it is still our preferred position. If it is unlikely, legislation will be required to deal with the issue to reduce, as best we can – as that is my advice – the risk of legal challenges arising from the proposal that the costs be dealt with by a new chairperson. We will have to further examine that issue but there are concerns about the way we can ring-fence that or secure that position.</p>

          <p eId="para_274">On the question of whether the tribunal can continue with public hearings, the tribunal has not held public hearings for some considerable time because of the issue of costs, which has to be dealt with. My advice is that many other issues have to be dealt with to try to get on top of this one. While on the face of it perhaps the House should rush in and pass resolutions to allow the changes take place and bring in new legislation, but all my legal advice to date on the issue is that we should not rush it because the House needs to deal with it comprehensively. As I said earlier, the Attorney General had been in the Hague for the weekend and returned home to deal with the matter. My first meetings on this issue only took  place today, and I wanted to bring it to the House immediately.</p>

Does the Taoiseach not recognise that, irrespective of his response earlier, what we are looking at here is the closing off of access to teaching positions in second level education from the autumn? Is it not hypocrisy on the Government's part, having only recently boasted that it was committed to ensuring fair access to education at all levels, that we now see the axing of teaching posts at second level education?

This is a matter that is dealt with by the managements and principals of schools in their overall positions. The fact is that the number of teachers in the second level system will be increased for the next academic year. The number of pupils is way down and the pupil-teacher ratio is now down to 13.6:1. The Deputy is incorrect to try to link this with the issue of disabilities. He knows that area is dealt with in first level where we are now spending €350 million on education for students with disabilities, but that is a separate issue. School managements have to deal with the position. They have more teachers, fewer pupils and a lower pupil-teacher ratio.</p>

If the idea is that we should keep the number of concessionary teachers at exactly their current level and at the same time employ more teachers overall when there are fewer pupils and a lower pupil-teacher ratio, it is ridiculous. The Deputy wants to give me facts, but the fact is that the number of teachers on the payroll next year will increase from 25,307 to 25,597.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_387">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_388">I welcome the opportunity to bring the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2003 before the House. At the outset, I want to thank the Chair and members of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights for providing me with the opportunity to outline the general scheme of the Bill at their meeting on 11 June. Arising from this discussion, I have introduced a number of changes in the Bill and I will mention these when I am dealing with the detailed provisions. Before doing so, however, I would like to make a few general points.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">This Bill is an interim response to the recommendations of the Commission on Liquor Licensing and the first report of the Strategic Task Force on Alcohol established by the Minister for Health and Children. The Commission on Liquor Licensing was established by the Government in late 2000 to review the liquor licensing system and to make recommendations for any necessary legislative changes. By the time it had concluded its work at the end of March 2003, the commission had submitted four reports covering various aspects of the licensing laws and collectively containing over 130 recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">One of the commission's recommendations is a codification of intoxicating liquor law that is currently contained in the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2003, spanning three centuries. Such an exercise is long overdue, and I have therefore accepted this recommendation without hesitation. The many structural reforms to the licensing system that have been advanced by the commission will be addressed in the codification Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">I do not wish to enter into the detail of the codification exercise at this stage, other than to  say that it should be guided by the following principles: the aim should be a rationalisation of the law in order to make the licensing code more user-friendly and accessible for licensees and the public alike; it should also aim to simplify and streamline application and renewal procedures, where possible, in order to reduce unnecessary administrative burdens and overheads; open and transparent decision-making procedures, including adequate advance notice for designated notice parties, and opportunities for public consultation are essential; clear and coherent legislative provisions that leave no room for ambiguity or doubt are needed in order to facilitate compliance with and enforcement of the law; the importance of public order, public health and planning aspects must be recognised in order to prevent, and reduce the incidence of alcohol-related harm; and objective criteria are required for the granting of licences that recognise, among other things, the need for an appropriate spatial distribution of licensed premises in order to serve the needs of local areas and their communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">I am happy that the preparatory work is already under way in my Department. I expect that an outline of the codification Bill will be available by this time next year. In the meantime, I have decided to bring forward the present shorter Bill to respond to urgent recommendations of the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">The proposals set out in the Bill are consistent with the concerns outlined in the interim report of the Strategic Task Force on Alcohol that was published last year, and are also relevant in the context of the special initiative on tackling alcohol abuse set out in chapter 2 of the current social partner agreement, Sustaining Progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">The proposals set out in this Intoxicating Liquor Bill form part of the State's response. Other actions are being considered by my colleagues, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Transport. In the area of advertising, the Minister for Health and Children is proceeding with the preparation of legislation to reduce the exposure of children and adolescents to alcohol advertising, sponsorship, marketing and promotions. A new road safety strategy is currently being developed by a high level group and drink driving issues are being examined in that context by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">I want to turn now to the detail of the Bill. Section 1 contains the Short Title, collective citations, construction and commencement provisions. Section 2 contains definitions. The definition of "bar" is taken from the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988. It is important because a distinction is made in various sections of the Bill between "licensed premises" and "the bar" of licensed premises. Admission to the bar of licensed premises is prohibited in certain cases but access to other parts of the premises is not affected, such as a function room or dining room.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">This section also contains definitions of "drunken person" and "disorderly conduct." Arising from the discussion with the joint committee, I have brought the definition of "drunken person" into line with section 4(1) of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994. This provides that it shall be an offence for any person to be present in any public place while intoxicated to such an extent as would give rise to a reasonable apprehension that the person might endanger themselves or any other person. The broad definition of "disorderly conduct" takes account of recommendations of the Commission on Liquor Licensing. Section 3 repeals a number of provisions that are being replaced in the Bill and I will mention them as I move through the sections.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">The provisions set out in Part 2 of the Bill update the law regarding conduct on licensed premises. Sections 4, 5 and 6 deal with drunken persons and drunkenness, while sections 7 and 8 deal with disorderly conduct. They update and replace provisions in the Refreshment Houses (Ireland) Act 1860 and the Licensing Act 1872 which have fallen into disuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">Section 4 prohibits the supply of intoxicating liquor to drunken persons by licensees, as well as drunkenness in the bar of licensed premises. It provides that a licensee shall not admit a drunken person to the bar, and that where a person is drunk on leaving licensed premises, it shall be presumed that the person was drunk while on the premises until the contrary is proved.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">Section 5 prohibits the supply of intoxicating liquor to drunken persons in licensed premises by a person other than the licensee. In other words one cannot buy by proxy or through an intermediary when one is drunk.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">Offences by drunken persons are set out in section 6. It provides that a drunken person shall leave licensed premises on being requested to do so by the licensee or by a garda. Moreover, such a person shall not seek entry to the bar of any licensed premises – access to a restaurant or other facilities within a hotel will not be affected. A Garda power of arrest is also included.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">Section 7 places a duty on licensees to preserve order on licensed premises, while section 8 prohibits disorderly conduct on such premises. A person engaging in disorderly conduct must leave the premises on being requested to do so by the licensee or a member of the Garda Síochána and shall not re-enter the bar of the premises within a period of 24 hours. A Garda power of arrest is included.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">The section also provides that a licensee may refuse admission to a person convicted of an offence under the section where such admission could reasonably be regarded as involving a substantial risk that the person would engage in disorderly conduct.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">Section 9 extends the temporary closure of premises penalty to include offences under several sections, including sections 4 which deals with supplying drunken persons and permitting drunkenness, and section 7 which deals with the duty of the licensee to preserve order. While temporary closure of the premises will be mandatory  in the event of conviction, the District Court will retain a margin of discretion with regard to the duration of the closure period. This penalty is confined under existing legislative provisions to convictions for under-age drinking.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">I do not agree with a view that has been expressed that the temporary closure penalty should not apply to a first offence but rather to the second and subsequent convictions. We need to send a strong message from this House that drunkenness and disorderly conduct on licensed premises are not acceptable. Changing the provisions of the Bill in the manner suggested would not serve that purpose. It would send out the message that everyone has one free go before being convicted of the offence of serving people who are drunk on their premises.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">Part 3 contains amendments to existing legislative provisions, including, in particular, those relating to persons under the age of 18 years set out in Part IV of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">Section 10 provides that Thursday night closing time will revert to 11.30 p.m. from 12.30 a.m. The Commission on Liquor Licensing has recommended this change and it is also in line with the recommendations of the Strategic Task Force on Alcohol. I want to indicate to this House, as I indicated in Seanad Éireann, that if this is not an adequate rebalancing of the licensing hours, I will revisit the issue in the context of the 2004 Bill to which I alluded earlier. I say that because Deputy Deasy indicated strongly that it was his view that closing times on Fridays and Saturdays should also be brought back to 11.30 p.m. I want to do what has been recommended by the Commission on Liquor Licensing. If it transpires that Deputy Deasy's suggestion retains some force, the matter can easily be revisited in the context of the 2004 legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">Section 11 replaces section 5 of the Act of 1927 which makes provision for the grant of special exemption orders. The section contains three important changes. First, in subsection (7) it provides for a local authority a role in determining the duration of special exemption orders in its administrative area. The District Court will retain discretion in granting such orders but will be required to have regard to any resolution adopted by a local authority in the area in which the premises are located. The local authority must consult with the Garda and consider the views submitted by the Garda and any other person, including views on health aspects, in advance of adopting a resolution.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">Second, the grounds on which objections to the grant of such orders may be made under subsection (6) are being extended to include undue inconvenience or nuisance to persons residing in the locality or an undue risk to public order in the locality. At present, the grounds are limited to undue inconvenience to persons residing in the vicinity of the licensed premises, a narrow category of people whose interests could be affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">Third, the possibility of the District Court requiring an applicant for a special exemption order to install a closed circuit television system is specifically mentioned in subsection (4)(<i>b</i>). I am not in favour of requiring all licensees, irrespective of the size of the premises and regardless of whether they apply for special exemption orders, to install CCTV. The need arises mainly in relation to larger premises, and the provision I propose will enable the Garda, which is a notice party, to request the court to attach the CCTV condition where it has reason to believe it to be justified or appropriate. A CCTV system may seem to be a small imposition on the proprietor of a large and substantial premises, but in the case of small premises on the main streets of towns such as Loughrea or Killorglin in County Kerry, where there are many premises and where turnovers are not large, the installation of a CCTV system could be economically onerous and disproportionate, bearing in mind the potential implications for public order and the like.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">Section 12 prohibits the provision of entertainment during the 30 minutes drinking-up time that is permitted under existing provisions. Section 4(2) of the Public Dance Halls Act 1935, which permits dancing during the 30 minute period following expiry of a special exemption order, is being repealed. The Commission on Liquor Licensing has recommended this change to ensure that the original purpose of facilitating an orderly clearing of premises is not defeated.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">Section 13 substitutes a new section for section 32 of the 1988 Act. It prohibits the purchase of alcohol for, or delivery to, persons under the age of 18 years of age. However, the purchase or delivery of intoxicating liquor for consumption by a person under 18 years in a private residence where a parent or guardian has given explicit consent shall not be unlawful. The provision that is being replaced is flawed in so far as it permits the delivery of intoxicating liquor to persons under 18 years in a private residence without parental consent.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">Section 14 substitutes a new section for section 34 of the 1988 Act. It prohibits persons under the age of 18 years from bars of licensed premises. However, under subsection (2), a licensee may permit a child – defined as a person under the age of 15 years – to be present if accompanied by a parent or guardian, but not after 9 p.m. This discretion shall not apply where it appears to the licensee that the child's presence in the bar could reasonably be regarded as injurious to the child's health, safety or welfare.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">Under subsection (3), a licensee may permit a person aged 15 to 17 years to be present in the bar unaccompanied by a parent or guardian, but not after 9 p.m. Subsection (4) contains a number of exemptions to the general prohibition. The remaining subsections are broadly similar to existing provisions in section 34 of the 1988 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">As the House will be aware, I had originally suggested an 8 p.m. cut-off, but I amended this to 9 p.m., having listened to various views expressed  on the subject. The provision is reasonable and takes account of the need to facilitate families while at the same time promoting compliance with and enforcement of the licensing laws. I understand that children's charities, including Barnardos and the ISPCC, welcome the restrictions on the presence of people under the age of 18 years in bars. The Irish Medical Organisation has also written to me on the subject. It is supportive of the general thrust of the Bill even if, in its view, the proposals do not go far enough in some areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">It has been suggested that not allowing persons under the age of 18 years in the bar of licensed premises after 9 p.m. is in some way anti-family or that it will convey an image of the country as not being welcoming to families. I cannot subscribe to that view and I believe that most reasonable people support the Government's approach on this issue. If I was in a hotel anywhere in Ireland and saw a notice above the entrance to the bar that no persons under the age of 18 years will be admitted after 9 p.m. I would not consider the hotel to be anti-family or anti-child, nor would I feel unwelcome if I was there on a family holiday. Indeed, having been on many family holidays in many Irish hotels, I might welcome some solace after 9 p.m. and the excuse that it was illegal as a means of escaping some of the blandishments of junior members of families in the hotel.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">In this context I emphasise that in any hotel it is open under this system for the patron who is there with his or her family to bring out whatever alcoholic beverage he or she wants to drink in the company of his or her children in the lounge and general public areas, such as any function room, dining room or restaurant. No offence will be committed as long as the young persons are not admitted to a bar within the meaning of the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">Section 15 introduces an entirely new provision in the form of a new section 34A to be inserted in the 1988 Act. It requires that persons aged 18 to 20 years inclusive carry an age document to enter and remain in the bar of licensed premises after 9 p.m. Those are the only hours during which it is required to carry such a document. An age document may be one of the following: a Garda age card, which is the official Garda card containing a hologram and photograph of the carrier; a passport; an identity card of any member state of the European Union; a driver's licence; and a document prescribed in regulations to be made by the Minister. An age document is not required to gain access to other parts of the premises so that if a publican proposes to have a room set aside in his premises for entertainment or family matters or the serving of food, as has been suggested in much public commentary, there is no requirement for an age card to be provided to gain access to any such part of the premises.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">This new obligation to produce an age document to gain admission to bars is intended to assist licensees in complying with provisions relating to underage consumption of alcohol and to  assist the Garda in enforcing the law. While the carrying of an age document by 18 to 20 year olds will be mandatory after 9 p.m., this does not remove the obligation on licensees to ensure that intoxicating liquor is not supplied to or consumed by persons under 18 at any time. For example, a hotelier cannot serve under 18 year olds with alcohol outside the bar of his premises. Where a publican reallocates space within his premises so as to provide family entertainment rooms, he or she must still undertake the legal responsibility of not serving drink to under 18 year olds wherever they may be on the licensed premises.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">Whenever a licensee is unsure if a person has attained the age of 18 years, production of an age document should be demanded. It has been suggested that some people over the age of 21 years, possibly up to the age of 24 years, sometimes look to many people as if they could be under the age of 18 years. From time to time, some fresh faced people suffer embarrassment as a consequence. The introduction of an age card and a general requirement that it be produced should lessen the embarrassment in their case because they will always be able to carry it against the off-chance that they will be challenged.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">Arising from preceding amendments, section 16 contains a number of further amendments to the 1988 Act. It amends sections 31(2) and 33(1) to provide that the consumption of intoxicating liquor by a person under 18 years of age is conditional on the explicit consent of that person's parent or guardian. Second, it makes it an offence for a person aged 15 to 17 years to be present in bars of licensed premises after the cut-off point. Finally, it amends the existing temporary closure order provision of section 36A of the 1988 Act – as inserted by the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000 – to make it an offence not to affix a conspicuous notice giving details of the closure order as required by that provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">Section 17 has been introduced following discussions with the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights on 11 June during which concerns were expressed by members in relation to off-licences. It contains provisions dealing with the consumption of intoxicating liquor purchased for consumption off a premises and, for this purpose, updates and replaces section 13 of the Intoxicating Liquor (General) Act 1924. The section provides that a licensee shall be guilty of an offence if, with the licensee's knowledge or consent, intoxicating liquor supplied by the licensee in a closed container for consumption off the premises is consumed in another premises owned or controlled by the licensee or in a public place within 100 metres of the licensed premises. This limit of 100 metres is also referred to in the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003. The person who consumes such intoxicating liquor shall also be guilty of an offence. The section restates the existing prohibition on the consumption in an off-licence of intoxicating liquor bought there.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">Section 18 is intended to permit any member  of the Garda, whether in uniform or not, to enforce the licensing laws as recommended by the Commission on Liquor Licensing. At present, the powers of non-uniformed officers appear to be restricted to drugs-related offences under the Licensing (Combating Drug Abuse) Act 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">Section 19 provides that a person who claims prohibited conduct has been directed against him or her in any licensed premises may seek redress before the District Court. For this purpose, "prohibited conduct" is defined as discrimination against or sexual harassment or harassment of a person contrary to Part II of the Equal Status Act 2000 on, or at the point of entry to, licensed premises. The forms of redress currently available under the Equal Status Act are being extended to include temporary closure of the premises concerned. Moreover, where the District Court is satisfied that a person is entitled to redress and makes such an order, any person may object to the renewal of the licence of the premises concerned. That strengthening of the law provides support for the law against discrimination contained in the Equal Status Act 2000. Provision is made in subsection (6) for the Equality Authority to apply to the District Court for redress in certain cases, while subsection (7) provides that the authority may provide assistance to persons applying to the courts for redress. These new provisions extend the powers of the Equality Authority in respect of proceedings before the District Court where discrimination is an issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">I repeat what I said during Question Time last Thursday. The proposed transfer of jurisdiction from the Equality Tribunal (ODEI) to the District Court is not intended to reflect any lack of confidence in, or support for, the work of the tribunal. The correct view to adopt is that licensees should in principle be answerable for all their actions, particularly in respect of refusals to admit, in a single jurisdiction rather than having to face conflicting penalties and policies on precisely the same matter. Senator Walsh made the point in the course of debate on this legislation in the Seanad that it would be strange to have two referees of a football match both of whom had jurisdiction to blow the whistle for the same tackle with reference to different rules. The analogy is a good one to illustrate the thinking behind this particular change in the law. At present, the District Court is extensively involved in licensing matters. It has an involvement in the annual renewal of intoxicating liquor licences, in the grant of special exemption orders to licensed premises and in the application of sanctions and penalties for breaches of the licensing laws, including temporary closure of premises in certain cases. The court has the ultimate role in determining whether or not licensees are complying with the law in relation to admitting young people or persons who are drunk.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">It makes sense to extend the court's jurisdiction to include the adjudication of cases taken against licensed premises under the Equal Status Act. It  is a licence renewable condition that licensees are required to operate their premises in a peaceable and orderly manner. If, for example, a licensee admits or serves a person who is violent or disorderly, he or she could be exposed to an objection to renewal of the licence before the District Court on the grounds of not operating the premises in a peaceable or orderly manner. Not admitting or serving the person may, on the other hand, expose the licensee to a claim of discriminatory action before the Equality Tribunal. A decision to permit or refuse entry or service could expose a licensee to actions in two jurisdictions which is unsatisfactory. This is the reason I propose to adjust existing arrangements. I propose that in future it will be the responsibility of the District Court to adjudicate in such cases, but I stress that the non-discrimination provisions of the Equal Status Act will continue to apply to licensees. The provision to amalgamate jurisdictions in respect of admission issues has a very narrow application.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">Section 20 prohibits the supply of intoxicating liquor at a reduced price during a limited period on any day; during what is known as a "happy hour". This provision is intended to discourage practices which may lead to excessive consumption of intoxicating liquor. It will not prohibit or curtail retail practices such as sales or product promotions that take place over a period of days.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">I am concerned that the licensing of national sporting arenas is not properly provided for at present and I am therefore making provision in section 21 for new arrangements in relation to such arenas. Licences primarily intended for other purposes are currently being used in such arenas. In one case a theatre licence is being used. The conditions attaching to these licences are not suited to the needs of national sporting organisations which makes full compliance with and enforcement of the licensing laws difficult. These circumstances compare unfavourably with the licensing arrangements for racecourses, greyhound tracks, national cultural institutions and the National Concert Hall. Moreover, many national sporting arenas find it difficult to generate sufficient income from sporting events alone to cover their costs. Increasingly, such facilities are being used for non-sporting events such as conferences, exhibitions or seminars. The new section will permit the limited and controlled sale of alcohol at sporting and non-sporting events in designated areas of sporting arenas and will regularise the licensing position of these arenas. It will be a matter for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to designate national sporting arenas by means of regulations and to issue certificates approving the grant of a licence in respect of prescribed areas of the arenas concerned. He and I are agreed that this new provision will not apply to – and will never be used to bring about – the sale of beer by vendors who travel up and down the stands at football matches and the like as happens in some places. We are solely discussing regularising the legally dubious <i>de facto</i> licensing provisions which exist at some arenas.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">Section 22 provides for the making of two types of regulations including, regulations to prohibit or restrict licensees from engaging in promotional practices intended or likely to encourage persons to consume alcohol to an excessive extent and regulations to specify that particulars must be affixed to any container in which intoxicating liquor is sold for consumption off the premises to facilitate the identification of the licensee and the licensed premises concerned. The Commission on Liquor Licensing recommended that promotional practices conducive to or likely to result in excessive consumption of alcohol should be prohibited by law. This view is supported by the Strategic Task Force on Alcohol. Section 17 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000 provides that the name of the owner and the address of premises shall be clearly indicated on a label to be affixed to any container in which intoxicating liquor is sold for consumption off the premises. This section has not been implemented and is now being repealed.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">Deputy Costello debated the merits and demerits of that with me in the context of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill. There are serious practical problems with it. That is why a regulation-based approach seems to be appropriate because it will enable me to fine tune what could or could not be expected of people selling drink in off-licences. I have met a number of off-licensees, who run both small and large scale operations, and they have emphasised the difficulty of, for example, ripping open every case of wine to stamp individual bottles or of opening six packs of alcohol to mark individual containers. When bringing the regulations forward, I intend to consult widely within the trade in order to achieve a reasonable result and not impose blanket obligations on people which could be counterproductive and of little use legally.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">However, I accept Deputy Costello's remark that this could be useful in some cases. I am trying to distinguish between the case of wine bottles on the one hand, where it would probably be no use, and the take-away cans of beer or naggins of spirits found in the possession of young people, where it would be useful in assisting the gardaí to find out where the young people were sourcing the material. It should be emphasised that no matter what view is taken on the matter, it will never be the case that where a young person is found in possession of alcohol emanating from a particular source, a conviction beyond reasonable doubt against an off-licensee for supplying them could be properly grounded on that mere fact alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">Implementation of these provisions by means of regulations is intended to avoid any later challenge to the legislation on the grounds that proper procedures had not been followed. I am advised that I must notify the European Commission of proposed regulations under this section in accordance with the technical standards and transparency directives. These directives are intended to enable the European Commission and the member states to examine in advance  proposed national technical rules in the interests of transparency and the smooth functioning of the internal market.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">Section 23 deals with the application of the Bill's provisions to registered clubs. Sections that amend or replace existing sections in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 already apply to clubs by virtue of section 16 of the 2000 Act. Section 24 determines the jurisdictions of the courts in relation to sections 9 and 19. Section 25 contains two amendments to the operation of the Equal Status Act 2000. The first amendment is intended to safeguard the discretion of licensees regarding the presence of persons under 18 years of age in bars of licensed premises. That proposal is in line with the recommendations of the Commission on Liquor Licensing and the Strategic Task Force on Alcohol.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">The second amendment provides that a licensee may set a minimum age for the sale and consumption of alcohol that is above the statutory minimum of 18 years as long as the policy is publicly displayed and implemented in a non-discriminatory manner. It is possible for an off-licensee, if he or she regards it as socially responsible behaviour, to state that they will not supply spirits in large bottles to persons under a certain specified age as long as it is stated in a notice in the premises and it is applied on a non-discriminatory basis to all persons to whom it should apply. The age limits will not be enforced by the gardaí as the statutory limit will remain at 18 years. However, a person who believes that they have suffered discrimination and has grounds for believing that a licensee does not operate the policy in a fair and non-discriminatory manner may seek redress before the District Court. I can give the House an example. If there was a rule in a premises that spirits would not be served to persons under the age of 24 years and the rule was displayed in the premises and if it transpired that members of the Traveller community were the only people to whom that rule was applied in practice, that would be a discriminatory application.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">I wish to refer again to the codification Bill I intend to bring before the House next year. It is not a consolidation Bill but a codification Bill as it is not a mere restatement of the existing law but a reworking of the law to include any necessary amendments. It will provide the House with an opportunity to revisit the provisions set out in this Bill. If we are not getting the legislation right, if brighter ideas are available or if there are areas in need of reform, such as in the area of theatre licensing – I am signalling this now in case anybody is going to make a significant investment and claim afterwards that they were not given advance knowledge – which requires substantial reform, we will have the opportunity in a short time, in terms of legislative history, to consider those issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">The same applies to nightclub owners, who have made a strong case for a separate nightclub licence. The fact that I am not dealing with their  proposal in this Bill does not mean that the door is closed to it. I hope the House and my Department will have the opportunity over the next number of months to look at many issues which have been raised in the debate on this Bill and see if they require to be restated in the codification Bill. This Bill will, I hope, be repealed by the codification Bill. Every measure in the Bill will be liable to revision and review some time in 2004.</p>

          <from>Mr. Deasy</from>
          <p eId="para_438">No. This is a short Bill which incorporates the recommendations from the reports of the liquor licensing commission and the strategic task force on alcohol. The Minister said the Bill will be repealed next year. The Bill should have been passed months ago. The sections of the Bill are quite simple and people have been talking about them for years. It was not necessary to take so long to bring the Bill forward or to wait for the reports from the strategic task force or the liquor licensing commission. It is common knowledge that some of these measures were needed a couple of years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">The Minister has drafted the Bill's provisions from the reports I mentioned. I could not help pondering this over the past few days, particularly with regard to the report of the strategic task force on alcohol. The Minister sneered at Fine Gael's policy on alcohol but we based our policy on that report as well. It is interesting that the snide remarks and sneering of the Minister a few months ago was about a policy based on the same document on which the Bill is based.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">For the past three years I have read in newspapers and seen on television the commentators who are appalled at and horrified by the street violence this country has experienced. In the past few weeks, however, since the introduction of this Bill, there has been a sea change. The newspapers that reported on the horrific street violence are now claiming this legislation is too draconian and is taking away our liberties and freedoms. They cannot have it both ways. The argument that sickens me is that one cannot touch the bona fide pint drinkers who do not bother anyone and only harm themselves. I have heard business people on the radio over the past few days arguing about this. It is most hypocritical. Everybody is aware of the mess we are in with regard to drink-related crime. People cannot have it both ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">From the point of view of my party, the legislation does not go far enough. It does not seriously address the issues this country faces with alcohol abuse and drink-related crime, which has doubled in recent years. The Minister is quoted as calling this a "crisis". There is a crisis in this society caused by excessive alcohol con sumption. He constantly cites the Commission on Liquor Licensing and the Strategic Task Force on Alcohol. If there is a crisis why did he not include some of the more powerful measures in the interim report of the strategic task force report such as lowering the blood alcohol limit for drivers with full and provisional licences? Why did he not call for a total ban on advertising? He and other Ministers have been mouthing on about advertising for years. A simple way of dealing with that is to impose a total ban on it. Again, he avoided it. Why did he not put in place a systematic data collection procedure for the key harm indicators? With regard to the commission report why did he not initiate a national alcohol strategy, something that the National Crime Council has also advocated?</p>
          <p eId="para_442">Why not address the use of the argument of drunkenness as a defence against a criminal prosecution or as grounds for mitigation of penalty? That was a recommendation in the commission report. Why are more gardaí not being deployed? Why is this Government not putting the resources into increasing Garda numbers if there is a crisis?</p>
          <p eId="para_443">As far as drunkenness is concerned I will probably support what the Minister is trying to do. It is important that we place an onus on publicans. Most publicans are quite responsible but some simply are not and they do not care what happens to a patron once he or she goes out the door. There is an onus on publicans not to allow overt drunkenness or drunken misconduct on their premises. What kind of evidence is required to show that a person is drunk? How will the court satisfy itself that the person was drunk at the time? This is already on the books. I agree that it should be revisited but the real issue is enforcement. If it has not been enforced in the past it will not make any difference in the future. If one goes through this Bill one comes to the same conclusion in four or five different areas. It will not make a damn bit of difference unless the enforcement aspect changes dramatically. We all know that and this is a good example of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">The Minister came up with the suggestion about four to six months ago of allowing local authorities to extend pub closing hours. I said then that it was a silly and naive idea, and I was right. Everyone agreed with me, even local councillors all over the country who said that it was a crazy notion. This is not as bad. It is trying to allow the local authorities to have a significant input into deciding which premises should be granted special exemptions. In a perfect world that probably could work. I do not like the idea of councillors being lobbied by publicans. Many councillors drink in the same pub. I do not like the idea that the guy who owns the pub lobbies those councillors for a special exemption order because a resolution would be passed through that town council and the phrasing of this would have an effect in the District Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">I do not want councillors touching this area, it should be left to the Garda and the courts. The Minister never served on a local authority. If he  had served six months he would know I am right. I have often said that to him. I do not believe he understands how close and vital the relationship between publicans and councillors is in rural areas. He does not have a clue how middle Ireland works with regard to lobbying on a local level, and if he did this provision would not be in the Bill. In a perfect world it would. There is nothing wrong with a Minister thinking outside the box. Many people here would never take a risk on any issue. There is nothing wrong with a Minister coming up with a new and different idea that is innovative. That is a good thing but this is potentially dangerous.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">One of the factors involved is undue risk to public order in the locality but usually, public order becomes an issue after the exemption is granted. It is putting the cart before the horse. I would impose a moratorium on special exemption orders. The trouble on the streets now is bad enough. The last thing we need is extended hours. Until we get a handle on the kind of street crime that exists there is no point in liberalising our drinking laws. We did it three years ago and there has been hell to pay ever since. It is nuts.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">I love the idea of gardaí on the video stakeout but if there is no money for CCTV in towns, and there is no money for extra gardaí, how can there be money for camcorders? It comes down to enforcement. This section of the Bill is a nonsense because there simply are not enough gardaí available. Giving them a video camera and posting them outside a pub door for two or three hours is crazy when they need three times as many officers to do a proper patrolling job on a weekend in an urban area.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">With regard to labelling, which the Minister mentioned earlier, this was in the Fine Gael policy document and I tend to agree with the Minister. Looking at the practicalities of this there are cost issues that may not have been thought out initially. We should look at it in the future but from a practical standpoint the industry may not be able to carry that level of cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">Given that the Minister was about to give me the brass neck award for even contemplating raising the drinking age his suggestion of allowing pub and nightclub owners to raise the drinking age in their establishments is possibly the most hypocritical thing I have heard since I have been in the Dáil. The Minister deserves the award for bringing this to the House after what he said a few months ago.</p>

          <p eId="para_455">I will move on. With regard to the equality sections of the Bill, people have been lining their pockets for years with the equality provisions in the old Act. This would allow cases of alleged discrimination go before the District Court where the standard of proof would be more rigorous. For years publicans and hoteliers have been targeted by people who have used the law for purposes other than those for which it was intended. It has been a vehicle that has allowed thousands of people to gain thousands of euro. I heard a Travellers' representative recently saying that the equality proposals in this Bill demonstrated the influence that vintners have on politicians. That is the truth. I have seen this with my own eyes, and the carping of those who are against the equality provisions in the Bill is unbelievable. The Equality Authority would have much more credibility if it said what everybody knows, that this law has been abused for years by particular groups and needs changing. The Equality Authority has done itself serious damage by trying to argue against the provisions in this Bill when it is common knowledge that this change is needed and I support it fully.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">Now we come to age cards, which could be really effective. It is also our policy to have age cards, and I support them. I wish to home in on one aspect, a provision to which the Commission on Liquor Licensing drew our attention. It noted the increasing level of forgery of Garda identity cards among young people, a serious offence under the Intoxicating Liquor Act. It is not that serious. In Dublin and other urban areas people have cottage industries forging documents so that young people can get into pubs. If and when this provision is passed into law, the problem will multiply tenfold. I know because I had experience of it in the States, just as Deputy Cassidy pointed out. I assumed the identity of William Laidlaw for two years. He was a resident of St. Catherine's, Ontario, and a crew member in the college that I attended. We all had fake IDs. There was a fellow doing an art major who was skilled with his hands, and he earned bucketloads of dollars making false IDs for everyone.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">I was talking to the private secretary to one of the Ministers this afternoon and she told me that her daughter's assumed name was Nuala, and that all her friends have assumed names. If that happens, the problem will multiply. Part of the fun for people is using a fake ID to get past a bouncer and enter a club or pub. No wonder section 28 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 refers to the making of false IDs, and section 26 to their use.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">In the United States, if the licensee is caught with someone holding a fake ID on the premises, he or she is liable. If one wants this measure to be effective, there must be some penalty for the licensee. Perhaps it is already covered by law, but it should be checked out. Mark my words, if the age card is to work – I support it – to ensure that forgery does not get out of hand, strict liabilities must be included regarding the use and  manufacture of such cards, and penalties for the licensee.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">I now come to the super-pubs. There are to be café-style pubs, with any new pub limited to 1,300 square feet. Unfortunately, we were subjected to six months of constant yakking about community-based pubs. The Irish people were going to drink cappuccinos and eat croissants, and everything was going to be hunky-dory. The Minister bored us with that drivel for months and the media were sucked into it.</p>

          <p eId="para_467">—with this drivel for months. The media got sucked into it because they all believed in it. For weeks on end, we were all looking forward to the prospect of the café-style pub, which was going to solve everyone's problems. My favourite quote is "provide an atmosphere and ambience that encourages moderate social consumption of alcohol rather than the excessive consumption and binge drinking that has become so common in recent years". That utopia was thrown out by the Government again and again. If it was such a priority, where the hell is it? Now we are told that we must wait until the middle of 2004 before this figment of someone's imagination appears. Let us get real here. The Minister has talked a great deal in the past year, but many things have simply not materialised, and he has sucked many of the media with him.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">Then we have "Cool McDowell", who gave a sermon to the children. It was the old "don't get laid and drunk" speech about those things not being cool. MTV and "Ibiza Uncovered" are not cool. I still watch MTV and I find it rather good television. If the Minister goes on about that, why does he not ban advertising? If he is so adamant that he will save the children, why does he not advocate a total ban on it? The good news is that no one took him seriously. The bad news is that MTV will never ask him to do an episode of "Cribs" in Ranelagh. When I heard all that, I had to ask myself whether I would take the Minister seriously on drink. The answer was "No", and I was not the only one to think that. It was embarrassing. The children in this country could buy and sell the Minister when it comes to drink. Frankly, they know more about it than the Mini ster. Children of 14 or 15 know much more about drinking than the Minister. He would be better off putting people in prison and leaving the children alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">The Minister said last year that the Garda would have sufficient resources to carry out its duties, but that is not the case. He said that he would examine proposals to toughen criminal law regarding public order offences, but street violence has worsened, and in the Minister's words there is still a crisis. There are no extra gardaí. It looks like 600 gardaí will retire this year. As far as enforcement is concerned, the Minister likes to say that he will go after "drink-induced criminality", and I support that. I support some of the other measures too, but I wish to focus on drink-induced criminality.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">The National Crime Council recently conducted a study which showed that 56% of public order offences were struck out or dismissed. That is the issue the Minister should deal with. Is it any wonder people no longer report crime? The reason is they know that the chances of anything happening to the person who has committed the crime are tiny. Some 14% of public order offences resulted in a fine and 1% resulted in people going to jail. That is the issue in this country. It is not merely about this Bill and legislating to put more laws on the Statute Book. We love putting laws on the Statute Book, but we hate enforcing them. Every Deputy present knows that that is the case and they have all referred to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">Some of the provisions are useful, and I would like to be able to support them, but unless one deals with the other side of this issue, that of enforcement – with 56% of public order offences people get off scot-free – one is at nothing. It is no wonder the gardaí are completely demoralised and leaving in droves when they go out night after night, putting their safety and health on the line, and see criminals getting off again and again. The Judiciary has a role in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">Last week I spoke in the House about drug offences and said that the only way to deal with the drugs problem is to have a three-month minimum sentence for those caught dealing. We will have to consider that seriously because many drug dealers are being sentenced under the Probation Act. If one compares districts, one will see that some judges put these people away while others let them off.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">It can be the fourth or fifth time before these guys are put behind bars. We must think seriously about minimum sentences, particularly in the area of drug-related crime. The reports stated that "there was a belief among the Garda that no real deterrent existed for public order offences and that most of them [being the offenders] did not think they had done anything wrong." There is a mindset that regardless of what crime or public order offence one commits, one's actions will have few, if any, consequences. That is the prob lem. People are going out and glassing guys in pubs, taking their eyes out, and getting suspended sentences. Guys are going into pubs and beating the lard out of people in indiscriminate attacks and nothing is happening to them. They know it, their friends know it and the gardaí know it and are sick of it. If the Minister wants to deal with the issue of drink, he must first deal with a real sanction for those who break the law and commit public order offences. Approximately 80,000 such offences were committed in the past year.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">The Minister has often cited the Mayo example in regard to the enforcement of the provisions on under age drinking and has made the argument for me. He has even asked Garda Commissioner Byrne to produce a report on this issue. Why have there been 121 pub closures in the west of Ireland for about four small counties while the number in Dublin is in the teens? The reason is that the gardaí enforce the law and make an attempt to deal with under age drinking. The Minister has made the argument for me time and again. Deputy Costello has made the same point.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">As far as closing time is concerned the commission made an observation, with which I agree, that many commentators who think they know a good deal about drinking say they would allow for a free-for-all and no licences. Politicians, including my father, agree with them. I completely disagree with this and have said so for many years. The commission stated that allowing a free-for-all where publicans choose when to open or close would not suit Irish people's drinking patterns, and it is absolutely right. Let us look at what happened during the past few years.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">The Minister has incorporated a provision which provides for reverting to the old closing time on Thursday. That is party policy and I agree with it. I get annoyed when I hear commentators speaking about the hour on Thursday being gone as if it was the end of the world. I have heard the same commentators say that the chaos and mayhem on the streets must end. I have heard them question the Government and the Garda Síochána. The hypocrisy here is hard to take sometimes if one takes the weekend as a whole and those three hours on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">One day one reads a newspaper story about a drunken rampage leading to devastation on the roads and a man beaten to within an inch of his life. This is followed by a civil libertarian argument that makes no sense whatever, taken with the previous argument. I understand why the Minister has bought into the argument that students are hung over and that there is worker absenteeism on Fridays but, for some reason, he does not accept that the provision has caused the increase in street violence. I have a real difficulty with that. What evidence does the Minister need? The statistics show that in 2000, there were 1,703 assaults causing harm.</p>

          <p eId="para_481">In 2001, the number of assaults causing harm increased to 2,374. Last April the Minister said there were 3,500 serious assaults in 2002. Essentially, the number of assaults has more than doubled since 2000. The Minister does not need any more evidence than that. He has said it is too early to make a decision on it. It is not; the evidence is there. The gardaí agree with me and it is time the Minister made a decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">I agree with some of the Bill's provisions. The Minister speaks tough on crime at times. Many people, particularly those in the media, believe he is doing something in this area. Since coming to office he has managed to pass the public order Bill introduced by the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue. He has taken out sections of the report of the Commission on Liquor Licensing, which he commissioned in the first place, and has presented them to the Dáil well over a year after his appointment. This is not much of a record on drink and alcohol abuse. The Minister does not understand how people drink here or how horrifying it is when one is in an urban area, with no prospect of help whatsoever, facing someone who is about to attack, assault and cause one bodily harm. It happens again and again. It happens every weekend night. I condemn some of the politicians here and commentators who say the Minister has not done enough. This is a step too far. The Minister has not gone far enough. He needs to take unpopular but necessary decisions in this area. I will support him if he does so.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">The Minister has asked for political co-operation. I support the Bill on two conditions – if the Minister reintroduces Friday and Saturday closing times and reduces the size of any new pubs. The latter is an issue on which I thought we had agreed. If the Minister is serious about political co-operation, he should take us up on it because we want to progress this. He should not say he wants political co-operation and then come up with one proposal. I have the facts to prove this and the gardaí agree with me, but the Minister has said he will wait until next year. There is no need to wait until next year. We all know what has happened during the past three years. If the Minister is serious about this he should take me up on my offer and, if he does so, my party will support these measures. If not, that is the way it goes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_303">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_484">I welcome the Minister to the House. However, I cannot give the same welcome to the legislation. We have had four interim reports from the Commission on Liquor Licens ing and the first interim report of the task force established by the Department of Health and Children. Following two years of deliberations, the Minister has produced a Bill which is extremely disappointing. I had expected much more and in a more coherent fashion. If one looks at the various headings, it is clear the Bill falls into three parts: conduct on licensed premises, amendment of the Intoxicating Liquor Acts and miscellaneous items. This does not suggest a comprehensive, coherent, thought out, thematic, or philosophical approach to the matter. The Minister said he intends to go down that road next year with a codification Bill and that the work will be done there. This is unacceptable because what he has produced is questionable in many areas. Much of it is going backwards, particularly in regard to the equality tribunal, and some of it is not workable. I would have thought the emphasis would have been on what is urgently needed and what is workable.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">We need to look at the issue of drink-driving which is the cause of major road fatalities and which gives rise to our adult problem. Nothing is being done about that in this legislation. We are told that the Minister for Health and Children will look at the issue some time in the future. Despite the specific proposals in the interim report of the strategic task force, which have been around since last May, nothing has happened. We have no idea when the Minister will look at them. I do not expect it to happen soon. The targeting of our young people through advertising is another issue we need to consider but there is nothing in this legislation that will do anything about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">The major areas on which we need to focus are missing from this legislation. The Minister is talking about providing an interim solution whereas in 12 months time we will have a new approach, a new codification of the legislation. What we really need is enforcement. We need the 2,000 gardaí the Minister promised. We need them on the beat and enforcing the law. This legislation will not provide any of that, nor will it provide enforcement in regard to many of the issues relating to drinking. Legislation on under-age drinking is enforced in a haphazard manner at present. There is already legislation on the Statute Book in regard to drunkenness but it is not enforced.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">This legislation is an unsatisfactory presentation of a discrete, unconnected collection of issues which miss the point of doing something urgent about the situation. This is exemplified in the Minister's original definition of a drunken person. I cannot understand where he got hold of it. If he had started the legislation with the definition of a drunken person he gave in his presentation a month ago, he would be laughed all the way home to Ranelagh. According to his original definition a drunken person means a person whose mental or physical faculties are impaired, or appear to be impaired, due to consumption of intoxicating liquor, so as to substantially diminish  the person's ability to think and act in a way in which an ordinary prudent person in full possession of his or her faculties, and using reasonable care, would act in like circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">Imagine the difficulties a publican or barman would have in determining that. Imagine, a person buying a round in a bar who bought a drink for a person who was not acting in a prudent fashion or taking reasonable care would be committing an offence. The penalty could be €1,500. A person could buy a round for a person who was a little tipsy or for a person whose mental faculties appeared to be impaired. On whose opinion will a judgment be made? How could any legal action be founded on such an opinion?</p>
          <p eId="para_489">This exemplifies the attitude taken in this legislation. The attitude is haphazard and pulls things out of the air. After all the chat shows on which the Minister sat and after all the musings of the last 12 months, the legislation he has produced is not good enough. We would be better off to withdraw this Bill if the Minister is going to produce codified legislation within the next year. He should produce Green and White Papers which would properly discuss the approach to dealing with alcohol, alcohol abuse and the drink culture in the country. He must also produce gardaí on the beat who will ensure the law is implemented and that the number of public order offences does not continue to climb through the roof.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">The gardaí must also enforce the law in regard to under-age drinking. It is a scandal that this law is not being enforced. Why does the Minister create law after law which is not enforced? The existing law in regard to drunkenness should also be enforced. What value is there in introducing a bevy of new measures in regard to drunkenness where the first penalty, if somebody is quarrelsome on the premises, is to close down the premises? The Minister will come the heavy with this legislation. Will we have a garda sitting in mufti in a corner or will there be a camcorder which will determine that somebody is quarrelsome and the pub must be closed down? The Minister knows this will not happen. He is producing bad law.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">Along with these issues of bad law, the Minister is now going to treat 18 year olds as less than adult. This is despite what he has said previously in the House. He is going to pass over discretion from the legislator to the publican and young people of 18 years will not have the right to go into a pub and have a pint. The Minister stoutly defended that right in the House a couple of months ago. It will now be left to the discretion of the individual publican whether to admit them to the pub. The Minister has stated that he intends operating this discrimination in a non-discriminatory fashion – what a contradiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">The Minister has also effectively repealed the provisions of the equal status legislation in regard to admission to public houses through transferring the matter to the District Court. It is more difficult to process the case of somebody refused  admission to a pub in the District Court than in the Equality Tribunal which was specifically set up for that purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">I made a proposal in regard to off-licence sales which the Minister indicated, when we met in regard to the heads of the legislation, he would take on board. Obviously he found that too difficult as a result of the views of those supplying the alcohol in off-licence premises. The Minister must grasp the nettle but he is not doing so. I am extremely disappointed with the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">Alcohol is the preferred drug of the Irish people. It is an integral part of our social culture and no celebration or mourning takes place without its consumption. The public house is where people meet informally over a few drinks and socialise. Due to the fact that it is a drug, alcohol has mood and behaviour-altering properties. Therefore, it is important that we constantly monitor the pattern of alcohol consumption and take appropriate measures to guard against abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">In recent years the consumption of alcohol has increased dramatically amongst all age groups in Ireland. Undoubtedly, the unprecedented levels of economic expansion associated with the Celtic tiger have put significantly more disposable income in the pockets of people. There has been no major analysis of these factors although surveys have been carried out. Ireland has moved from being a nation of moderate drinkers 20 years ago to being one of the highest consumers of alcohol in Europe with a 49% per capita increase in ten years. Ireland is top of the European league for binge drinking with more than 40% of men and 16% of women having more than six drinks when they go out drinking. Alcohol consumption per adult in Ireland is 56% higher than in the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">The pattern of drinking among the young has changed equally dramatically and 50% of Irish children under 12 have experimented with alcohol. These are alarming figures. Two thirds of 15 and 16 year olds drink regularly and half of them binge or crash drink. A survey conducted by the Department of Health and Children as recently as April found that one in every four young people between the ages of ten and 16 years had been drinking alcohol in the previous month. The fallout from such widespread excess and abuse by young and old is equally dramatic. The estimated cost to the Exchequer of alcohol last year was €2.5 billion. Some 40% of traffic deaths and 30% of roadside deaths are related to drink driving. Crime figures for 2002 reveal 35,000 cases of public drunkenness and 22,000 cases of threatening and abusive behaviour which were drink related. The vast majority of public order offences are also drink related. Some 20% to 25% of all accident and emergency cases in hospitals are drink related. A 370% increase in the numbers of teenagers intoxicated in public places was recorded between 1996 and 2002. Alcohol abuse is a significant factor in many of the cases of young women  attending the sexual assault unit of the Rotunda Hospital in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">The dramatic increase in alcohol consumption by young and old and the consequent high levels of anti-social behaviour require a fresh response. The old <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude and tolerance of drunkenness and drink-related offences must be replaced by a new culture of responsibility. This responsibility must be shared by those who produce and sell alcohol as well as those who consume it. Society, through its policy-makers, legislators and educators, must create the environment and introduce the measures which will help to change the old patterns of behaviour. In this respect, I disagree with the Minister. There must be a coherent theme, running from the brewers and distillers of alcohol down to the consumers, in terms of a responsible approach to alcohol consumption.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">The first area which must be dealt with is the drinks industry, the primary responsibility of which is to contribute to whatever measures are deemed necessary to offset and counteract the abuses arising from the consumption of its products. The drinks industry is a multi-million euro one with huge profits. Breweries and distilleries should pay the Government a special levy on their profits and the money raised should be placed in a designated fund which would finance education, information and awareness-raising programmes, aimed primarily at young people, and would finance health and rehabilitation programmes for people damaged by alcohol abuse and addiction. Vast sums of money are spent on marketing by the drinks industry. Approximately €38 million was spent last year in the Irish advertising market. Young people and sporting activities are particularly targeted by sponsorship, promotions and advertising. Advertising which links alcohol to young people and sporting activities should be banned immediately. There is no reason why one should have to wait until some time in the distant future.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">The Minister for Health and Children should use the Health Act 1997 to ban a range of dangerous products from the Irish market which the Minister considers to contain excessive volumes of alcohol and to be aimed mainly at young people. A health warning could be placed on every unit of alcohol displayed in the same manner as tobacco products, a provision to which this Bill makes no reference. Enabling legislation could be enacted to allow the Minister for Health and Children to introduce further restrictions on an enabling basis in regard to the advertising industry, as he or she feels appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">The second area of responsibility is the service industry. The primary responsibility of owners of premises licensed to sell alcohol, such as public houses, night clubs, restaurants, off-licences and supermarkets, is to know the law, obey it and ensure it is obeyed on their premises. This is particularly important given the proliferation of licences in areas in which licences have not historically existed. There is an absolute need for  people to know the law and ensure it is operated on the premises and in the vicinity. From that point of view, all licensees should have to undergo a training, information and health and safety-type course in regard to their legal responsibilities. This should include, for example, how to manage premises and service customers. The industry has already gone down that road with the responsible serving of alcohol programme, developed by the health promotion unit of the Department of Health and Children. The RSA programme should be part and parcel of the conditions of someone being granted a licence. It should be a statutory requirement, the benefits of which should be passed on to employees in order that they know precisely how to handle people and manage premises.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">No one under 18 years of age should be permitted to sell or serve alcohol on premises which are dedicated primarily to the sale of alcohol under any circumstances. That is not provided for in this Bill. The Minister's proposals on the requirement of age identification does not change the existing situation in that the same number of options apply, for example, a voluntary Garda card, a passport or a driving licence. The only satisfactory identification should be a personal public service card, with its computer code, which everyone from the age of 18 years holds. It is the only standard method.</p>

          <p eId="para_504">While this Bill imposes strong penalties on under age drinking, they are not enforced. We are aware of the situation which pertains in County Mayo. It is a legendary part of the wild west, yet, in terms of the implementation of law and order, it is far from wild. Rather, it is the only county in Ireland in which offences committed in regard to the service of minors are being pursued by the Garda and enforced by the courts. I do not understand why we cannot do the same in the rest of the country. Perhaps we could send the gardaí from Dublin to take lessons from Superintendent Carey in Mayo in order that they might learn a thing or two.</p>

          <p eId="para_506">That is correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">This is a question of enforcement. Part of the problem with this Bill is that the Minister is beating around the bush by merely introducing elements of the legislation if they are required. The Mayo example demonstrates that legislation,  if enforced, will deal with the problem. However, it is not being widely enforced and, once the law is flouted, it is brought into disrepute and the Minister, therefore, has a strong responsibility in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">We are to have codification next year but the fact that we must wait until then is part of the problem. What assurance have we that the 70-plus Bills proposed by the Minister will actually be codified? We need a thematic and philosophical structure to the new legislation which will contain the best parts of the various Bills and weed out what is unnecessary or redundant in order that we have a coherent set of legislative proposals which respond to modern needs. There is nothing in what we have seen to date which reassures me that that will be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">I am particularly unhappy that this Bill does little more than repeal section 17 of the 2000 Act, which makes provision for the labelling of all off-sales containers. The Minister also says that he will make provision for new regulations to be introduced some time in the future. The Minister knows he will not do this. If we could not come up with a plan in three years, it will not happen now. We must address the entire question of off-licences and the need for traceability on liquor sold from them. The Minister has outlined all the reasons this cannot be done. Will he come up with some reasons why it can be done? A great deal of liquor is sold from off-licences and I would appreciate if the Minister could give us more specific details of off-licence sales. There has been a proliferation of outlets selling liquor that was previously sold from straight off-licence premises. Now, every supermarket, SPAR, Centra and garage forecourt shop sells alcohol. There is little control of who the alcohol is sold to and how it is sold. If the existing laws were enforced, it would be of enormous benefit in dealing with the problem of under age drinking. However, we have now repealed the law that should have been in place with regard to off-licences. I am very disappointed by this.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">The Minister promised us that the issue of alcohol and driving would be addressed. Why is the drink-driving limit not brought into line with the rest of the EU? We are the only country that allows 80 milligrams per millilitre. Why not reduce it to 50 milligrams – two pints of beer to one – and bring us into line with European limits? Such a move would not require major research or new legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">The 1994 Road Traffic Act allows the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to introduce regulations to lower the blood-alcohol limit for provisional drivers to zero. That recommendation of the first interim report of the task force could be implemented by the stroke of a pen. The random breathalysing of drivers, regularly sought by the Garda, could also be implemented by the stroke of a pen. We are awaiting these regulations. However, the Minister will tell us that the Minister for Health and Children will introduce some while the Minister for Transport will intro duce another. We know they will not be introduced because they are not part of the Ministers' agendas. Nothing in the schedules of legislation has indicated that these matters will be tackled.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">The legislation's provisions on equality issues represent a backward move. I have no doubt that the Minister was lobbied strongly by the vintners on the matter. This is regrettable as the Equality Tribunal was beginning to settle down. Even the vintners, in their presentations to us, indicated that the position was more stable than heretofore. However, the Minister proposes to transfer a major function of the Equality Tribunal – to look at cases of discrimination regarding admission – to the District Court. This will seriously undermine the tribunal and the equal status legislation. How long will it be until another service provider asks a Minister to follow the precedent established by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and question the equal status legislation? Service providers will be able to argue that there are certain people they do not want on their premises. They could argue that they too should have an exemption from the provisions of the equal status legislation in terms of discrimination. The notion of being able to discriminate in a fair manner beggars belief.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">The Garda Síochána has a heavy duty of responsibility in ensuring effective enforcement of the law. However, this is being done in a haphazard manner. Why can the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform not speak to the Garda about the need for a strategic plan to deal with alcohol abuse? No strategies are in place to address this. We know public order offences have increased dramatically in recent years. Vicious assaults are commonplace. Why can the Garda not mark out the locations where the violence and disturbances occur? This is an operational matter. Why can it not deploy greater resources to these flash points? Why can we not have closed circuit television cameras installed at flash points?</p>
          <p eId="para_514">The provision of youth services and facilities must be addressed. We need alternatives to the drink and drug culture. There is no sense in us examining this in a vacuum. Major diversionary programmes and sporting facilities are required. Communities devoid of these services need to be particularly targeted. It is a disgrace that the RAPID programme which was specifically geared, with investment of €2 billion, towards providing such additional facilities has now fallen by the wayside and the Government is no longer honouring its commitment. The young people's facilities and services fund is no longer being funded.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">As the drinks industry spends an inordinate amount of money on advertising directed mainly at the young, Government levies should be channelled into funding educational and awareness programmes. School and youth organisations should play a major role in promoting a healthy lifestyle. If only the same amount of money were put into presenting and projecting healthy life styles as is put into pretending drink is part of a healthy lifestyle, the position could improve.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">We do not have coherent policies to tackle this issue. We need to look at introducing a whole new approach to dealing with alcohol abuse. The best way to do this is to replace the present culture of tolerance on alcohol and alcohol abuse with one of responsibility. We must tackle this right across the board and place responsibility on the brewers and distillers right down to the Garda, the service providers, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who is responsible for legislation, and the consumers. If we do not proceed in this fashion, we will find ourselves with a scattered set of hit and miss proposals. This is what we have in this Bill as there is no integration between its provisions. When this Bill is passed, the new state of affairs will be worse than the present one.</p>

          <p eId="para_520">To delete all text after "That" and substitute the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_521">"Dáil Éireann:</p>
          <p eId="para_522">– Recognising that over-consumption of alcohol, alcoholism, and associated ill-health, public and private violence, and negative economic impacts are serious social problems in this State requiring comprehensive and effective solutions based on international best practice;</p>

          <p eId="para_526">– Noting the recommendation of the strategic task force on alcohol with respect to the efficacy of pricing controls as international best practice in reducing alcohol over-consumption and associated public disorder – which are not substantively addressed in the Bill before the House;</p>

          <p eId="para_528">– Noting the grave concerns raised by a broad coalition of reputable non-governmental organisations about the dangerous precedent set by proposed amendments to the Equal Status Act , which are not related to international best practice in reducing alcohol over-consumption and associated public disorder;</p>

          <p eId="para_531">– Condemning the Government for attempting to fast-track such flawed legislation through the Dáil;</p>
          <p eId="para_532">Declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill.".</p>
          <p eId="para_533">I tabled this amendment on the basis that this legislation is flawed and should be referred back for revision. A Second Reading of any revised Bill should be postponed until the Minister has prepared an impact assessment statement that covers the implications of the Government's proposals for the Garda, local authorities and the industries concerned with its enforcement, and such a statement should be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. The Minister should also request an impact assessment statement from the Equality Authority confirming that the proposals in the Bill do not delete equality rights or affect the operation of the Equal Status Act 2000. An impact assessment statement should also be obtained from the Human Rights Commission again stating that the proposals in the Bill do not delete or have a deleterious effect on human rights. Both statements should be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">The Minister stated that we will return to these issues next year. I do not see the urgency. Why not wait and get the codification of the legislation right so that it incorporates the concerns of groups such as the Irish Nightclub Industry Association or the Irish Hotels Federation, and those of minority groups which they have raised with Deputies, to ensure we do not have to return continually to this issue to try to get it right? What about effective policing? There is nothing in the Bill that will ensure that these new provisions will be enforced. What about the issue of sequential closing or adequate public transport at night?</p>
          <p eId="para_535">I recognise that excessive consumption of alcohol, alcoholism and the associated negative effects on health, the economy and as manifested by public and private violence are serious social problems for the State. These problems deserve the best international standards and practice but the Government has not managed to address them in the Bill. I support one or two provisions, namely, the banning of happy hours or promotional sales of alcohol, especially cut-price drinks, and these are mentioned in section 20. We deserve effective legislation because, so far, Governments have effectively failed to enforce existing laws and powers with respect to excessive consumption of alcohol and the associated public disorder.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">The Minister made self-congratulatory references to how the Bill progresses the recommendations of the Strategic Task Force on Alcohol. One of its main recommendations related to price controls, a recognition that one of the three most important aspects of international best practice in reducing excessive alcohol consumption and associated public disorder is to increase tax on alcohol. The task force report recommended that the State increase alcohol taxes and use the additional Exchequer revenue to implement the recommendations set out in the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">The subtext of the Bill is a misplaced notion that the main problem with alcohol consumption is under-age drinking. The reality is that those who are of a legal age to drink are responsible for the vast majority of excessive alcohol consumption and also carry out the vast majority of related anti-social behaviour. To confront this reality, we would have to confront ourselves and the examples we as older members in society and as legislators have set. We have not required the Garda to prioritise the redirection of its resources towards tackling this problem in society which could be dealt with quickly were this redirection to take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">The Minister has not conducted an adequate assessment of the impact of some of the proposals in the Bill on different sectors of society. For example, the Irish Hotels Federation believes that the ban on children in section 14 and the mandatory identification provisions in section 15 will do long-term damage to the tourism industry and make hotels and similar mixed establishments less family-friendly. If the Minister wants to sit in peace and quiet, there are pubs in which he can do so. He can also go to his hotel room and order drink from there. Other organisations, such as the National Youth Council, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and the One Parent Exchange and Network, have grave concerns about these provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">The Bill exploits genuine and widespread concern about the negative impact of alcohol and alcoholism, the prejudice and preconception that Travellers and young people are responsible for the bulk of public order offences and the unfortunately widespread but mistaken belief that the reason the Equality Tribunal has made so many  findings in favour of Travellers is because they are milking the system. This is rather than accept that this pattern reflects a long-standing tradition of discrimination and exclusion of Travellers from these businesses due to prejudice.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">I share the grave concerns raised by a coalition of reputable non-governmental organisations about the dangerous precedent the Minister is setting in his proposed amendments to the Equal Status Act which are not related to international best practice in reducing excessive alcohol consumption. I refer to the plans to remove the jurisdiction of the Equality Tribunal to refer complaints of discrimination by licensed establishments to the District Court and the exemption of licensees from the Equal Status Act in section 25 to permit, legislate for and legalise discrimination. Without exception, everyone has the right to equal treatment and protection against discrimination and there can be no exception for certain industries or sectors from common obligations under the Equal Status Act, not even after such powerful interest groups have lobbied the Minister. The exemptions under sections 19 and 25 set a dangerous precedent, opening the door for other industries and sectors to argue that it is unreasonable to expect them to comply with the Equal Status Act on the basis of cost and security.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusHealy" eId="spk_311">
          <from>Mr. Healy</from>
          <p eId="para_541">I am disappointed by the Bill and its provisions. I would have thought that, following on the different reports, it would have been much more comprehensive. To say that codified legislation will be ready some time in 2004 is not good enough, because this is an area that is a cause for considerable concern. There is a crisis where the consumption of alcohol is concerned and the Bill is a limited and inadequate response to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">Alcohol is the most abused drug in society. It is so ingrained in the national psyche that we often forget it is a drug that causes huge problems for individuals, their families and friends and major difficulties in work. The costs of dealing with alcohol abuse in the health service are enormous and in recent years we have experienced a rise in street violence and anti-social behaviour across the State. We should promote a responsible approach to alcohol among consumers, the drinks companies, publicans and club owners. This limited Bill does nothing to address those elements.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">The sale of cans from off-licences to under age drinkers is a problem, as are off-licence opening hours. Many off-licences are part of the local corner shop or small supermarket and it is clear that drink is being sold by them at all times of the day and night. These shops are open from 7 a.m. until 11 p.m. and some are even open 24 hours a day. I agree with the Labour Party spokesperson who suggested that there should be an identification code on cans sold by such outlets. I listened with some incredulity to Deputy Deasy when he suggested this would not be possible because it would cost the drinks companies too much. The  drinks industry turns over billions of euro in profits and it would be a drop in the ocean for it to operate such a scheme. It would be a small step in the right direction to take such action. The drinks industry should also contribute by way of a levy to education and rehabilitation programmes to ensure a responsible approach to alcohol.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">Enforcement is the Achilles heel of existing legislation and of this Bill. There is a raft of legislation which is not enforced – under age drinkers can get their hands on drink at the drop of a hat – and the fact that there is no sign of the 2,000 additional gardaí we were promised will not help.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CiaranCuffeGP" eId="spk_312">
          <from>Mr. Cuffe</from>
          <p eId="para_545">This Bill has laudable aims but proposes questionable means to realise them. By restricting the availability of alcohol while not tackling the cartel that controls the licensed trade, we are failing to tackle the core of the problem of alcohol abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">The limited number of licences perpetuates the monopoly in the licensing trade. Small pubs are being bought by developers and destroyed. There is enormous pressure on publicans to double or treble the size of premises. Unless the Minister tackles the super-pubs, not only through liquor licensing legislation but through the planning regulations, he will fail to tackle the widespread abuse of licences that allows the perpetuation of these super-pubs.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">The character of familiar areas has been shattered by the destruction of small-scale, family owned premises. The Minister only has to walk through his own neighbourhood to see it has destroyed much of the village atmosphere of Ranelagh. If he walks across the canal down Camden Street, where there were seven or eight pubs, he will see one super-pub shatter the character of that vibrant city neighbourhood every night by releasing hundreds of patrons on to the streets.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">Further down, in Temple Bar, the small-scale, family owned pubs such as The Norseman, The Foggy Dew and The Temple Bar have been destroyed through expansion. Ten years ago when I lived in the area, there was a hush when the darts team from Oliver Bond was playing local residents in The Temple Bar. It was a family owned pub that was physically demolished, keeping only the facade, and an airport style drinking lounge was installed that is many times the size of the previous establishment.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">Allowing the existence of enormous airport lounges encourages drunkenness to thrive in our society by getting rid of the subtle controls a bar man used to have over the premises. John Kehoe on South Anne Street had barely handed over the keys of his premises before the new owner threw open the upstairs door and doubled the size of the pub overnight. That is a major contributory factor to drunkenness. I am surprised that the Minister, a man who tends to oppose monopolies and cartels, is not tackling this problem in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">In every other European country one sees the small neighbourhood bars the Minister has mentioned previously. They exist because the owner does not need €1 million to open the establishment. I know people who opened a bar in Paris because they could not afford to open a premises in Dublin as they needed €1 million before they even got off the starting blocks. Unless the cartels and the super-pubs are tackled, the heart of the alcohol problem will not be tackled. Of course, super-pubs are not the source of all our problems with alcohol but they are a major contributor and controls are necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">Alcohol advertising must also be tackled. It was distasteful to witness the opening of the Special Olympics on television being interrupted by highly financed advertisements that link alcohol to sport. I hope the Minister will implement a blanket ban on the advertising of alcohol, particularly where there is an association with sport. The linking of the image of a man on a surfboard to the sale of alcohol is a highly dubious practice.</p>

          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_557">The Standing Orders of this House, as they have been allowed to develop, make it difficult to properly frame Private Members' legislation that would have the same effect as Government proposed legislation. The Green Party presents this Bill cognisant of the fact that the flaws in the Planning and Development Act  2000 can be addressed not only in this Second Stage debate but, if the House approves, on Committee Stage so that the intent of the Bill could be improved even further.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">In the course of the debate on this Bill, my party colleagues will make arguments not only regarding the content of the Bill but also the many problems that arise from the lack of effective legislation in this area. We will talk about specific local instances of how zoning is continuing to fuel land price inflation in many areas. We will talk about the fact that in the 30 years that have passed since the Kenny report we have still not had an appropriate response from successive Governments. We will talk about the fact that the acquisition of housing has been made more difficult through the lack of a proper legislative response, and the fact that a proper social and transport infrastructure does not exist in many communities because of such a failure. Ultimately, we will argue that a lack of a proper and effective law in this area has had an adverse effect on probity in public life. My role this evening is to go through the particular sections of the Bill and allow Members of the House to react to the many proposals we will put forward this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">Section 1 seeks to amend section 10(2)(<i>a</i>) of the Planning and Development Act 2000. The wording is the same as that in the Act with the addition of the words, “provided that priority in the subsequent use of these designations of land or property to be zoned should be given to land or property which is either (i) the property of the State or an agency of the State, or (ii) in the ownership of the planning authority concerned.”  While the section refers to “priority”, our intent would be that zoning of publicly-owned land should be solely done by the local authority. As I have already mentioned, the restrictions on the moving of Private Members' legislation does not allow us to formally propose that but it is open to the Government to provide a suitable amendment on Committee Stage. We will argue that the Government should give due consideration to an idea that is not original – the Kenny report is now 30 years old – but which has been re-flagged recently by CORI in a submission to the all-party committee on the Constitution. While the Government might argue over the course of this debate that the idea pre-empts the work of the all-party committee, we will argue that the committee must come up with a specific wording in terms of the Constitution and a legislative change which is necessary to properly define the balance that should exist between the rights of private property and the common good. This legislative change can be made separately to that and it is one that should be made with immediate effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">Section 2 seeks to amend section 10(8) of the Act. Again, the wording is almost the same as that in the Act but with a change of emphasis. The Act states that there shall be no presumption in law but we are saying there shall be a presumption in law that land zoned in any particular development plan, including a development plan  that has been varied, shall remain so zoned in any subsequent development plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">To be fair, most local authorities tend to do that in practice in that zonings in one development plan are carried over when the new development plan is presented to members of the local authority. We would argue, however, that there is an urgent need to change a particular element of a past development plan that would carry over into the next development plan process because, technically, it is possible in the drafting of a new development plan to change all zonings and designations. That is not a safe way to proceed for long-term planning in many of our local communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">Section 3 seeks to amend section 13(1) of the Act, which relates to variations of the development plan, and the change is similar to the one we suggest in section 1 concerning the development plan process. We say that regarding any variations proposed, priority should be given to land that is publicly owned. Our intent would be that we should go further, as suggested in the Kenny report and recently in the CORI submissions, and restrict zoning to publicly-owned land and not allow the instant inflation in privately-owned land that public decision making in respect of development plans and variations has allowed happen in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">Section 4 seeks to amend section 13(6)(<i>a</i>) of the Act. We seek to provide that with the support of no less than two thirds of the planning authority concerned, shall a variation be made of the development plan because in some instances it is possible to vary development plans through a simple majority of those present for the voting. We would like the legal effect of a development plan to carry as much weight as possible and to have the support of two thirds of the planning authority concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">On those grounds I commend the Bill to the House. I will now pass over to my colleagues who will further develop the arguments we wish to make over the course of the debate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulNicholasGogartyGP" eId="spk_318">
          <from>Mr. Gogarty</from>
          <p eId="para_565">In welcoming the Bill I acknowledge the limitations that exist in terms of bringing Bills before this House without financial implications. As will be said on a number of occasions, were Opposition Deputies to have that power, particularly regarding this Bill, it would be a little more far-reaching than it is currently. Even the modest measures that have been proposed would go some way towards stopping the land speculation and money grabbing we have seen in developments over the past 30 years and which in many cases have brought politics into disrepute in that with the stroke of a pen, the value of land can increase ten-fold. Should the Minister decide to use his powers, as has been done in a very limited number of cases, it would be virtually impossible to change the zoning of land, despite public protests, because of the fear of compensation. In many cases, the compensation aspect is exacerbated because the value of the land has  increased to such an extent through its very rezoning.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">We are attempting to make the usage of land and proper planning and development more important rather than giving developers <i>carte blanche</i> to increase their paper earnings ten-fold and raise the price of housing commensurate with the value of that land. An example of that was put to the House recently but I want to raise it again because I was not happy with the Government's response.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">A prime example of where this Bill would have had a positive effect is in the area of lands at Adamstown. As the House will be aware, Adamstown is approximately 530 acres of land on which there is talk of building a new town the size of Drogheda, going on to Lucan, which is the fastest growing town in the country. I will continue to raise this issue because it has not sunk in on the Government side of the House that we cannot build a new town of this size without proper planning in advance in terms of the facilities, the delivered services and the infrastructure. What has happened in that case has been a monumental folly. In order to justify the fact that developers must first build a certain amount and incur certain costs, developers are being allowed to build without proper facilities being in place, the reason being that the developer or builder in question would have to pay for them in some way, shape or form. This is partly due to the value of the land and other factors, including insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">Were this Bill to be enacted, developments taking place under the auspices of the local authority would be given precedence. In addition, a debate along the lines of that which occurred with regard to the requirement that 15% or 20% of new developments be social or affordable housing would not arise and there would no longer be uncertainty about affordable housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">I wish to address the Adamstown development in more detail. Services should have been in place before this development was given approval and went before An Bord Pleanála. If it had been planned in a structured way by the local authority, as opposed to being drawn up by the local authority with strong input from developers, I guarantee the final plan would have been completely different. The crux of the issue is that local authorities, without political interference or interference by developers, should be given time to plan for the long-term and to develop in a sustainable manner which meet the needs of local communities. This did not happen in the case of Lucan and it must happen nation-wide. Local authorities must take the bull by the horns and ensure they have a greater input into the development process.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">The political interference of the past, of which Lucan is a case in point, must be eliminated. Numerous areas of the town were developed by material contravention which flies in the face of proper planning and has destroyed the town. A long-term, strategic approach would have led to  a more sustainable area in which to live. This needs to happen elsewhere. The Minister of State's colleague has the power to do something about the Adamstown development and I ask that he does so.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">I also ask that, in considering the Bill, the Minister considers the long-term sustainability of planning and development. This is the reason a number of the sections, particularly the final section to which Deputy Boyle alluded, are so important. It includes the provision to allow two thirds of the relevant planning authority to change a development plan. In the past, a simple majority was used to the detriment of proper planning and development. With the abolition of the dual mandate, local councillors will focus more on their brief, which should bring responsible local government. However, as the measure is still in its infancy, we will continue to need checks and balances to make sure this comes about. I ask the Minister to support the Bill and to consider tabling positive amendments in light of his input in terms of the legislation's financial implications.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cuffe</from>
          <p eId="para_572">"In recent years there has been a remarkable increase in the prices paid for serviced land suitable for building and for potential building land near cities and towns in the State." While these words might appear appropriate today, they are not mine but are taken from the report of the Committee on the Price of Building Land, known as the Kenny report, which was submitted 30 years ago to the then Minister for Local Government, a youthful Deputy Robert Molloy. Sadly the report has sat on the shelf for the past 30 years and many of its fine recommendations have not been implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">Essentially, the Kenny report expressed concern at the profits accruing to developers from the sale of building land. The words used in 1973 are similar to those which could be used today to describe the position that pertains not only in the greater Dublin area, but also on the outskirts of many of our towns and cities.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">It is wrong that, for the most part, the enormous profits from land rezoning accrue to a limited group of developers. While I will not use my position to name them, many media publications have referred to as few as a dozen developers who own much of the landbank, certainly around the greater Dublin area. It is wrong that a small group of people in society can own or gather together futures and options on lands in order to release it onto the market when and in the manner they so wish. By cutting from the loaf of a limited landbank at whims, this limited group of developers is, in essence, holding up the price of land and ensuring that the consumer, the purchaser and those who rent accommodation are held to ransom. This is wrong. Many of the recommendations of the Kenny report on local government still hold water and should be enacted.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">Enormous pressure is exerted on local authorities during the making of development plans. In many ways, it is a akin to the contest between David and Goliath in that the forward planning and development sections of local authorities do not have the resources to compete with the finely-tuned submissions made by and on behalf of local landowners.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">Often, it is only through the mechanism of freedom of information that we are able discover the kind of dialogue taking place between developers and the local authorities. Recently, during the current review of the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown development plan, I used this mechanism to discover some of the reasoning behind the phenomenal amount of rezoning being proposed in the plan. In particular, I queried the rezoning for housing of a large patch of land almost half way between the towns of Shankill and Bray. I was curious about the apparently arbitrary manner in which a large chunk of land in the middle of a green belt and half way between two towns would be zoned for development. When I used freedom of information legislation to find out what was going on, lo and behold, I found a file full of correspondence from the landowner, Sir Mark Cochrane, and his agents to the local authority, essentially pertaining to the reasons the land in question should be rezoned.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">While I am sure the development department and the forward planning section of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council considers planning criteria only in its reasoning on the rezoning of lands – certainly in the current development plan – I am curious as to the reason such a substantial amount of land is being proposed for rezoning. I wonder whether the views expressed in the simple submissions of ordinary citizens are listened to as carefully and clearly as submissions made by the owners of large land banks. Local authorities and landowners, namely, the farmers who have perhaps been farming land for generations as opposed to those landowners who buy up large landbanks through speculation, come under enormous pressure from developers for the rezoning of land.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">The rezoning of land is necessary in certain areas and for certain uses. It is wrong, however, that the profits from such rezoning should accrue principally to the developer, rather than the local authority concerned. We should take on board the very clear recommendations of the Kenny report of 30 years ago, which states that the acquisition of land by local authorities for resale to builders or to the ultimate purchasers can help to stabilise the price of land or, at least, to prevent it rising very rapidly.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">I will conclude with one final quotation from the report where Mr. Justice John Kenny, the chairman of the committee which compiled it, quotes from the report of the Uthwatt committee in Britain. It states that the denser the population, the more intensive the use of land becomes in order that the limited area may be capable of fur nishing the services required; the more complex the productive organisation of society, the more highly developed must be the control of land utilisation exercised by or on behalf of the community. This is a quote from the Uthwatt committee in Britain. The word and intent of that report, and the Kenny report, was to make land and housing available at affordable prices for the general population. I do not believe that is happening today. We need to look at that report again and implement it rather than continuing to flounder, obfuscate and fail to produce housing at affordable prices. I believe this legislation will help to provide land at affordable prices for the general community.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanCroweSF" eId="spk_320">
          <from>Mr. Crowe</from>
          <p eId="para_580">I commend the Green Party for introducing this legislation. It is a valid and genuine attempt to tackle the problem of land speculation in this State. I am not sure if the proposals before us will seriously tackle the continued hoarding of land, spiralling house prices and rampant profiteering by developers. I believe it is important to record our opposition to what is happening throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">Last month, the Taoiseach told the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that 19 developers are hoarding large tracts of lands in Dublin's commuter belt. He left congress in no doubt that he had every intention of seriously taking on the developers and tackling the issue. Last Friday, <i>The Irish Times</i> reported that the Taoiseach's Department and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government seemed unsure as to who these developers are. If the Taoiseach is committed to taking on these 19 developers, identifying them would surely be a positive first step.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">One of the first Bills passed by the Government on its return to office was the elimination of the Part V provisions of the Planning and Development Act. This promised that 20% of any new land zoned for housing had to be kept for social or affordable housing. At the time Part V was revoked, my colleague, Deputy Morgan, accurately described it as a developer's charter. In September 2002, the construction industry trade magazine ran an article asking its readers if, "Part V is driving you crazy". By December, – no doubt concerned for the mental health of the construction industry – the Minister removed Part V. This decision seems to have been made despite the overwhelming support of various stakeholders during the so-called consultation process. Most of them suggested it be left in place, yet for some reason the Minister decided to remove it.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">The majority of developers and speculators are now opting to cherry pick clients by selecting housing agencies and eliminating the rather crude, but possibly effective attempt at social integration and breaking down elitism in our society. Developers are also offering financial inducements to local authorities. Money from these developers, particularly in the Dublin area, is not worth a damn. Local authorities want units,  not money. Money will not solve the problems in local authority areas in Dublin. The State is also selling off land, not to local authorities, but in many cases to private speculators and developers. Ministers then cry crocodile tears about the increase in house prices. We are not tackling the major problem – the availability of land. Land is being sat on, while people, particularly in this city, remain homeless and young people are finding it increasingly difficult to find housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">While the Green Party legislation is positive as far as it goes, Sinn Féin believes there is a need for more radical approaches to deal with the problems of housing, land prices and speculation. Sinn Féin believes the right to housing is fundamental and must be enshrined in the Constitution. We intend to introduce legislation for a referendum on the subject in the autumn and look forward to the support of Deputies with a serious interest in tackling homelessness and other housing-related problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">Sinn Féin has also made a submission on private property to the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution. I am sure my colleague Deputy Morgan will deal with this in greater detail tomorrow. The submission makes the point that the right to public property is being given pre-eminence over social justice. The democratic programme of the first Dáil, one of the cornerstone texts of Irish republicanism states: "We affirm the right that all rights of private property must be subordinated to the public right and welfare."</p>
          <p eId="para_586">We need a real debate on the right to private property as it is currently constituted in the Constitution. The constitutional balance must be in favour of the common good over the rights of private property.</p>

        <speech by="#MarianHarkinIND" eId="spk_321">
          <from>Ms Harkin</from>
          <p eId="para_587">I welcome this Bill. It is a response to the circumstances where certain individuals have amassed huge sums of money from the rezoning of privately-owned land. This Bill deserves serious consideration and support. The sorry saga of rezoning has led to corruption and widespread abuse of power. This has been well documented and while I do not intend to go down that road, the country continues to live with the consequences of many of those rezoning decisions. The Taoiseach today admitted that the Flood tribunal has already cost the taxpayer €26 million and could possibly run for another 15 years. We are looking at a gold mine for the legal profession and an economic black hole for the taxpayer.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">A further consequence of some rezoning decisions has been to put the price of the average house in Dublin and other cities outside the grasp of the average person. Once again the taxpayer is taking the hit because rezoning decisions were taken in the interests of speculators, landowners, people of property and politicians rather than the public good.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">I would like to widen the debate and look at some issues relating to rural planning. The rural  areas policy of the Sligo county development plan provides that the rural development control policy is best achieved by concentrating development in existing towns and villages. While it does provide that special consideration will be given to bona fide members of the farming community wishing to build dwellings on their land, it also provides that the development of sites for sale in a speculative way will be discouraged. The Sligo county development plan is actively discouraging those who wish to live in the countryside and instead wants to herd its citizens into villages and towns. One third of Irish people live in rural areas and they should be allowed to continue to live there. The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuiv, has said that planning policy should facilitate people wishing to live in rural areas. Indeed, the Taoiseach endorsed this view when speaking at a meeting at Maam Cross earlier this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">Furthermore, the national spatial strategy takes into consideration the need for rural housing in structurally-weak areas. However, in many rural areas such as Sligo, there is a constant and ongoing battle where significant amounts of time and energy of those that are seeking planning permission – the planners, officials and politicians – is taken up in enforcing a system that is largely anti-rural. In this context, I welcome the establishment of the Irish Rural Dwellers Association. This body aims to ensure that people that want to live in rural Ireland can do so, subject to proper planning guidelines and environmental protections.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">In many areas, models of development and planning are being imported from other countries. These models are seen as superior to our indigenous patterns of settlement and are, by and large, imposed on people. This is an unjust, unfair and anti-democratic system. I, like many others, look forward to seeing it changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">I should like to comment on land speculation. Many people and I would say most people in this House, would agree that the amassing of huge sums of money by individuals through rezoning is not a gain for society as a whole. Other mechanisms need to be found to ensure sufficient building land is available. What I find astounding is that farmers who want to sell a single site, not two, ten, 40 or 100, are refused planning permission. In many cases they are selling for purely economic reasons, for example, the downturn in farming, the foot and mouth disease outbreak two years ago, bad weather or just plain bad luck, but this is considered speculative development in rural Ireland. Others make millions if they know the right people or they are in the right location. There is no justice in this. While this Bill will not solve the problems of rural Ireland, it will go some way towards alleviating those in urban Ireland.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_322">
          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_593">I thank the Chair for the opportunity of speaking to this legislation. I  warmly welcome this Bill and I intend to vote in favour of it. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Planning and Development Act 2000 and to introduce measures to discourage land speculation. It provides an opportunity to stand up to land speculators and the greed merchants who have destroyed our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">This Bill also gives us a chance to support householders, consumers and, above all, the thousands of people on social housing lists. It is a scandal that many young couples cannot afford to buy their own homes. Let us call a spade a spade in this debate and say clearly that speculators are causing a crisis in the supply of houses. Sadly, we have a Government that will not stand up to them. It is also sad to see this Government turning its back on the households of this country and particularly young people. This is the real world for many people in 2003, and this is the real world of planning and development. Ireland was once known as the island of saints and scholars. Today it is better known as the land of scandals and tribunals. All sectors of society, politics, banking, the Church, business and particularly developers, have let the people down and this has led to massive cynicism in our country. This is bad for democracy and has led to massive alienation of the young, the old and the poorer sections of our society. This has had a profound impact on our value system. If we do not stop the rot, this country and its people will go down the tubes.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">Part of the solution is in this Bill which sets out measures to discourage land speculation. It is a great sign of hope and confidence in the future that we can do something for our own people. We cannot turn a blind eye to the homeless and families on waiting lists. It is a crime to tolerate a situation where 5,581 people nationally are homeless and more than 4,060 of those are in the Dublin area. We must listen to groups like the Simon Community, Focus Ireland, Threshold and the St. Vincent de Paul when they produce radical housing strategies and homeless action plans. We need basic principles. We need to set targets and we need to produce results. We have seen many examples of good practice in planning and development and housing, particularly on Dublin City Council. We must build on this and do what is right for our people. We also need to be creative, and that is what this Bill is about. We need proper planning. We need clarity and openness and, above all, we need top-quality housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">Some of the planning decisions around this city have been a disgrace. A block of apartments in my constituency at Glandore Road near Griffith Avenue is a classic example of bad planning and development that is out of character with the area, particularly Griffith Avenue, one of the most beautiful avenues in Europe. Now there has been another attempt to push 150 other apartments onto a piece of land at the rear of the Cloisters, Gracepark Road, Dublin 9. This will cause major traffic problems, noise, parking problems, overlooking of people's homes and all sorts of health and safety problems. It is an over- development on a small piece of land. It is another classic example of greed and land speculation. There was a plan for houses which would suit the local community. Now high apartment blocks are being packed in. It is a numbers game and a money game and it is against the principles of this legislation. We have the ability to plan and develop while at the same time allowing for space, the protection of our environment and safety for families.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">We cannot allow speculators to set the housing and planning agenda. We cannot allow more than 50,000 of our people to remain on social housing waiting lists. It is bad for people, it is bad for families, it is bad for children and it is damaging for our society. These are the kinds of areas where we must make tough decisions. We need to put people and communities first and put land speculators at the bottom of our agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">This Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill gives us all a chance to show our true colours. Are we on the side of the speculators or on the side of the men and women of no property? I commend the Green Party for presenting this Bill and I urge everyone to support it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaudgeConnolly" eId="spk_323">
          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_599">The main purpose of this Bill is to discourage the practice of land speculation and I welcome it. The Kenny report of three decades ago produced proposals to control the price of building land. It showed that speculation was a problem 30 years ago. If we do not do something about it soon, it will be a problem in 30 years time. This initiative would have had the full endorsement of the public to deal with the price of building land. The Kenny report also endorsed the right of local authorities to insist on a social housing component in all new developments. Recently we have heard about social housing again, but it was recognised 30 years ago that social housing was a necessary component of new developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">The Kenny report also proposed that a cap be put on the price of building land which represents by far the greatest outlay in terms of providing new homes. That cap would have been set at no more than the value of agricultural land plus 10% and would have been a major factor in preventing the rezoning scandals which have constituted the major part of the tribunals' agendas. Land has been bought and sold for seven and ten times its original value. That is not morally right.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">It is interesting to note that successive Governments of various hues have studiously shied away from adopting any of the recommendations in the Kenny report. This has largely contributed to residential price inflation over the past three decades. The cost of housing impacts widely on society. It has clearly reached crisis point when young couples, both working, cannot afford to build a house or start a family because of the price of houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">The artificial market created in the supply of serviced building land is the real scandal. It channels huge sums of money into the pockets of speculators at the expense of the public who pay for investment in infrastructure and the administration of our planning laws. Sustainability means satisfying human needs fairly without destroying the ecosystems that support life. The conflict between modern economies and the natural environment lies at the heart of sustainable use of the planet. The challenge is to modify modern economies to sustain ecosystems instead of destroying them. In the interests of sustainability it is appropriate that local authority development plans should review the local authority's changing needs at regular intervals and apply zoning designations accordingly. The support of two thirds of the members of local authorities concerned will ensure that any future rezoning will have the support of a broad cross-section of the members of the authority concerned. I understand this is a change from two thirds of those present to two thirds of the total number of councillors. In such circumstances no rezoning will sneak through in the review of a development, nor will any members be in a position to claim, as we have seen in the Flood tribunal, that they were not aware of the implications of the vote. I would question a person's presence on a local authority if he or she does not know the implication of the vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">I would also be in favour of the establishment of a zoning commission whose remit would encompass the review of the adopted development plans of all local authorities to ensure that they are in conformity with the objectives of sustainable development and appropriate land use. At any one time it is possible for a small number of developers who control a vast amount of building land to make massively inflated profits from land speculation, profits which come from the pockets of those who struggle to purchase houses. Accordingly, the situation where such land banks can produce massive windfalls for developers, merely because local authorities make rezoning decisions, should be ended.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">Section 3, which stipulates that two thirds of the members of a local authority will be required to support a rezoning proposal, will go a long way to address the question of frivolous or questionable rezoning in future development plan reviews. The stabilisation of house prices would make a major contribution to keeping inflation in check, which has caused prices to spiral by more than 20% annually during the lifetime of the Celtic tiger.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">I support the provision that priority in the variations of the development plan be given to State-owned local authority land, since the benefits will be clearly seen to accrue to the local authority concerned, and by extension to the citizens of the authority's functional area. I unreservedly support the Bill.</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_608">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which proposes to amend the Planning and Development Act 2000. The Bill has three purposes: first, to require land in State or local authority ownership to be used as a priority once zoned, whether in a new development plan or in a variation; second, to reverse the rule which was introduced in the Planning and Development Act 2000 that there is no presumption that land zoned in a development plan will remain zoned in any subsequent development plan and, third, to provide that variations of development plans would require approval of two thirds of the elected members of the authority. The intent of the Bill may be sincere and I would support the concern expressed about land banks being held by a small number of developers. I also identify with some of the points made, particularly by Green Party members.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">However, while it provides the opportunity to debate these matters, the Government believes that the Bill is misconceived and will oppose it. Planning law was comprehensively reviewed in the Planning and Development Act 2000. In the Act, new rules concerning the content and preparation of development plans were adopted to ensure an adequate supply of land for housing and other developments as a critical factor in restraining house price increases. The Bill would frustrate the Government's attempts to ensure an adequate supply of land for housing and other critical infrastructure. It would do nothing to promote sustainable development. On the contrary, it would have a negative impact on our attempts to plan sustainable, structured use of land to build communities. It would thwart our attempts to ensure that development plans are up-to-date instruments that allow local authorities to respond, in a transparent and planned way, to the needs of the people that live in their area and of the country generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">The function of the planning system is to support the sustainable development of land in the interests of the common good. The development plan lies at the heart of the planning system and is intended to provide the strategic framework and policy context for all local authority planning decisions. The Planning and Development Act 2000 reinforces the role of the development plan as the primary strategic statement on land-use planning at city, town and county level, and provides a clearly defined context for the formulation and content of planning applications.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">Under the Act, a development plan must set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area to which the plan relates. Within the wider social, economic and environmental policy context, develop ment plans must set out a strategic spatial framework – a clear view ahead, in development terms – for the area they cover. This spatial framework needs to focus on the big picture planning issues, possibilities and considerations that will underpin how the development process in each area is structured to achieve the development plan's objectives for each community. The spatial framework should also be consistent with longer term planning and sustainable development aims, including those set out in the national spatial strategy and any regional planning guidelines in force.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">The Planning and Development Act provides that a development plan must include objectives for the zoning of land for the use, solely or primarily, of particular areas for particular purposes, whether residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural, recreational, as open space or otherwise, or a mixture of those uses, where, and to such extent as, the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, in the opinion of the planning authority, requires the uses to be indicated. It is primarily a matter, therefore, for each planning authority to ensure that these zoning provisions are implemented in a manner that is consistent with the overall strategy contained in the plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">Public confidence in the planning system and the development plan will improve if decisions to zone land are made in an open and transparent manner, are clearly justified on the basis of the needs that have been established and support the aims and strategy of the development plan. My Department is currently preparing detailed guidelines to assist planning authorities on these and many other aspects of the process of making development plans. These will be published in draft form for public consultation shortly. Following consideration of any submissions received during the public consultation process, the guidelines will be issued in their final form as ministerial guidelines under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act. The guidelines will set out in detail how, working within the legislative framework for planning, Ireland can develop a more dynamic, objective and inclusive planning system to structure future development that meets our economic, social and environmental objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">The primary purpose of zoning is to identify the location and quantity of land to be designated for development within the period of the development plan, the uses to which such land may be put and the acceptability, or otherwise, of different classes of land-use within each zone. The 2000 Act does not require that all land within a planning authority's area must be zoned. However, zoning is likely to be most appropriate within urban areas and in areas adjoining urban areas regarding lands which are under pressure for development and lands which are proposed for development or redevelopment.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">Under the provisions of the Planning and Development Act, planning authorities must  ensure that sufficient and suitable land is zoned for residential, or for a mixture of residential and other uses, to meet the requirements of its housing strategy and to ensure that a scarcity of land for residential development does not occur during the period of the plan. In addition, the criteria that need to be taken into account when zoning land for development include the need for such rezoning, the wider policy context, infrastructure issues, physical suitability and the need to adopt what is termed a sequential approach. The amount of land to be zoned for a particular land use must be clearly based on a realistic assessment of requirements based on factors such as projected population levels, economic context, availability of suitable services and infrastructure and expected take-up rates. In considering the amount of land to be zoned, its purpose and its location, regard must be had to the national spatial strategy, regional planning guidelines, the infrastructure plans and programmes of various State and semi-State bodies and any other relevant guidelines and directives.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">Adopting a sequential approach to zoning allows existing and future infrastructure to be utilised to the maximum and promotes the achievement of sustainability. This requires zoning to work from the centre of urban areas outwards, with undeveloped lands closest to the core, and public transport routes being prioritised. New areas to be zoned should be contiguous to existing zoned development lands.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">The Green Party Bill seeks to prioritise the use of State and local authority-owned land over privately-owned land when it is zoned. Under the Bill, the use of privately-owned zoned land has to be deferred until State and local authority-owned land has been developed. This would mean an unco-ordinated development of land, based only on land ownership, not need and certainly not sustainable planning. The sequential approach would be lost.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">Moreover, there is no obvious benefit to this approach. State entities or local authorities do not own enough land – much as we might like them to do so – zoned or otherwise, to ensure an adequate supply of housing, where it is needed, over the years. The timely use of privately-owned land is essential to ensure an adequate supply of land for development. The proposed change by the Green Party would introduce great uncertainty as permission for private developments might have to be refused if suitably-zoned, State-owned land were still available. This disruption would cause problems in the supply of land for development with consequent impacts on the supply and price of housing in particular. I accept that may not be the party's intention. There may be a difference between what has been planned and the effect of the Green Party's Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">Government measures to boost supply – such as investment in infrastructure and the increased residential densities being achieved as a result of the residential guidelines produced by my Department – have been successful in increasing  supply to meet the strong demand for housing. Last year was the eighth successive year of record house completions with 57,695 units completed. This represents an increase in output of 9.7% on 2001 and over 30% increase in the housing output in the Dublin area. There was concern for a long time that while the figures were increasing, they were not going up very much in Dublin. This was not true last year. Ireland built at a rate close to 15 units per 1,000 of population last year, which is the fastest in Europe and a significant achievement. I was at a conference lately at which the European figures were outlined. Our rate of 15 units per 1,000 of population was far ahead of the rate in other member states. Sweden's rate of building is 1.5 units per 1,000 of population. Our rate is enormous when compared with any country of comparable significance.</p>

          <p eId="para_629">The substantial increase in housing supply achieved in recent years has been of critical importance in improving affordability and moderating house price increases. Average year-on-year house price increases have been reduced from a peak of around 40 % per annum in 1998 to 11% in 2002, which is evidence of a more stable and balanced housing market. It remains ahead of the rate of inflation and we can only hope that this year will be better again. An adequate supply of development land is critical to ensuring that this balance continues. The measure proposed by the Green Party would cause great uncertainty in the market for land which would have a negative impact on supply and, ultimately, lead to higher house prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">Under the national partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, a new affordable housing initiative is being developed which will boost the supply of affordable housing. The parties to the pay agreement proposed the new initiative with the objective of increasing the supply of affordable housing by 10,000 units. In response to this proposal, the Government committed to an ambitious scale of delivery of affordable housing through this initiative and arrangements under Part V of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2002. Deputy Crowe made reference to this earlier and to him I say that Part V has not gone. The amended Act passed before Christmas did not abolish it.

The Green Party proposes a reversal of the rule introduced in the 2000 Act whereby land zoned in a development plan could subsequently be rezoned or have its zoning removed altogether. This rule was introduced in 2000 to ensure that, where land was zoned for development, there would be an incentive for the owner of that land to develop it quickly. I am amazed by this proposal. We are trying to get away from the time when developers had their land zoned before sitting on it while the asset's value multiplied. Once land has been zoned, we wish to encourage owners to develop it rather than to sit on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_650">The provision in the 2000 Act was a safeguard for local authorities. Fears were expressed that any attempt to rezone land or remove its zoning would lead to compensation claims against local authorities. The Green Party now proposes to reverse this rule thereby removing the incentive on developers to develop zoned land as quickly as possible while exposing local authorities to possible compensation claims where they try to change the zoning of land in the interest of sustainable development. This is completely unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">The final change proposed would provide that variations of development plans would require approval of two thirds of the elected members of an authority. Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, the rules concerning the adoption  of development plans and variations were amended to ensure that development plans would be kept up to date. As Deputies will be aware, out-of-date development plans had been a major problem prior to the passing of the Act. In particular, a new, simplified and transparent procedure to vary development plans was introduced to allow a local authority, in consultation with its local community, to amend plans to accommodate new needs in their area or changes in the environment such as new Government policies. The Act permits the adaptation of development plans to new or changing circumstances. Raising the requirement for the approval of a variation to a development plan to a vote in favour by two thirds of the members of the authority from a simple majority would make it more difficult to pass proposed variations regardless of their necessity or importance.</p>

          <from>Mr. Andrews</from>
          <p eId="para_666">The intent of the Bill is good but the content is misguided. Unquestionably this country has a problem with high land prices. It has one of the least densely populated land masses in Europe but it has the highest prices for land. Something is clearly amiss. The thinking behind the Bill is right. A few speculators have a huge amount of land and that has to be tackled. The committee on the Constitution is dealing with it, although I have my reservations about that. The Bill, however, is not sufficient and I am not sure that it makes sense in some respects.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">The Kenny report has been referred to widely. It was produced 30 years ago but nothing has happened since then and we must admit that failing. However, that is in the past. The current situation demonstrates that the urgency and details of that report are even more prescient than ever. The report failed to make a distinction between land prices and land values. I am a member of the committee on the Constitution and our problem is that land values will clearly be emasculated in some way, which is fine, but it involves the transfer of wealth and that is where the constitutional difficulty arises.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">I believe there is too much detail on property in the Constitution. I have a copy of the constitution of Finland. It is a new constitution, only three years old, and section 15 deals with private  property. The subject is, quite correctly, dealt with in two sentences. The constitution provides that the property of everybody is protected. Provisions on the expropriation of property for public needs and against full compensation are laid down by legislation. In other words, it requires the parliament of that country to deal with the issue and the constitution gives it free rein to do so. That is the proper way for a national parliament to deal with it. I do not believe our committee on the Constitution should do a great deal more than allow this elected, democratic Chamber to make the rules in relation to the common good and the restriction on private property, to return to the situation of normality from which we departed so drastically.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">With regard to the issues dealt with in the Bill, some of the provisions do not make sense. There are two reasons for saying that. Section 1 encapsulates a reserved function, which is the creation of the development plan, and goes on in the same paragraph to deal with an executive function. It states: ". . .  provided that priority in the subsequent use of these designations of land or property to be zoned should be given. . . ". The person who will give that use is clearly the county manager, not the county councillors. It is a little confusing to incorporate in a single subsection both a reserved function and an executive function. It does not make sense and will inevitably lead to a great deal of confusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">The provision is also not properly framed. It clearly only applies to residential land, not to the other zoning designations in the subsection such as commercial, industrial, agricultural and recreational. What happens in an agricultural area, for example, where publicly owned forestry must be developed as a priority over privately owned agricultural land? Is that something the Green Party intends to bring into law in this Bill or is the party directly focusing on the issue of residential land? If so, that should be reflected in the Bill and not be so broadly drawn as it is in this section. To highlight the problem with the mixture of reserved and executive functions, section 3 contains a reserved function only, in relation to variations. That is fine and makes sense, apart from the two thirds majority which the party suggests will be necessary to have a variation of the development plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">The Bill is well intentioned but it fails to address anything relating to the supply side. It restricts supply by making it more difficult to have a variation in the plan. It restricts the way in which the county councillors can use land, which will inevitably reduce supply. This is not constructive or helpful. The Green Party is bathing itself in piety, as usual, and presenting itself as the party of the conscience of the nation that is trying to expose failures in other parties. That is a fine political imperative, if that is what the party has in mind, but there is little use in doing that by abusing Private Members' time with a pointless Bill that makes no sense. There are  other ways of doing it, if the Members put their minds to it.</p>

This is lost somewhat in the analysis of Part 5 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2002 and that Act should be afforded some time to bed down. For this reason, I oppose the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_685">The Kenny report is 30 years old this year, yet the main issues with which it  grappled continue to face us today, namely, the rapid rise in the price of land for development and the resultant price of housing. The greatest difficulty I have with this report, and had before it was even published, was the fact that well-known people were abusing the system of planning and development for their personal gain at the expense of good planning and development. The two implicit cartels operating in this sector keep the price of land rising and the cost of development rising even higher. Since the publication of that report, little has been done to alleviate the problem. It is time to right the wrongs of the past through the spirit of the Kenny report and the best modern thinking.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">It is timely that we are debating this Private Member's motion against the background of the resignation of Mr. Justice Flood. His work in the tribunal has brought to public attention the murky side of Irish life. On appointment, he was entrusted with finding the truth but he got lies and attempted manipulations of his work. Thankfully, he came through the lies and gave us the truth. The planning process has been damaged by the revelations in Dublin Castle. It has also been damaged by many of the bizarre and ridiculous planning decisions that have impacted on people's homes, neighbourhoods, country and quality of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">We live in a country of sprawling housing estates, many without a single basic amenity, and motorways designed to take traffic from cities that are clogged up by shoppers travelling to shopping centres that should never have been built. People have lost faith in the planning process. With regard to the Bill before us I welcome the fact that the Green Party is attempting to inject a greater degree of accountability into the planning process at local authority level.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">The Bill also goes some way towards helping to bring into being many of the recommendations on private property made in the CORI submission to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. CORI suggests that local authorities should first purchase land voluntarily or compulsorily before rezoning it. Take the example of land being rezoned from agricultural use to development or housing use – this would involve a local authority purchasing the land at agricultural prices, plus a small margin for the owner, rezoning would occur while the land was in local authority ownership and so the windfall gain on the land's value would remain with the local authority. The land would then be sold on to the developing agent.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">At first glance this seems fair, logical and sensible. Land and house prices have escalated to the point where young people cannot afford a home. The State is crippled by a large bill whenever it wants to build anything and local authorities are faced with growing waiting lists for housing to be built on expensive land. The Bill also proposes a two thirds majority on a local authority in order to change the zoning of a piece of land contained in a development plan. This is clearly designed to  end the practice of a Fianna Fáil majority council forcing through an unwise zoning decision and I do not see any problem with that proposal in principle. I am rather unhappy about the piecemeal efforts that have been made to change our planning business. This Bill is welcome, but it is not enough. Increasing the number of councillors needed to vote through a rezoning decision is a blunt instrument. We need new thinking, to which I hope to contribute in future debates.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">I am appalled by the lack of action to address the public disquiet on the issue of planning. Local government, indeed any form of government, cannot survive and prosper without the trust of the people it governs. According to An Taisce, we expect to build many houses over the next ten years, is it 50,000, or 100,000?</p>

When will we have a debate on the spatial strategy in this House?

          <p eId="para_695">A land use commission to take the controversy out of rezoning decisions should be set up. That would ensure that we would get the quality planning decisions which have been lacking over the past few decades. I intend to look at that issue and to publish a land use commission Bill to give effect to such a body. Evidence heard by the Flood tribunal suggests that decisions may have been taken in a corrupt context. In other cases, the High Court has heard evidence that zoning decisions are taken in the interest of landowners and developers, without reference to the public interest which should underline such decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">We should bring forward proposals under which zoning decisions contained in a development plan would not be legally binding until the commission, whose chairman should be appointed by the Government, is satisfied that those developments comply with the relevant planning guidelines, as well as the national spatial strategy, the strategic planning guidelines for Dublin and any other relevant directives that have been made. This does not propose to take away the powers of a local authority or its members. Democracy and accountability of public representatives is crucial to effective, transparent planning but the commission would act as a quality control measure that would once and for all end the accusations regarding corrupt council lors, greedy landowners and ill considered decisions that have plagued the process for decades.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">Such a commission is long overdue and provides for a win-win situation for all. The public wins knowing that the planning decisions are made in its interest. Local authority members win because once corruption is eliminated, faith in them will be restored. Landowners win knowing that any suspicion that they are being "looked after", which is often misplaced, cannot be held in the face of evidence from the land use commission which believes in planning decisions that are good for a region. I am heartened by the fact that, for all the sleaze, accusations and scandal, we are now beginning a rational, sensible debate on planning, which should see a new chapter in Irish planning history being opened. This Private Members' Bill is a welcome addition to that debate, and my party will be supporting it in principle on Second Stage. It needs to be amended, but that can be done if and when it passes this Stage. However, nothing short of a revolution – in the form of a land use commission – is necessary to tackle this country's planning process effectively. I hope that the House will have the chance to debate that revolution soon.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_387">
          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_698">I am glad to have an opportunity to say a few words on this Bill, even though it is during Private Members' time. I have been around long enough, like some other Members, to remember what planning was like in the old days. There have been many references to the Kenny report. There were several other reports relating to development, regional strategy and so on. There were the McKenzie report, the Miles Wright report and the Buchanan report, all back in the 1960s. They related to regional strategy, development and all the things thought about now and about which nothing was done – good, bad or indifferent.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">There is one thing about this Bill which concerns me – and the Minister should listen carefully, for we have been through it before. As I have repeatedly said, the current shortage of land for housing is chronic. One cause was a reaction to some unsavoury things that happened, with the result that everyone decided to oppose the zoning of land. That has meant that one can have no land for houses, playing right into the hands of the developers, who are essentially represented on the other side of the House. A situation could develop now whereby one could give people land for nothing without its affecting the price of houses one iota.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">A classic example is the local authorities. In some cases, they have owned land for the last ten or 15 years. They still own it and could make it available but have not done so, for what reason I do not know. Under present legislation, that land could be released and developed under public private partnerships. I ask the House to contemplate who the beneficiaries would be.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">Of all the issues to strangle this country in the last five or seven years, planning must surely be the worst. There are experts on it everywhere. If I switch on the television or listen to the radio, I hear some expert talking about "bungalow blight", for example. That does not affect cities, of course, but it does affect people – Deputy Harkin spoke about it – in the countryside. People have a right to live there, just as they have a right to live in towns. There has been a tradition of living in the Irish countryside for thousands of years. This country's population once stood at 9 million. At that stage, the bulk of the population lived in the countryside.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">Of course, everyone now wants to control what happens there for his or her benefit. It is what is generally referred to as "the common good". Whose common good? I am not so sure, but some of the things I have seen regarding development in the countryside and the points referred to by Deputy Harkin a few minutes ago enraged me, for it is clear that those who live in the countryside are not entitled to constitutional rights or a future at all. They are not entitled to live in their own place or have a home of their own because so many people have their own selfish interests and want to stop them.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">All the Minister need do is check with the various agencies with whom his Department liaises to ensure that no development may take place except at their behest. One example is An Taisce – we will return to this – a body that is funded by the Minister's Department directly so that it can impede development in the countryside to exclude people who have lived there for generations. It is a disgrace that that should be allowed to happen. The Minister sat looking at it, and his predecessor did the same. Deserving cases have applied for planning permission in the countryside and been deprived. They have been told that they should buy a house in a town development, but no one has told them where they should get the money to do that. Is it a God-given right to tell people who have lived in their own place all their lives how and where they should live?</p>
          <p eId="para_704">There is a serious issue with which the Minister must deal. Regarding planning, it occurs to me that, previously, when an application was made for planning permission, one knew how it would go. If the rules were laid down, they were quite clear. Then they became vague and misty. There were challenges in the courts, appeals and counter appeals. I would like to recount an amazing thing I heard on the radio recently. One of the promises made at the last general election related to St. Brigid's in the Coombe, a school which needed replacement. It was announced that there would be a replacement structure in the very near future – almost before the election. Now the school has found out that the corporation proposes to sell the land in question to a developer.</p>

That was the publicly announced proposal.</p>

          <p eId="para_708">I must tell the Minister of State that it was so. Let us now move a step further to an issue to which I strongly object. There is now a tendency in planning and development to intensify development by introducing high densities to the Irish market, saying that they are better value for money. There is no doubt that they represent significantly better value for the developer. They have to be, for one can get up to four times as many houses onto a site.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">What about the people living there and their quality of life? They must spend the rest of their lives there. Are they not entitled to some recompense for their investment? Surely they must be entitled to something if they propose to live their lives and bring up their children there, sending them to school from there – if there is a school. Surely they are also entitled to some little quality of life. No, they are forgotten.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">I am deeply disappointed in the Minister, for I considered him a thinking, caring man. I now realise that he could not care less, and all his predecessors and colleagues on that side of the House are exactly the same. Housing, which has a corollary in planning, is currently a primary issue, for no one can afford it. In my constituency, an income of €100,000 per annum is required to generate a loan sufficiently large to buy a house. The Minister has ensured that those in the lower half of the income scale have no chance of ever getting a house. Affordable housing will shortly only be affordable for millionaires.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">It reminds me of something I said in this House a year and a half ago. I will finish with this true story. I was walking down the pier in Dún Laoghaire a long time ago – before some of the present Members would have been able to walk there. Someone had inscribed on the wall the words, "Vote Fianna Fáil, the party that made meat a luxury." I thought about that scribe recently. If he was around today he could add, "and they have now made housing an unaffordable luxury as well." It is true.</p>

          <p eId="para_714">Earlier I outlined our concern about the rise of the superpub and that the Bill is doing little or nothing to arrest it. As I speak there are several applications with the planning authorities with which I am familiar seeking permission for enormous pubs which would swamp their immediate neighbourhood and result in the release of hundreds if not thousands of people. That is not an exaggeration. Some of the newer pubs in the centre of Dublin can contain up to 2,000 people. That is not good for peoples' well-being on the streets of Dublin as it leads to a rise in crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">Recently I had occasion to speak with a former constituent as a city councillor on Dublin City Council. He explained the changes in life on Camden Street in the heart of Dublin since the superpubs came on the scene. I come from a party that espouses passivism and non-violence. He described in graphic detail how, early one morning, he caught an individual urinating through the letterbox into his front hall and how he took up the sweeping brush and dealt with the offender in a very violent manner. While I would rarely condone such behaviour, in this instance I can understand it because his quality of life was shattered by the rise of the superpub and by the changes in his neighbourhood arising from the enormous size and scale of pubs. It has not helped him or the Garda in carrying out its duties or any of us in trying to improve the quality of life of our constituents.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">While there are commendable aspects to the Bill, the existing legislation should be enforced prior to introducing new draconian measures to limit the availability of alcohol. The Bill is anti-family, anti-tourism and anti-fun. The existing laws should be enforced prior to the introduction of new legislation. Transferring cases of discrimination from the Equality Tribunal to the District Court will water down the powers of the Equal Status Act. There is a danger that those who are discriminated against will find it difficult to access the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">Banning children from licensed premises discriminates against families and against children and it will place undue restrictions on events such as weddings and family gatherings. Banning dancing during drinking-up time is one of the more ludicrous proposals. With this measure, the Minister, Deputy McDowell, is assuming the character of an old-fashioned parish priest with a blackthorn stick. We challenge the Minister to defend what we believe to be a retrograde proposal. It is possible to make better use of existing legislation. We intend to table substantial amendments on the banning of advertising of alcohol, particularly where there is a link between alcohol and sport, placing health warnings on alcohol products.  Going down the nanny state road is not the right answer to the problem the State faces in regard to alcohol. Better planning regulation is the way forward rather than draconian measures. We want the cartel that controls the licensing industry broken up rather than more restrictions on alcohol.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaddyMcHughIND" eId="spk_395">
          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_718">There are many problem issues associated with intoxicating liquor and the provisions of this Bill will not solve the problems. The solution to the many problems associated with alcohol does not require more legislation but rather the enforcement of the provisions of the legislation already on the Statute Book. The solution to the many problems is to provide the resources to enforce the legislation, to resource the Garda in a manner in which it can operate efficiently, to recruit the extra gardaí promised in the programme for Government. In the name of God, what is the point in introducing more legislation if we do not have the resources to implement the legislation already on the Statute Book? The only reason is to endeavour to create the false impression that something is being done. The bottom line is that existing problems will continue to exist following the enactment of this Bill due to a lack of resources. The reality is that more gardaí visible on the beat is the best means of restoring sanity to this country and to control the limited number of blackguards who spoil it for the rest.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">I wish to refer to some small but welcome elements of the Bill. The prohibition on the supply of alcohol to persons who are obviously drunk is welcome. I cannot understand the mentality of publicans who continue to serve persons who are drunk so that they end up in a stupor. The prohibition on the sale of alcohol at reduced prices is welcome because it can lead to binge drinking, particularly among young people. The reduction in opening hours to 11.30 p.m. on Thursday night is welcome. I come from the west and if the Minister of State would listen I would tell him the west has lost out and is lagging behind the rest of the country to the extent that people cannot afford to be in pubs on a Thursday night until 12.30 a.m. The reality is that the publican is in attendance and perhaps one or two customers boring the hell out of each other to try to pass the night away. That is the reason I welcome the reduction in opening hours to 11.30 p.m. on Thursday nights.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">There are a number of comical elements in the Bill, not least the provision which prohibits those under 18 years of age from being on licensed premises after 9 p.m. even when accompanied by their parents. In defending this provision I have heard the Minister bore us with the same example which I will relate for the benefit of the House. It is clear from his comments that the Minister is introducing this provision only because he cannot find a solution to a very intricate issue of how the Garda will determine whether a person is drinking an orange soft drink or an alcoholic drink with  an orange colour. If the Minister, Deputy McDowell, cannot solve the conundrum of the oranges how will the Garda determine if the under age person is accompanied by a parent, guardian or impostor? Will the parent on the licensed premises have to have proof of parenthood on his or her possession?</p>
          <p eId="para_721">When Deputy McDowell was appointed Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, many thought we would have a tough Minister. I would say to the Minister, if he was present, that there is no point in having a reputation if he does not live up to it. I regret there is nothing in Bill to indicate any streak of toughness and, in fact, it contains very little.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">The real solution to our problems is enforcement of existing legislation, recruitment of the extra gardaí as promised and resource them adequately so they can do the job they are supposed to do.</p>

          <p eId="para_725">I compliment the Minister and the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Dea, who is here tonight, on the manner in which they introduced the legislation. The draft heads of the Bill were first brought to the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. Deputies Costello, Deasy and McGrath, who are here, will testify that it was a constructive discussion. There may have been different views on the legislation but the method by which it was brought forward was a welcome departure from the norm and should form a template or model for the way in which legislation should be treated.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">Some of the ideas which arose during that constructive discussion have been incorporated into the Bill. I welcome that. I specifically welcome the Minister's amendments in regard to extending the time prohibition on young people in licensed premises at night and the introduction of an element in the Bill regarding off-licences, although this provision does not go far enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">I thank and compliment the Commission on Liquor Licensing, the strategic task force on alcohol and all the people involved on those committees – particularly the chairperson Gordon Holmes – for their hard and diligent work over the years in producing the reports which have come before us and which form the basis of this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">When the Minister spoke to us at the pre-legislative stage, he indicated that he intends to introduce codifying legislation next year. This is a welcome commitment. I have dealt with this legislation on many occasions. It goes back to 1833 and there are dozens of Acts to which one may need to refer on any given licensing application. I hope the Minister does not simply intend  to consolidate and amalgamate all the previous legislation but that the new legislation will genuinely codify the flaws apparent in this and existing legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">This Bill has as a background a scenario where alcohol consumption has doubled in the past ten years. We have a major problem with under age drinking, a serious problem with public order and a growing problem with anti-social behaviour, specifically associated with young people drinking. We have a new phenomenon of binge drinking, a proliferation of fast food outlets which, tied to late extensions in drinking times, have led to anti-social and public order problems. Our licensing laws have been liberalised in the past number of years, there is an increase in disposable income, a lack of parental control and there is a more sophisticated drinks industry in terms of advertising. There has also been a suggestion recently in scientific circles – I do not subscribe to it – that as a race we have a genetic predisposition towards alcohol.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">In this context, the legislation is welcome. However, it should not be viewed, as some Opposition Deputies have suggested, in isolation. It is a multi-dimensional, multi-faceted problem. Some Deputies who suggested that this legislation goes no way towards solving the problem fail to realise that this is just a single measure which is part of an overall series of measures on advertising, public order, enforcement, CCTV etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">The vast majority of publicans are diligent and law abiding. They operate in a difficult environment and we should not blame them for many of the problems associated with under age drinking, anti-social behaviour and drunkenness which are a feature of modern life. Neither should we blame the moderate drinkers. As legislators, we have an important input into the debate. We can control the supply of drink. We cannot do much about the demand for drink because it is related to many of the social issues I mentioned earlier. However, we have a duty to deal with the supply issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">The legislation represents a reasonable attempt to combat drunkenness, under age drinking and binge drinking. It shifts the onus to the publicans in various areas, which I welcome. I have no difficulty with the provision regarding ID for 18 to 20 year olds after 9 p.m. There is widespread support for this. If somebody abides by the law and does not engage in excessive drinking, anti-social or drunken behaviour or public order offences, that person should have no difficulty with this provision. I draw an analogy between this provision and the need for a tax clearance certificate. Years ago people felt that the need for a tax clearance certificate was an imposition on the poor taxpayer. Now it is an absolute requirement and nobody bats an eyelid.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">While I welcome the Minister's introduction of a measure of regulation in regard to off-licence premises and public order offences which may take place near them, it does not go nearly far enough. I ask the Minister of State to convey my  thoughts on this to the Minister. Many of the problems of under age drinking, anti-social behaviour and public order offences are directly related to the proliferation of off-licence premises. Deputy Costello shares my views on this. The Minister may not be willing to deal with it in this legislation but he should introduce a comprehensive package of legislative measures to deal with the problems associated with off-licence premises in the codifying legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">The issue of supply is the one element of the problem with which we can deal in this House. Deputy Deasy spoke at length about how we are not dealing with the problem. We might not get it right on this or every occasion but it is our duty as legislators to deal with it. On promotional activities, there is a broad welcome for the abolition of the happy hours, which were an insidious development, in the liquor licensing legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">I welcome the introduction of the concept of closure orders into our intoxicating liquor licensing legislation. I have had experience of dealing with the enforcement of liquor licensing laws. Unfortunately, our legislation has not been enforced in many respects. Closure orders, in terms of flexibility, immediacy and their short-term nature, will have a major role to play in dealing with the enforcement of any new liquor licensing legislation. The Minister should encourage an ongoing monitoring situation in regard to how the legislation is working. The Commission on Liquor Licensing and the task force have a role to play in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">There has been a general welcome for reducing closing time on Thursday nights to 11.30 p.m. It is recognised that people drinking up to 12.30 a.m. on a Thursday are drinking a lot and this makes it difficult for them to function well on a Friday. The situation needs constant monitoring to see how it develops and can be dealt with later if further fine tuning is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">We are all familiar with the night-club industry campaign for special night-club licences. Although this Bill does not deal with it, there is great merit in examining it in greater detail over the coming 18 months, before the codifying legislation is introduced. I have dealt with special exemption orders at District Court level. They are an outmoded concept in that they confer a benefit on night-clubs, where none existed before. The night-club industry is a relatively new phenomenon and we need to have new regulations to deal with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">The legislation recognises that we have a problem. It is a reasonable, if only interim, response until next year. It is part of a multidimensional and multifaceted response, which requires on-going monitoring. I look forward to the full and comprehensive legislation next year.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnCurranFF" eId="spk_399">
          <from>Mr. Curran</from>
          <p eId="para_739">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2003. The main purpose and function of the Bill is to deal with combating drunkenness, under-age drinking and binge drinking. A number of Deputies have  claimed that this Bill will not solve such problems. They are right, a fact of which we are aware on this side of the House. No one is saying this Bill will sort out all those problems. Nevertheless, it is a first step towards addressing the issues. As the Minister has said, it is interim legislation which will be followed up later. The Bill is an appropriate and immediate response to deal with some of the glaring problems which face us on a daily basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">Legislation is only one part of the solution, a raft of which already exists in regard to licensing laws. Enforcement is a key issue. Some sections of this Bill provide for better powers of enforcement for the Garda, particularly in the context of gardaí still being required to enter licensed premises in uniform, which is impractical. Other similar issues are addressed in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">In the context of where we are now, there is no question that the problems of drunkenness and the ensuing violence on our streets have become quite widespread. Although Garda figures may not always reflect this, because much of it is probably unreported, the accident and emergency departments in many hospitals bear witness to what is happening on our streets. Apart from the serious accidents, assaults and violence which occur, a raft of other nuisances result from alcohol abuse which affect neighbours and people out for an enjoyable night. The situation is out of hand in many cities and suburbs and it is appropriate that the problem is dealt with now.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">There is a misconception that these problems are caused solely by the licensing laws and the pub trade. In preparation for this contribution, I reviewed a log of queries in my constituency office this morning. In it I found significantly more queries and complaints regarding people drinking outside as opposed to inside. Those people are drinking in fields and laneways and are causing all sorts of problems. This issue must be dealt with. This Bill makes reference to off-licences, however, we need to take its provisions several steps further. If my constituency office is typical of others, they are receiving complaints day in, day out. Public parks, laneways and shopping centres, which are closed at night, are commonly used by people for drinking.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">Ironically, my local authority has introduced a ban on the consumption of alcohol in public places, which the Garda has enforced to a certain extent. Perhaps the Minister of State and his colleagues will accept that, rather than various local authorities bans, it may be time for a national ban, enshrined in legislation. If that were the case, the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Environment, Heritage and Local Government could promote it and there would be more clarity. At present, the provisions vary from place to place, depending on the level of enforcement by the Garda. We have had a certain amount of success with the ban but it requires considerable effort from the local superintendent in order to police and enforce it.  However, where it has been in effect, it has made a significant difference. Perhaps it is time we examined the issue further in the context of next year's legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">We can have all the legislation we like, but its success is dependent on the role of the Garda and how the force engages with it. One of the problems is that, while we have more gardaí employed in the State than ever before, they are assigned to different task forces and specialist units, which we never had before, such as those investigating lap-dancing, drugs and fraud. The result of all these specialist investigations is that, unfortunately, the number of uniformed gardaí available to any station is not as high as it was traditionally. I have no major problem with that situation because the success of these units, in particular in regard to the seizure of drugs in my constituency, is increasing year on year. However, if we are to address the area of drunkenness and the lawlessness and disorder which come with it, we need a presence of gardaí on the street.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">Although it is perhaps more pertinent to next year's legislation, I suggest to the Minister of State that it is important to bar and night-club owners that the industry is run well and that their areas are well policed and secure. If an area gets a reputation for being dangerous, it affects everyone because people will not go there. Many late night bars and night-clubs use CCTV systems and supply their own security staff. These premises charge an admission fee, therefore, it is not unreasonable that we examine charging them a levy on such admission fees in order to provide additional Garda resources and manpower – a public order unit on the beat. We must address how we can provide more gardaí on the beat at those times of night when there are concentrations of people in villages, towns and city centres at the end of the night.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">The provision in section 15 with regard to the production of ID is long overdue. On my first trip to America, one could not go into a pub without proper ID. This measure is a first step and is to be welcomed. Given that gardaí will be able to enter premises without wearing a uniform, the provision could become really effective. I specifically welcome the fact that the onus of responsibility for dealing with drunkenness has been extended beyond the licence holder to his or her staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">I have a problem with section 14, which prohibits persons under the age of 18 being on a premises after 9 p.m. All my married life, I have enjoyed my summer holidays in Ireland and last year I was in Clifden. Clifden would do no business in the summer without foreign visitors, a feature typical of many other areas in Ireland. Most of the pubs doing any business in the evening at 8 p.m., 9 p.m. and 10 p.m., were those which had a restaurant business. The provision for an after 9 p.m. ban is not a practical cut-off point when one considers the tourism industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">I accept and understand that one may not be comparing like with like, when one considers, say,  a village pub in a suburb of Dublin. I have grave concerns for tourism, particularly in parts of the country which do not have an indigenous population to support all the pubs. The example of Clifden is a good one, which is replicated in Killarney and other places. The pubs have developed in a manner that they are providing significant amounts of food, primarily aimed at the tourism industry. Whether visitors are Irish people or foreigners going on holidays to Clifden or any other part of the country, the 9 p.m. cut-off is a bit too early, particularly in the summer. Perhaps there is a mechanism by which the Minister could be more generous with the time by specifying a summer and winter time. I would appreciate the Minister of State examining this issue, particularly with regard to tourism.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">The Minister of State said that temporary closure orders could be one or seven days. Such temporary closure orders may be a little severe in regard to some of the offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">Much depends on the size and nature of the pub and the nature of the offence. One of my concerns is that the decision is at the discretion of a particular judge. It is not just the licence owner who would be affected. Depending on the nature of the offence, the suppliers to that pub – and I am not talking merely of the breweries, but all other suppliers, including staff and part-time staff – could be affected. Some of the offences, which could be quite minor, could be dealt with in one jurisdiction and incur a one-day closure, while in another jurisdiction they might incur a seven-day closure. For a first offence, that seems quite a harsh penalty. The notion of a seven-day closure seems severe for what might be a minor offence. I am not saying that the law should be broken, but the penalty in this case could be much more severe than the crime warrants.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_753">I am very disappointed with this Bill. I have listened carefully to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell – the real Taoiseach as we call him in the west. I have listened to him on RTE, on the "Pat Kenny Show" and other programmes. I thought that when the legislation came before the House, we would have the answer to all the problems in this country. Even watching him on television on Sunday with Sam Smyth – and I know they are good old buddies – I thought, listening to him, that everything would be okay. I thought that with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, in that Department, we would have no problems. Reading the Deputy's remarks in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> every week, I believed this Bill would be the greatest ever to come before this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">I want to say to the real Taoiseach, Deputy McDowell, that I am bitterly disappointed. If this  is the best he can do, after 14 months, there is only one place for him to go to – from the front benches to the back. He has let society down.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">The only reason the Bill is in the House at all is not because of the Government, or Deputy McDowell or Deputy O'Dea. It is because the people of this country have seen what has happened regarding the changes in the licensing laws over the past number of years. I compliment RTE, which has taken up this issue where the politicians have failed. An RTE programme showed what is actually happening at all hours of the morning. What has been going on for the past number of years has been appalling. People in this country are saying that enough is enough and that they want something done in regard to the drink culture, yet it seems the best we can do is attack young children who are out with their mothers and fathers.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">I come from the west, an area that depends on tourism. I come from a town that will see thousands of visitors over the next few months. Mothers and fathers will go into restaurants and pubs to be told, at nine o'clock at night, that their young children are to be put out on the street while they finish their meal.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_758">That will not help tourism in the west. We have worked hard enough to promote it, by God, and we do not have much trouble attracting people because we are very much family-oriented. The best this Government can do is attack the children. It then passes matters over to the local authority in order that it can pass a resolution to grant an exemption for the great supporters of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party. If Joe Soap and five out of the nine members of the local authority are drinking in the pub, and get a few drinks from the owner, that owner might then inform them that he is planning a jazz festival for the following weekend and could do with an exemption. He explains that the local gardaí are not too friendly and suggests that the authority pass a resolution supporting his application, with the judge taking on board what the publican says.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">Is handing over the licensing laws to the local authorities the best the Minister can do after 14 months in office? In effect, the Minister is saying that the Government cannot deal with planning or housing; that it cannot do the job it is elected to do because of interference from central Government; and is now to decide who will have licences or exemptions. What a super Minister. I was calling him the real Taoiseach a minute ago.</p>

We have a drinking culture that we never saw before. That is because Fianna Fáil wanted to be in favour with the publicans before the last general election. They know they made a mess of it. The Minister must now try to clear up the mess, but he is not doing much about it.</p>

          <p eId="para_769">It is now proposed to send undercover cops into the pubs. We have two of them on the other side of the House and we will send them in under cover. We have no guards, and Deputy O'Dea simply has a part-time job with Independent Newspapers, so he might take on the job, along with Deputy McDowell. We do not have sufficient gardaí on the streets. Deputy Deasy pointed that out a fortnight ago. I myself tabled a number of questions on the matter. Due to sickness, retirement and the cutbacks, we do not have enough gardaí. The Minister has failed to convince his Cabinet colleagues to put up the money for an increased Garda force. More daftness is being spoken about an undercover Garda force in the pubs.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">I ask the Minister why so many public order cases are being thrown out of the courts. Why is this happening, and why is the Minister not asking the Garda Commissioner about it? The Garda is doing its job, yet 56% of the public order cases have been thrown out. Why is that? The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, played a part in this issue. He told the publicans he would take action on the Equality Bill. This matter relates to what happened in my county last weekend.</p>

What will the Minister for Justice, Law and Family Reform do about decent people who are trying to run their businesses?

          <p eId="para_773">The Minister rubbished me a number of months ago when I tabled a Dáil question about ID cards. He told me he could do nothing about it, that it was too complicated. How has he resolved it now within six months? When I asked the question, the matter was supposedly all tied up with European legislation, constitutional rights and everything else. All of a sudden, the Minister has all the answers. He is the best man I know for the spin. We are short of medical doctors, but we are not short of spin doctors, and by God the Minister is good at spin.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">How will the Minister resolve the ID problem? A person of 19 or 20 years of age goes into a pub. The publican is not sure whether that person is over 21 or over 18. If the person says he is not carrying a card and asserts he is more than 18 years old, and is then put out by the publican, will that person then have a case against the publican?</p>

On pubs and clubs, we now see that they have made a submission asking to be allowed stay open until 4 a.m. If they spend enough time lobbying the Minister and the Minister of State, they will probably be allowed to stay open until 8 a.m. That is the way we are heading. We need to look at pubs and clubs in cities. One would sometimes wonder what is the difference or whether there is any. These premises are open in the day as pubs and, when looking for exemptions, they are clubs at night. It is quite simple in rural Ireland, where the pubs are not clubs. I have problems with this law. We have decent honest publicans. The Minister himself acknowledged many times that the Garda does a good job of enforcement in my own county. If some of the gardaí in other counties followed their example, we might not have half the problems. They are doing a good job. Some publicans might not agree with them but I do.</p>

          <p eId="para_779">We are good at introducing laws but not at enforcing them and that is part of the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">Regarding late night drinking, why was the Minister not brave enough on this occasion to demand that all clubs close at the same time? In fact, there should be no such thing as a nightclub in a pub. It should just be a pub. There should be no such thing as pubs opening up to 1 a.m. and beyond with people coming on to the streets at 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. This is happening in every town and is a scandal. I thought on this occasion that the Minister would be brave enough to take this  on, and I would have been the first to support him.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">If a man has cancer, people will sympathise with him, but they have greater sympathy for a drunkard falling up the street. As with penalty points and drink driving, the time has come for people to stand up and be counted. Where people with drink taken misbehave by causing disorder on the streets, we must isolate them as we have done in the case of those with penalty points or convicted drink driving. The time has come when we must stop sympathising with those who drink to excess. We must stand up to these people and say to them that they must take responsibility for themselves. We have too much sympathy for those who drink to excess and for publicans who are a powerful lobby. I know they will not be too happy when they read my speech, but I do not care because I see on a daily basis what drink is doing to homes, families and society. People will cover for drunkards at work but do not have half as much sympathy for those suffering from cancer, for example. There is too much sympathy for those who drink excessively and that must stop.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">The Minister did not go far enough in this proposal. Rather than just cutting back on Thursday night opening, he should have cut back Friday and Saturday night opening as well because what is happening in every town and village is outrageous. I compliment people like Dr. Michael Loftus. Although he would not be a supporter of mine and would be a supporter of the Government, I do not hold that against him because I have always admired him for his courage as a doctor and coroner in speaking out 20 years ago when he first identified the drink problem. He was called every name under the sun because he told the truth and was not afraid to stand up for his convictions. He must be complimented because he was 20 years ahead of his time and we now see the drink crisis he foresaw then. Doctors are sick of what is happening in our hospitals and homes every Friday, Saturday and Sunday night. The Garda Síochána is called out at all hours because of drink-related violence. We in this House are the cause of that because we made a serious mistake a number of years ago and we should be brave enough to admit it.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">It is shameful that the GAA, the FAI and the IRFU depend on drinks companies for money and that the Government will not give them money from the national lottery so they do not need the sponsorship of these drinks companies to keep up and running. The GAA should get rid of the Guinness All-Ireland and should let it be called the "pioneer All-Ireland" next year or something else. The Government should sponsor it if it is serious about tackling the drink culture. It effectively sponsors pubs through the later opening hours. The Minister may laugh, but this is no laughing matter. If the Minister took his duties more seriously and introduced the necessary legislation, we would not have half the problems. If the Government is not serious about tackling the drink problem, it will continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">I know what is wrong. The Government receives so much revenue from licences and duty on drink that it effectively has a conflict of interest. Much revenue is being made but it is being lost through the unnecessary burden on hospitals. The Bill does not go far enough and the Minister has failed the people. They called him Michael the Archangel on the Pat Kenny and Sam Smyth shows but he is Michael the shy man instead.</p>

        <speech by="#TomHayes" eId="spk_424">
          <from>Mr. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_787">I am delighted with the opportunity to say a few words on this important Bill because it is a serious issue for us not only as public representatives but also as parents. Many of us encounter the effects of alcohol abuse through our business and work, hence our interest in the subject.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">I do not understand the need for this new legislation. Gardaí say quite openly that the problems they encounter in fulfilling their duties are some of the reasons they cannot implement the rules and regulations already on the Statute Book. It is time we examined how the Garda operates and works. I had reason to speak to some gardaí who told me the amount of time that they are tied up in Garda stations with administration means they cannot get out on the streets and do the work the Minister pays them to do. We need to examine that in the context of this Bill. They also told me that they need extra resources. I am at a loss as to why that cannot be addressed within current legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">The duty on alcopops was increased in the budget last year. I was amazed that younger people who drink these alcopops were so receptive to the idea of the extra tax being imposed on them. Many of them know that these alcopops cause serious problems, especially for inexperienced drinkers, because they are so easy to drink and so high in alcohol content.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">Many people will remember years ago when cider was high in alcohol content. People would not drink it because it was dangerous, it was known as "lunatic soup", which it probably was at the time. The company, which is based in my constituency, dropped the percentage of alcohol in it and soon the industry was thriving and, as a result, drinking cider is no longer as dangerous as it used to be. We should examine methods or reducing the level of alcohol in the drinks that are causing problems for young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">The culture of binge drinking frightens me. I have been drinking since I was very young, much younger than I like to admit, but I was taught by a person I respected to be able handle my drink.  That idea does not exist any longer. We are not teaching people how to carry their drink and not drink more and more and get carried away.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">Young people should be educated at an earlier age because we live in a society surrounded by drink. People meet in pubs before and after matches. I was in Dublin city centre after the opening ceremony of the Special Olympics on Saturday night and the place was full of young people going in and out of pubs. I went to the match the following day and people, whether they were on their way to or coming from the match, were going into the pub for a drink. It is the same for people who are going to meetings. Tonight most of us will finish up in a pub, be it here in the Dáil bar or a bar somewhere in the city. The truth is that our lives revolve around drink and we are in and out of pubs often.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_795">I am glad that Deputy Hayes followed Deputy Ring because I have experienced the challenge of following him and I am glad to slip in now when the House is quieter. I am also glad to support the Bill and the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">The Minister is damned if he does and damned if he does not. He has been harangued by people who said he must take action and now that he is taking action, he is getting the same treatment. I do not feel sorry for him – he is very capable – and I support him in this. I support him not only as a Member of this House but as a member of the committee on justice, equality, defence and women's rights. I am glad that I was given the opportunity to serve on that committee because it is a tremendous challenge and I am enjoying the work. It is a great experience working with colleagues such as Deputy Costello and others under the chairmanship of Deputy Ardagh.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">When I made my maiden speech it was on the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill. On that occasion I was in favour of the Bill and in contributions since then I have drawn on my experiences from my constituency. I have often mentioned that, as I go about my business in Tallaght, Firhouse, Templeogue and Greenhills, many parents come to me. In the past year they have regularly told me of their unease when their children go out at night and their sense of relief when they hear the front door open and close in the small hours of the morning. In most cases those conversations are underlined with a sense of helplessness, anxiety and anger but everyone agrees that the solutions to the problems caused by the excessive consumption of alcohol are complex and will not be found overnight or through the introduction of new laws in isolation.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">I am regularly told of incidents where the response of gardaí has been slow and where the  punishment meted out in court some months after an incident is too lenient. The court concentrates on the appearance of the defendant who appears, on this one occasion – and it is always just one occasion – to have gone off the rails, blaming the demon drink to avoid responsibility for his or her action.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">We were all adolescents once but I must have led a sad life. Listening to colleagues talking about their experiences, I seem to have missed out because I was not as hard a drinker as was the norm. I am sorry Deputy Ring is not here to hear this but I often think I lost out by not fulfilling the John Wayne image of the hard-drinking Irishman. If I come back a second time I might do things differently. It is, however, important that we be responsible. Four years ago I had a serious illness and the doctors told me at the time that it was good that I had looked after my body by not smoking and not drinking heavily.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">We are all parents and parents must take some responsibility. They must make it known that their children are on their own if they push too far. Many colleagues have spoken about the mayhem in the accident and emergency departments of our hospitals and other problems associated with alcohol abuse and it is vital that we recognise it is not always someone else's child.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">While this Bill fills a gap in legislation before the more comprehensive Bill is introduced in 2004, it will only scratch the surface of the problem unless it and previous legislation is enforced. We hear calls from all sides of the House for more gardaí. A concerted effort by the Garda between 10 p.m. and 3 a.m. under existing legislation on weekend nights would act as a deterrent and as a public demonstration that current levels of drunken behaviour are unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">I receive many representations from groups on the causes of and solutions to the State's growing drink problem. They all recognise that there is a real problem but the experts are unable to agree on a solution. That tells its own story and demonstrates how necessary it is to consider all the representations, although some of them are quite diverse and it is very difficult to reconcile them.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">I have often said that I bring to this House my experience from my constituency. I live in the town with the third largest population in the State yet there are fewer pubs in Tallaght than in many small villages. I do not know if that is good or bad but it is interesting and it demonstrates the culture that exists.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">There was a time when drinking heavily was seen as acceptable and part of Irish culture and tradition. Now, however, it is more serious. I have no problem if people are responsible but now it appears that some people cannot come out of a pub without misbehaving. I am not saying everybody misbehaves but there are many public order problems, of which the Minister is well aware, with people vomiting and causing all sorts of difficulties on main streets, up lanes, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">I have a concern about some of the action the Minister is taking. In trying to clean up the act as  far as pubs, off-licences and late night drinking places are concerned, I hope we do not transfer the problem elsewhere and create more anti-social difficulties in our communities where, to some extent, we have solved the problem of under age drinking in fields, lanes and so on. The situation is not yet perfect but in South Dublin County Council, with the introduction last year of the by-laws, we have gone some way towards solving the problem and addressing some of the difficulties experienced by many people in estates. In dealing with disorder inside and outside licensed premises, it is important that we do not drive the problem underground which will cause difficulties in communities. I ask the Minister to take account of that and listen to what we are saying.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">In that context, and to be unusually parochial, I spoke to the Minister recently—</p>

          <p eId="para_814">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on whose introduction I commend the Minister. Interestingly, the last telephone call I received in my office before I came to the Chamber was from a woman who rang to say she was terrified, on this lovely summer's evening, by the carry on of a gang of youths who are drinking beer around the corner from her house. I suspect that is happening on a widespread basis, not just in this city but throughout the country.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatCarey" eId="spk_437">
          <from>Mr. Carey</from>
          <p eId="para_816">I have no doubt it came from the off-licence and I have a fairly good idea which off-licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">The vast majority of drinkers are very responsible. They do not overdo it and do not binge drink. The vast majority of licensees are equally responsible but, unfortunately, there has been a trend in recent years where, as a result of various societal changes, the consumption of alcohol has spun out of control. For that reason the Minister, and I commend him again for it, has tacked the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">When I was in St. Patrick's College in Drumcondra in 1965-67 there were about 190 late teenage trainee teachers, all but two of whom wore pioneer pins, including myself. Indeed, when all of us went for interview for our various teaching posts, we made sure we wore the pioneer pin. We also wore the fáinne. I have to say that one of the two consumers of alcohol in St. Patrick's at the time is a Member of the other House. I did not drink until I was 21 years of age, not because I did not want to but I could not afford it. That has changed and that is one of the reasons the Minister is taking this action.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">The reality now is that alcohol is one of the drugs of choice. Enormous work has been done in the area of dealing with what might be called hard and soft drugs in setting up drugs task forces in areas where there is serious abuse of drugs, but I wish we could convince the powers that be that we should include alcohol in the target to try to ensure we encourage moderation. I have also seen the positive work being done by the No Name Clubs. I remember Eddie Kerr coming to Finglas many years ago to set up the first one in the Dublin area, which is still flourishing. Regrettably, there are few of them still in existence.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">We have a problem with enforcement; there is no point pretending otherwise. What the Minister is doing is, by and large, strengthening the hand of the enforcers to ensure there is a higher level of compliance. I cannot understand why only 47 out of the 440 cases taken for breaches of the law in regard to serving under age people in pubs come from the Dublin area. Some of the members of the Law Library are extremely ingenious in the way they have been able to exploit what are undoubtedly loopholes in the law. A licensee in my own area was brought to court and because of some particular loophole in the way the summons was served or whatever, he was fined the princely sum of €100. He would make that money in 15 minutes or half an hour in the pub.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">I strongly support the temporary closure issue. No stronger signal can be delivered to a licensee than to have the pub, hotel or whatever closed for either a minimum or a maximum number of days. I would not shirk from fairly severe penalties, and the maximum of 30 days is quite severe. I also support the idea of a prominent notice being posted on the door of the premises. That will send out the message that the licensee better beware or will be taken to court.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">Bringing back the Thursday closing time to 11.30 p.m. is a good idea but there are practical problems with that, including industrial relations problems. I do not always agree – in fact, I never agree – with the vintners on the points they make but real difficulties will arise in trying to encourage bar staff to take what will probably be a lesser wage if they are working shorter hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">Unlike Deputy Deasy – I am not sure whether Deputy Ring is for or against it – I strongly favour the advisory role of local authorities in relation to extensions, etc. I am sure Deputy Costello will remember that this originated in the crime committee of Dublin City Council a number of years ago when the committee was chaired by a colleague of Deputy Costello's, Alderman Michael Conaghan. We pursued that issue at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">Throughout the country, but certainly in Dublin, we have enormous problems with nuisances being created by pubs which stay open late at night. Enforcement is not adequate. Shutters are being pulled down and rattled at all hours of the night, together with all the associated loud behaviour. The local authorities should take their own responsibility. We cannot, as the Minister said, shirk our responsibilities. God knows we have shirked them enough as members of local authorities. We should not shirk them in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">Section 13 relates to off-licences. I support the strongest measures the Minister can introduce to compel off-licences to abide by the law and label trays of cans or whatever, regardless of whether it is awkward. We can label everything else. If we buy a can of sardines, the label of the particular supermarket will be on it. I cannot understand why off-licences cannot label bottles and cans.</p>

          <from>Mr. Carey</from>
          <p eId="para_827">It can be done. One of the suggestions made to us at the time was that the plastic bags from the off-licences would be labelled, although they are now producing paper bags, and good luck to them. I welcome that, but why can we not introduce a provision that the wrappers would at least carry the logo of the off-licence?</p>
          <p eId="para_828">I wish to raise an issue not covered by the Bill, which needs to be addressed through education. It is sinister when young people under the ages of 18 or 15 years can place an order for alcoholic drinks by telephone with their local off-licence using a credit card and have trays of them delivered to their homes by local taxi or hackney companies to be consumed to their hearts content, with or without their parents' consent. This happens. I am aware that the Bill provides that young people will be entitled, in certain circumstances, to consume alcohol with their parents' consent.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">I have a difficulty concerning the restriction on young people being present on licensed premises after 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. How will this be policed? I would favour the measure if it were possible, but I am not sure it will be. Although the Minister  and I differ on the issue of identification cards, I support his proposal to make the carrying of identification mandatory. The age card, which we strongly promoted in Finglas, is easily copied, as are, unfortunately, passports, driving licences and other documents. The Minister and I agree to differ on the introduction of a national identification card system, which I strongly support. It would be possible to strike a balance between protecting civil liberties and introducing a card containing information largely in the public domain.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">I also strongly support giving licensees the freedom to set an age threshold for the sale of alcohol above the current level of 18 years. Certain off-licence operators ran into trouble for doing this. I also support the restriction on happy hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">On my way to the Houses this morning, I noticed a large hoarding advertising a particular stimulant drug, not an alcoholic one, which promotes an association between consumption of the product and inspiration, imagination and flight. We all know the drink in question is not consumed on its own, but is mixed with shorts, which brings us to the issue of education. I suspect that in codifying the laws the Minister and his colleagues in the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science will probably address this issue. We have a serious problem of young people and not so young people not being able to control consumption of alcohol. I welcome the measures being introduced in the Bill to strengthen current laws and hope they will be enforced this time.</p>

          <p eId="para_832">I wish to share time with Deputy Connaughton.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">I am delighted to speak on the Bill. As a licensee, it is important that I declare my interests. We have heard the Minister speaking on the licensing laws virtually every week since he took office. In one sense, the measures in the Bill are too little, too late. I am aware of the difficulties of running a licensed premises and a supermarket off-licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">Crime doubled in the period from 2000 to 2002. This Bill codifies previous legislation. It is a pity the Minister did not spend more time on the legislation and produce a defining Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">When Deputy Deasy published the Fine Gael Party's ten point plan, the Minister indicated it could have been issued on the back of a beer mat. Now we find that many of its ideas have been incorporated in the Bill. While I am not active as a publican, I am aware of the difficulties they encounter. We have a special, confined restaurant licence. When introduced in 1998, these licences were a fantastic concept, as they allowed alcohol to be sold with food which created significant benefits in terms of the development of tourism.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">I foresee difficulties arising from the provisions on identification. If a person on a licensed premises claims to be 22 years old, he or she has no obligation to produce identification. What happens if people from Northern Ireland or the United Kingdom, which do not have an obli gation to carry identification, enter a pub here? Difficulties will arise when people coming here for international sporting events are asked in a Jury's hotel or elsewhere to produce identification.</p>

          <p eId="para_838">We continually refer to Ireland as a tourism destination and we have a no frills airline which brings many visitors to Dublin and elsewhere. Small family businesses, which began as acorns and were nurtured by their owners through hard work, form the backbone of the economy. Regulation is needed. However, it is unfair to associate publicans, as a group, with breaches of the law. They work tirelessly, often 40 hours on a weekend not during a whole week – there is a hell of a difference. There are definitely difficulties in Dublin and other large urban areas in terms of breaking the law. However, if one was to enter a licensed premises in the west on a Thursday night – Deputy Costello will verify this – one would not find a cricket in them as they are only busy during weekends.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">If a publican asks a person his or her age and the person replies that he or she is 22 years, there is no obligation to produce a permit. This is one of the issues—</p>

          <from>Mr. Perry</from>
          <p eId="para_841">As a barrister, will the Minister explain how a publican can act as judge and jury? On a busy night, for example, one must hire additional staff. There are major difficulties in the trade in finding competent staff. Frequently, the licensee is not working on the premises, but will have nominated a bar manager who may not know the clientele of the pub in question. How will the Bill be enforced? I ask the Minister to examine the difficulties which will arise with regard to people from the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">Some months ago, the Minister stated we needed café-style pubs and told us he was considering the possibility of introducing a new form of licence to facilitate them, but they are not mentioned in the Bill, nor is there any reference to imposing restrictions on superpubs which feature big screen televisions, loud music and low lights. I am amazed the Minister did not address this type of pub in the legislation. Perhaps he intends to return to the issue. Many of us were amused by the notion of café-style pubs, given that the difficulty in most towns and villages in the west is that there are too many pubs. The introduction of significant changes to our dated licensing laws is of fundamental importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">Most pubs, hotels and restaurants rely primarily on food and pubs which depend solely on alcohol have little chance of survival in the current climate. The growth of tourism here is strongly  linked to food and the new options available, from T-bone steaks to <i>à la carte, </i>which have attracted families. As Deputy Ring pointed out, hotels in Westport are family orientated.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">We are a tourism destination, which will make enforcement of the legislation difficult. Will members of the Garda Síochána be given authority to police the regulations and, if so, how will they go about it? Since I entered the House in 1997, we have had major debates on the enforcement of previous legislation in this area. Does the Minister envisage members of the Garda Síochána entering a hotel at 9.10 p.m. and asking people their age? This is the difficulty with the legislation. As a previous speaker stated, there were 47 cases of breaches of the licensing laws in the greater Dublin area. The Bill places an obligation on off-licences to put labels on cans. That will not work. Every off-licence in the country uses scanners.</p>

This Bill seeks that labels specifying source of origin be put on drinks containers so that they can be traced back to the vendor. I guarantee that this will not work. Each off-licence cannot put its name on cans of Budweiser or bottles of scotch to identify where they were bought.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">Section 2 deals with the definition of a bar. The explanatory memorandum states:</p>
          <p eId="para_850">The definition of a bar is the similar to that in the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 1988. The definition is important because a distinction is made in sections of the Bill between licensed premises and the bar of licensed premises. Admission to the bar may be prohibited but access to other parts of the premises is not affected, e.g. function room.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">This is a total contradiction. A hotel function room could contain a bar that is a couple of hundred metres in length. Is the Minister saying people could leave the bar, walk into the function room and be served?</p>

          <p eId="para_866">What the Minister did not know was that certain elements in the media decided to rubbish him for the same thing – what comes around goes around.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">I have no problem with the principle behind this Bill. There are aspects of it that should have been included in legislation a long time ago. Whether it is possible to enforce the legislation is another matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">There is no doubt that the country is submerged under alcohol. Through binge drinking etc., the problem is almost out of control in some areas. Everyone knows this; it is not news. The question of when a person is drunk in the eyes of the law has been raised. While the Minister is more of a professional in this area than me, I do not know from where the person who has to tell a court an individual was drunk will get their instructions to prove it to the court. Time will tell if I am right or wrong. It will be extraordinarily difficult to prove this.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">I have no problem with many of the matters in this Bill. Having reduced the opening hours by an hour on Thursday, I would have thought the Minister would have followed it up and done the same throughout the weekend. Whether this is practical will be seen in what the Minister does <i>vis-à-vis</i> discos and late closing. If one wanted to  create a battleground where the Garda cannot win, one would create it with 500 or 600 young people coming on to the streets at 4 a.m. Many of them are inebriated to the degree that they have false courage. Two gardaí in the village squad car cannot be expected to maintain law and order.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">This Bill falls short of the total legislation I would like to see being introduced. Why did the Minister not start at the other end? There is no doubt that the vintners, particularly those in rural areas, will be cranky about this. Deputy Perry referred to villages and towns where one would not see a sinner on a Thursday night. If all the stakeholders saw that their empires were all being impinged on to some degree, people would be more inclined to accept it as an all-in solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">The Minister should start at the beginning. I can see no reason in the world why any disco or pub would close its doors as late at 3 a.m. This is happening all over the place. I cannot see any reason why this cannot be brought back by an hour or an hour and a half, without being a spoilsport. If this were done, ordinary publicans could see that there would be no great disadvantage to them when they are expected to close earlier. I have received much material from various lobby groups. The computers are whirring and e-mails are being sent all over the place. This Bill only allows another wedge to develop. The Minister did not deal with the issue in its totality. There will be much unnecessary unease for some of the stakeholders caught up in this.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">I hope that this will become part of the Bill when it comes to be codified. If it is not, I do not think the Bill will work.</p>

          <from>Mr. Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_876">As a society, we must ask what we will do about the alternatives to drink. I have been a Pioneer all my life. There are a couple of thousand Pioneers in this country and that is good for people who want to do that but in the modern day it is not for everyone and certainly not, it seems, for young people. The No Name Club, with which I and most other people here have certain connections, is a movement that is flourishing in the part of the world from which I come. It is not the solution to the problem and will not prevent binge drinking and public order offences, but it will help. There is no other organisation at youth level that is likely to deliver a reasonable degree of good sense, level headedness and so on than the No Name Club. It has connections with the Garda Síochána, local community leaders and parents. Most importantly, the cohort of young people involved in it are at an age, 15 or 16 years, when if they can be persuaded to delay drinking for another year or two  they will, as many of my colleagues here have said, have a more mature approach to drink. The No Name Club currently gets a small amount of Exchequer funding. I hope the Minister, as a member of the Cabinet, will do something about that if he gets the chance.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">I have serious misgivings about whether this legislation can be policed on the ground without a significant increase in Garda numbers which does not seem to be happening. I hope we will get to that stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">Something which has not been mentioned – perhaps people are afraid it would be unpopular – is that, whether we like it or not, there will have to be an element of parental control and responsibility in this business. It is too easy to blame the Minister, the Garda, publicans and everyone else, but if Irish society has broken down to the extent that fathers and mothers are either unaware or do not care where their 12, 13 and 14 year old sons and daughters are at 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning, we have a problem on our hands. I would advocate that parents should be held responsible to some extent for the wrongdoing committed by young people. An 11, 12 or 13 year old cannot be held to be totally to blame. Parents or guardians must accept some responsibility for where they are. It may not be a popular thing to say, but it is a fact and that is what should happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">I hope it will be possible to police this. If the Minister thinks this will solve the problem he is in cloud cuckoo land. What matters is how this is implemented and we will have much more to say about it on Committee Stage.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BarryAndrewsFF" eId="spk_466">
          <from>Mr. Andrews</from>
          <p eId="para_880">I propose to share my time with Deputy Ellis.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">Deputy Connaughton is right about the culture of complaint in society in modern times. Expectations have risen. People's expectations of the State are much greater than in previous times and, unfortunately, the spirit of providing for oneself is somewhat blunted. Under this heading, parents could do much more.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">Ireland has a tradition of drinking, and a world-wide reputation for drinking to excess and binge drinking. As Deputies know from trips overseas, there is an Irish bar in almost every city in Europe, the USA, Australia and other places. For millions of people their first point of access with Ireland is the Irish bar. In the 19th century cartoons in <i>Punch</i> magazine depicted the Irish as hard drinking, and there is a historical reality to that. Historically in this country there was only one moral authority, the Catholic Church. The system of land ownership meant men married late in life. Therefore, frustrated men were allowed a certain amount of leeway in terms of alcohol abuse, gambling and so on. That is how alcohol abuse developed historically as a problem and remains a problem today. A blind eye was turned to what would be a moral infraction in other countries because it did not interfere with society in the same way as anything to do with the sexual  morality might have done in the 19th century, and that legacy has survived to this day and is an historical reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">In more prosperous times people have more money and there is much more drinking at a much younger age. It is time we dealt seriously with it in this House. The legislation currently before the Dáil is simply one section of a raft of legislation and reform that is necessary to change people's attitudes and culture. There is nothing else to do here other than get drunk, apart from sport. Drinking is one of the few outlets for young people today. Unless we are serious about dealing with that, we will suffer in the future. This legislation is evidence of the Government's commitment in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">There has been some criticism to the effect that there is plenty of legislation already and if it were enforced we would not have to bother introducing new legislation. I welcome this legislation and the legislation promised next year because it gives a very clear codification of licensing law and leaves no room for confusion among licence holders and people entering premises. That clarification and transparency will bring a greater degree of compliance and that is a welcome development.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">Another criticism relates to the Equal Status Act. Alcohol is one subject that gets people's interest. If one wants to have a good debate, talk about boozing and alcohol abuse. When the Equal Status Act was passed in 2000 the only section of it that was debated with any kind of enthusiasm was the part that dealt with Travellers and their exclusion from public houses. Similarly, this Bill has sparked a significant amount of lobbying from interested parties, more so than any other legislation. The Equal Status Act dealt with other issues, such as access to education and real estate. None of these issues sparked anybody's interest. It is a fact of Irish life that when it comes to alcohol everybody has an opinion because it touches on almost everybody's lives. Drinking is perhaps the only social outlet, the only thing for people to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">The criticism of section 19 concerning the Equal Status Bill is misplaced. I agree, however, that the Equality Authority needs to be funded properly. I welcome the fact that in the District Court a successful respondent can pursue an unsuccessful litigant for costs. That is right and proper, and it is a normal mechanism in the justice system. However, the Equality Authority needs to be properly funded so that genuine cases will not be debarred from being brought in the District Court by reason only of somebody's lack of finance. Deputies should also be aware that the vast majority of claims that are brought to the Equality Authority involve sums which come under the jurisdiction of the Small Claims Court where there is no cost implication. It deals with cases involving damages of less than €1,300. The Equality Authority's report for last year refers to this.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">Equality officers have no formal legal training, yet in many cases the Equality Tribunal will hear submissions from barristers and solicitors and it is difficult for an equality officer to deal with such adversarial encounters. In view of this, it is appropriate that the District Court hears these cases, especially given that 45% of tribunal cases involve Travellers and access to pubs. It is better if they are heard in the District Court, provided that the Equality Authority is properly funded. Most claims will end up in the Small Claims Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">The Bill is one part of a major governmental approach to the problems in this area. There has been a cultural change in the country with regard to smoking. As an erratic smoker, I feel somewhat like a pariah in so many parts of a society. It is not only that it is impossible to smoke in public places and buildings, but the absence of cigarette advertising impacts on society. In view of this, the Minister should consider, and be brave enough to deal with, the question of the advertising of alcohol on television and in sport. It is not appropriate. If we want a cultural change in the country, we must create a sense of the unacceptability of drink, especially among young people who are most involved in sport and probably have the kind of disposable income for which brewers and distillers constantly compete.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">There is some merit in the doubts that have been expressed about the legislative provisions concerning hotels. The Minister should exercise some flexibility on this aspect as they will probably be difficult to operate. There is no use in creating a law that cannot be enforced; it makes a mockery of the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">I am interested to see what will happen with the use local authorities will make of their right to pass resolutions. Scepticism has been expressed about this, but I believe it will work. I do not consider councillors will pass resolutions unless they are totally satisfied with the security arrangements for major events that should attract special exemption orders. They will not want to see headlines about public disorder, criminal damage or any kind of destruction of property on foot of a motion or resolution sponsored by them and in view of this, they will not pass them lightly.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">The provisions regarding people aged between 18 and 21 years are acceptable. In other countries there are prohibitions on drinking, for example, in the United States people under the age of 21 years cannot enter a licensed premises. It is a step in the right direction and part of what will necessarily be a cultural change if this problem is to be properly addressed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnEllis" eId="spk_467">
          <from>Mr. Ellis</from>
          <p eId="para_892">The Bill is probably only part of an overall restructuring of the licensing laws covering the pub trade. It must be accepted that in the past ten to 20 years, the licensed trade has changed considerably. Small family owned pubs in rural Ireland have become super-pubs in the major towns, the disco scene has replaced the  dance hall and there has been a total change in the culture of drink and the amount consumed. For example, most social occasions are now centred on, or associated with, drink. The situation needs to be addressed but how this can be done in the context of modern Ireland will require much deliberation.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">The Bill imposes many responsibilities on publicans, including responsibility for ascertaining the age of those they serve, monitoring the amount of alcohol consumed by their patrons and the question of dealing with them. These are serious issues. For example, the age problem is a major cause of concern. A person may look as if he or she is 18 years of age when he or she is 24. The reverse is also the case where somebody who looks 23 or 24 years of age may be only 17 years. This creates major problems in terms of age identification. It may be necessary to consider imposing a mandatory requirement on all customers to carry age identification rather than singling out those under the age of 21 years, which is discriminatory. Either one is an adult at 18 years of age or one is not. If one is an adult, one should not be treated differently to those who are over 21 years of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">Publicans also face problems around what one publican described to me as "foreign cargo". This arises where a customer enters a premises reasonably intoxicated and is served perhaps only one drink. However, ten minutes later the publican may find the customer lying on the pavement outside the pub for an unknown reason, yet he will take the rap because his premises were the last attended by the customer. This provision will make it very difficult for publicans to operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">Publicans will also face problems with the provisions dealing with the presence of under age people in their pubs and parents taking children into pubs. In many instances, pubs are not the ideal location for young children, but will these provisions mean they will be left at home? For example, will parents go to the pub leaving a 13 year old minding the rest of the family? That is not unheard of. In some cases, because of the lack of parental control, parents do not know the whereabouts of their 12, 13, 14 or 15 year olds and if they ask, they will not be told the truth. This is regrettable, but is probably an aspect of modern society because in many cases, both parents must work to have the lifestyle to which they aspire. The net result is that in some cases the children can be of secondary importance. It is sad but it happens, and it is a serious problem. While something should be done to address the problem of young children in pubs late at night, as this is totally wrong, I also see the other side of the equation. It is possible that more serious problems will arise where older children are unaccounted for by their parents for long periods at night-time.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">Education on alcohol needs to be urgently addressed. It is time that second level schools started to explain to students the problems that can be caused by binge and other forms of drink ing. It is a serious issue. If young people were properly educated on the dangers of alcohol and the problems it can cause in later life, we might see a response similar to the change in attitude to smoking among certain sections of society. It now appears that girls smoke more than boys. Similarly, it appears that, regrettably, girls are inclined to drink more than their male counterparts at a certain stage. The net result of this is the need for a major campaign of education on alcohol in second level schools. Not to do so will lead to many future social problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">On the last occasion legislation was introduced to extend opening hours, I expressed reservations. Late night drinking has become a result of the previous changes. Enforcement is a problem for the Garda. I understand the inability of the Garda to enforce the law in this area, especially where one or two gardaí enter a pub with 200 or 300 customers. They will not be given a great reception, especially if everyone is half or three quarters full of alcohol. Such a scenario is very hard on gardaí and I do not know what support they would need. It is impossible for small numbers of gardaí to enforce fully the present laws on pub closing hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">The input of local authorities into this Bill is welcomed by all of us. It gives people the opportunity to decide what will happen in their local area and it is a chance for councillors to take part in decisions with regard to exemptions and opening hours rather than to blame everybody else. I would not like to see circumstances arise such as those which obtained in my younger days whereby in one diocese there were midnight dances, 1 o'clock dances in the next and 2 o'clock dances in another. Local authority members will be in a position to decide what should happen in their own area within reason, but I hope we do not end up with major variations from town to town. That would not be in the best interests of the licensed trade.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">The changes on equality law are to be welcomed. The law has been abused in some cases which is something the new provisions will prevent. People who have seen publicans as soft touches will, hopefully, no longer do so. The problem of publicans trying to run their own premises were highlighted recently in Swinford. They may be overrun by people to whom they may want to serve one drink, but who take over the place subsequently. Publicans must be protected against such incidents, but they have been afraid because of the equality legislation to exclude people in some cases. I do not say that everybody should be excluded or that all Travellers enter pubs to wreck them. Travellers have the right to be treated in the same way as everybody else, but they do not have the right to wreck a premises without facing the same consequences other members of society would face if they were to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">The penalties in this Bill are slightly harsh in respect of first offences with regard to which courts should have complete discretion. Anyone  can understand the imposition of a mandatory closure for a second offence within a certain period. Penalty points on driving licences are lost after a certain period of time and this should also be the case in terms of publicans. A first conviction should disappear after a prescribed time limit. Such a provision would be important in terms of allowing people to make the right decision at the right time and to cover up for a person who may accidentally find they have been off side. If discretion were not left to the courts, a person could find their premises and their reputation damaged for something which might not even be their fault.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">We all welcome this Bill while hoping that future legislation will deal with every aspect of anti-social behaviour late at night. It must also deal with the problems of chippers and other late night venues frequented by young people.</p>

          <p eId="para_906">He is probably in the bar. He would not come to the House when an important matter was raised on the Adjournment by Deputy Allen. The Minister was afraid to come before the House to say what was happening. If every Minister carried on the way Deputy McDowell does, with his laughing and smirking, this country would be in a very poor state. I hope the Minister is listening to this, wherever he is, and that he will not come back here tomorrow and behave in the same way. The legislation before the House is very important. If the Minister went out on to the streets of Dublin tonight and looked at the drunkenness and anti-social behaviour there, he might get serious. Fights are breaking out while ambulances and gardaí pick up young people off the streets.</p>
          <p eId="para_907">When I first examined this Bill, which the Minister thinks is the be all and end all, I noted that it was mainly concerned with the combating of drunkenness and disorderly conduct and was designed to address the problems of under age and binge drinking. The Bill declares that it contains a package of urgent reforms intended to improve compliance with enforcement and the intoxicating liquor code. Other reforms recommended by the Commission on Liquor Licensing,  including far reaching structural reform of the licensing system, will be addressed in the codification of the entire liquor licensing code which has already been announced. We are told that preparatory work to codify licensing laws has already commenced as it is intended that a codification Bill will be available by mid-2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">The Minister is on record as saying there is a crisis in under age drinking and binge drinking while parents do not even know where their young people are at night. While this crisis continues, all the Minister can do is take petty decisions. He is afraid to take the tough decisions necessary to stop the fighting, the drugs, the under age drinking, the public order offences and the anti-social behaviour. All he can do is provide councillors with the power to set opening hours. I have never seen such ludicrous proposals. I live in Wexford where Enniscorthy Town Council could say that Kavanagh House should close at midnight, Wexford Borough Council could say Mooney's Lounge need not close until 1 a.m. and New Ross Town Council could permit a pub in its jurisdiction to stay open until 1.30 a.m. I could travel from Enniscorthy to Wexford to New Ross, perhaps also crossing to Waterford where the pubs may not close until 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. While this Minister is giving powers to county councillors, another Minister is trying to take powers away from them by removing Members of the Oireachtas from local authorities altogether. I do not know where this Government is headed, nor does it seem to know itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">Deputy Ring spoke earlier about spin, which is what the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is about. The Minister is afraid to make the tough decisions. Those decisions relate to the streets and if the Minister went out to them, he would know that binge drinking is occurring. Deputy Hayes spoke about the Garda, of which an uncle of mine is a member. The stories he has to tell me are absolutely frightening. He has been called out at 2 a.m. in Dublin to attend to a 14 year old child who was laid flat on his back because he had been able to obtain plenty of beer in an off-licence without any problem. The child was able to sit on the street and drink. The Minister says we will put labels on alcohol. If a bottle of vodka purchased at an off-licence is drunk in a park by an under age drinker and left behind, the off-licence can be prosecuted for selling it. This Minister has lost the plot completely. He is afraid to take the tough decisions required to stop under age drinking and fighting on the streets.</p>

          <from>Mr. Callanan</from>
          <p eId="para_910">I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to respond to my request  for better facilities for St. Cuan's College, Castleblakeney, County Galway. The complete improvements, which cost £650,000 at the time, were sanctioned in October 2001. The architects divided the project into two phases. One of these, which includes the provision of a new roof, is complete and a fine job was done.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">The next phase is to provide six classrooms and relocate the woodwork and science rooms into another part of the school, as these prefabricated classrooms will not be suitable as science and woodwork rooms. The relocated rooms for science and woodwork will have to be fully equipped both electronically and mechanically. An agreement has been entered into to facilitate this. Planning permission was secured over one year ago and, from a safety point of view, these works are necessary. At present, students are crossing a busy road to get into the science and woodwork rooms and these rooms are already in poor shape.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">This school has between 210 and 220 students. This year it will enrol two children with disabilities so the facilities being requested will be badly needed. It is an excellent school and produces great results. The tenders for this work are with the Department of Education and Science since January this year. I call on the Minister to give the go-ahead to these tenders in order that work can start straight away.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</from>
          <p eId="para_913">I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline the position regarding St. Cuan's College, Castleblakeney, County Galway. This school is located three miles from Mountbellew, County Galway, and shares the catchment area with Holy Rosary College and Mountbellew vocational school. It is a relatively small school by today's standards with a current mixed enrolment of 199 pupils, 101 girls and 98 boys. Notwithstanding the enrolment level, St. Cuan's ruled out an amalgamation with other schools in the area in 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">The school currently operates on a split campus basis. Its buildings are separated by a road which students cross a number of times each day. The extra classrooms are required to consolidate the school on one campus. Effectively, this will allow the school to vacate a deteriorating 1960s pre-cast concrete building in favour of high quality temporary accommodation on the site of the newer school building. In July 2002, the Department made a significant investment of almost €175,000 to carry out re-roofing works on the newer building at the school to facilitate this development.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">The extra classroom accommodation under consideration comprises six prefabricated structures. A tender report in this regard was originally submitted by the school authorities in February 2003. However, the report was incomplete and it was necessary for the school authority to instruct its consultant to prepare an additional submission to the Department to deal with a number of omissions. The outstanding infor mation was subsequently submitted by the school authority and is currently being examined by staff in the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">The report comprises details for a single storey, semi-permanent, six classroom building with a total floor area of 459 square metres for which the school authority has planning permission and a fire safety certificate. The examination of the report is nearing completion in the Department and the outcome will be conveyed to the school authority as soon as possible.</p>

          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_917">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this harrowing case which concerns a family in my constituency that I have known for many years. The parents are now elderly and have a 29 year old son who has got himself into trouble through no fault of his own but because of an injury he sustained from a hiding he received on the so-called safe streets of this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">I will quote from a report in <i>The Star</i> of 27 June 2002. I visited the family some weeks earlier:</p>
          <p eId="para_919">A seriously brain-injured man declared unfit for prison after being convicted of robbery has finally been given accommodation at a mental care hospital – after waiting more than seven months. A judge yesterday imposed a three-year suspended sentence after hearing that a place was finally available for Peter Sheridan (29), of New Street, Dublin. He had been convicted on one count of robbery in 1999. It was the eighth hearing of the case before Judge Frank O'Donnell – who had refused on every previous occasion to send Sheridan to jail. He had deferred sentence until an appropriate care facility could be found – and had remanded Sheridan in the care of his family three times. "I simply cannot bring myself to jail this man," he said.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">After much search and inquiry, a place was found and the court was told that it would be available in April of the following year to cater for him. The centre where suitable therapeutic treatment could be made available for Mr. Peter Sheridan was in St. Doolagh's Park, Malahide Road, Balgriffin. However, the operator of the facility, Ms Margaret Rooney, received correspondence on 27 May this year which stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_921">I wish to inform you that the South-Western Area Health Board has not been allocated any monies to fund such a placement to offer to Mr. Peter Sheridan a programme at St. Doolagh's Park. However, Mr. Sheridan's case, along with a number of other cases, has been brought to the attention of the Eastern Regional Health Authority with a request that he be considered a priority for any funding which may become available. I regret that my response cannot be more positive at this time and thank you for your interest in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">An elderly couple in their 70s are now prisoners in their home. The physical damage done to this man who, by his parents' own admission is no angel, is such that he cannot be left alone. I have met him and spoken to him. He is a danger to himself and, frankly, a horror to live with. The lives of these elderly people have become intolerable. The cost of bringing this misery to an end is the price tag of the Taoiseach's make-up each year. That is what this country has been reduced to. The cosmetic requirements of the Taoiseach are more important than providing the type of therapeutic treatment and residential care Mr. Sheridan desperately needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">The judge refused to send him to prison on eight occasions because the man is not a criminal; he is just sick and needs treatment. That treatment can be provided if the Minister will make the resources available.</p>

        <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_480">
          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_928">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Ceann Comhairle for allowing this matter to be raised on the Adjournment this evening. Partnership Tralee is one of the 38 area-based partnership companies delivering the local development social inclusion programme. The focus of this programme is to work with, and on behalf of, individuals and communities experiencing exclusion and disadvantage. Tralee and its hinterland form an unemployment black spot with 3,166 people on the live register at the Tralee employment exchange. This level of unemployment is causing serious social problems in the town and leading to exclusion and disadvantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">As the partnership's budget was reduced from €870,000 to €770,000 for 2003, the management had to make sweeping cutbacks across the board to its many programmes. This cut of €100,000 has resulted in significant moneys allocated to Tralee LES being withdrawn and Partnership Tralee has withdrawn funding from a range of training programmes for long-term unemployed people. It  has also had to make programme cuts to its community development programme, and it had to delay the employment of an outreach worker to support one-parent families in two RAPID areas until late 2003, due to the shortfall in funding. A reduction of 50% in the community award fund will result in the partnership not being able to fund Christmas parties for the elderly or carry out other functions. A partnership education programme, together with the probation and welfare service, to help ex-prisoners reintegrate into mainstream education and training will not proceed this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">The budget for capital grants also had to be cut resulting in no grants being available from June to December this year for business start-ups. Many clients will have to rely on loans to fund their business start-ups but it is increasingly difficult to get a loan if one is unemployed with the result that many enthusiastic individuals will be forced to abandon their projects. Together with the change in the back to work enterprise scheme, many clients coming to Partnership Tralee for help and advice feel that the odds are stacked against them when it comes to starting up a business. Partnership Tralee has also been forced to make programme cuts within its community-based youth initiatives, including initiatives for children, on parenting skills and early school leavers. Support for the training of child care workers for classroom assistants working with children with special needs has also been greatly reduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">Partnership Tralee makes effective use of community employment programmes. However, these programmes have been cut by 18% to 20% in Tralee from December 2002 to December 2003. CE programmes are of considerable benefit to the individual participants and to the communities that receive the benefit from them, including many voluntary organisations. Further cuts in the CE programme which are now threatened would have a serious effect on the most marginalised and disadvantaged in the community. The social economy scheme, when first introduced, was designed to replace many of the jobs that were lost in CE programmes. This however has not been the case and only 33 jobs have been allocated to Tralee under the social economy scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">Will the Minister of State answer the following questions here this evening? He may not have them in his brief but he may be able to answer them. First, would he convey an invitation to the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, to meet with Partnership Tralee when he visits Kerry in the near future? Will he ask the Minister to allocate moneys from the receipts from dormant accounts to partnership companies to compensate them for their reduced budgets in 2003? Will he guarantee the future autonomy of partnership companies or will they be subsumed under a new body incorporating LEADER companies and other agencies?  Most important, will the Minister be in a position to advise partnership companies of their budget for 2004 in the near future? They need this urgently for further planning and to start preparing their programme for next year. Finally, Tralee did not benefit from the recent economic boom as did other large urban centres. There is a high level of unemployment and other disadvantage in the town. Partnership Tralee had been meeting this challenge with considerable success but after this cut in funding, it cannot carry out the programme it desires and deems to be necessary at this stage.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinFerrisSF" eId="spk_481">
          <from>Mr. Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_933">I am raising this issue as the cut in funding for Partnership Tralee will have serious long-term detrimental effects on the town of Tralee. It will prevent the partnership from continuing with many of the valuable programmes in which it has been involved and will mean that no new developments will be possible. For example, this year the partnership will be unable to fund a training programme for the long-term unemployed. Last year, its local employment service trained 194 people in new technologies. Discontinuing this work makes a mockery of the Government's claim to prioritise Tralee as a centre of attraction for the type of industry that needs workers with those skills.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">Another area where partnership is being forced to scale back its operations is the community development programme which established support groups for lone parent families. This will have a negative effect by increasing the marginalisation and isolation of a group that requires particular attention to overcome the barriers to development of resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_935">A particularly successful aspect of the work of Partnership Tralee was its assistance to small businesses. Capital grants of up to €2,000 were available and formed a crucial role in getting many small enterprises off the ground. Now, due to the cutback, no grants will be available for the remainder of 2003. I fail to understand the logic of this, especially from a Government that makes much of its commitment to encouraging small businesses. It is yet another example of short-term savings that will be outweighed by the cost that will follow these and all other cuts being made across a range of social and other services. While the community sector has been told that the social economy programme will compensate for cuts in the community employment schemes, this is being contradicted by the fact that the social economy will deliver only 33 jobs in Tralee. We need to hear that the social economy is to be expanded and whether it will make up for the losses in the community employment scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">The Minister of State also needs to inform the partnership companies what will be their budget allocation for 2004 and whether he intends to change the programme's content. Will he at the same time give a commitment that the work being carried out by partnerships will be supported at present levels over the 2004-2006 period? While  I do not accept the contention that money cannot be found from ordinary budgets to cover what is necessary, would the Minister of State consider persuading the Minister for Finance to allow him to use some of the money recovered from dormant accounts?</p>
          <p eId="para_937">Those involved in local partnership groups are concerned that the autonomy of the groups will be threatened in the future if they are placed under direct control of local authorities, as has been proposed. The secret of their success is that they have been able to utilise fully the skills and energies of local communities and talented people within those communities. They should be left as they are and that includes guaranteeing them the necessary funding to continue. Partnership Tralee covers many areas outside Tralee such as Ardfert, Fenit, Abbeydorney, Brennerville, right out to parts of Ballymacelligot, all dependent on the support they have had from the partnership. It is an indictment of all concerned that a partnership such as Partnership Tralee now finds itself with a cut of €100,000, and this is not taking into account the work that it has done in Tralee and beyond. It will be a great loss if this cutback is maintained. I hope the Minister of State will answer the questions I have raised. I endorse everything Deputy Deenihan says about the effects of this cut and the long-term effect in areas in our communities that are most in need of the support of partnerships such as Partnership Tralee.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_938">I am pleased to have the opportunity, on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, to respond to some of the questions raised by the Deputies. As they will appreciate, I can only respond to matters relevant to my Department. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is responsible for the community employment programme and social and economic programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_939">An amount of €44.6 million has been provided in the Vote of my Department for the local development programme this year. That figure represents a reduction of 6% in the local development subhead over the amount provided in the Estimates for last year. I stress to the Deputy that the reduction is 6%. Some of the much higher figures being bandied about are totally untrue. The overall reduction this year was 6%. In the previous two years, funding of €45.5 million and €47.6 million was provided to deliver the three sub-measures of the programme. The outturn of expenditure for the two years was €43.2 million in 2001 and €53.6 million last year. An additional €6 million was provided from savings in the Vote of my Department and allocated to the local development programme in December 2002 because it had overspent during the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_940">Tralee Partnership was allocated an annual budget of €825,330 for each of the three years 2001-03. As a result of the reduction in 2003, its  revised budget for this year is €767,557, a 7% reduction. Deputies will be aware that ADM manages the local development social inclusion programme on behalf of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. The programme is delivered on the ground by 38 partnerships, one of which is that which the Deputies spoke of, and 33 community groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_941">Allocations from the budget available for the programme in 2003 were recently agreed by the board of ADM and notified to each partnership and community group. As the Deputy will appreciate, ADM must manage the programme from the budget available in my Department's Vote. Reductions in available funding for 2003 are being managed on a sliding scale, up to 7%, depending on the annual budget of the relevant partnership.</p>
          <p eId="para_942">The issue was raised on numerous occasions recently in the House and at the recent departmental Estimates committee meeting, and I am aware that some area partnership companies and community groups had the expectation of a carry-over of previous years' under-spends into 2003. However, it is important to point out that the Department – like all other Departments – operates on an annual cash basis and not on an accrual basis. Perhaps the situation might have been different if the partnerships had secured funding from other EU sources. Therefore, my Department cannot facilitate a cumulative carry-over of under-spends. Any belief in the partnership that it might have been able to carry forward an under-spend was not well founded, and that was made clear to it. I can assure the Deputy that ADM is working closely with the area partnerships to minimise, as far as possible, the impact of the reductions in funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_943">I can inform the Minister that the Deputies would like him to meet the partnership in Tralee. He has been dealing with ADM, which acts as the go-between, on the matter. I understand the Minister has met Planet, which is the organising group of all the partnerships. He has been dealing with the groups collectively and knows well the points being made.</p>
          <p eId="para_944">There is no hope or prospect of getting any money from the dormant accounts. It does not work like that. The partnership will have to manage on the money allocated to it this year. The dormant accounts are dealt with by a separate statutory board. It is working on its disbursement plan, and some money will probably start to be spent on new projects – but not replacement ones – in early autumn. Some money from dormant accounts may well go to various good projects in disadvantaged areas – the same sorts of areas as the partnership would operate in – but none of that money will be provided to partnerships as replacement funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">Regarding future autonomy, there is a move to bring about greater coherence among all the different schemes and programmes now under the same Department, namely the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, be  they partnerships, drugs task forces, community development programmes, Leader programmes and so on. We had a major conference last week at which they were all asked for their views to try, not to amalgamate them, but to get them working more coherently to identify the duplication and the gaps. Everyone in the business agrees that there are many of those groups around, which were originally funded by various EU programmes, leading to a great deal of overlap and the emergence of gaps. We could get better value from the money they are costing the taxpayer. We had a major conference last week, and there is a joint initiative between the Ministers, Deputies Ó Cuív, Cullen and  McDowell, on the child care committee. They are trying to improve the structures and perhaps bring all those different community groups together, not amalgamating them into the county development boards but having them work in a more co-ordinated way with more channelling and agreement on their aim to provide services for their communities. That work is ongoing. I do not think that anyone can give the Deputies a definite answer about partnership funding for 2004 until much later in the year, but I will convey the Deputies' views to the Minister.</p>

          <p eId="para_949">The most recent statistics on activities in the Irish psychiatric services published by the Health Research Board reveal that 11% of all admissions to psychiatric hospitals and units are non-voluntary. I accept that this figure is high by European standards. However, the implementation of the provisions of the Mental Health Act 2001, which is planned to commence next year, is likely to reduce that figure.</p>
          <p eId="para_950">When fully operational, the Mental Health Act 2001 will modernise Irish law in relation to involuntary detention of persons for psychiatric care and treatment. It is expected that, over time, this will bring about a reduction in the number of decisions by consultant psychiatrists to detain a person involuntarily and thus bring the rate for involuntary detention in this country closer to that pertaining in other European countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_951">The Mental Health Commission is the main vehicle for the implementation of the provisions of the Mental Health Act 2001. When operational, the Act will significantly improve safeguards for mentally disordered people who are involuntarily admitted for psychiatric care and treatment. Under the provisions of the Act, each decision by a consultant psychiatrist to detain a patient for psychiatric care and treatment on an involuntary basis and each decision to extend the duration of such detention must be referred to the commission.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_13">The commission will arrange for an independent review of all such decisions by mental health tribunals which will operate under its aegis. The tribunals will comprise a consultant psychiatrist, a lawyer and a lay person. The mental health tribunals will arrange, on behalf of the detained person, for an independent assessment by a consultant psychiatrist. The tribunals will be empowered to order the release of a patient if they consider  that he or she does not require to be detained involuntarily. The commission will also operate a scheme to provide legal aid to patients whose detention is being reviewed by a tribunal.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_14">I understand that the Mental Health Commission is aware of regional variations which exist in the rate of involuntary detention and will be examining the matter in the course of its work.</summary>

          <p eId="para_955">I propose to take Questions Nos. 89, 96 and 110 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_956">The health service reform programme was announced on 18 June 2003. The programme's priority focus is improved patient care, better value for taxpayers' money and improved health care management. The reform programme has drawn on the conclusions and recommendations of the two reports, the Commission on Financial Management and Control Systems in the Health Service and the Audit of Structures and Functions in the Heath System, which were published on the same day. The reports and the health service reform programme do not deal with the impact that the new health structures will have on the number of acute beds, respite care places and step-down rehabilitative beds in the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">The Government decided in the context of the health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You, to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals over the period to 2011. The decision to increase the number of beds in acute hospitals was taken on foot of a detailed national review of bed capacity undertaken by the Department of Health and Children. The review clearly identified the need to increase acute bed capacity, and meeting this need continues to be a priority for the acute hospital system. In January 2002, I announced the commissioning of an additional 709 acute hospital beds. To date 551 of these beds are in place and it is envisaged that the remaining beds will be brought on stream before the end of 2003.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_15">Services for older people were reviewed and proposals developed with the objective of bringing the service up to an acceptable level on a  phased basis. The health strategy outlined improvements in community, hospital, residential and respite care. To date, additional revenue funding for the development of services for older people has increased significantly from €12.7 million in 1997 to an additional €87.807 million in 2002, including nursing home subvention funding. In excess of €270 million additional funding has been provided for services for older people from 1997 to date. This has resulted in more than 1,000 additional staff being recruited. Between 1998 and 2001, more than 550 additional beds have been provided in new community nursing units and more than 1,250 day places per week have been provided in new day care centres.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_16">In relation to services for people with intellectual disabilities, the provision of additional respite care services has been one of the priority areas specifically targeted for development in recent years. For example, around 465 dedicated respite places were put in place for people with intellectual disability and those with autism between 1999 and 2002. The further enhancement of respite care and other supports for people with disabilities and their families continues to be one of the priority within those services.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_17">In relation to rehabilitative beds, effective rehabilitation draws on a broad range of services to meet the particular needs of patients, with the objective of helping patients return to normal life in the community. I am aware that there are serious shortcomings in the present range of services available for people with severe disabilities and those with acquired brain injuries in a number of health board areas. It is estimated that there are more than 900 people inappropriately placed in acute hospitals or nursing homes who require step-down rehabilitation beds.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_18">A number of health boards are examining the possibility of developing residential units for these clients, either by the health board itself or in partnership with voluntary agencies such as the Cheshire Foundation of Ireland. In addition, as set out in the health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System For You, my Department is carrying out a review, in consultation with the relevant stakeholders, of the current rehabilitation services available.</summary>

      the way in which Ireland compares in a European Union league table on the number of beds per head of population; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_959">I presume the Deputy is referring to the OECD economic survey on Ireland published in May 2003 which stated that Ireland was below the OECD average for acute hospital beds per 1,000 population.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_19">At the outset it should be pointed out that the OECD advises caution in the interpretation of the cross-country data provided on health contained in its recent survey. The OECD health survey is based on Irish data for 1999 and is compared with data from other countries for the years 1997 and 1998. Health care systems differ significantly across the range of OECD countries. It should also be noted that the Irish data on the number of acute beds do not include the acute beds located in private hospitals in Ireland while some OECD countries include acute beds in private hospitals.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_20">Data on the number of acute beds per 1,000 population cannot be considered in isolation from the average length of stay and the capacity for day case treatment. The OECD notes that the average length of stay in an acute bed in Ireland is below the OECD average.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_21">The OECD survey refers specifically to in-patient beds, which are those beds accommodating patients who are formally admitted to a hospital for treatment and/or care and who stay for a minimum of one night in the hospital. However, it should be noted that day activity is now a significant component of hospital-based care in Ireland and there has been a rapid movement in the last few years towards day case work where a variety of routine and complex treatments, surgery and diagnostic tests can now be performed with the patient being admitted and discharged from hospital on the same day. Evidence shows that much of the growth is the result of technological and medical innovations, such as less invasive surgery and advances in anaesthetics. There has been an increase of 13% in the number of day cases between 2001 and 2002, which is similar to the increases experienced in preceding years. This increase reflects the increasing ability of the hospital system to treat more patients on a day basis.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_22">A review of acute hospital bed needs was undertaken by my Department. This review, entitled Acute Hospital Bed Capacity – A National Review, was published in January 2002. A specific section of the national bed review examined international comparisons of bed capacity and considered the position of Ireland relative to other OECD countries using OECD health data.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_23">On foot of the bed capacity report the Government decided in the context of the health strategy to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals by 2011. I introduced the first phase of this process and provided funding for an additional 709 acute beds in the period 2002 to 2003, representing a 6% increase in acute bed capacity. My Department has been informed by health agencies that 551 of these new beds have been opened to date with the remaining beds due to come on stream by the end of the year. At present my Department is examining the regional issues associated with the allocation of the remaining 3,000 acute beds.</summary>

      if his attention has been drawn to the recent report from of the Combat Poverty Agency showing that poorer people get sick more often and die younger than those who are better off; his plans to address the health needs of the less well-off; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_487">
          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p eId="para_964">I am aware of the Combat Poverty Agency Report, Against All Odds: Family Life on a Low Income in Ireland, to which the Deputy refers. My Department has received a detailed briefing on the study from the Combat Poverty Agency and has had initial discussions with the agency on how the Department and the agency might work  together to address relevant issues raised in the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_965">The report is an in-depth study of 30 families. The high level of poor health found in the study reinforces the evidence already available in Ireland and internationally on the links that exist between poverty and ill-health. This evidence has been clearly set out in a number of studies in the last few years in a Irish context, most notably in the Inequalities in Mortality 1989-1998 study carried out by the Institute of Public Health. The chief medical officer of my Department has also highlighted the evidence of the links between poverty and ill-health in his recent annual reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_966">As the Deputy is aware, the national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS, is the main vehicle through which the Government's response to the problems of poverty and social exclusion is being channelled. The targets to reduce health inequalities set out in the Government's review of the national anti-poverty strategy were developed in the course of an extensive consultation process and have been integrated into the national health strategy. Key health targets are to reduce the gap in premature mortality and low birth weight between the highest and lowest socio-economic groups by 10% by 2007, and to reduce differences in life expectancy between Travellers and the rest of the population.</p>
          <p eId="para_967">As a result of the wide range of factors which affect health status and health inequalities, the national health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You, envisages these targets being met through a range of actions including greater focus on multi-sectoral work and health impact assessment (HIA).</p>
          <p eId="para_968">The national health strategy asserts quite clearly that to achieve better health for everyone and to reduce health inequalities, health must be put at the centre of public policy. In this context, health impact assessment, HIA, is being developed so that relevant policies, strategies and legislation undergo a comprehensive process of health proofing so that their impact on the physical, mental and social well-being of the population is positive. The Institute of Public Health is already involved in some initiatives in this area and the Department of Health and Children, in partnership with the institute, is developing a programme in this area which will include: policy seminars for senior management, the first of which is scheduled to take place in early July; training courses for health impact assessment practitioners – project management, hazard identification, risk management, health gain interventions, HIA appraisal, inter-sectoral action; and review of health impact assessment tools.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_24">The important role of primary care in effectively addressing health inequalities was highlighted in the national anti-poverty strategy consultation process and in the report of the national anti-poverty strategy and health working group. The primary care strategy provides for an interdisciplinary team-based approach to primary care  provision. Clients may self-refer to any team member and appropriate procedures will be in place to facilitate referral between team members and, where necessary, joint management by the team also. I have approved the establishment of an implementation project in each of ten locations.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_25">In relation to primary care, there is now a general practitioner co-operative providing an out-of-hours service operating in each health board area and the network of GP co-ops is being extended to cover wider areas, except in the North-Eastern Health Board where it is already region-wide.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_26">The primary care strategy model includes mechanisms for the involvement of the community. The community and voluntary pillar is represented on the steering group for the implementation of the strategy and is also working with four of the ten initial implementation projects. Sustaining Progress includes a commitment that the learning from community involvement will be used to inform models of participation appropriate to the wider national health strategy. The document, Community Participation Guidelines, published last December by the Health Board Executive, HeBE, sets out the spectrum of ways of involving patients and communities.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_27">My Department recently co-hosted a conference with the Combat Poverty Agency to launch its Building Healthy Communities programme, which has a special focus on community development approaches to reducing health inequalities. My Department also supports financially, in the context of the implementation of the primary care strategy, a number of research projects under the aegis of the Building Healthy Communities programme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_28">The report, Ireland's Changing Heart, the second report on the implementation of the cardiovascular health strategy published recently, highlights the importance of addressing health inequalities in the context of strategy implementation. Consideration is being given as to how this can best be addressed. Targets to reduce health inequalities will also be taken on board in the review of the cancer strategy under way. Mechanisms for developing an injury prevention strategy are under discussion between my Department and the Health Board Executive, HeBE.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_29">In the 2003 letters of determination, and in other correspondence, my Department has asked health agencies to prioritise actions to reduce health inequalities. The chief executive officer of each health board was asked to prioritise its funding allocations in favour of the RAPID and CLÁR programmes.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_30">A number of awareness raising exercises have been undertaken among staff in the Department of Health and Children in relation to targets to reduce health inequalities. A work programme is being progressed with the Institute of Public Health to develop a programme of awareness raising and training for health board staff in con junction with the Health Board Executive regarding the targets to reduce health inequalities and also in relation to the indicators and data needed to monitor and evaluate the targets.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_31">The NAPS and health working group has been reconvened in a consultative capacity in relation to monitoring progress towards achievement of the targets. The social partners are represented on the working group.</summary>

The current vacancy rate of 2.6% has been declining steadily in recent years, and could be considered to be a normal frictional rate. It is clear from these figures that the recruitment and retention measures I introduced are proving to be very effective.</summary>

          <p eId="para_995">As the Deputy is aware, the provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons is the responsibility of the health boards-authority in the first instance. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services on a national basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_996">The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. This year, my Department and the health boards are funding 13 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. Thus there is an aggregate of 20 public service dentists in training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</p>
          <p eId="para_997">Orthodontic initiative funding of €4.698 million was provided to the health boards/authority in 2001 and this has enabled health boards to recruit additional staff, engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients and build additional orthodontic facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_998">In June 2002, my Department provided additional funding of €5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. This scheme has also enabled some boards to make arrangements for the treatment of cases by private specialist orthodontic practitioners from Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">The chief executive officers of the health boards-authority have informed me of the following information on their orthodontic waiting lists as at the end of the March 2003 quarter, which is detailed in the table following:</p>

          <p eId="para_1076">The Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, undertook this survey to check for compliance with regulations on the labelling of genetically modified food. The survey, which formed part of the EU co-ordinated programme for the official control of foodstuffs for 2002, examined a wide range of both soya and maize containing foods.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077">Samples used for this survey included breakfast cereals, baby foods, snack foods, dried soya products, soya and maize flours and bakery products. The results show that 12 of the 75 samples tested – 16% – contained GM ingredients authorised for food use within the EU. Under EU Regulation (EC) No. 49/2000, food or ingredients that have 1% or less GM content do not require GM-specific labelling if the operator can show that the food or ingredients were from a non-GM source, which would indicate that the GM content was due to technically unavoidable contamination. None of the samples which were found by the FSAI to contain GM material contained greater than this 1% threshold.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078">As part of the follow up to the survey, the FSAI wrote to the companies whose products contained GM ingredients seeking confirmation that the products or ingredients in question were sourced from non-GM sources. All companies responded with documentary evidence to the satisfaction of the FSAI, which meant that specific GM labelling was not required.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_46">However, the survey showed that six of the 12 foods containing GM material had labels indicat ing that they contained no GM ingredients, with one of those also having an organic label. One additional product had an organic label. Under current EU legislation, labelling cannot mislead the consumer to a material degree as to the content or production of a food. The FSAI has followed up with the companies involved to make them aware of the relevant legislation and of their responsibilities under the law. As a result, one food company has already responded to the FSAI and has indicated that GM-free type labelling will be removed from the foodstuffs concerned. The FSAI has indicated that a further formal survey focusing on products with GM-free labels will be undertaken with a view to enforcement action in the event of non-compliance.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_47">It should be stressed that the purpose of the survey was to ensure that GM products were correctly labelled so that consumers have the required information to enable them make informed choices about the food they purchase. I am satisfied that the problem identified with the use of GM-free labels in a small number of cases has been addressed by the FSAI.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1080">The provision of services at Bantry General Hospital is a matter for the Southern Health Board. The board has been supporting the phased development of services at the hospital over the past number of years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1081">A total of €2.45 million has been invested in improving the physical structure of the hospital and in the upgrading and replacement of equipment. As part of the ongoing developments an additional eight beds are being provided in the hospital under the bed capacity initiative. Construction of the eight-bedded extension was completed in 2002 and I provided revenue funding of €350,000 to open these beds. The board intends that these beds, which will initially serve the medical needs of the hospital, will be opened over the coming months.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_48">A new medical consultant in old age medicine and a sessional consultant in palliative care have been appointed. These appointments have resulted in a significant increase in activity at the hospital. The number of medical, nursing, paramedical, non-nursing and administration staff has also been increased. A strategic development plan is in place for an extended hospital campus in Bantry. Additional land and property has been  purchased to enable these developments to take place. Approval to progress capital projects is being considered by my Department in the context of a review of health capital projects under the national development plan. It is expected that this review, which is being undertaken by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Finance, will be completed shortly.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1083">In November 2001, I appointed Mr. Paul Gardiner, Senior Counsel, to produce a situation report about the position in Ireland and in the United States in respect of a possible investigation into the actions of the multinational pharmaceutical companies whose products are implicated in the HIV and hepatitis C infection of persons with haemophilia.</p>
          <p eId="para_1084">As part of his investigations, Mr. Gardiner liaised with solicitors acting for the Irish Haemophilia Society. He travelled to the United States and spoke to a number of relevant experts, including the lead counsel in the HIV haemophiliac litigation in the United States. Mr. Gardiner also received legal advice from a major New York law firm in relation to the matters relevant to his investigations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085">Mr. Gardiner furnished a report to me which consisted of a 60 page opinion and a number of appendices, one of which comprised over 50 pages of legal advice from the US lawyers. The report drew attention to the fact that there is no guarantee that the US authorities would provide judicial assistance to an Irish tribunal, either in relation to enforcing the discovery of documents or compelling the attendance of witnesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086">I briefed my Cabinet colleagues on the content of the report and I provided the Irish Haemophilia Society with a copy of it.

          <p eId="para_1090">Successive Governments have pursued a policy of regional self-sufficiency in relation to the provision of hospital services in order to ensure that patients are in a better position to access services locally. The benefits of this policy are evident through a series of major infrastructural developments in hospitals around the country which has resulted in the availability of more services and new specialties on a regional basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091">However, for reasons of complexity, a number of specialised services are concentrated in the eastern region. The ERHA has acknowledged that the referral of patients from outside the region to avail of tertiary and super-regional services in the eastern region remains appropriate given the range and specialised nature of the services provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_1092">The Deputy may wish to note that the ERHA intends to have discussions with the health boards and the acute providers in the region in relation to the development of referral protocols.</p>

          <p eId="para_1095">The provision of orthodontic services is a matter for the health boards in the first instance. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services in the Southern Health Board, SHB, area and on a national basis.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_49">In the short term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of €6.729 million was  approved for orthodontic services in 2001, of which €4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This enables health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients. The SHB was allocated an additional €1.191 million in 2001 for orthodontic services of which €1.032 million was for the orthodontic initiative. The post of consultant orthodontist for Tralee was advertised through the Local Appointments Commission, LAC, on two separate occasions but unfortunately there were no successful candidates. It is currently with the LAC for re-advertising. The efforts of the board are hindered by the limited availability of suitably qualified candidates for the post. However, the commitment of the Department to training development is manifested in the funding provided to both the training of specialist clinical staff and the recruitment of a professor for the Cork Dental School. I am hopeful that the LAC will be successful in recruiting a suitable candidate for this post.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_50">My Department has funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University Dental School to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualification in orthodontics. The Department recognises the importance of recruiting a professor at Cork Dental School; therefore, approval in principle has been given to a proposal from the school to further substantially improve the training facilities there for orthodontics and so enable the recruitment of a suitable candidate. This project should see the construction of a large orthodontic unit and support facilities; it will ultimately support an enhanced teaching and treatment service to the wider region under the leadership of a professor of orthodontics.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_51">In June 2002, my Department provided additional funding of €5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. The SHB was allocated an additional €720,000 from this fund for the treatment of cases in this way.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_52">The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. This year, my Department and the health boards are funding 13 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. Thus, there is an aggregate of 20 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_53">These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an  auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_54">Finally, the chief executive officer of the SHB has informed me that at the end of the March 2003 quarter, there were 3,400 patients receiving orthodontic treatment in the board. This is an increase of approximately 1,100 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients receiving treatment in December 2001.</summary>

      <b>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Health and Children</b>
      the present scale of nursing home subvention; his views on the fact that they are entirely inadequate; and his proposals in this regard.
      [17618/03]

        </question>
        <speech by="#IvorCallely" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_496">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</from>
          <p eId="para_1097">Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990, a health board may pay a subvention to assist a person in meeting the costs of their long stay care in a private nursing home. However, it was never intended that a subvention payment would meet the full costs involved. Apart from contracts entered into under Article 22.3 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993, which allows a health board to enter into an arrangement with a private nursing home, the placement of a person in a private nursing home and the fees charged is a private arrangement between the individual and the nursing home proprietor.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098">The Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993 are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There are currently three rates of subvention payable –€114.30, €152.40 and €190.50 – for the three levels of dependency which are medium, high and maximum. Included in these payments is an increase of 25% which came into effect in April 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099">A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency in a case for example where personal funds are exhausted. As referred to above, articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993 permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subvention within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act 1996.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_55">I would like to remind the Deputy that funding for the nursing home subvention scheme has increased significantly since its inception. In 1994, the first full year of the scheme, €5 million was allocated for its operation. The Deputy may be interested to note that funding of €110 million is  being allocated in 2003 for the operation of the scheme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_56">In line with a Government decision, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme has been undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance. The objectives of the review of the subvention scheme were,inter alia, to examine the objectives of the nursing home subvention scheme and the extent to which they remain valid, to assess the service delivered and to establish what scope, if any, exists for achieving the programme objectives by other more efficient and effective means. I will be launching the review later in the week in association with my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, who will be also launching a report on the future financing of long-term care in Ireland.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_57">A review of the nursing home regulations is also being undertaken within my Department. The objective of the review is to develop a scheme which will be transparent; offer a high standard of care for clients; provide equity within the system to include standardised dependency and means testing; be less discretionary; provide both a home and nursing home subvention depending on need; be consistent in implementation throughout the country and draw on experience of the operation of the old scheme. My Department will also be consulting with all stakeholders as part of the review process.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p eId="para_1101">Due to the nature of any health care system not all treatments can be made available to patients immediately. Hospital facilities must be used to best effect and it is sometimes necessary to place patients for non-urgent treatments on a waiting list. Therefore, the significant issue from the patients perspective is the length of time spent waiting for treatment.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_59">This Government is strongly committed to reducing waiting lists and particularly waiting times. Our objective is to reduce waiting times significantly in the short term with particular focus on those waiting longest for treatment. The overall target set out in the national health strategy, which was published in December 2001, states that by the end of 2004 all public patients requiring admission to hospital will be scheduled to commence treatment within a maximum of three months of referral from an out-patient  department. Intermediate targets have been set to achieve this aim to ensure that the focus is being turned towards those waiting longest for treatment.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_60">The target for 2002 was that no adult would wait longer than 12 months and no child would wait longer than six months to commence treatment. Despite pressures on the acute hospital system and the influence of factors such as the winter vomiting bug, considerable progress has been made by health agencies in reducing waiting times for public patients in 2002. Very significant progress has been made towards the target for 2002 in many hospitals, particularly those outside the eastern region.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_61">There has been a significant reduction in the number of adults waiting longest for in-patient treatment. The total number of adults waiting more than 12 months for in-patient treatment in the nine target specialties has fallen by 30% from 7,402 to 5,209 in the period June to December 2002. The total number of children waiting for more than six months for in-patient treatment has fallen by over 31% between June and December 2002.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_62">While the waiting list initiative will continue to fund additional elective activity, the dedicated national treatment purchase fund, NTPF, is being used to target those waiting longest for treatment, initially concentrating on those adults waiting longer than 12 months for admission to hospital and children waiting longer than six months for admission to hospital. Funding of €43.8 million has been provided in 2003 for the waiting list initiative and some €31 million has been provided for the NTPF. The NTPF has identified sufficient capacity to treat approximately 8,000 patients in 2003. To date approximately 4,500 long waiters have received treatment under the NTPF.</summary>

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_63">At the outset, Prospectus stated that it is difficult to accurately predict the true financial impact of programmes of this scale. In addition, the limi tations of the available financial data made it difficult to develop a realistic estimate of costs or benefits in relation to the major components of reform – in some cases data was not readily available or not directly comparable. This information deficit is reflected in the analysis completed by the Brennan commission also. However, the Prospectus team outlined the likely benefit and cost contributors associated with a programme such as this.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_64">For example, improvements in management focus, role clarity and team-working should contribute to increased productivity from the existing labour base in people-based services; shared service efficiencies should create significant savings and productivity improvements across functions such as general accounting, accounts payable, human resource administration and purchasing and receivables; the reduction in health board overheads should free up resources which could be utilised to meet demand for front-line services; and sales of surplus assets, in particular property assets which might no longer be required could be another source of cost saving. These benefits will have to be balanced against the potential costs associated with establishing some aspects of the new infrastructure.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_65">It has been agreed by Government, that the costs associated with the reform process in 2003 will be met from within existing allocations.

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</from>
          <p eId="para_1109">I congratulate the National Council On Ageing and Older People for its work in producing the report mentioned by the Deputy. It represents a qualitative exploration of the views of older people, service providers and carers. It serves to provide policy makers with the insight of those who receive our services and the frontline providers of these services. It will also greatly help to inform my Department's approach to the development of day services for the older people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1110">When I opened the recent conference to mark the publication of the council's report, I pointed out that the cornerstone of policy in relation to the care of older people is care in the community. The overall aim is to support older people to live in their own community for as long as possible. Nowadays, older people are living longer and healthier lives, and those lives should have purpose and meaning. One of the important functions of day care centres is to offer older people an opportunity to meet with their peers and also to provide them with a focus for social interaction. Older people can also avail themselves of practical facilities such as meals, bath/shower facilities, medical room, hairdressing and other health and recreational services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1111">In recent years, health and social services for older people have been improved both in hospitals and in the community. Funding, both capital and revenue, has been substantially increased in respect of services for older people. Between 1997 and 2003, additional funding of approximately €270 million has been provided for services for older people. A portion of this funding went towards providing an additional 1,250 day care places.</p>
          <p eId="para_1112">The national development plan is providing considerable capital funding to services for older people in the period 2000-06. On a national basis, this will enable a comprehensive infrastructure of community nursing units and day care facilities to be put in place, with the refurbishment of existing extended-care facilities and the replacement of old accommodation. New day care centres have already been opened in places such as Finglas, Kilorglin and Mallow.</p>
          <p eId="para_1113">The health strategy, Quality and Fairness – A System For You, recommends the provision of an additional 7,000 day care places. It is my intention to continue with the provision of those places as resources permit.</p>

          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p eId="para_1117">As the Deputy is aware, the health strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the medical card income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low income who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children and particularly children with a disability. This should be viewed in the broader context of the strategy's emphasis on fairness and its stated objective of reducing health inequalities in our society. Due to the prevailing budgetary situation I regret that it is not possible to meet this commitment this year but the Government remains committed to the introduction of the necessary changes within the lifetime of this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118">It should be remembered that health board chief executive officers have discretion in relation to the issuing of medical cards and also that a range of income sources are excluded by the health boards when assessing medical card eligibility. Many allowances, such as carers allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement and foster care allowance, are all disregarded when determining a person's eligibility. Given these factors and the discretionary powers of the chief executive officers, having an income that exceeds the guidelines does not mean that a person will not be eligible for a medical card, and a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that a person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1119">Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme, can avail of the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme no individual or family unit pays more than €70 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_66">The health strategy includes a series of initiatives to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services, including recommendations arising from the review of the medical card scheme carried out by the health board chief executive officers under the PPF which include streamlining applications and improving the standardisation of the medical card applications process to ensure better fairness and  transparency, providing clearer information to people about how and where to apply for medical cards and proactively seeking out those who should have medical cards to ensure they have access to the services that are available.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_67">Access to primary care services is of crucial concern to the Government as is evidenced by the publication of a separate strategy document, Primary Care: A New Direction. Primary care is the first port of call for the majority of people who use health services. It can meet 90% to 95% of all health and personal social service needs. It is a vital public service. People want community-based, well-integrated, round-the-clock services that are easy to reach. They want themselves, their family members and their communities put right at the centre of care delivery.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_68">The primary care strategy sets out a vision of the service we want to put in place building on our existing strengths, to develop a high quality, user-friendly primary care service to meet people's needs into the future.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_69">Change will not be effected overnight. The strategy sets out an implementation plan, which recognises the breadth of the change, which will be required in order to support the rolling-out of the new primary care model over the next decade.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_70">As the new model is developed, a wider primary care network of other primary care professionals will also provide services for the population served by each primary care team. The provision of a wide range of services in this way will allow a higher percentage of patients to be cared for in the community, thus reducing hospital admissions. Furthermore, as the strategy is implemented on a national basis many services will be provided on an extended-hours basis and out-of-hours cover for defined services will be greatly enhanced.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_71">Last year I approved the establishment of a number of initial implementation projects which will involve putting in place an integrated primary care team in ten locations around the country. This will enable us to see in a real and practical way how the new model will operate in practice, the benefits which we hope will flow from this new way of working and to explore some of the implementation issues in a practical way.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_72">This is, of course, only one of the first steps along the way. The implementation period recognises that there are major structural changes, which must occur in order for the new primary care model to be implemented. It is also necessary to ensure that the required numbers of health professionals are trained and retained in the system over the coming decade and beyond to meet anticipated needs.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_73">One of the principal objectives of the plans for the modernisation of our health service structures which I have recently announced is that the system should be structured to enable the health strategy, including the primary care strategy, to be delivered. As part of the reform plans, there fore, the system for the planning and delivery of primary care services, at national, regional and local level, will be reorganised in line with the vision contained in the primary care strategy.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_74">Primary care, planned and organised on this basis, will lessen the current reliance on specialist services and the hospital system particularly accident and emergency and out-patient services. Based on available evidence, it will have the potential to reduce the requirement for specialist services, reduce hospitalisation rates, reduce lengths of stay for those who are hospitalised, promote more rational prescribing, and improve efficiency.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1129">The cardiovascular health strategy, Building Healthier Hearts, published in July 1999, identified cardiovascular disease as the number one cause of death in Ireland today. The Southern Health Board's regional cardiovascular health strategy, 5 Year Action Plan, June 2000, also identified cardiovascular disease as the number one cause of death in the region accounting for 46% of all deaths in Cork and Kerry. Since 1989, Cork and Kerry have consistently higher standardised mortality ratios, SMRs, for cardiovascular disease than the national average. Kerry has a higher SMR than Cork. Under the cardiovascular health strategy, investment in the development of cardiology services has taken place in all service areas right across the region in both Cork and Kerry.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_78">In line with priorities identified in the Southern Health Board's regional cardiovascular health strategy, 5 Year Action Plan, June 2000, Tralee General Hospital has received €503,778 over the first four years of the strategy to develop cardiology related services in the hospital. This has resulted in the appointment/approval to recruit 12.5 staff for the hospital under the strategy,  including four coronary care unit nurses, one occupational therapist, two student cardiac technicians, one cardiac rehabilitation sister, one cardiac rehabilitation nurse, one dietician, one resuscitation officer, 0.5 physiotherapist and administrative support.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_79">The strengthening of the infrastructure in the hospital has enabled Tralee General Hospital to develop a cardiac rehabilitation service, a cardiac non-invasive diagnostic service, extend its telemetry service in CCU, extend its resuscitation-training programme and provide for ongoing staff training. It has also ensured that essential cardiac equipment was procured for the cardiology services at the hospital.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_80">The interim report of the joint working group on cardiology manpower recommended the appointment of a consultant cardiologist at Tralee General Hospital as one of three priority appointments for the Southern Health Board. With the allocation of €1.330 million to the Southern Health Board this year, under the cardiovascular health strategy, the board plans to appoint two additional consultant cardiologists, one each at Cork University Hospital and the Mercy Hospital. The Southern Health Board plans to proceed with the consultant cardiology appointment at Tralee General Hospital from additional funding from the cardiovascular health strategy in the future.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1135">I am aware of the concerns of the psychology profession regarding the implementation process for the report of the joint review group on psychological services in the health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1136">Following the publication of the report in March 2002, a major priority for my Department was to promote an integrated and co-ordinated approach by the health boards to its implementation over time. This applied in particular to the major recommendations of the report relating to the organisation and management of psychology services, entailing very substantial increases in the number of principal and director level psychologist posts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1137">Given the key role of the Health Board Executive in fostering collective working and progressing organisational change and development in the health service, my Department secured the agreement of the executive to work with the directors of human resources in the health boards towards the implementation of the recommendations of the report. The present position is that the directors of human resources are in the process of individually considering the recommendations contained in the report on how their boards might propose to proceed with the implementation process in due course. This work is being undertaken in light of service imperatives; funding priorities; and the budget 2003 announcement on public service numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1138">In this context, it is important to bear in mind that the overall budgetary and economic position in 2003 has had important implications for all aspects of public spending, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by Government for 2003.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_83">Given these constraints my Department, together with the directors of human resources in  the health boards, is prioritising support for the implementation of a key recommendation of the joint review report relating to human resource planning through the provision of a substantial number of additional post-graduate training places in clinical psychology. This has resulted in a threefold increase from end-1999 to end-2002, from 26 to 84, in the number of trainee clinical psychologists employed in the health services. At present, there are about 105 clinical psychologists undertaking post-graduate training in the State. Over 60 students are enrolled on the Psychological Society of Ireland's clinical psychologist post-graduate training diploma, 24 are enrolled on the doctoral programme in clinical psychology at TCD – 12 in first year and 12 in second year – and 19 are enrolled on the doctoral programme in clinical psychology at UCD – ten in second year and nine in third year. It is understood that both the National University of Ireland, Galway and the University of Limerick have plans to introduce doctoral programmes in clinical psychology in 2003 with an intake of a further 20 students in total. These developments, in enhancing graduate output, will help maintain an improved balance between demand and supply in human resource and service provision.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_84">My Department remains committed to working on an ongoing basis with health agencies, educational providers and the education authorities to ensure adequate provision of training places in clinical psychology consistent with the medium-term human resource requirements of the health services as detailed in the important recommendations on investment in training and education detailed in the Action Plan for People Management published in November 2002.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_85">A particular priority is to secure the best return, in terms of graduate output, on the very significant financial resources currently being invested in the health services to support post-graduate clinical psychology training. Consequently, my Department, together with the health boards' directors of human resources, is currently examining the current model for post-graduate psychology training with the objective of supporting training provision on a planned and sustainable medium-term basis.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_86">In addition to measures to increase the supply of psychologists through the implementation of the recommendations of the joint review report, it should be recognised that other efforts have been undertaken to improve staffing levels in the psychological services, both at local and national level. Relevant developments include the recruitment of psychologists from overseas by the health boards, the introduction of a fast track working visa scheme for health and social care professionals, the streamlining of procedures for the validation of overseas qualifications and the devolution of responsibility for recruitment of basic grade psychologist posts to health boards from the Local Appointments Commission. Ongoing pay enhancements through the implementation of the recommendations of the Public  Service Benchmarking Body will make a further contribution to reducing current vacancy levels by increasing the attractiveness of employment as a clinical psychologist in the health services.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_87">The Deputy may also wish to note the significant increase in excess of 40%, an increase of 125 from 291 to 416, over the three years to end-2002 in the numbers of fully qualified psychologists working in the health service which has contributed to a significant increase in the volume of psychological services provided.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1140">The health service reform programme was announced on 18 June 2003. Its priority focus is improved patient care, better value for money and improved health care management. The reform programme is based on the conclusions and recommendations of two reports, the Commission on Financial Management and Control Systems in the Health Service and the Audit of Structures and Functions in the Health System, which were published on the same day.</p>
          <p eId="para_1141">These reports and the reform programme do not deal directly with the impact of the new structures on the number of medical card holders in the health service. As the Deputy is aware, the health strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the medical card income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low income who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children and particularly children with a disability. This should be viewed in the broader context of the strategy's emphasis on fairness and its stated objective of reducing health inequalities in our society. Due to the prevailing budgetary situation I regret that it is not possible to meet this commitment this year but the Government remains committed to the introduction of the necessary changes within the lifetime of this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1142">In addition, it is my view that a single executive will provide for a greater streamlining of the application process. In addition and very importantly, the reformed system will ensure that there is a single interpretation of legislation and a standard application of discretionary powers for the issue of medical cards. Combined with progress on new eligibility legislation providing greater clarity and transparency in relation to the existing arrangements for eligibility, this should also reduce barriers to access.</p>

          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p eId="para_1148">I propose to take Questions Nos. 120 and 293 together.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_88">As the Deputy is aware, the health strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the medical card income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low income who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children, and particularly children with a disability. This should be viewed in the broader context of the strategy's emphasis on fairness and its stated  objective of reducing health inequalities in our society. Due to the prevailing budgetary situation I regret that it is not possible to meet this commitment this year but the Government remains committed to the introduction of the necessary changes within the lifetime of this Government.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_89">It should be remembered that health board chief executive officers have discretion in relation to the issuing of medical cards and also that a range of income sources are excluded by the health boards when assessing medical card eligibility. Many allowances such as carers' allowance, child benefit, domiciliary care allowance, family income supplement and foster care allowance are all disregarded when determining a person's eligibility. Given these factors and the discretionary powers of the chief executive officers, having an income that exceeds the guidelines does not mean that a person will not be eligible for a medical card, and a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that a person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify that.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_90">Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the long-term illness scheme, can avail of the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than €70 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_91">The strategy includes a whole series of initiatives to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services, including recommendations arising from the review of the medical card scheme carried out by the health board chief executive officers under the PPF which include streamlining applications and improving the standardisation of the medical card applications process to ensure better fairness and transparency; providing clearer information to people about how and where to apply for medical cards; and proactively seeking out those who should have medical cards to ensure they have access to the services that are available.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_92">The health strategy emphasises fairness and the objective of reducing health inequalities in our society. A whole series of initiatives are outlined to clarify and expand the existing arrangements for eligibility for health services. Shorter waiting times for public patients is prioritised, with the expansion of bed numbers and the introduction of a treatment purchase fund. In addition, there are clear commitments to targeting vulnerable and disadvantaged groups including continued investment in services for people with disabilities and older people; initiatives to improve the health of Travellers, homeless people, drug misusers, asylum seekers/refuges and prisoners; and implementation of the NAPS targets relating to health.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_93">Access to primary care services is of crucial concern to this Government as is evidenced by the publication of a separate strategy document, Primary Care: A New Direction. Primary care is  the first port of call for the majority of people who use health services. It can meet 90% to 95% of all health and personal social service needs. It is a vital public service.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_94">The primary care strategy sets out a vision of the service we want to put in place, building on our existing strengths to develop a high quality, user-friendly primary care service to meet people's needs into the future. However, change will not be effected overnight. The strategy sets out an implementation plan, which recognises the breadth of the change, which will be required in order to support the rolling-out of the new primary care model over the next decade.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_95">As the new model is developed, a wider primary care network of other primary care professionals will also provide services for the population served by each primary care team. Last year I approved the establishment of a number of initial implementation projects, which will involve putting in place an integrated primary care team in ten locations around the country. This will enable us to see, in a real and practical way, how the new model will operate in practice, the benefits which we hope will flow from this new way of working and to explore some of the implementation issues in a practical way.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_96">This is only one of the first steps along the way. The implementation period recognises that there are major structural changes which must occur in order for the new primary care model to be implemented. It is also necessary to ensure that the required numbers of health professionals are trained and retained in the system over the coming decade and beyond to meet anticipated needs. One of the principal objectives of the plans for the modernisation of our health service structures which I have recently announced is that the system should be structured to enable the health strategy, including the primary care strategy, to be delivered. As part of the reform plans, therefore, the system for the planning and delivery of primary care services at national, regional and local level will be reorganised in line with the vision contained in the primary care strategy.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_97">The targets to reduce health inequalities set out in the Government's review of the national anti-poverty strategy and which were developed in the course of an extensive consultation process have been integrated into the national health strategy. Key health targets are to reduce the gap in premature mortality and low birth weight between the highest and lowest socio-economic groups by 10% by 2007, and to reduce differences in life expectancy between Travellers and the rest of the population.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_98">Policy measures for implementing these targets as outlined in the Framework Document for the NAPS review and the report of the working group on NAPS and health, have been taken on board in the national health strategy. Because of the wide range of factors which affect health status and health inequalities, the national health strategy envisages these targets being met through a range of actions including greater focus  on multi-sectoral work and health impact assessment.</summary>

It was initially introduced on an administrative basis, with the intention that regulations to underpin its operation would be introduced following amendment of the relevant section of the 1970 Health Act. However, amendment of the Act was delayed and, following further consideration and legal advice obtained from the Attorney General's office in October 2000, regulations made under the existing section  59 of the 1970 Act, fixing the threshold for the new scheme at €53.33, came into effect on 1 March 2001.</p>

          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p eId="para_1172">The health service reform programme was announced on 18 June 2003. The programme's priority focus is improved patient care, better value for taxpayers' money and improved health care management. The reform programme has drawn on the conclusions and recommendations of the two reports, the Commission on Financial Management and Control Systems in the Health Service and the Audit of Structures and Functions in the Heath System, which were also published on the same day. The Government considered the recommendations made in both reports and has decided on a number of priority actions to move forward system reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_1173">These key actions are: a major rationalisation of existing health service agencies to reduce fragmentation, which includes the abolition of the existing health board-authority structures; the re-organisation of the Department of Health and Children to ensure improved policy development and oversight; the establishment of a health services executive which will be the first ever body charged with managing the health service as a single national entity and will be organised on the basis of three core divisions, a national hospitals office, a primary, community and continuing care directorate, a national shared services centre; and the establishment of a health information and quality authority to ensure that quality of care is promoted throughout the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1174">The new structure set out in this reform programme will provide a clear national focus on service delivery and executive management. It will achieve this through reduced fragmentation and the creation of clear and unambiguous accountability throughout the system. This is not a centralisation of services but a streamlining of the management of the system to create greater efficiencies.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_99">I also reject the Deputy's contention that the reform programme structures will in any way damage community based services. On the contrary, Prospectus saw this structure as optimal in terms of allowing the primary care model the opportunity to develop and grow. It also saw the advantage to be gained in distinguishing between acute and primary, community and continuing care, stating that this structure provides the opportunity to "reflect the declared priorities of strengthening primary care and reforming the acute hospital sector; allow recognition of the different management demands of each sector in  terms of scale, technology, organisation type and delivery mechanism".</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_100">In addition, in the areas of primary, community and continuing care, the reform programme provides for a strengthening of existing community care structures. I have already indicated on a number of occasions that services will continue to be delivered through these local health office networks but they will operate within a fundamentally realigned national management structure providing a proper framework within which all primary, community and continuing care services can be integrated.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_101">In respect of the issue of democratic control raised by the Deputy, we have an Exchequer-funded health service with centrally determined resourcing decisions. Therefore, Oireachtas Members should have a responsibility to ensure that there is a match between funding of services and national priorities. Democratic input could best be represented at regional level through at least twice yearly meetings with the director of the regional health office and his or her senior management team, together with other members of the HSE or its offices, as appropriate. This mechanism is advanced as complementing and reinforcing the role of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children in reflecting the views of public representatives in the ongoing oversight of the health system. The emphasis is on ensuring that democratic input at regional level should focus on the delivery of national priorities. I have agreed to bring more detailed proposals to Government on the representation arrangements following the completion of the communications process over the coming months.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1176">As the Deputy is aware, I established the expert working group on radiation oncology services in 2000 to examine and advise me on the appropriate future development of radiation oncology services nationally. The group comprised a multidisciplinary team of experts in radiation oncology, surgical oncology, nursing, epidemiology and palliative care. The group conducted a national assessment of needs for radiotherapy services, having regard to the demography and epidemiology of cancer and the gaps in current service provision.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_102">The report addresses the following key issues: access to radiotherapy services in terms of information, financial access and organisational components of access; the need to provide a high quality, evidence based service; the need to take account of current and new developments in  health technology; the requirements of the system in terms of human resources; international norms in respect of service provision, planning and staffing; and the organisational development of the services in terms of structures and processes which need to be in place in a radiotherapy facility.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_103">All health boards, including the South Eastern Health Board, have been afforded the opportunity to meet with and make submissions on a number of occasions to the group. On completion by the expert group, the report was submitted to me on 24 April 2003. Given the significance attached to this report and its implications for the development of radiation oncology services nationally, it is necessary for me to submit the report to Government. I advised the Dáil of my intentions in this regard on 7 May 2003. It is also necessary that there be consultation at interdepartmental level, including with the Department of Finance, prior to consideration by Government. It is anticipated that the report will be considered by Government shortly, after which it will be published.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_104">I accept that the significant under-capacity in radiation oncology which exists at present represents a major challenge for the health services. In this regard, I met with a delegation from Waterford city and county councils last week and outlined the key principles which inform the group's deliberations and the priorities for the development of radiation oncology services. These include: the need to develop the backbone of the service initially around major treatment centres as quickly as possible; adequate throughput and caseload is essential to deliver quality care; and equity of access is essential to ensure that patients receive treatment on the basis of clinical need and regardless of geographical location. In the context of the initial development of major centres, provision will be made to ensure equitable access through a number of mechanisms, including improved transport and accommodation.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_105">With regard to cancer services generally, there has been considerable investment in the development of oncology services and symptomatic breast disease services in the South Eastern Health Board. Since the implementation of the national cancer strategy in 1997, an additional cumulative sum of approximately €30 million has been allocated to the South Eastern Health Board for the development of cancer services. This level of investment has enabled the approval of ten additional consultant posts in the South Eastern Health Board in key areas such as medical oncology, surgery, radiology and haematology. This level of investment in the south-eastern region has delivered significant benefits to cancer patients and their families.</summary>

A research project on fluoride delivery systems is currently being undertaken. The objective of this project is to evaluate the quality and performance of the fluoridation of public water supplies. It will determine best practice methodologies appropriate to all aspects of fluoridation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1187">There is a comprehensive system of monitoring of fluoride levels in the water supply by local authorities and health boards. The annual report of the Environmental Protection Agency on water quality confirms that more than 99.75% of analyses of Irish water supplies are within the recommended EU limit of 1.5 part fluoride per million parts of water and 94% are within the stricter Irish limit of one part fluoride per million parts of water.</p>
          <p eId="para_1188">As the Deputy is aware, I established the Forum on Fluoridation to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies in Ireland. The forum's report was launched on 10 September 2002 and its main conclusion was that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure. The forum also concluded that: water fluoridation has been very effective in improving the oral health of the Irish population, especially of children, but also of adults and the elderly; and the best available and most reliable scientific evidence indicates that at the maximum permitted level of fluoride in drinking water at one part per million, human health is not adversely affected.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_106">Dental fluorosis, a form of discolouration of the tooth enamel, is a well-recognised condition and an indicator of overall fluoride absorption, whether from natural sources, fluoridated water or from the inappropriate use of fluoride toothpaste at a young age. There is evidence that the prevalence of dental fluorosis is increasing in Ireland.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_107">The forum consisted of people with expert knowledge spanning the areas of public health, biochemistry, dental health, bone health, food safety, environmental protection, ethics, water quality, health promotion and representatives from the consumer and environmental areas.

          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p eId="para_1190">The Health Service Employers Agency undertakes quarterly surveys of nursing vacancies, the latest of which is for the year ending 31 March 2003. A copy of this survey will be forwarded directly to the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1191">The main points of the survey are: there were 1,543 extra nurses employed in the health service in the year ending 31 March 2003; 1,116 nurses were recruited from abroad in the year ending 31 March 2003; 307 nurses work every day in the hospitals as agency nurses; the vacancy rate now stands at 2.6% nationally.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_109">While all sectors reported that recruitment was well ahead of resignations-retirements, employers reported that 946 vacancies existed at 31 March 2003. However, the combination of utilising agency nurses and overtime adequately compensates for this shortfall. The current vacancy rate of 2.6% has been declining steadily in recent years and could be considered to be a normal frictional rate, given that there will always be some level of movement due to resignations, retire ments and nurses availing of opportunities to change employment and locations.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_110">The recruitment and retention of adequate numbers of nursing staff has been a concern of this Government for some time and a number of substantial measures have been introduced in recent years. These include: an increase of 70% in the number of nursing training places from 968 in 1998 to 1,640 in 2002; payment of fees to nurses-midwives undertaking part-time nursing and certain other undergraduate degree courses; improved scheme of financial support for student paediatric nurses; payment of fees and enhanced salary to nurses-midwives undertaking courses in specialised areas of clinical practice; abolition of fees for "back-to-practice" courses and payment of salary to nurses-midwives undertaking such courses; financial support to State enrolled nurses working in the Irish health service wishing to undertake nursing conversion programmes in the United Kingdom; and 40 sponsorships are made available each year for certain categories of health service employees wishing to train as nurses.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_111">I would like to illustrate the improvements that have taken place in nursing numbers generally in recent years. In 1998, there were 26,611 whole-time equivalent nurses employed in the public health system. By the end of 2002 this figure had reached 33,395. This is an increase of almost 6,800 – or over 25% – during the period. It is clear from these figures that the recruitment and retention measures I introduced are proving to be very effective.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1197">As the Deputies are aware, the Eastern Regional Health Authority is charged with responsibility for commissioning health and personal social services on behalf of the population of the region and also on behalf of those outside the region who are referred for specialist treatment. I wish to inform the Deputies that, on foot of an acknowledgement by all parties of the need for an overall development of the facilities at Crumlin Hospital, I approved the establishment of a project team to plan for the future development of the hospital. The team includes representatives from the hospital, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Department of Health and Children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1198">The first stage of the planning process involves writing a brief for the preparation of a development control plan that will set the context for future capital developments on the site. It is intended that a phased approach to new development and the upgrade of facilities will be taken. The plans will allow for the prioritisation of developments according to the service needs of the hospital and the ERHA, including infrastructural improvements in the haematology-oncology department and in the cardiology department, as well as the provision of MRI facilities on-site. A phased approach to the overall development will ensure that services continue to be provided at the hospital during the redevelopment of the facilities. A further major development, the new €30 million operating department, funded by the Exchequer, is currently being put in place at the hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_1199">I have met the New Crumlin Hospital Group, which is composed of parents of children who regularly attend Our Lady's Hospital for treatment. It was this group that commissioned the recent Pollock report on facilities at the hospital. As I have already said, the deficiencies highlighted in the Pollock report are well-known and accepted. I am committed to the redevelopment programme at Crumlin and have given the New Crumlin Hospital Group my assurance in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_1202">Possible measures to deal with overcrowding in the Mater accident and emergency department were outlined in a submission from the hospital to the ERHA. However, the authority has made it clear that those measures are not appropriate and has been assured by the hospital's chief executive that there is no question that patients attending the accident and emergency department will be treated anywhere other than in the department itself. In October 2002, I approved a capital grant of €1.355 million for the upgrading of the accident and emergency department at the Mater. This project, which includes the provision of additional resuscitation cubicles, the development of a chest pain assessment unit, and the establishment of a minor injury unit, will significantly improve facilities in the department and will also have knock-on benefits in relieving bed capacity pressure at the hospital. Work on the refurbishment project has now commenced.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_1206">The youth homelessness strategy was published on 31 October 2001. The health boards have lead responsibility for implementation of the strategy and they have prepared detailed action plans in this regard. I have given approval to these plans and they are being phased in over the period 2002-04. I understand that since the publication of the strategy, approximately 96 new staff – including management staff, project workers, social workers, family support workers, after-care workers and public health nurses – have been appointed across the ten health board regions, seven new units have opened nationwide and new and extended services have been developed in approximately 20 locations.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_115">The Deputy will be aware that, under the strategy, implementation is to be monitored by a committee chaired by the National Children's Office. It also comprises representation from the relevant stakeholders as follows: the Department of Health and Children; the Eastern Regional Health Authority and each health board outside the ERHA area; the Department of Education  and Science-Education Welfare Board; the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government; the Homeless Agency; and the voluntary sector.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_116">The committee is placing particular emphasis on cross-sectoral issues that require attention. Its work aims to add real value to the implementation process by grouping the strategy actions and rooting their implementation through detailed analysis and meaningful follow-up. The committee has established six sub-groups, which are being co-ordinated by the National Children's Office.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_117">I have been advised that the following three sub-groups have already commenced work: inter-agency co-ordination and linkages – an analysis of the significant current blockages has been carried out, solutions identified and agreed by the plenary committee and the sub-group is following up on the solutions in areas such as training, information systems, inter-agency protocols, internal organisational communications systems and policy proofing: after care, emergency response, assessment and emergency care – the key after-care issues are being identified, a questionnaire is being issued to all after-care workers to enable accurate assessment of progress to date, identification of problems with implementation, dissemination of best practice and planned solutions and the next plenary session will be devoted to discussion of the after-care analysis and actions for follow-up will be agreed; and statistics – it is acknowledged that there are difficulties in accurately measuring the number of homeless young people in Ireland.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_118">With regard to statistics, a project team was set up by the Department of Health and Children together with the health boards approximately two years ago to devise proposals for the establishment of a national standardised integrated child care information system. This will include a national youth homelessness database accessible to both voluntary and statutory service providers. An interim data set is being used in the meantime. In addition, the definition of youth homelessness used in the strategy has been interpreted differently by various health boards. The statistics sub group is currently examining ways of minimising the potential for such inconsistencies, pending the development of a national youth homelessness database. It is working closely with the Department of Health and Children project team and will submit its recommendations to both the project team and the YHS monitoring committee.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_119">I understand that the sub groups were prioritised as they cover the most critical areas of the youth homelessness strategy and that the committee considered that it would not be helpful for all six sub groups to proceed simultaneously. I am informed that work on the remaining sub groups will commence in the latter part of this year. The remaining sub groups are: education and training; support services, community development, co-ordination of family support services – this sub  group will link in with the Department of Health and Children's review of family support services which has recently commenced; information and advocacy.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1208">I refer to the Government's recently published health service reform programme. The Deputy will be aware that the programme draws on analysis made by Prospectus strategy consultants in the audit of structures and functions in the health system. In looking at the range of agencies operating within the sector, the consultants found: that complex and fragmented structures were an obstacle to achieving improvements; that there was scope for the rationalisation of certain agencies; and that there is a lack of standardisation and co-ordination across the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1209">They recommended a consolidated structure which forms the basis of the health service reform programme. This reorganisation of the system provides the opportunity to mainstream a number of agencies. The consultants suggested that four agencies with strong roles in policy development should have those functions subsumed into a restructured Department of Health and Children, which, in the new structure, will have an improved focus on policy formulation and evaluation. Any executive or operational functions of such agencies will be transferred to the appropriate mainstream delivery agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1210">The report acknowledges that the office and other specialist agencies have played a key role in the past. It emphasises the need to ensure that the skills and functions residing in these agencies be retained within the revised structures. It also recommends that, where particular commitments would be threatened by mainstreaming, "sunset" clauses should be established for relevant agencies to protect the completion of particular tasks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1211">My commitment to achieving a reduction in smoking in Ireland is well known. I am aware of the concerns raised by ASH. I would not take any action which might jeopardise the advances made to date by the Office for Tobacco Control. I will be considering the application of a sunset clause to this and the other specified agencies in due course. I will, at that time, consider the potential impact on the control of tobacco in this country, including the concerns raised by ASH, in the context of the broader need to streamline the structures and functions in the health system.</p>

          <p eId="para_1230">I am aware that the homeless are a high risk group in relation to a number of health conditions, including mental illness. Since 2000, the Department of Health and Children has allocated €18.34 million to health boards to deal with homelessness, with an additional €2.66 million allocated for 2003. The main difficulty in respect of adult homelessness has been in the Dublin area and, in order to address this, the Eastern Regional Health Authority appointed a director of homelessness who is working closely with the three area health boards in implementing the provisions of Homelessness – An Integrated Strategy, published in May 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_1231">The ERHA has commissioned the three area health boards to provide multidisciplinary mental health teams within homeless services. Responding to the needs of homeless people with mental health issues requires a multifaceted approach and these teams will play a key role in developing services that are responsive, targeted and effective. The services commissioned across the three area health boards include the following key elements: providing screening, assessment and treatment to homeless people with mental health problems; targeting those homeless people sleeping rough with mental health problems; bringing the mental health service to hostels, day centres and other settings where homeless people present; and providing support and consultancy to homeless services and their staff on mental health issues and concerns.</p>

          <p eId="para_1234">The health reform programme was announced on 18 June 2003. The programme's priority focus is improved patient care, better value for taxpayers' money and improved health care management. The reform programme has drawn on the conclusions and recommendations of the two reports, the Commission on Financial Management and Control Systems in the Health Service and the Audit of Structures and Functions in the Heath System, which were also published on the same day. The Government considered the recommendations made in both reports and has decided on a number of priority actions to move forward system reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_1235">These key actions are: a major rationalisation of existing health service agencies to reduce fragmentation, including the abolition of the existing health board-authority structures; the reorganisation of the Department of Health and Children to ensure improved policy development and oversight; the establishment of a health services executive which will be the first ever body charged with managing the health service as a single national entity; the executive to be organised on the basis of three core divisions, namely, a national hospitals office, primary, community and continuing care directorate, national shared services centre; the primary, community and continuing care directorate will be made up of four regional health offices of the health service executive, with existing community care structures at local level, to deliver regional and local services; the establishment of a health information and quality authority to ensure that quality of care is promoted throughout the system; and the modernisation of supporting processes, service planning, management reporting etc., so that they will be in line with recognised international best practice. The new structure set out in this reform programme will provide a clear national focus on service delivery and executive management. It will achieve this through reduced fragmentation and the creation of clear and unambiguous accountability throughout the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1236">As an immediate priority, the Government has decided to: establish an interim board of the health service executive and an interim national hospitals office to make early progress on the reform of the hospital sector and to help drive the overall implementation process; launch a communication process with stakeholders based on the Government's decisions – the process has already begun; and put in place robust structures to manage implementation of the reform programme.</p>

          <p eId="para_1247">The Government decided, in the context of the health strategy, to provide an additional 3,000 acute beds in hospitals over the period to 2011. This decision was taken on foot of a detailed national review of bed capacity entitled Acute Hospital Bed Capacity – A National Review, which was published in January 2001. Funding has been provided to commission an additional 709 acute beds, representing an increase of 6% in acute beds, in the period 2002 to 2003. My Department has been informed by health agencies that 551 of these beds are now open. At present my Department is examining the regional issues associated with the allocation of the remaining 3,000 acute beds.</p>
          <p eId="para_1248">The Deputy will appreciate that, due to the nature and complexity of the acute hospital system, the number of beds in use at any one time may fluctuate. On the day following the report by RTE that 500 hospital beds had been closed, my Department contacted health agencies and was informed that, in fact, a total of 338 beds were temporarily out of use for various reasons, including those of a financial nature.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_124">It is a feature of all acute hospital systems that some beds are out of use for short periods. In 2002, bed closures resulted from ward refurbishment, essential ward maintenance, staff leave, seasonal closures and infection control measures. The total bed days lost in 2002 as a result of these closures is equivalent to an average of 269 beds being closed, which represents approximately 2% of the overall available beds. Traditional seasonal  bed closures take place during the summer months in hospitals around the country.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_125">Under the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act 1996, health agencies are required to deliver a level of service consistent with their approved budgets. Given the level of funding available this year, the structuring of overall service plans by health agencies for 2003 may involve some containment of service activity in order to manage within budget. In order to contain activity and remain within budget some hospitals have temporarily closed some beds in 2003. These closures are in addition to the normal seasonal closures that take place in hospitals around the country during the holiday periods.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1254">As the Deputy is aware, I announced the national extension of BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme on 27 March 2003. The BreastCheck clinical unit in the southern area will be located at South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital, with three associated mobile units. Counties covered include Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Waterford and Tipperary South Riding. The BreastCheck clinical unit in the western area will be at University College Hospital Galway, with two associated mobile units. The area of coverage includes counties Galway, Sligo, Roscommon, Donegal, Mayo, Leitrim, Clare and Tipperary North Riding.</p>
          <p eId="para_1255">Under the extension, approximately 130,000 women in the target population 50 to 64 years of age will be eligible for screening. The programme expects to diagnose approximately 400 cancers per annum among this population.</p>
          <p eId="para_1256">Under the business plan submitted by BreastCheck to the Department, the national expansion of the programme to the west and the south is costed at €27 million, including €13million capital costs. It is anticipated that additional costs will be incurred by the host hospitals and these are being assessed at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_1257">Approval has issued for the establishment of two capital project teams to develop a brief for the capital infrastructure needed for the static units in the south and west. This approval will allow for the immediate commencement of the detailed planning for the national roll-out.</p>
          <p eId="para_1258">In respect of funding requirements, I do not anticipate additional revenue requirements for the programme this year. Revenue requirements for subsequent years will be considered in the context of the Estimates process. As regards capital costs, discussions are ongoing involving officials of my Department, BreastCheck and relevant health agencies. Discussions have also commenced concerning operational plans for the national roll-out, including linkages with the symptomatic services.</p>

          <p eId="para_1262">The broad thrust of admission policy in the psychiatric services in this country is to admit to in-patient care those patients whose illnesses, on the basis of clinical judgment in each individual case, are deemed to be of such severity as to be inappropriate for community-based treatment. Substantial progress has been made in recent years in ensuring that those in need of mental health services receive care and treatment in the most appropriate setting. In this regard, health boards have developed, and are continuing to develop, a modern comprehensive community-based mental health service. This has resulted in a continuing decline in the number of in-patients in recent years with a corresponding increase in the provision of a range of care facilities based in the community to complement in-patient services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1263">It is my intention to continue the growth in alternatives to hospitalisation, with the further development of community-based services throughout the country. Significant additional funding, both capital and revenue, has been provided by my Department in recent years for this purpose.</p>

          <p eId="para_1272">Responsibility for the provision of the services referred to by the Deputy is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the area health boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_1273">The Eastern Regional Health Authority has reported that the current statistics in relation to numbers awaiting assessment in St. Louise's assessment and treatment service at Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin are 38 on the waiting list with a further 16 where further information is required. In relation to treatment, the numbers are six awaiting treatment and a further four where further information is required. In an attempt to reduce the waiting times for assessment, the hospital decided to appoint two additional staff to the unit earlier this year and to increase the number of consultant hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_1274">When the authority was made aware of the current difficulties with waiting times for the services at St. Louise's assessment and treatment service, a review of the child sexual abuse assessment and treatment services in the eastern region was commenced. This includes a review of the services provided at St. Claire's unit, Temple Street Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_1275">Following the establishment of a steering group to oversee the review process, monitor progress and develop recommendations and the appointment of dedicated researcher, some interim findings have emerged to date and work is ongoing. Two progress reports on the review to date were presented to the Eastern Regional Health Authority board members in April and June 2003. The key findings reported in April were that although the numbers being referred have reduced over the past 12 months, the waiting times have increased. The primary factors contributing to this were identified as: complexity of cases, amount of time spent on court work, difficulties in relation to recruitment and retention of specialist staff, training and induction of staff and delays associated with obtaining the required level of information from the various referral sources.</p>
          <p eId="para_1276">Further extensive interviews and site visits identified further challenges within the current arrangements relating to capacity for referrals. I understand that the resource implications of measures to address the waiting list issue will be the subject of discussions between the provider agencies and the authority.

          <p eId="para_1277">I wish to assure the Deputy that I will be closely monitoring the situation. I am urging the Eastern Regional Health Authority to complete this review as early as possible. I am committed to ensuring that the current waiting time situation is improved.</p>

      the investigation he intends to carry out into a serious rise in the incidence of lung cancers among people in the east of the country, highlighted in the recent annual report of the EHRA; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [17544/03]

        </question>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_549">
          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p eId="para_1279">The annual report of the ERHA referred to by the Deputy states that cancer incidence, for males and females, is significantly higher in the eastern region than the national average, based on data for the years 1994-97, and excluding non-melanoma skin cancer. This is mainly due to lung cancer, which accounts for approximately one in every five male cancers and one in even ten female cancers. Over two fifths – 42% – of all lung cancers in the country occur in the region. The report further states that annually, there are over 600 lung cancers in the region, that at least 500 of these could be prevented if people did not smoke and that smoking prevention is a major priority for the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_1280">The National Cancer Registry has informed my Department that for the period 1994-99, the European age standardised incidence rates, EASR, of lung cancer for the ERHA were significantly higher than that observed for Ireland overall, with rates for females and males 36% and 35% higher than the national rates. The National Cancer Registry has concluded that the higher rates of lung cancer in the ERHA presumably indicate, or reflect, higher rates of smoking – past or present – among the population there, compared with the national average. For example, a preliminary analysis of 1994-99 data indicates that, among patients diagnosed with invasive cancer in Ireland, residents of the ERHA are 14% more likely than the overall Irish population to have ever smoked, that is, either current or ex-smokers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1281">The national cancer strategy acknowledges that the cause of most cancers is multi-factorial but that there is strong evidence that lifestyle factors, in particular smoking, alcohol and diet play an important role. The promotion of healthy lifestyles is a key element of the work of my Department's Health Promotion Unit and spending by the unit since the launch of the national cancer strategy on these topics is in excess of €17 million. The Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002 signifies my commitment to a range of anti-smoking measures. In this regard, I announced on 30 January last, my decision to ban smoking in all workplaces from 1 January 2004. This ban will include the hospitality industry where many workers are exposed to passive smoking.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_127">In 2002, the health promotion unit commissioned the second phase of the national health and lifestyle surveys. The positive trends from this survey show that: across almost all demographic categories smoking rates have fallen but this trend has been most marked among girls and young women, a key target for our recent anti-smoking initiatives; the overall rate of smoking in schoolgoing children has fallen and while overall  exposure to tobacco smoke is down, the rates of exposure at work and in pub and clubs remain high.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_128">While these trends in smoking are positive, much work remains to be done. Since the implementation of the national cancer strategy commenced in 1997, there has been a cumulative additional investment of approximately €400 million in the development of appropriate treatment and care services for people with cancer. In recognition of the need to further develop cancer services, the national health strategy identified the need for a new national cancer strategy. The national cancer strategy 2003 is being developed by the national cancer forum in conjunction with my Department. This strategy will build on the progress that has been made during the implementation of the first national cancer strategy and set out the key investment areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the coming years, including the area of health promotion. The strategy will have regard to developments and best practice in other jurisdictions and will make recommendations in relation to the organisation and structure of cancer services nationally.</summary>

The group submitted its report to me on 24 April 2003. In preparing its report, the group conducted a national assessment of needs for radiotherapy services having regard to the demography and epidemiology of cancer and the gaps in current service provision. All health boards have been afforded the opportunity to meet with and  make submissions on a number of occasions to the group.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_133">The report addresses the following key issues. These include access to radiotherapy services, in terms of information, financial access and organisational components of access; the need to provide a high quality, evidence based service; the need to take account of current and new developments in health technology; the requirements of the system in terms of human resources; international norms in relation to service provision, planning and staffing; the organisational development of the services in terms of structures and processes which need to be in place in a radiotherapy facility. The completion of the report took longer than was originally envisaged by the group due to the complexity of the issues involved, the broadly based consultation process undertaken, and the need to reflect fully on the recommendations. In addition, research was commissioned on patient needs and priorities.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_134">Given the significance attached to the report and its implications for the development of radiation oncology services nationally, it is necessary for me to submit the report to the Government. I advised the Dáil of my intentions in this regard on 7 May 2003. It is also necessary that there be consultation at inter departmental level, including with the Department of Finance, prior to consideration by Government. It is anticipated that the report will be considered by Government shortly, after which it will be published.</summary>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Fahey)</from>
          <p eId="para_1293">I propose to take Questions Nos. 165, 166 and 169 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1294">In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment, participation levels are gradually being reduced reflecting the significant reduction in the numbers of the long-term unemployed, and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment. The average participation rate on the programme during 2003 is expected to be in the region of 22,500, which amounts to a reduction of 5,000 places approximately, phased over the year. The allocation of places and renewal of individual CE projects, throughout the country, is a matter for FÁS. The level of participation on CE as at year-end is as follows: 39,039, 39,520, 36,579, 33,549, 30,809, 24,991, 20,000 – target. There are currently – 30 May 2003 – 22,769 participants in CE schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1295">Drugs task force activity and child care service provision are ring-fenced from any reductions and projects in RAPID areas are given priority. CE places in the health sector, which includes personal assistant services, are being maintained at existing levels to ensure continuity of the delivery of these services. However, such places are subject to the normal eligibility requirements for the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1296">All health service related CE projects including those sponsored by the Irish Wheelchair Association, have been ring-fenced from reductions that have taken place as a result of reducing the CE programme to 20,000 places by the end of 2003. During 2002, when CE places were being reduced, FÁS ensured that these designated health CE places were untouched and that the places were maintained as agreed. I understand the difficulties being encountered by organisations such as the Irish Wheelchair Association which have difficulty in replacing participants due to the lack of suitable applicants coming forward for the programme. However, CE is an active labour market programme and the concept of progression by participants is central to such a programme.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_139">A number of reviews of CE are currently under way. The PPF provides for an overall appraisal of active labour market programmes to be carried out and this work is being undertaken under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market, which is chaired by my Department. In  addition, a cross-departmental senior officials group has been asked to consider options for the future of CE, taking account of the link with the provision of community services. FÁS is also currently completing an internal review of CE and the job initiative programme, which is well advanced and should be finalised shortly. The outcome of these various initiatives will inform the Government's consideration of options for the future of these programmes.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1298">I presume the Deputy is referring to the final report of the competition and mergers review group, which was published in 2000. The review group made wide-ranging recommendations in relation to competition and merger law and I implemented many of their recommendations via the Competition Act 2002 by reforming and consolidating competition and merger legislation into one statute. One of the recommendations of the review group proposed that the Groceries Order should be repealed, a view shared by the Competition Authority. However, following my consideration of the views of all interested parties and taking into account the interest of consumers, I decided to retain the order in October 2000, while also indicating that the matter would be kept under review.</p>
          <p eId="para_1299">Since then there have been a number of changes in the grocery sector, in particular the arrival of the so-called "discounters" who continue to increase their share of the market. In addition, as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I am dedicated to tackling any factors which impinge negatively on consumers or which contribute to inflationary pressures. In the light of this I am currently considering what action, if any, is appropriate in relation to the Groceries Order.</p>
          <p eId="para_1300">The size of shops is an issue covered by the retail planning guidelines, which are the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who recently announced his intention to carry out a review of the guidelines. I understand that it is anticipated that any such review will examine the performance of the guidelines to date and will involve a consultation process with interested parties.</p>

Therefore, if the person concerned is 66 years of age as supplied in the details to the question, he would unfortunately not be eligible for a statutory redundancy lump sum payment. However, computer records of the Department of Social and Family Affairs show that the person concerned was born on 6 June 1938. If this is indeed his correct date of birth, and provided he fulfils the other conditions – has at least two years' service and is fully insurable if he is a full-time worker – he could then be entitled to a statutory redundancy lump sum payment. His birth certificate could be used to clarify this matter.</p>

In 2002, again following an approach from the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association on the issue of payment of security duty allowance, I gave a commitment that in situations where Reserve personnel perform duties, in addition to their training, which are normally performed by Permanent Defence Force personnel, the reservists would, in future, be paid the appropriate allowances as paid to their Permanent Defence Force counterparts. These situations arise mainly in the performance of security duties which attract the payment of security duty allowance. This will only apply in situations where reserve personnel are posted to duties, normally performed by Permanent Defence Force personnel, which attract security duty allowance and have the required level of qualifications or training to hold such posts. Payment will be retrospective to March 2002.</p>

Payment of the 80% advance instalment amounting to €3,478.80 issued on 16 October 2002. This was in respect of 19.4 animals, which is the total number of quota rights on record. When processing the application for balance payment it was found that incorrect movement details for two animals, tag numbers HUA654708 and MWFV0298C were recorded on CMMS. Amendments are now being prepared by the mart involved to rectify this matter. It was also found at an inspection of the herd on 19 March 2003 that occurrences in relation to four animals were not registered on CMMS. The herd owner was notified earlier this month that a resultant penalty would apply because of this non-compliance under paragraph 32 of the terms and conditions of the scheme. The person named contacted the District Livestock Office on 23 June 2003 to inform it that he will be seeking a review and requested in the meantime that the application be processed further on the basis of the findings at inspection. This has now been put through for payment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1334">The person named sought an exemption from certain qualifying conditions of the early retirement scheme on grounds of ill health. He had ceased farming in 1995 and, in consequence, was unable to satisfy a number of conditions including the requirement to have been engaged in farming for the ten calendar years prior to the date of transfer or lease of his land to an eligible transferee.</p>
          <p eId="para_1335">The scheme includes a provision for scheme conditions to be waived where an applicant cannot meet them for certain reasons beyond his or her control, including long-term incapacity. My Department, while sympathetic to the situation of the person named, concluded that an exemption could not be granted in his case because he had been out of farming for over eight years. The early retirement scheme is fundamentally a restructuring scheme intended to encourage older farmers to retire early and give over their land to younger farmers. The fact that the person named has been out of farming for so long made it very difficult to accept that he was still in any meaningful sense a farmer. It is considered that the granting of an exemption in this case would have stretched the interpretation of the scheme beyond reasonable limits. The person named was informed of this decision and advised of his right of appeal to the agriculture appeals office.</p>

          <p eId="para_1362">Section 3(2) of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 excludes credit unions from the scope of the Act. This means, <i>inter alia,</i> that they are not bound by the provisions of the Act that relate to advertising, including the obligation to quote an annual percentage rate or APR, or to credit agreements. These provisions derive mainly from the 1987 consumer credit directive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1363">Although the Consumer Credit Act 1995 does not apply to credit unions, the fact that their activities and rules have to be in accordance with the Credit Union Act 1997 provides a substantial measure of consumer protection for their customers. The European Commission is of the opinion that Ireland, by excluding credit unions from the scope of the 1995 Act, failed to transpose the directive correctly. While I do not necessarily accept all of the Commission's conclusions in this regard, I am examining the matter. I am considering whether to propose the repeal of the section 3(2) exclusion in order to bring credit unions within the full scope of the Act. However, my preference is for an approach which would recognise and be supportive of the uniqueness of credit unions, while addressing effectively the appropriate regulatory and consumer protection requirements that arise.</p>

          <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</from>
          <p eId="para_1410">One of the key principles underpinning the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act is the fact that the fund is managed by commissioners who are independent of Government. The commissioners control and manage the fund with discretionary authority to determine and implement an investment strategy. The Act requires the commission to follow a strictly commercial investment mandate with the objective of securing the optimal return over the long-term, subject to prudent risk management. In following this mandate, the commission has decided on a long-term asset allocation of 80% equities and 20% bonds.</p>
          <p eId="para_1411">These features of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Act are similar to the trustee arrangements which exist in private pension funds. Along with the statutory prohibition on drawdowns from the fund prior to 2025, they insulate the fund from day-to-day pressures on Government and enable the commission to take a long-term view. This is essential if the purpose for which the fund was established, to meet as much as possible of the cost to the Exchequer of pension payments from 2025 until at least 2055, is to be achieved.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_143">Consistent with the philosophy underpinning the fund as I have just set it out, I do not regularly ask the commission for detailed reports on short-term investment returns. The fund's investment strategy is a matter for the commission and I have no say in it. It is my strong view that regular discussions between me and the commission on its investment strategy and the resultant short-term gains and losses, which may in any event never be realised, would seriously interfere with the long-term focus which must attach to a fund which will not start to make significant disbursements for over 30 years. I draw the Deputy's attention to the detailed provisions in the Act concerning the format of the commission's statu tory annual report to the Minister for Finance. The commission is specifically required to include in the report information on the investment strategy followed, a report on the investment return achieved by the fund and a valuation of the net assets of the fund at year end. These requirements are designed to ensure that detailed information concerning the fund is made available to the public at the appropriate time.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_144">The commission's report for 2002 is due around mid-2003. The assets of the fund were held in cash up to 31 December 2001 and the Commission commenced entry into the markets in 2002. By end-December 2002 a total of €8,163 million had been paid into the NPRF since its inception in April 2001 by way of capital contributions from the Exchequer. Further capital contributions amounting to €551.5 million have been made this year to date bringing the total Exchequer contribution to €8,715 million. The provisional market value of the fund at end 2002, the latest date for which figures have been published by the commission, was €7,425 million that is, a decline of €736 million which represents the difference between the capital contributions by the Exchequer and the market value at end 2002. This decline is a net figure which takes account of investment income in both the temporary holding fund and the fund itself and also of gains in the bond portion of the fund offset by declines in the value of equities. The investment return since the fund's inception to end December 2002, measured according to industry standards, was 13.3% compared with a return for the fund's strategic benchmark of 24.4% and a return for the average Irish managed pension fund of 19.3%. I am advised that the chairman of the commission, in giving evidence to the Committee of Public Accounts on 19 June 2003, said that in the five and a half months to 17 June 2003 the fund has earned a net return of 5.5% and that the net decline in the value of the fund at that date was around €300 million.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1413">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that much of the spirits sold in Ireland is sourced from manufacturers and distributors outside the State and they come within the excise system. Additionally, I am informed that there are a number of UK based drinks companies with depots in the State which have traditionally sourced their supplies of alcoholic products, including spirits, in the UK and account for their excise duty payments at various points of importation, including  the facilitation stations on the land frontier. It is not considered that the recent strengthening of the euro has impacted on the volumes involved. As regards consumers, a recent cross-Border price survey of excisable products indicated that spirits and other alcohols are now cheaper in the sterling area. As the Deputy will be aware, cross-frontier differentials in price can influence consumer behaviour and ultimately impact on tax receipts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1414">In accordance with the Single Market arrangements private shoppers may bring into the country considerable quantities of duty paid spirits from other member states for personal use. Revenue keeps such developments under review to ensure that abuses of the system are detected. In the case of the licensed trade, the situation is being closely monitored in liaison with the drinks industry, and appropriate action is being taken on a case by case basis with over 11,000 litres of alcoholic products being seized in 2002 and over 6,500 litres having been seized so far in 2003. In addition, since the end of 2001, 22 licensed premises have been detected in possession of illicit spirits some of which is believed to have originated in Northern Ireland. Six of these cases have already been successfully prosecuted and further cases will come before the courts in the coming months.</p>

          <p eId="para_1416">I assume the Deputy is referring to the excise income on spirits for the period 1 January 2003 to date and also for the years pre-1984. As the Deputy will be aware, in my budget 2003, I announced an increase in excise duty of 20 cent – VAT inclusive – on a standard measure of spirits. The excise duty rate on spirit-based alcopops was also increased to the full spirit rate. This meant an increase of approximately 35 cent – VAT inclusive – on a bottle of this product. These increases took effect from midnight on 4 December 2002. The total excise net receipts for spirits for the period 1 January 2003 to end May 2003 – latest available figures – is €106.8 million. The performance of tax revenues, including excise duties, depends much on the performance of the economy which has been sluggish. While we hope to benefit from the international pick-up in economic activity which is forecast for the last quarter of 2003, it is generally recognised that the risks to economic projections are decidedly on the downside at this time.</p>

This compares with 2,847,886 litres and 2,877,381 litres released in the corresponding period in 2002 and 2001 respectively. While these figures show a drop in volume in the order of -18.9% for 2003, a comparison for the periods November to May 2002-03, which takes account of the high level of pre-budget clearances, shows total volumes down by -4.9%.</p>

          <p eId="para_1430">Sexually transmitted diseases are among the most common causes of illness in the world and have far-reaching health, social and economic consequences. They affect both industrialised and developing countries. The increasing mobility of populations and weakening of tradit ional customs seem to be increasing the prevalence of people having sexual relations with multiple partners. Apart from their specific symptoms, STDs also increase the risk of HIV infection. As the world enters the third decade of the HIV-AIDS epidemic, the evidence of its impact is undeniable. By far the worst-affected region, sub-Saharan Africa is now home to 29.4 million people living with HIV-AIDS. Approximately 3.5 million new infections occurred there in 2002, while the epidemic claimed the lives of an estimated 2.4 million Africans in the past year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1431">The transmission of HIV occurs in a number of ways, including heterosexual transmission, unsafe injections, blood transfusions and from HIV positive mothers to their unborn children, as pointed out in the <i>Sunday Business Post </i>article of 15 June 2003. However, it is widely acknowledged by leading experts, including the World Health Organisation, that heterosexual transmission accounts for most of the HIV infections in the developing world. Efforts to halt the spread of HIV-AIDS need to take a comprehensive approach incorporating components to prevent the spread of the virus and to mitigate its impact. Strategies to halt the spread of HIV need to focus on promoting behaviour change and access to condoms. High risk groups – injecting drug users and commercial sex workers – need to be the target of specific interventions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1432">Women, in particular, are at a high risk of HIV infection for biological and sociological reasons. Unequal gender relations need to be considered in all programmes established to prevent the spread of HIV, including condom use and distribution, behavioural change communication strategies and awareness-raising of HIV. The provision of health care for HIV infected people needs to address weaknesses in health systems in developing countries including the lack of qualified health workers, inadequate infrastructure, and poor laboratory facilities. Administering anti-retroviral drugs requires qualified health staff as strict regimens need to be followed in order to ensure their efficacy. The provision of care and support for those infected and affected by HIV is also required alongside prevention and treatment programmes in order to address the needs of those living with HIV.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_145">Ireland Aid is contributing to the global response to prevent the spread of HIV and mitigate its impact on developing countries. The Government's global response to HIV-AIDS, which is guided by the HIV-AIDS strategy for the Ireland Aid programme 2000, involves advocacy for a sustained and resourced response to HIV-AIDS; strengthening leadership at all levels; and improving co-ordination of resources and planning across Departments. At country level Ireland Aid's support focuses on developing the capacity of partner Governments and national AIDS councils to prevent the spread of HIV-AIDS and to mitigate the social and economic consequences of the pandemic. The funding provided through the Ireland Aid programme is  made available to a range of organisations at global, regional and country levels.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_146">Funding resources for HIV-AIDS interventions have increased over the past five years to €50 million today. This funding is directed at HIV-AIDS activities primarily focused on Africa and implemented through international organisations, NGOs, regional initiatives and in programme countries. A number of activities have been supported in 2003 including the global fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria; AIDS vaccine research initiative; and prevention, care and support activities. In addition to these health is one of the key sectors supported by Ireland Aid. Ireland's support for health is guided by an explicit policy framework, outlined in the Ireland Aid guidelines for health, April 2000. This framework has facilitated the growth in health sector expenditure by Ireland Aid and the support of programmes that strongly reflect the principles of national ownership and the strengthening of health systems at country level. In addition some funds are directed at priority programmes such as malaria, TB or reproductive health, which merit additional support because of their contribution to addressing the major burden of disease.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1436">The Government has made clear to the US authorities its concern that the detainees in Guantanamo Bay be treated in accordance with the provisions of international human rights and humanitarian law. This concern is shared by our partners in the EU and by a number of other states.</p>
          <p eId="para_1437">I understand that the US authorities are in the process of setting up military commissions before which selected persons currently detained at Guantanamo Bay may be tried for terrorist activities.

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_147">I am aware of recent media reports of a possible use of the death penalty in relation to detainees at Guantanamo Bay. Ireland's position on the death penalty is well known to the US authorities. Ireland is among those countries which have outlawed the death penalty and,  together with our partners in the EU, we remain firmly opposed to the death penalty in all cases, irrespective of the circumstances involved. The Government believes that the abolition of the death penalty contributes to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights, and are committed to achieving its universal abolition.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_148">In conjunction with our EU partners, and in accordance with the common EU guidelines on the issue of the death penalty, we have expressed our concern to the government of the United States at the continued use of the death penalty on a number of occasions by means of general and case-specific demarches and will continue to do so. The Government is of the view that these approaches at EU level carry greater significance than individual bilateral interventions.</summary>

The application was assessed by members of my Department's inspectorate, in accordance with the defined criteria for the programme as outlined in the relevant circular. In this regard, it should be noted that the criteria for inclusion in the programme were amended in 2003 and course organisers were advised that  courses in curricular areas were required to reflect clearly the strands/strand units, content, methodologies and assessment practices promoted in the primary school curriculum. Furthermore, course organisers were advised that courses which focused on a single strand or strand unit of the curriculum would not be approved.</p>

The timetable and the content of the course were amended to include aspects relating to the games strand of the physical education element of the primary school curriculum. The appeal was considered. However, it was concluded that despite the amendments to the timetable and content, the course did not sufficiently meet the criteria for approval of summer courses and accordingly the decision was not changed.

Government policy objectives in this area are: to improve participation rates and outcomes in schools in the first instance and, where this strategy has not met the needs  of the individual learner, to provide for second-chance education and training such as Youthreach for those who left school early, particularly those who left without any qualification.

The standard rate of capitation grant for primary schools was substantially increased from €57.14 per pupil in 1997 to €111.58 per pupil in 2003. This represented an increase of 95% in the standard rate of capitation grant at primary level over the period. In addition, the ancillary services grant has been increased from €38.09 – £30 – per pupil in 1999 to €127 per pupil in 2003. Since 1997, significant improvements have been made in the level of funding to voluntary secondary schools. For example, the standard per capita grant in 1997 was €224.74. This has been increased to €266.49  in the current school year. An additional per capita grant of €38.09 is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the total per capita grant in the case of these schools to over €300. In addition, under the school services support initiative, second level schools have benefited from further significant increases in the support services grant from €25.40 per pupil in the year 2000 to €99 per pupil this school year. The level of capitation grants for 2004 will be reviewed as part of the normal Estimates process.</p>

          <p eId="para_1615">Individual school authorities are responsible, in the first instance, for ensuring the safety and welfare of children and others in their care. Officials from my Department's building unit have, however, recently met the board of management of Scoil Mhuire Fatima, Drogheda, and requested that the board prepare a report prioritising the immediate improvement works required at the school. When this has been completed my Department will consider the report having regard to the scope for providing funding for the most urgent of these works from within the contingency sum for emergencies set out in the building programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1616">The position in relation to the permanent accommodation project for Scoil Mhuire Fatima is that my Department does not intend to allow further large-scale projects into architectural planning during 2003. The timing of when individual projects, including Scoil Mhuire Fatima, can progress to architectural planning will depend on the budgetary allocation for 2004 and subsequent years, the rate of progress with existing projects in architectural planning and the priority afforded to each project by reference to the published criteria for prioritising large-scale building projects. In the meantime, individual schools should use their devolved grant to deal with the most urgent health and safety works.</p>

          <p eId="para_1620">Primary schools participating in Giving Children an Even Break are in receipt of a range of additional supports, including teacher posts and other non-teaching supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme. These levels of disadvantage were established as a result of a comprehensive survey of primary schools carried out by the Educational Research Centre, ERC, in March-April 2000 at the request of my Department. A total of 2,351 primary schools identified as having pupils enrolled with characteristics of disadvantage have been invited to participate in Giving Children an Even Break.</p>
          <p eId="para_1621">Giving Children an Even Break has both an urban and rural dimension as previous research has shown that educational disadvantage manifests itself differently in urban and rural settings. Scoil Phadraig Naofa is included in the urban dimension and is benefiting from the allocation of supplementary grant aid towards providing additional educational supports for the children concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1622">Schools categorised as urban in Giving Children an Even Break with the highest concentrations of at-risk pupils are supported, where necessary, through staff allocations to implement reduced pupil/teacher ratios of 20:1 in junior classes – infants through second class – and 27:1 in senior classes – third through sixth class. The school was not considered eligible for additional teaching staff, based on the level of concentration of at risk pupils in the school as reflected in the Educational Research Centre survey outcome. Representations from schools in relation to the outcome of the survey carried out in 2000, including the school referred to by the Deputy, were considered by my Department in consultation with the Educational Research Centre. Following this process, the school involved was informed in October 2002 that there would be no alteration in the existing level of support provided under Giving Children An Even Break.</p>
          <p eId="para_1623">My Department has received a further submission from the school in question but unfortunately the appeals process is now complete. However, the points raised in the school's new submission will be considered in the context of any future disadvantage programmes.</p>

          <p eId="para_1625">The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year. The number of mainstream posts is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is finalised for a particular school year following discussions with the education partners. The staffing schedule is set out in a circular which issues from my Department to the board of management of each primary school. Accordingly, all boards are aware of the staffing position for their school in any school year. The staffing schedule for the coming school year, 2003-04, is outlined in my Department's circular 9/03, which issued to all primary schools in February 2003 and is also available on the Department's website.</p>
          <p eId="para_1626">The enrolment of the school referred to by the Deputy on 30 September 2002 was 324. An enrolment of 325 is required for the appointment of the 12th mainstream teacher and, as this enrolment figure was not reached, the appointment of the 12th mainstream class teacher is not warranted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1627">I established an independent appeals board to adjudicate on appeals from boards of management on the mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. Appeals are considered in accordance with criteria laid down by the Minister for Education and Science from time to time. The current criteria are set out in my Department's circular 19/02. The appeals board operates independently of the Minister and the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_1628">The staffing of the school in question for the 2003-04 school year was considered by the appeals board. The board, having considered the appeal, was satisfied that a departure from the staffing schedule is not warranted in this case. The board of management of the school was notified of the decision of the appeals board in April, 2003. The decision of the appeals board is final. I am sure you the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent appeals board.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_159">The 2003 school building programme can be accessed on my Department's website at www.education.ie. Section 8 of the building programme lists the 20 schools that were invited to participate in a pilot initiative to all small schools undertake building and modernisation works on a devolved basis. The maximum level of grants under this initiative ranged from €100,000 to €350,000 depending on the size of each school and having regard to their level of pupil enrolments. As part of the recent update of the school building programme, my Department invited a further 20 pri mary schools to participate in a second pilot initiative that is aimed at reducing the amount of temporary accommodation required in primary schools. These schools are listed in section 13 of the updated programme. This initiative enables each of these schools to undertake a permanent solution to their immediate classroom accommodation needs within a maximum grant level of €100,000 per classroom. Under these initiatives, school authorities are responsible for project planning and construction and therefore the timeframe for the completion of each project is a matter for the relevant school authority.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1637">A number of meetings have taken place between senior officials in my Department and their counterparts in the Department of Health and Children in relation to the establishment of the National Council for Special Education and the drafting of the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill. Further discussions are proposed. I consider the establishment of the council and the publication of the Bill to be key developments in advancing the structural and legislative measures which are necessary to underpin the development and delivery of services for persons with special needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1638">With regard to the Bill, my officials have completed the consultation process with the various interests groups. The Bill will take into account the views which emerged from these consultations. I intend to bring the legislation to Government shortly and anticipate its publication before the end of the month. My objective is to bring forward legislation which will identify the special educational needs of children with disabilities and which will provide for an education appropriate to their needs as early as possible in their lives; which will ensure that parents have a central role in their child's education; which will provide for the planning for the child's future special education needs as an adult; and which will ensure that the various agencies involved in providing for special education and related support services are required to act within specified time limits.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_160">I also propose that the legislation will build on and strengthen the structures set out in the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2002, especially the National Council for Special Education and the Special Education Appeals Board. It will also be an objective for revised legislation that it will closely dovetail where necessary with  legislation being prepared by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform relating to the broader issue of services for people with disabilities.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_161">A key focus of my Department has been on advancing the fundamental structural measures which are necessary to underpin the development and delivery of services for persons with special needs.

        <summary eId="sum_162">The proposed draft order to establish a National Council for Special Education sets out three broad functions for the council: to carry out research and provide expert advice to the Minister on the educational needs of children with disabilities and the provision of related services, to provide for a range of services at local and national level in order that the educational needs of children with disabilities are identified and provided for, and to co-ordinate the provision of educational and related support services to children with disabilities in consultation with health boards, schools and other relevant bodies.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_163">In practical terms, this will translate into the definition by the council, on foot of research that it conducts or commissions, of appropriate educational responses for categories of special need, along with assistance by the council in the delivery of educational services to individual children at ground level through its provision of information, co-ordination and facilitation services. The draft order proposes a measure of independence for the council in carrying out its research function as it provides that the council shall, as it considers appropriate, publish the findings of its research in such form and manner as it thinks fit.</summary>

      [17456/03]

        <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_654">
          <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_1640">The provision of telecommunications services is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market. However, in order to more rapidly achieve the Government's stated aim of open-access, affordable, always-on broadband infrastructure and services, approximately €200 million of funding under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 is being utilised to leverage and accelerate investment in competitive advanced infrastructure and services, to enhance the potential for the development of  electronic commerce, and to enable the electronic provision of public services, including education, welfare and health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1641">My Department has run a number of programmes of targeted intervention in recent years. Under the National Development Plan 1994-1999 and INTERREG II, over €26.5 million was made available to support 13 projects which rolled-out broadband infrastructure nationwide. One of the projects funded under this measure was the Esat rollout of fibre optic cable in many urban areas, including Dundalk. The 4.5 kilometre Dundalk ring allows the provision of first-class telecommunications services to such locations as Dundalk Regional Technical College, the Finnabair Industrial Estate and the Coes Road Industrial Estate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1642">On foot of submissions received following the first Call for Proposals in 2000, nine contracts were signed which will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure and increased availability of broadband services for business and residential users. The projects involved are scheduled to be completed by the end of 2003 and include the construction of a new national fibre backbone by ESB Telecoms, which will serve both Drogheda and Dundalk, and Esat BTs rollout of Digital Subscriber Lines in 40 locations including Drogheda.</p>
          <p eId="para_1643">Eircom upgraded its exchange in Drogheda as a matter of urgency in recent months and is now in a position to offer Digital Subscriber Line services on 17,000 lines in the town. Esat BTs DSL service has been available to Drogheda customers since autumn 2002. I also understand that eircom offers DSL services on 16,000 lines in Dundalk. For technical reasons, subscribers need to be within approximately 3.5 kilometres of a DSL-enabled telephone exchange in order to avail of DSL services. The rollout is proceeding as quickly as possible; it is expected that 145 exchanges nationwide will have DSL by July 2003, and eircom plans to have 1.2 million telephone lines DSL-enabled by March 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_1644">Following the second call for proposals, the interdepartmental working group on telecommunications recommended in March 2002 the design and construction of metropolitan area fibre networks in 19 towns and cities across the country. These networks are now under construction, and will be coming into service from later this year. My Department is currently giving active consideration to the construction of additional metropolitan area networks in the north-east.</p>
          <p eId="para_1645">My Department is also exploring the potential of wireless-based technology to promote the deployment of broadband, particularly in remote areas. Pilot projects utilising wireless local area network, LAN, technologies are currently under way to assess their suitability for the delivery of advanced broadband services in the regions. One of these trial projects is being conducted by Digiweb in County Louth, and I expect the final report on the trials to be submitted in October 2003.</p>

However, the report concluded that ownership of the southern or left bank is not definitive. The report also concluded that the portion of the river from the high water mark to Dooghs townland would belong to the State unless evidence of a crown grant giving title to a private person is forthcoming.</p>
          <p eId="para_1652">I am advised that a subsequent report furnished by the title research unit in January 2002 on the Lower Caragh River and portion of Caragh Lake concluded that the rights to fish Caragh Lake and River including the estuary which Seefin Fisheries Limited purchased from KRD Fisheries Limited is good title and should be robust enough to withstand any legal challenge. While I would stress that these reports in themselves do not establish title, nevertheless my Department has no reason to doubt that Seefin Fisheries Limited hold good title to the area of fisheries involved.</p>

An important input into the thinking of these groups will be the feedback from the consultation process with stakeholders which has commenced and will be completed in the autumn. It is intended that many of these projects will have specified outputs to be delivered in agreed timeframes. However, there are a number of projects which will have a longer timeframe and for which full implementation will need to be managed in the context of an agreed industrial relations protocol. The renegotiation of the consultants and general medical services contract will commence quickly but may take some time to complete.</summary>

The proposed additions to the list of products for which the E.M.E.A. will be responsible will not have a significant impact on the work of the board. It should be noted that the Board carries out its own assessment of these products and in some instances, acting as rapporteur or co-rapporteur, carries out assessments on behalf of the other member states.

          <p eId="para_1748">The most recent report of the national cancer  registry, Cancer in Ireland, 1994 to 1998: Incidence, Mortality, Treatment and Survival, finds that incidence rates of prostate cancer in men in all age groups and 65 and over showed statistically significant increases. However, mortality rates showed no evidence of an upward or downward time trend. The report states that the evidence of a divergence between incidence and mortality rates may be due to better case-finding, more incidental diagnoses or a genuine increase in survival. The report further states that the increase in incidence rates in men under 65 years of age appears to be a recent phenomenon and that it is notable how little mortality rates have changed over this same period of time. The report concludes that it is unclear from the figures if mortality trends will change much in the future but considers that it is unlikely that incidence rates will continue their steady climb.</p>
          <p eId="para_1749">As the Deputy is aware, since the implementation of the national cancer strategy commenced in 1997, there has been a cumulative additional investment of approximately €400 million in the development of appropriate treatment and care services for people with cancer. This includes the sum of €29 million which was provided this year to ensure that we continue to address increasing demands in cancer services, including services for prostate cancer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1750">In recognition of the need to further develop cancer services, the national health strategy identified the need for the preparation of a new national cancer strategy. The national cancer strategy 2003 is currently being developed by the National Cancer Forum in conjunction with my Department. As part of this work, a sub-group of the National Cancer Forum has been established on generic screening. This multi-disciplinary group has reviewed all issues relating to screening, including examining specific diseases such as prostate and colorectal cancer. The group's recommendations will inform the development of the new national cancer strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1751">The strategy will build on the progress that has been made during the implementation of the first national cancer strategy and set out the key investment areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the coming years.

          <p eId="para_1756">The mobility allowance is a monthly, means tested health board allowance.

          <p eId="para_1757">To be eligible to receive this allowance applicants must satisfy the following conditions: be over 16 years and under 66 years; be living at home or maintained in any long-term institution; be unable to walk, even with the use of artificial limbs or other suitable aids, or must be in such a condition of health that the exertion required to walk would be dangerous; inability to walk has to be likely to persist for at least one year; moving of the applicant must not have been forbidden for medical reasons.</p>

          <p eId="para_1782">I take it the Deputy is referring to what is called an enhanced nursing home subvention.</p>
          <p eId="para_1783">Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990, a health board may pay a subvention towards the cost of private nursing home care, where a person is unable to meet the cost and where he or she has been assessed as needing nursing home care by a health board and where the person has satisfied a means test. However, it was never intended that nursing home subvention would meet the full costs of private nursing home care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1784">A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letter of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No 3) Act 1996.</p>

          <p eId="para_1791">As the Deputy is aware, the provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons is the responsibility of the health boards or authority in the first instance. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services in the Eastern Regional Health Authority, area and on a national basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1792">The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. This year, my Department and the health boards are funding 13 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at three separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year – five of whom are from the ERHA – and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. Thus, there is an aggregate of 20 public service dentists currently in training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_180">Orthodontic initiative funding of €4.698 million was provided to the health boards and the health authority in 2001 and this has enabled health boards to recruit additional staff, engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients and build additional orthodontic facilities. Under the initiative, the ERHA was allocated €2.044 million. This enabled the authority to recruit additional staff, including two consultant orthodontists and to develop new treatment facilities at Loughlinstown and at the regional orthodontic unit located at St. James's Hospital. My Department has also funded a six-chair orthodontic suite for the Northern Area Health Board, operational since  May 2003. The authority is also validating its orthodontic waiting lists as part of this initiative.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_181">In June 2002, my Department provided additional funding of €5 million from the treatment purchase fund to the health boards and health authority specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling the boards and the health authority to provide  both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. The ERHA was allocated an additional €1.815 million from this fund for the treatment of cases in this way.</summary>

The present number of consultants is well in excess of the number recommended by the Tierney Report on Consultant Staffing, which proposed a staffing complement of 1,500 by 2003.

          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p eId="para_1849">I propose to take Questions Nos. 343, 344 and 345 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1850">The total number of in-patient beds available in 2002 was 12,169, of which 4,851 were located within the Dublin area. The total number of in-patient beds available in 1975 was 14,843, of which 7,127 were located within the Dublin area. It should be noted that, in respect of 2002, the number of in-patient beds refers to the number available for use, whereas, for 1975, the number of in-patient beds refers to the bed complement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1851">It should also be noted that an additional 783 day beds were available nationally in 2002 compared to none in 1975. This is due to the fact that day activity is now a significant component of hospital based care in Ireland and there has been a rapid movement in recent years towards day case work in which a variety of routine and complex treatments, surgery and diagnostic tests can now be performed with the patient being admitted and discharged from hospital on the same day. Much of the growth is the result of technological and medical innovations, such as less invasive surgery and advances in anaesthetics. There has been an increase of 13% in the number of day cases between 2001 and 2002, which is similar to the increases experienced in preceding years. This increase reflects the increasing ability of the hospital system to treat more patients on a day basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1852">On foot of the report, the Government decided, in the context of the health strategy, to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals by 2011. I introduced the first phase of this process and provided for an additional 709 acute beds and my Department is examining the regional issues associated with the allocation of the remaining 3,000 acute beds.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_198">The position regarding hospital beds which were  not in use as at 12 June 2003 is that 338 beds were not in use across the acute hospital system. It is a feature of all acute hospital systems that some beds are out of use for short periods of time. Bed closures result from ward refurbishment, essential ward maintenance, staff leave, seasonal closures and infection control measures. Traditional seasonal bed closures take place during the summer months in hospitals around the country.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_199">Under the Health (Amendment) (No 3) Act 1996, health agencies are required to deliver a level of service consistent with their approved budgets. Given the level of funding available this year, the structuring of overall service plans by health agencies for 2003 may involve some containment of service activity in order to manage within budget. To contain activity and remain within budget some hospitals have temporarily closed some beds in 2003. These closures are in addition to the normal seasonal closures that take place in hospitals during the holiday periods.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1889">As I have mentioned in previous replies to parliamentary questions, the impetus for the recent Transport Council discussions on the issue of open skies with the USA lies with a ruling of the European Court of Justice on 5 November 2002. That ruling was on a case taken by the European Commission against eight member states, not including Ireland, in relation to those states' open skies agreements with the USA.</p>
          <p eId="para_1890">The court ruled that the designation of national airlines in those member states' bilateral air transport agreements is contrary to the right of establishment provided for under the treaties establishing the European Union. This means that member states must allow any European airline established in their country to enjoy the benefits of that member state's bilateral agreements. This legal principle applies to each member state's – including Ireland's – bilateral agreements with every third country, and not just with the USA.</p>
          <p eId="para_1891">In response to the court's ruling, the European Commission reactivated a proposal to give it a mandate to negotiate an "open aviation area" agreement with the USA. This was a long-standing proposal, and one that all member states were now willing to give their agreement to, as transpired at the Council earlier this month. It was in this context that I had to consider the impact on Shannon.</p>
          <p eId="para_1892">The meeting on 28 May between my officials and the United States Embassy, which was held at the request of the embassy, did not discuss any details of the current bilateral agreement between Ireland and the USA. The discussion was limited to a briefing for the embassy on the possible outcome of the Transport Council, coupled with an indication from the embassy that the US authorities would be available for detailed discussions on the bilateral agreement if required.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_209">In considering the matter of an open skies man date, before it came up for decision at the Transport Council earlier this month, the main issues that I took into account were the ruling of the European Court of Justice last November, the impact on Shannon Airport and its hinterland, the impact on tourism of increased access to Ireland, the opportunities for Aer Lingus to increase its business on transatlantic routes, the opportunities that might be opened up for other airports in Ireland, as well as Ireland's wider relationship with Europe.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_210">A major part of my thinking regarding Shannon was the fact that an EU-US liberalised market is the inevitable outcome of this process in Europe. This process towards an open skies policy is no longer about legal interpretation but about economic policy and what is now best for the future of Shannon and Ireland.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_211">The new and liberalised market will allow Shannon to retain its position as an important destination for US-Ireland transatlantic traffic and to seek to develop itself as a hub for passengers and cargo. In particular, I believe that there may well be significant opportunities for Shannon to market itself as a hub for traffic between the USA and Europe, especially eastern Europe, in the context of the enlargement of the Community next year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_212">In the margins of a meeting in Brussels on 18 June 2003 on a range of aviation issues between European aviation officials and their US counterparts, a senior official of my Department had informal discussions with the US officials on the subject of the Ireland-US aviation agreement. As I have indicated, discussions will now be ongoing between my Department and all the necessary interests on these matters, including those pertaining to Shannon, the European Commission, the US authorities and Aer Lingus.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1897">I propose to answer Questions Nos. 359 and 360 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1898">It is my general policy that the three State airports should be in a position to provide cost-competitive and appropriate infrastructure to meet the current and prospective needs of users consistent with a commercial mandate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1899">There are, of course, two main issues in the programme for Government relating to the future of Aer Rianta and the three State airports. These are the proposals concerning greater autonomy and independence for Shannon and Cork airports and the commitment to examine proposals for a new independent terminal at Dublin Airport and to progress such proposals if the evidence suggests that such a terminal will deliver significant benefits.</p>
          <p eId="para_1900">As regards the concept of a second, independently owned terminal at Dublin Airport, I am aware that the general thrust of a consultant's report in 1999 by Warburg Dillon Read, based on a very brief review of the issue, was negative. I sought expressions of interest from the market in relation to this issue last autumn and 13 responses were received from a range of national and international companies and consortia. The panel of experts that considered those expressions of interest concluded in its report of February this year that such a terminal is both operationally and technically feasible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1901">Compared to four years ago, the landscape for civil aviation has changed dramatically with the slowdown of the world economy that began in 2000, events such as the attacks in the US on 11 September 2001 and, more recently, the war in Iraq and the SARS outbreak. This process of change, which is global in nature, will continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1902">It is, therefore, not only prudent but necessary that we look afresh at our structures and organisations involved in the aviation sector to ensure that we are equipped to deal with the challenges facing us in the changed, and still changing, environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1903">My Department is currently finalising a process of consultation with relevant interested parties and stake holders including Aer Rianta and the group of unions in the company, in respect of these two main issues in the programme for Government. It is my intention to continue discussions at Government on both these major initiatives as soon as possible following this consultation process.</p>

          <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. Brennan)</from>
          <p eId="para_1905">Since no Government tax is imposed on air travel in Ireland I assume the Deputy is referring to the airport charges levied by Aer Rianta on airlines using the State airports.</p>
          <p eId="para_1906">The determination of the maximum levels of airport charges that may be levied by Aer Rianta is a matter for the Commission for Aviation Regulation, which acts on an independent statutory basis as provided for under the Aviation Regulation Act 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_1907">The manner in which Aer Rianta levies airport charges at the three State airports is a matter for the company subject to compliance with the commission's determination. As the Deputy is aware, Aer Rianta has a statutory responsibility to operate on a fully commercial basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1908">Aer Rianta operates incentive schemes to promote the development of new routes at the three State airports. The new route incentive scheme for the current year at Shannon airport offers carriers significant reductions by way of discounts on the standard airport charges. The scheme covers the first five years of operation of a new route offering a 100% discount in the first year, that is, no airport charges are payable by the airline in the first year. It offers an 80% discount in year two, a 60% discount in year three, a 40% discount in year four and a 20% discount in year five. Thereafter, the standard Aer Rianta charges at Shannon Airport will apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_1909">The incentive scheme for new routes is subject to certain qualifying criteria and is operated by Aer Rianta in an open, transparent and non-discriminatory manner. In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that any proposal which might lead to discriminatory treatment between routes fperated within the European Union, including internal flights in Ireland, would run counter to EU competition law.</p>

          <p eId="para_1934">I have brought the material supplied by the Deputy in connection with this question to the attention of the Garda authorities. I am informed by the Garda authorities that Fatima Mansions is policed by gardaí from Kilmainham Garda Station. These gardaí are augmented by different specialist units including the detective unit, special resource unit, drugs unit and the divisional crime task force based at Pearse Street Station. In addition, a dedicated community policing Garda is assigned full time to Fatima Mansions to address the concerns of the residents. I  am further informed that gardaí target the Fatima Mansions complex to ensure that a high visibility Garda presence is maintained. Known offenders are also targeted and many notable successes have been achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1935">The Garda provide a personalised policing service to the area and maintain ongoing liaison with the local residents, Dublin City Council, health boards and other statutory and voluntary agencies working with the communities with the objective of ensuring that a multi-agency approach is adopted to address the problems in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1936">The Garda keep in contact with the community groups, particularly through the Rialto policing forum which has a Garda as a member. I have asked the Garda authorities to address the residents' concerns outlined in this regard in the correspondence. I understand the superintendent at Kevin Street will endeavour to encourage the delegates back into the forum. I have been assured by the Garda that policing strategies are kept under review by Garda management and are tailored to meet changing circumstances and that the complex will continue to receive Garda attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_1937">There are a number of other initiatives in place to address the difficulties being faced by residents of the flat complex. As the Deputy is aware, the Fatima Mansions complex is situated in the canal communities local drug task force area – which is one of the fourteen local drug task forces established by the Government in areas of disadvantage identified as having the highest levels of drug misuse. Each local drug task force is in the process of implementing its second local drug action plan incorporating a range of measures in relation to drug prevention and education, treatment and rehabilitation and drug supply control within their designated area. The task forces also provide a mechanism for the co-ordination of drug services within their own areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1938">Under this initiative, the Government has already approved funding of approximately €2 million to the canal communities local drugs task force towards the implementation of the two rounds of plans which it has submitted to date. A considerable number of projects have been established and supported in the task force area and the Fatima Mansion complex is benefiting through this process. A number of specific projects within the complex are supported in this way including the employment of a community development worker to support the local community in relation to the drugs issue, the provision of financial support for the Women's Support Group in its work with recovering female drug users in the flats complex and the employment of an assistant child care worker in the Little People's Palace crèche in Fatima Mansions.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_219">In addition, there are a wide range of other measures being supported under this initiative which encompass the wider task force area but include working with the community of Fatima Mansions. Examples of this include the employment of a drop in worker, a child development  worker, a prison links worker and the provision of assistance for men's support groups, all under the auspices of the Rialto community drugs team. Further measures being supported include the development of a community healing and outreach centre which provides a range of holistic therapies for local people and the employment of a development worker with the new communities in the task force area.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_220">Fatima Mansions is currently undergoing a regeneration programme which was launched by the Taoiseach approximately two years ago. This involves the demolition of the flat complexes and the building of replacement apartments. Five blocks are scheduled for demolition in July 2003. The project is expected to take up to five years. At present, Dublin City Council is laying cable for the installation of CCTV. The superintendent at Kevin Street serves as a member of the Fatima Mansions regeneration board.</summary>

      the reason he did not consult the support groups for men before setting up the National Domestic Violence Intervention Agency; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that reports show that 50% of domestic violence is perpetrated by women on men; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [17520/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_734">
          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_1952">The National Domestic Violence Intervention Agency was established by the non-governmental organisations overseeing the implementation of a domestic violence intervention pilot project. The Deputy may be aware that my Department has provided funding for a  domestic violence intervention project in the Dún Laoghaire-Bray area. The project will operate on a pilot basis and will be evaluated after one year of operation. The project is non-gender specific – it will apply equally to male and female victims of domestic violence and abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_1953">I understand the advisory committee comprises representatives of the agency, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda, the Courts Service, the Probation and Welfare Service, the Legal Aid Board, Women's Aid and the Cork domestic violence project. I am informed that the interests of male victims of domestic violence will be represented on the advisory committee by the Cork domestic violence project who have provided services to male victims of domestic violence. I am also informed that, in the event that there is a need for contact to be made with another service offering a service to a male or female victim, contact will be made with that service in relation to that victim.</p>
          <p eId="para_1954">The domestic violence intervention project is an integrated programme co-ordinating the work of the civil and criminal judicial systems and other key agencies such as the Garda, women's support groups, perpetrators programmes and the Probation and Welfare Service. The central aim of the project is to increase the safety of victims of domestic violence and reduce the recidivism rate of domestic violence. The intervention project arose from research undertaken into the development of an intervention model and is based on projects operating successfully in other jurisdictions such as those in Duluth, Minnesota and Hammersmith, UK.</p>
          <p eId="para_1955">In relation to the assertion that 50% of domestic violence is perpetrated by women on men, I should mention that this is not borne out by reports of incidents to the Garda. Garda statistics show that the vast majority of victims, 89% are female. The assertion in relation to the 50% of victims being male arises from recent research. However, the research itself acknowledges that it does not deal with the context, reasons or initiation of the violence or the severity of the violence or extent of the injuries resulting from the violence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1956">The Deputy may wish to note that reliable research approaches the question of violence in intimate relationships by establishing a comprehensive picture and examining the broader context. This should include: the history of the violence, as opposed to one incident receiving the same count as multiple incidents; the impact of the violence on the victim, including the level of fear brought about by the incident(s) and-or any resultant injury, including assault during pregnancy; the context in which violence was used, such as in self defence; whether the violence involved rape or sexual assault; the level of power and control which one partner wants to have over the other; data in relation to partner murder, and; data in relation to violence after separation from a partner.</p>

The Deputy will be aware that the location is currently undergoing regeneration. The superintendent serves as a member of the local regeneration board. Furthermore, gardaí keep in contact with local community groups through, in particular, the local policing forum, which has a Garda representative as a member. I certainly urge that the policing forum be fully supported. I have been assured by the Garda authorities that the location will continue to receive Garda attention.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_227">The European Council meeting in Brussels on 20 and 21 March 2003 noted the United Kingdom proposals and invited the European Commission to explore the ideas contained therein further, in particular with the UNHCR, and to report to the meeting of the Council in Greece this month. The Commission's response is contained in a communication dated 3 June 2003 to the Council and the European Parliament entitled "Towards More Accessible, Equitable and Managed Asylum Systems," copies of which I have arranged to have placed in the Oireachtas library.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_228">At the meeting of the European Council in Thessaloniki on 19 and 20 June 2003, the Council took note of this communication and invited the European Commission to explore all parameters in order to ensure more orderly and managed entry in the EU of persons in need of international protection, and to examine ways and means to enhance the protection capacity of regions of origin with a view to presenting to the Council before June 2004, a comprehensive report suggesting measures to be taken, including their legal implications.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_229">The Council, in its conclusions, also noted that a number of member states plan to explore ways of providing better protection for refugees in their regions of origin, which is the element of the original UK proposal on which emphasis is now being placed, in conjunction with the UNHCR. In accordance with the Council conclusions, this work is to be carried out in full partnership with the countries concerned on the basis of recommendations from the UNHCR.</summary>

In most cases, removals are carried out using commercial flights which usually involves transit through other European airports as Ireland does not have direct flights to most of the countries of return. In addition, most flights must be booked at short notice very near the date of departure which involves higher costs than if booked well in advance.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_232">It should also be borne in mind that in considering the costs of deportations, the continued presence in the State of persons who are the sub ject of deportation orders has to be taken into account. These costs include social welfare costs, direct provision costs, and detention costs in certain cases. While it is important to keep deportation costs to a minimum, not to remove persons refused permission to remain in the State would call into question the integrity of the entire immigration system. This would leave this country open to further illegal immigration and even more expense to taxpayers. I am determined that this should not happen.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2054">I have been informed by the Garda authorities that any member of the public who experiences problems with standards in the taxi industry may make their complaint to any member of the Garda Síochána or in any Garda station. In addition, in Dublin, a member of the public may make a complaint directly to the Carriage Office, Dublin Castle.</p>
          <p eId="para_2055">In Dublin, all complaints not made directly to the carriage office are forwarded to it where they are fully investigated. Complaints which may reveal serious crimes are forwarded to the Garda station responsible for the area in which the incident is alleged to have occurred for investigation. Outside Dublin, the complaint is investigated by the local Garda station. In both Dublin and outside Dublin, the complainant is generally invited to make a statement in relation to the complaint.</p>
          <p eId="para_2056">I am further informed that any complaint in relation to the terms of a small public service vehicle licence or any complaint relating to any infringements of the small public service vehicle licence are dealt with by the Garda Síochána as the Garda Commissioner has overall responsibility for the issuing of such licences. The local authority which issues the actual taxi plate or licence also has responsibility in relation to complaints. The number of complaints received in the past five years are set out in the following table. These figures are in respect of the Dublin metropolitan region only as the information could not be collated on a national basis in the timeframe allowed for this question.</p>

          <p eId="para_2075">A reasoned opinion has been received from the European Commission that Ireland, in allowing for hunting of the wood pigeon during its breeding season, does not comply with the terms of Articles 5 and 7(4) of the EU Birds Directive 79/409/EEC. Under the terms of Article 9 of the birds directive, Ireland has for many years operated a derogation to allow the control of wood pigeon by  farmers and their agents in the interests of preventing serious damage to arable crops including cereals, legumes and brassicas. In addition, a hunting season for the wood pigeon from 1 June to 31 January of the following year was put in place as a further control measure. The wood pigeon can breed during extensive parts of the year, so it can be difficult to apply a season which falls entirely outside the breeding periods.</p>
          <p eId="para_2076">While there has been no evidence that the conservation status of the wood pigeon has declined as a result of the length of the current hunting season the Irish authorities have, in response to the reasoned opinion, indicated that we intend to shorten the hunting season so that it will fall within the strict terms of the birds directive. I will be seeking to ensure that the measures which may legitimately be used by the farming community under the terms of the birds directive to prevent damage will continue to be provided for in national regulations.</p>

          <p eId="para_2080">The statutory framework for the control of dogs – the Control of Dogs Acts 1986 and 1992 and the Control of Dogs Regulations 1998 – is comprehensive. The principal features of the system involve local authorities or, in some cases, the ISPCA acting on their behalf, discharging dog control functions, including appointing dog wardens, operating shelters for stray or unwanted dogs, seizing stray dogs and arranging for the destruction of dogs that are  not reclaimed or for which new homes cannot be found.</p>
          <p eId="para_2081">Dog control legislation also imposes requirements on the owner or other persons in charge of a dog not to permit the dog to be in any place other than the premises of the owner or other person whose consent has been obtained, unless the dog is accompanied and kept under effectual control.</p>
          <p eId="para_2082">As regards dangerous dogs, the Control of Dogs Regulations 1998 prescribe leashing and muzzling requirements in respect of certain breeds of dog. These requirements must be observed when the dog is in a public place and the person in charge must be over 16 years of age and must be capable of controlling the dog. Furthermore, the 1986 Act gives specific powers to the courts to order that a dog, which the court considers dangerous, shall be kept under proper control or be destroyed.</p>
          <p eId="para_2083">Under the provisions of section 25 of the Control of Dogs Act 1986 the District Court may act on a complaint by any person where a nuisance has been created by excessive barking by a dog. My Department does not have information on the number of complaints made to the courts or the number of convictions obtained. While complaints in relation to barking dogs are largely dealt under the provisions of the Control of Dogs Acts, the position in relation to noise nuisance generally is that a legal remedy has been provided under Section 108 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 (Noise) Regulations 1994. This allows an individual, a group of residents, a local authority or the Environmental Protection Agency to make a complaint to the District Court in respect of noise which gives reasonable cause for annoyance, for the purpose of obtaining an order for the reduction, prevention or limitation of the noise. The defendant is obliged to comply with any such order. I have no plans to review this legislation at this stage.</p>

Elimination of the odour, which is due to hydrogen sulphide, is an operational matter for Kildare County Council. I understand that the council is conducting a series of trials to determine the most effective solution.</p>

          <p eId="para_2308">In the interests of protecting the secrecy of the ballot, the present manual voting system does not provide a receipt or docket with the voter's preferences. Similarly, the new electronic voting arrangements will not provide a print out of individual voter preferences at the time of voting. However, the system software will enable the printing of a ballot paper for each vote cast, without attribution to the individual voter, where a court order to this effect is obtained at an election petition.</p>
          <p eId="para_2309">When using the voting machine, the voter will see his or her preferences beside the candidates' photographs. In addition, the details of each preference will be separately shown on a voting machine display screen. Before pressing the cast vote button, a voter can amend in secret the preferences recorded on his or her ballot.</p>
          <p eId="para_2310">I fully acknowledge the desirability of ensuring maximum confidence in the new system particularly in those constituencies or local electoral areas where the voting machines have not previously been used. To this end, details on the voting procedures will be sent to each elector before the European and local elections in 2004 and there will be national and local publicity campaigns to inform voters.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_240">Under the scheme the maximum grant available is 90% of the once-off costs of purchasing-installing the necessary security equipment. However, the level of funding made available for individual applications varies according to individual needs and circumstances and according to  the overall demand to be met in relation to the available resources. It is necessary to assess all applications at the same time so that an appropriate level of funding can be determined for each application, taking into account the need to target funding at those most in need of assistance under the scheme. In order to facilitate this process, it is necessary to have one closing date for receipt of applications so that an accurate assessment of the total number of applications received and the level of funding sought can be made.</summary>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_2330">The students summer jobs scheme was first introduced in 1993 to provide income support for less well off students who were disqualified under social welfare legislation from receiving unemployment assistance during the summer months. The scheme allowed students to take up  part-time work useful to their community and to receive payment for this work.</p>
          <p eId="para_2331">When the scheme was introduced unemployment levels in Ireland were among the highest in the EU and students found it difficult during the holiday period to obtain work. In the past five years, however, the take up has dropped significantly, from 13,500 in 1998 to 4,600 in 2002. This decline reflects the greater and wider availability of alternative and well paid summer jobs in recent years. Against this background, it was decided to discontinue the students summer job scheme in 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_2332">A replacement scheme for the student summer job scheme is not proposed. However, I have asked the area partnerships to consider how best they can offer practical assistance and support to students from disadvantaged areas in finding temporary summer employment in the labour market. My Department is in contact with the partnerships and is keeping the matter under review.</p>

      <b>Mr. F. McGrath</b>
      asked the

      if her attention has been drawn to the fact that 54.4% of households headed by a disabled person are living at or below the 60% poverty line; if her attention has been further drawn to the fact that at least 70% of people with a disability are unemployed; and if she has new plans to change that situation.

          <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan)</from>
          <p eId="para_2359">The analysis undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, of the results of the Living in Ireland survey for 2000 indicated that 54.4% of households headed by a person who was ill or disabled were at risk of poverty as the household income was below 60% of the median household income. This compares with a risk of poverty of 22.1% for all household types.</p>
          <p eId="para_2360">The latest figures relating to the employment of people with disabilities show that just over 40% of all persons aged 15 to 64 with a disability, or health problem, indicated that they were in employment, which compares to an overall rate of 65% for the total population in the same age category. These figures are obtained from the Central Statistics Office's report on disability in the labour force as part of its quarterly national household survey, QNHS, for the second quarter of 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_2361">The revised national anti-poverty strategy, NAPS – entitled Building an Inclusive Society and launched in February 2002 – sets out the Government's approach to tackling the issues of poverty and social exclusion for all groups vulnerable to poverty, including people with disabilities. It is a key objective of the NAPS to increase the participation of people with disabilities in work and in society generally and to support people with disability, and their families, to lead full and independent lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_2362">The NAPS identifies the lack of baseline data in respect of people with disabilities as a key constraint in setting specific targets for this group. While the QNHS data, to which I have already referred, represents a significant first step towards addressing this deficiency, the issue is receiving further attention in the context of the development of a comprehensive data strategy to underpin the NAPS process.</p>
          <p eId="para_2363">The NAPS, however, contains income adequacy targets which will have a positive impact on the position of all groups vulnerable to poverty. A working group, established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and chaired by the Department of Health and Children, is examining the issues associated with the introduction of a costs of disability payment.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_245">In relation to my Department, a review of the various illness and disability payment schemes is being undertaken as part of an ongoing series of systematic examinations of the Department's expenditure programmes. The intention of this review is to examine both the roles and effectiveness of the range of income maintenance payments provided by my Department and by the health boards. This includes identifying gaps and overlaps with a view to producing a simplified, comprehensive system; examining the extent to which schemes support self-sufficiency for people with disabilities; and looking at possible alternative approaches to the design and delivery of social protection for people who are ill or disabled. Close account will be taken in this review  of the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. It is anticipated that the working group carrying out the review will publish its report in the coming months.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2365">Since 1997, social welfare payments have increased substantially in real terms. During that period, the rate of disability allowance has increased by 45.6% compared with an increase of 26.6% in the cost of living during the same period.</p>
          <p eId="para_2366">Following a review of the national anti-poverty strategy, the Government set a target of achieving a rate of €150 per week, in 2002 terms, for the lowest rates of social welfare payments. The achievement of this target, re-iterated in Sustaining Progress, will significantly increase the value of payments to persons on low-incomes and at risk of poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_2367">My priorities for budget 2004 will include making further progress towards implementing Government commitments in the social welfare area and responding, where possible, to the various proposals and concerns brought to my attention during the course of the budget process, having regard to available resources.</p>
