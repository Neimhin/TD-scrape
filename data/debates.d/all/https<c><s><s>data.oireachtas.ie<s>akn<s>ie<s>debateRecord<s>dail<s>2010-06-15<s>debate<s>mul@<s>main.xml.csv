The first is the publication today of the Saville report and all that it represents for families who have waited since 1972.  I hope that the families' positions are vindicated by the text of that report.  I ask the Taoiseach whether he will accommodate an opportunity this week to have statements in this House on the publication of the Saville report.We have not yet addressed in this House the prenatal misdiagnoses of miscarriages.  It is imperative that we address this very important issue that has affected many thousands of women across the State and not just those women who have come forward and who have had fortunate outcomes.  Many thousands of women are going through a difficult and agonising period in their lives.

Everyone will understand that it is a prerogative of the Government to do that, given the serious nature of the motion that was put down.The Saville report is being published today.  It is a very important day for the families and for everyone who has had concerns on these matters.  It is a very lengthy report and perhaps it might be best for people to read the report and consider it in the House next week.  I would be anxious that the House would have statements on the issue.The other matter raised by Deputy Ó Caoláin can be dealt with by the Minister for Health and Children and there is ongoing accountability to the House in respect of any of these health care issues.  We considered that the confidence motion must be confronted head on.

Confidence is, therefore, about confirming that it is right that a Government should continue to serve the people because it has the capacity and determination to do what is required to address the challenges that lie ahead.These are formidable challenges.  I will speak about the measures which we are pursuing to secure financial stability and accelerate economic recovery but the truth is that we are operating at a period of grave challenge for our currency, for Europe and for the global economic system.  It is a time when the capacity to sustain confidence abroad is just as important as the ability to deliver the correct policies at home.  This Government has demonstrated its capacity to do both, as affirmed by fair-minded observers at home and abroad.  The task is far from complete but the direction is set and the goal is clear.  The journey is daunting but the will and capacity to succeed, whatever the ultimate political consequences, are unshaken.Confidence is about the challenges of today and tomorrow.  That is not to ignore issues that derive from the past.  This Government, and I personally, do not seek to diminish or equivocate about our responsibilities, actions and decisions.  It is right that all are held to account for what has been done, as well as what was left undone.  Our determination in that regard is evident from our decision to appoint distinguished and independent experts to conduct a robust assessment of the reasons for the banking crisis which has dominated so much of the work of this Administration.  We are determined to continue the examination, analysis and reflection so that full and fair assessments can be made, lessons learned and the basis established for a full political assessment of performance and responsibility to be made in due course.I assert that the firm and unshakeable commitment to that process and that outcome is an integral part of the position from which this Government invites the Dáil to reassert its confidence.I will deal with some of these matters in more detail.  At this point, I wish merely to repeat my full acceptance of responsibility for the decisions I took, as Minister and Taoiseach.  I believe that the record, informed by the expert analysis published over recent days, demonstrates that I acted to correct imbalances in our tax relief system and to rebalance the focus of economic policy from an excessive dependence on property and construction towards a more balanced and sustainable economy.  That this was ultimately insufficient to prevent the vulnerabilities in our situation producing the critical situation in which we have found ourselves reflected severe failings in our banking and regulatory systems.  These were compounded by failings on the part of external authorities who gave false comfort about the performance of both.  This was all crystallised by the collapse in international financial markets to a degree which could scarcely have been anticipated.  Accepting due responsibility as I do does not, however, oblige me to accept the re-writing of history and the bare-faced denials on the part of the Opposition.I  pay tribute to all of my Cabinet colleagues and my colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party, the Green Parliamentary Party and the Independent benches.  This has been the most volatile and demanding period in politics I have seen in over a quarter of a century in this House.  The Government has worked long and hard in an effort to get Ireland through the crisis and our track record has been acknowledged by international commentators to be the correct response for our circumstances.  The recent banking reports from Mr. Regling, Mr. Watson and Professor Honohan confirm that.The reports confirm the need for an extensive guarantee; confirm that Anglo Irish Bank was a systemic bank at the time of the guarantee; confirm that bank failure would have been disastrous for our economy; confirm that the timing of the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank did not result in higher costs; and confirm that steps have been taken to correct the main issues relating to regulation.Our efforts are paying off.  The most recent OECD Outlook has stated: "after a severe recession in 2009, the [Irish] economy appears to be close to a turning point".  While painful, the tough decisions we have taken are working.  I believe we have reached a turning point in our economy and the challenge we now face is to drive on with this approach in order that we can get more people back to work as quickly as possible.  Other countries are now facing up to their difficulties as we have already done.  It is clear that our determination to move early and decisively to address our public finances has generated approval and confidence abroad, from which we continue to benefit.   Recent turbulence in the eurozone is the most vivid demonstration of the necessity of the decisions we made and the effectiveness of the policies we pursued.The credit for this success lies squarely on the shoulders of Irish people.  They have understood the need for tough measures and adapted to the most difficult of circumstances.  While we face another difficult budget ahead, we are returning to growth and, with it, we are seeing an upturn in much needed confidence.  While continued turbulence in financial markets is a strong signal that we cannot be complacent, the hard won gains of the past two decades remain despite the severity of the recession.  This year, economic activity as measured by GDP will be around 30% higher than ten years ago and 150% higher than 20 years ago.Every day, as Taoiseach, I meet and hear how people are struggling because of this recession and about the sacrifices families have had to make.  I understand that.  The Government has worked hard to develop a plan for economic recovery and it is working.  The plan has four key parts, namely, to repair the banking system, restore order to the public finances, regain competitiveness and support enterprise to create jobs.Repairing the balance sheets of our banks is arguably one of the most significant financial challenges ever faced by the State.  However, the Government has faced this challenge for the simple reason that it is fundamental to getting credit flowing again, supporting economic recovery and creating jobs.The recent reports conclude that major responsibility for Ireland's banking crisis lies with the directors and senior management of the banks.  Anyone who denies that has not read the reports or is being deliberately mischievous.  The reports highlight a number of mistakes which were made.  This largely confirms my previous assessment of the key factors which were relevant, which were as follows.  Fundamental errors were made within the management of individual banks which led to excessive risk taking.  Banks became too dependent on wholesale funding.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	35	As a result, when the international credit market unexpectedly froze, the banks were vulnerable and in need of Government guarantees.  Inadequate financial regulatory controls were implemented in Ireland and other international economies based on a mistaken view of governance within banks.  There were property tax incentives in place over the period from the mid-1990s which, with the benefit of hindsight, should have been abolished many years prior to my decision in December 2005 to abolish them.  Individuals were left in dominant positions within individual financial institutions for too long a period.  There were stunning failures of corporate governance and not enough turnaround in management personnel in the institutions in question.There was a failure to impose international stability risk assessments and protection systems which took account of the interaction of global financial systems.  This was not a peculiarly Irish problem, as recent events in Europe have demonstrated.  There was also a failure to implement more intensive compliance regulation of those financial institutions which were too big to fail.  Auditors, regulators and governments all share part of this responsibility.  The higher capital requirements on speculative property loans in Irish banks which were introduced at the start of 2007 should have been imposed many years earlier before the rapid escalation in property lending took place.The lessons which have been highlighted in the independent reports have now been fully taken on board and policies implemented to ensure that a banking crisis can never happen again in Ireland.  While the Government shares and accepts its responsibility for its role in these mistakes, it is noteworthy that many of its strongest critics were proposing measures, such as higher spending and the radical reduction or abolition of stamp duty, which would have made the position much worse.In considering these two reports, I am fully aware that the Government's response to the banking crisis, while necessary, has not of itself been popular.  There has been justifiable anger about the conduct of the banks and it is anger I share.  I am, however, confident that the right calls have been made to deal with this distressing situation and I have noted that the Central Bank Governor, in his report, broadly confirms that.The Government response to the banking crisis has involved taking ten actions — the guarantee of Irish banking liabilities; the establishment of NAMA; the appointment of a new Governor of the Central Bank and a new Financial Regulator; the integration of the new Central Banking Commission and Financial Regulator structure; the setting of higher capital requirements for Irish banks by the regulator; the requirement of banks to increase lending to the enterprise sector; the restriction on bankers' pay——

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	37	——supporting the Garda and the legal system in their independent investigation and prosecution of any criminal actions in the banking sector; the introduction of a radically changed regulatory system; and new rules on bank directors and corporate governance.The Governor's report demolishes a number of mistaken views that have arisen which some have used in an attempt to damage the Government.  These include the incorrect suggestion that policy advice prior to the crisis suggested that banks were inadequately capitalised and that the property markets would collapse and that the Government ignored that advice; the mistaken view that a widespread guarantee of the Irish banking sector was not the correct decision; and the myth that the timing of the decision to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank resulted in significant losses for the taxpayer.  Due to the the damage to Ireland's reputation caused by these misconceptions it is important to review each of these in turn.I have previously argued that the balance of evidence and advice to the Government was that Irish banks had sufficient capital and that a soft landing to the property sector could be expected.  While this advice proved to be wrong, the suggestion that the Government was advised differently and ignored this advice never had any truth whatever.  I note also that the two reports confirm that the official advice to the Government both from the Central Bank and from the International Monetary Fund and OECD at the time was that the banks had sufficient capital to absorb the likely losses but that there were vulnerabilities and risks.We now know grave mistakes were made in the judgment of the capital adequacy of the Irish banks and the assessment of future loan losses and on the outlook for the property sector.  It is, however, important to note that no one in the independent authorities ever advised the Government that the capital requirements were not sufficient or that higher capital adequacy ratios should be imposed.  This is now confirmed by the independent reports and in the Governor's report he notes that the language of successive advice given was too reassuring throughout.The independent report by the Governor also vindicates the Government decision to introduce an extensive guarantee.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	38	No.  The Government introduced a blanket one not an extensive one.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	39	In particular, his report noted that:As regards the substance of the guarantee itself, it is hard to argue with the view that an extensive guarantee needed to be put in place, since all participants rightly felt that they faced the likely collapse of the Irish banking system within days in the absence of decisive immediate action.  Given the hysterical state of global financial markets in those weeks, failure to avoid this outcome would have resulted in immediate and lasting damage to the economy and society.An issue, however, raised by the Governor's report relates to the merits or otherwise of including subordinated debt holders in the initial guarantee.  The Governor's report indicates his views that the inclusion of existing subordinated debt in the coverage of the guarantee likely increased the potential share of the total losses borne by the State.  He, however, acknowledges that subordinated debt holders have suffered losses, given the buy-backs that have occurred at discounted prices.The Governor notes that in making this decision, considerations by the Government included the fact that:. . . since many of the subordinated debt bond holders were also holders of Government Paper, their exclusion could adversely affect Ireland's debt rating.  There was also concern that anything short of a comprehensive, simple to understand concept might cause confusion when markets opened and undermine the effectiveness of the Government's action.  CBFSAI representatives did not challenge these propositions.The decision to include Anglo Irish Bank in the Government guarantee has been one which has been a subject of understandable and critical debate.The Governor's independent report points out:There can be little doubt that a disorderly failure of Anglo would, in the absence of any other protective action, have had a devastating effect on the remainder of the Irish banks.  Given the other banks' reliance from day to day and week to week on the willingness of depositors and other lenders not to withdraw their funds, and the certainty that those lenders would infer from the failure of Anglo that all the other Irish banks might be in a comparable situation, in all likelihood the main banks would have run out of cash within days.  So either Anglo's disorderly bankruptcy had to be avoided or protective measures taken for the rest of the system, or — as was decided — both.The Governor's report also deals with the decision not to proceed with the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank on the night of the guarantee.  He indicated that two questions are raised.  First, should policy makers have had a greater sense that Anglo was facing not only a liquidity but also a potential solvency problem?  The answer is probably "Yes".  The second was whether nationalisation of Anglo on 30 September — compared with its nationalisation five months later — would have made a significant difference to the overall cost of the bank bailout to the taxpayer.  Here the Governor indicates that the answer is "Probably not".The second element of the Government's plan is to restore order to public finances.  Once again, people can have confidence that Ireland is back on track.  The good news is stability has been restored to our public finances and we have made a fiscal correction of 5% of GDP in 2009 and 2.5% in 2010.  Without these measures, our budget deficit would have ballooned to 20%.  Today we are held up as an example and people are talking about the Government's resolve and capacity to deal with problems we have been confronted with.  There is no room for complacency and we must persevere with the agreed deficit reduction programme over the coming years.Confidence in Ireland is rising and the decisive action we took means our economic outlook is better than would otherwise have been the case.  The ESRI has predicted that growth will return to the economy in the second half of this year and the European Commission is predicting that Ireland will grow at double the eurozone average next year.  The markets too can see this.  The Government's decisive action has brought us credibility.  This credibility is reflected in our reduced costs of borrowing, which is crucial to keep the country running.Money markets remain difficult and we must be constantly vigilant in this regard.  This recession has changed the financial world.  The lesson we need to take from it is that we are in a competitive global market and soft option solutions are not going to provide the basis for sustainable growth and the improvement of living standards we seek for the people.As a former Minister for Finance, I want to respond to the criticisms of fiscal policy in the banking reports and especially where this relates to the role of property-based tax incentives.  I want to emphasise that prior to the crisis, the Government took action to reduce the vulnerabilities of the economy to the property market, although I fully accept that in hindsight, it was not sufficient.  The independent reports identify four main areas where actions were taken as follows.These are the decisions in the budget I presented to Dáil Éireann in December 2005 to abolish a very wide range of property-based tax incentives; the refusal by the Government to abolish or dramatically reduce stamp duty; the decision of the regulator at the start of 2007 to increase the capital requirements on banks for speculative property lending from 100% to 150%; and the decision by the Government to allocate every year 1% of GNP into a National Pensions Reserve Fund.  Without these actions the crisis in the Irish economy would have been far worse and I believe this is consistent with the analysis of causes contained in the two independent reports.It is worth emphasising, in considering the role of various incentives given to the construction sector in contributing to the problem that in presenting the 2006 budget in December 2005, I decided to immediately restrict the use of property-based tax incentives by those on high incomes.  I introduced for the first time in that Finance Bill a measure to ensure that such taxpayers were no longer able to use property tax incentives or other measures to reduce their tax bill in any year below a certain level.  I subsequently announced the most radical abolition of property-based tax incentives made by any recent Minister for Finance.  I did this because I was concerned that these incentives were contributing to an overvaluation of property with resultant vulnerabilities.  This decision did not gain favour with many interested parties in the property market and it also represented a decisive policy shift because over a long period, successive Governments of all political persuasions had added more new property incentives rather than engage in a wholesale abolition of existing incentives.I also abolished the property based incentives for the general rental refurbishment scheme.  Similarly, the tax relief which was available for interest on loans taken out to acquire an interest in property rental companies was abolished for all new loans taken out after 7 December 2005.The Government accepts that there are independent policy lessons to be drawn from our experience and, in particular, we accept those set out in Part IV of the Regling and Watson report.  I agree with the assessment in the two reports that a more restrictive fiscal policy would have assisted in slowing the economy.  Hindsight is always clear and clearly we would have taken such a course if we had known of the scale of the property collapse which was facing the country.  I deeply regret that.

During the decade to which I refer, demands that were made in this House in respect of increased spending in a range of areas, capital and current, are there for all to see.  What those demands reflected were the raised expectations of our people who saw, for the first time, a country that had finally come to grips with the historic problems of under-employment and under-investment.

As Messrs Regling and Watson state, the true burden of responsibility emerges as quite broad and extends to insufficiently critical external surveillance institutions.

It has been further suggested that there was a sense of irresponsibility in that we were not prepared to deal with our debt position either.  We reduced the debt significantly during those times.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	87	The investments we made were not wrong in that respect.  On the contrary, almost all were necessary and worthwhile.  It is especially important to note that the tax revenues raised during those years were used to engage in unprecedented capital investments to provide key infrastructure such as roads, public transport projects, schools and third level research facilities.  Infrastructure has greatly increased our productive capacity and will be essential in returning the economy to a sustainable growth rate when global conditions improve.  These investments benefit the quality of life of our citizens and strengthen the prospects of recovery.The report suggests that we should have had a totally counter-cyclical policy.  I understand the macro-economic theory behind this but I know also, as a politician and public representative, that in the context of the debate that was being had in this House by public representatives of the people, many were asking, and rightly so, if not now, when are we going to deal with some of these historic under-investment problems in terms of education, health and social welfare and improvements in our pension provisions for our people?  I do not suggest that this allows people to consider, based on how things developed subsequently, that one would not look back with the benefit of hindsight and would, if one could reasonably expect this was going to happen, have pursued a more restrictive fiscal policy in the previous years.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	95	We used money to more than halve the national debt as a percentage of GDP, from 64% in 1997 to 25% in 2007.  If the assets of the National Pensions Reserve Fund are taken into account, the net debt position at the time I ceased being Minister for Finance was approximately 12% of GDP.  This undoubtedly helped slow the growth rate of the Irish economy from what would have applied had we used the funds to either increase public expenditure or reduce taxes as argued by others at the time.  This is now allowing us to borrow to help us through a very difficult period.  The policies now being espoused by Fine Gael and the Labour Party are more about chasing popularity than confronting reality.  At its conference in March, Fine Gael indicated that it would be willing to make a €2 billion adjustment in the 2011 budget.  That approach puts the party in conflict with the adjustment of €3 billion for 2011, agreed with the European Commission.  The Labour Party has called for an increased fiscal stimulus in the economy that would simply enlarge our deficit further and call into question our ability to continue to access continued funding.  Were the Opposition to implement such proposals they would decimate the hard won credibility the country has gained internationally.  Adopting such a budgetary stance would undermine the country's ability to pursue our economic strategy internationally and our economic recovery.With regard to the need to regain competitiveness and the creation of jobs, people can also have confidence that Government is working.  The good news is that prices are falling and competitiveness is being restored in Ireland.  Between 2009 and 2011, it is expected that our unit labour cost will have fallen by 12% and consumer prices are already down by 2.5% this year.

I am simply outlining that the investments we continue to make are within the budgetary policy we are now pursuing.  The country wants the Government to move on to deal with the crises and problems of today.  The people do not believe we should spend the next three years dealing with the previous three years or ten years.  There are committees in the Oireachtas and other processes, such as commissions of investigation, which can deal with these matters in a time-limited and cost-effective way.  The Government has no difficulty dealing with those issues in whatever way is required.In every one of the issues being dealt with by the Government and which the confidence motion addresses, we have taken the correct decision and made the right call.  The reports confirm that to a far greater extent than the Opposition contends.  Work remains to be done by Government in the coming months and years and for the remainder of our term of office.  That work will enable us to go back to the electorate for confirmation that the Government did its duty as it saw it, in the midst of the biggest crisis we have seen, probably in the history of the State.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	105	This motion of no confidence was triggered by the language, extent and depth of the two banking reports.  The verdict is in. The evidence has been gathered. The analysis has been made.  The conclusion of the two recent reports into our economic crisis is devastatingly clear.  Deputy Brian Cowen is guilty of creating an economic disaster that will forever carry the logo, "Made by Fianna Fáil."  If he had any integrity he would already have resigned.  If he had any respect for the people whose lives he has destroyed he would already have called a general election.  However, for him the supreme political virtue, the only virtue, is loyalty to party.  He puts that before loyalty to country and people.  That is the Fianna Fáil way, but it is not my way.I stand here today, on behalf of the people whom the Taoiseach has chosen to ignore, to accuse him in their name.  I accuse the Taoiseach of being one of the chief architects of our economy's destruction and of condemning our people to a lost decade of unemployment, misery and emigration.  I accuse him of hijacking our Republic and handing it over to a toxic circle of bankers, developers and speculators who, like a cancer, have sought to destroy our Republic from the inside out.  I accuse him of attempting to deceive the Irish public about the causes of this crisis and his own responsibility for it.Just over four weeks ago, the Taoiseach delivered two 7,000 word speeches defending his economic record.  These speeches can be summarised in four short words,  "it's not my fault".  That has been the mantra for his entire political career and for the careers of many of his Fianna Fáil colleagues.When he was Minister for Health, he insisted that his abject failure to reform and improve our health services was not his fault. Working in that Department, he explained, was like working in Angola.  When his policies as Minister for Finance helped destroy our economy, he also denied all responsibility.  He accepts responsibility for his actions but in doing so he is not prepared to do the necessary and put the matter to the country.  It was, he argued, the fault of officials who gave him bad advice or of organisations like the IMF which failed to warn him.  He even claimed it was the fault of the Opposition.  When he became Taoiseach and our banks collapsed he very quickly identified the fall guy.  It was not him or any of his failed policies.  It was all the fault of Lehman Brothers.  The pattern is clear.  The Taoiseach is never there when there is a problem.  He is never responsible when there is a failure.  He is never to blame when things go wrong.In all of this, he has shown himself to be a true disciple of his mentor, guide and predecessor, Deputy Bertie Ahern, a man who believed that all the cribbers and moaners, as he called them, should simply commit suicide.  He appointed Deputy Cowen as Minister for Finance because he knew he would do whatever his leader required of him.  How right he was.  From the moment Deputy Cowen became Minister for Finance he did his master's bidding and unleashed a series of reckless policies designed to do one thing and one thing only, to keep Fianna Fáil in power.  Deputy Bertie Ahern said his ethics consisted of getting into office and staying in.  The record is clear and cannot be denied, even by the Taoiseach.  He deliberately over-heated the economy and deliberately pumped up the property bubble.Over his four budgets, from 2005 to 2008, he increased spending by a massive 51%, more than twice the rate of growth in the economy.  To finance this massive spending surge he did everything he could to ensure the property bubble lasted as long as possible.  In 2005 he decided to extend massive tax reliefs for property developers past the election in 2007 against expert advice.  In 2006, at the peak of the housing boom, he even assured buyers that Irish house prices were based on what he called strong fundamentals.In his devastating report on the banking crisis Professor Patrick Honohan makes it very clear that this was a home-grown crisis, created and nurtured by the  Government.  Professor Honohan says, "Macroeconomic and budgetary policies contributed significantly to the economic overheating .....This helped create a climate of public opinion which was led to believe that the party could last forever."  That was the impression coming from the Galway tent year after year.In their report, Klaus Regling and Max Watson also make it clear that the banking crisis "was in crucial ways home-made" and that official policies and banking practices added "fuel to the fire."  The report said, "Fiscal policy, bank governance and financial supervision left the economy vulnerable to a deep crisis, with costly and extended social fall-out".  How true those words are.  By mid-decade "financial stability analysis should have sounded alarm bells loudly."  Those alarm bells were ringing for a long time.  The Taoiseach claims that no one shouted stop as he set us on the path to ruin, but he knows that is not true.  As far back as 2005, the International Monetary Fund told him that house price overvaluation in Ireland "could not just be explained by economic fundamentals".  The ESRI warned him that a collapse in the housing market could have "serious" short to medium-term effects on economic growth.  As The New York Times looked on in disbelief at what was happening here, under the direction and stewardship of the Taoiseach, it could only describe Ireland as the “wild west of European finance”.  In 2006, The Economist warned that Ireland was experiencing “the biggest bubble in history”.  In the same year, Professor Morgan Kelly projected that property prices could fall dramatically, with catastrophic consequences for the banking sector:We have spent the last five years learning to believe that exports and competitiveness do not matter, and that we can get rich by selling houses to each other.  We are likely to spend a painful few years as we unlearn that lesson.How right Professor Kelly was.  In his report, Professor Patrick Honohan lays bare the bunker mentality into which the Government had retreated by 2007.  He makes it clear that the conclusions of the financial stability report of that year were based on a "selective reading of the evidence".  He states:The central conclusion regarding a ‘soft landing' was not based on any quantitative calculations or analysis.  This appears to have been a triumph of hope over reality.  More generally, a rather defensive approach was adopted to external critics or contrarians.The Government was not willing to listen to the warning signs or to heed the alarm bells.  It decided to continue with the party as if it would never end.  Professor Honohan demolishes the Fianna Fáil line that no one was questioning the Government's policies.  He points out that "for years many observers had raised some concerns publicly or privately, albeit sometimes in coded form, about the sustainability of the property boom, which was indeed dramatic by international standards".  Fine Gael consistently warned the Government that its mismanagement would lead to disaster.  It ignored our warnings and our proposals, which would have halted the destruction.

The results of the Taoiseach's failure to listen to anyone who did not share his views are clear for all to see.  This country has experienced the most expensive crisis of almost any country.  Some €74 billion is being pumped into the banks, while credit is being denied to thousands of businesses.  The Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said that NAMA would create a wall of cash, but that has not happened.  The Taoiseach knows it is not happening.  Despite the spin about green shoots, small and medium sized retail enterprises are starved of cash and are barely hanging on.

More than 100,000 young people have left this country since 2008.  We have experienced the biggest rise in our national debt.  It has tripled in two years, under the stewardship of the Taoiseach, thereby forcing painful cuts in services, pay and investment.  Every Deputy in this House has been confronted by public servants and people who are out of work who are worried about the cost of living and the standards they have to meet.  Tens of thousands of houses are lying empty in tax-driven developments that were built in the wrong places.  Some 200,000 young families find themselves trapped in negative equity.  More than 30,000 of them are unable to service their monthly payments.  Does any member of this Government understand the stresses and pressures faced on a daily basis by families that are unable to meet their mortgage repayments?  Very little assistance is available to them.  There has been no response of any consequence from the Government.These bald statistics do not tell us the real story.  They do not tell us about families struggling to survive on one income, or no income.  They do not tell us about the lack of hope of those burdened with the scourge of unemployment.  They do not tell us about the despair of the weakest and most vulnerable in our society, as the services they rely on are shut down.  In recent years, how many times has Deputy Neville spoken about the tragedy of suicide, which was hidden for so long, coming to the forefront around this country as a result of social and economic pressure?  There have been many such cases in this city and across the entire country.  That is the legacy of this Government.  It has failed to heed the warning signs, or to implement real action that would have steered the ship of State and the economy in a direction that retained services for our people, created career opportunities for them and allowed them to maintain a suitable standard of living so they could raise their families in a normal way.  The legacy of the inaction of the Taoiseach and his colleagues in government is a society in which fairness does not exist.  When I spoke recently to a woman who complained about the removal of services from her 13 year old child, who has been blind since birth, she asked whether there is an understanding of the gulf of unfairness in this country when people are allowed to walk out the gates of agencies with €1 million in their back pockets, approved for incompetence and backed by the Government.  That is not fair in any society.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	118	Our economy has been brought to its knees.  It is clear that fairness is not evident in the daily lives of our people.  The lack of fairness in our economy is badly hurting every household in the land.  Society has been torn apart and ruptured by social pressure and the consequences of the Government's actions.  Many of these issues are the fault of the Taoiseach because he failed to direct the Government's actions as he should have.  Those outcomes result directly from the Government's policies.  For example, it allowed the banking system to run wildly out of control.  As late as September 2008, the Taoiseach claimed:The Irish banking sector has very well secured loans.  It is my intention to ensure that the Irish taxpayer will not be held liable in any way for any deficit that might occur in the event of there being a problem in the future.He said the Irish taxpayer would not be held responsible for any debt that might occur in the future.  He should reconsider that in the context of the €22 billion that is being put into Anglo Irish Bank.  A few months later, he told the Irish people that the Government would write any cheque that was required for the banks.  That is exactly what it has done.  It has written a cheque, on behalf of the Irish people, for almost €25 billion for Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society, even though those institutions are, in effect, dead.  Nothing illustrates better the toxic triangle that existed between Fianna Fáil, the developers and the bankers than the manner in which the Government has handled these two failed institutions.  Under the nose of the Government, they were allowed to convert themselves from simple savings and loans institutions into State-backed gambling machines.  In the case of Irish Nationwide, the machine was willing to approve loans of 100% or more to former Fianna Fáil Ministers, without even the pretence of going through the usual credit-approval process.They were machines gambling with the people's money.The evidence from the Honohan and Regling and Watson reports and from other sources is clear.  It was the Taoiseach, when Minister for Finance, who authorised the Dublin Docklands Development Authority to transform itself from a planning body into a development agency, which borrowed massively from Anglo Irish Bank, resulting in taxpayer losses of up to €400 million.  It was Fianna Fáil that appointed Seán FitzPatrick and re-appointed Lar Bradshaw to the board of the DDDA despite the obvious conflicts arising from their membership of the board of Anglo Irish Bank.  The Taoiseach knew this and condoned it.  He let it happen.It was also the Taoiseach who had supper with the board of Anglo Irish Bank in 2008, just before the bank's shares were placed with the golden circle of investors and the bank began to lose its deposits.  Does anybody in the country believe that the guests talked about football and the weather at that fine supper?  It was the Taoiseach and his Minister for Finance who decided, in September 2008, to guarantee not just depositors but risk investors in Anglo Irish Bank — a decision that cost the Irish taxpayer dearly and has been sharply criticised by the Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan.The pattern is clear.  At every point the Taoiseach did all in his power to protect the bank and its big investors, regardless of the cost to the Irish public.  His actions have not only damaged our economy but undermined vital public trust in the institutions of our democracy.  Last week this House was strangled and prevented from discussing the banking crisis or the catastrophe of pregnant women being told their foetuses had died.  The House was the only place in the entire country where discussion on these sensitive and important issues was not allowed, while the Government prepared for its press conference in order to achieve some sense of credibility through spin.Phrases such as "the golden circle", "crony Government", "cosy capitalism" and "the Galway tent" are what the Minister for Finance described as the socio-political context in which the banking crisis occurred.  Of course, the Galway tent and its attendees were central to the socio-political context.  These phrases all describe the same thing: the take-over of our Republic by the rich and powerful, aided and abetted by the Government.  A republic, as the Taoiseach well knows, is not just a form of government or a set of institutions.  It is a living, breathing thing nourished by the dreams and hopes of its people.  Its lifeblood is the trust that binds us, which allows us to say, "We are all in this together".It is that central trust which the Taoiseach has destroyed.  He has divided Ireland between the insiders, who manipulate the system for their own benefit, and the vast majority of our citizens, who are left powerless on the outside.  He has divided Ireland between those at the top, who never take responsibility or face the consequences of their actions, and the thousands of hard-working families who must now pay the price for his mistakes and incompetence.  In a republic, the people are supposed to be supreme.  Based on that simple criterion, the Irish Republic, which this party was proud to declare, is now a republic in name only.  The Celtic tiger is dead and the Government has failed to harness the Celtic spirit.  It is that spirit, deep within our people, and not the mandarins of Merrion Street, that will eventually pull this country through.  It is about time the Government turned its face towards the people and towards that community spirit, rather than turning its back on them as it did when it walked out of here last week.We now stand, thanks to the Taoiseach and his Government, in the wreckage of a great economy.  When this party, along with the Labour Party, handed over to Fianna Fáil in 1997, there was a budget surplus, with a thousand jobs being created every week, high productivity and low costs.  The Fianna Fáil Government has destroyed all the potential benefit from this.  Around this country, families live in a world of shrinking hopes, withered dreams and texts from Australia and America.  Without vision, we perish; but the Taoiseach, together with all those who surround him on the Government benches, is without vision.The people of Ireland yearn for leadership, direction and a sense of hope and possibility.  They yearn for a roadmap to recovery.  The Taoiseach has not even bothered to try to provide any of these.  Back in 2004, a Member of this House defined good government as follows: "Good government does not mean responding blindly to headlines or being pressured into half-responses.  It means sensible policies, soundly based, with realistic, achievable and prioritised targets".  That Member was the Taoiseach, who now stands condemned by his own words.  Based on his own definition of good government, he has failed and failed again.  He has turned poor, unaccountable government into an art form.His answer to the banking crisis is to write whatever cheques are necessary to bail out professional investors in banks, leaving the country in massive debt.  His answer to the fiscal crisis is to hike taxes and cut services, pay and investment, while ignoring the bloated structures of politics and Government.  His answer to the competitiveness crisis is to encourage cuts in pay for low earners while ignoring the costs of services administered or regulated by Government.  Whenever he is queried on his policies, he relies for endorsement on the very same banks, stockbrokers and institutions that he now blames for giving him the wrong advice as Minister for Finance.  To paraphrase the playwright, the Government is barren as a brick.As the architect-in-chief of our economic crisis, how can the Taoiseach come here today and ask this House to vote confidence in him?  As the man who has consistently denied any major responsibility for our economic crisis, how can he claim that he has any moral authority to sit in that seat?  As the man who helped destroy trust in the institutions of this Republic, how can he possibly ask the Irish people to place their trust in him?  Why should they?This goes beyond the mere confines of banks and fiscal policy.  When I asked him in the House about his predecessor's conduct in taking payments while holding the highest office in the land, he said the former Taoiseach was "not incorrect".  Did he not express full confidence in, and vote to retain in the Cabinet, a discredited Minister in the knowledge that he had submitted a sworn affidavit to the High Court which he knew to be false?  These standards, and his actions, are unacceptable in any quarter, least of all in the highest office in the land.There is only one honourable action open to the Taoiseach if he accepts responsibility for the decisions that have driven our economy onto the rocks.  My challenge for the Taoiseach, if he wants to put this acceptance of responsibility to the test, is to go to the country.  Let us have a general election, so that the people can give their verdict, whatever it might be, on the actions of this Government, which has destroyed the hopes and aspirations of so many and now commands the support of a mere 12% of the Irish people.

I expected he would come in today and present a robust defence of his Government's performance and of his performance.  I expected he would have the usual thump at the Opposition or anyone else he could find to blame.  Frankly, the Taoiseach excelled himself with the self-serving nature of his contribution in opening the debate.  He has provided us with half an hour of the most shameless speech I have heard in Dáil Eireann for a long time.  This was the thickest exercise in hard neck politics I have heard in a long time.  It was all about the Government, justifying its action and performance and term of office.  I heard very little about the problems people are facing in this country.  I refer to the 440,000 people on the live register, the highest number ever.  Even in the worst of days ever, the 1930s and 1950s, it never reached a figure like that.  Some 250,000 people lost their jobs since the Government was elected in 1997 and in many cases their redundancy money is now gone.  They are trying to survive on social welfare payments that have been cut by this Government.  I refer to the hundreds of businesses that have gone to the wall and the many more trying to survive.  People working in them and running them tell me it has been months since they were able to take personal payment from their businesses.  Families are trying to pay mortgages on properties in negative equity.  Young people are graduating from colleges and are worried, as are their parents, about the prospect of getting employment.  Pensioners are worried they will be next on the target list of this Government.The Taoiseach tells us everyone else is to blame.  He gave us a long list of the people to blame.  The closest the Taoiseach came to accepting any responsibility was when he spoke about the two reports published last week and how they blamed Governments.  Where did the Taoiseach get the plural?  He has been in government for the past 13 years.  He was Minister for Finance for four of those years and Taoiseach for more than two.  There is no plural.  When the Taoiseach says "Governments", he means his own Government and he must take responsibility for what he has done, which he has not accepted today.  The Taoiseach has come in to ask the Dáil to vote confidence in him and in his Government.I have no hesitation in saying the Labour Party will not do so.  We will not vote confidence in the Taoiseach because, like the people of this country, we have long ago lost confidence in him and in his Government.  We want Fianna Fáil and the Green Party out of government, we want a general election, we want a fresh start for the country and we want to move on as do the vast majority of the people in this country.At one level, this is a parliamentary exercise.  The Taoiseach says his mandate to govern comes from having a majority in this House.  This is a challenge as to whether he continues to have that support.  This is a challenge for each Deputy — whether in Fianna Fáil, the Green Party, or Independents — whether they stand by their narrow, personal or party interest or by the people who elected them.Everywhere I go I hear people ask when I am going to get this Government out and when will an election be held and a new Government elected.  That can be answered today.  I can speak for all Labour Party Deputies.  We want this Government out and a fresh start for the country.  How do the Independent Deputies, the Green Party Deputies and the Fianna Fáil backbenchers stand?  That is the most important question.This is a representative assembly.  Each of us here has a duty to represent the views of the people who elected us.  The people want this Government out of office.  Putting the question another way, if it were the people voting on this motion, what would be the outcome?  If the people had a vote on this motion, they would vote by an overwhelming majority to get this Government out of office.  The question is whether Deputies stand for themselves or for the people.  Deputies cannot come in here at 8.30 p.m. and vote confidence in the Taoiseach and then go back to constituencies and try to distance themselves from that vote.  Any Deputy who votes confidence in the Taoiseach and his Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government must take responsibility, as must the Taoiseach.The reason people want change is clear.  The verdict on this Government is in.  The two reports on the banking crisis are a clear statement of the damage done to this country by Fianna Fáil.  No matter how the Taoiseach reinterprets them, the reports are a clear indictment of Government policy.  The people know who is to blame and they want change but the country cannot have a fresh start while this Government clings to power.  For as long as Fianna Fáil remains in government, it will be preoccupied with self-justification, with defending the record and self-preservation.  I heard one Minister say at the weekend that he could not remember ever making a mistake.  Apparently the Taoiseach cannot remember making any mistakes either.  We simply cannot afford to have a Government so far removed from reality.  We will not tackle our problems with a Government serving out its notice, clinging on to power in the faint hope that some kind of recovery will revive its political fortunes while the rest of us are expected to contract mass amnesia.We need a fresh start and fresh hope.  We need a Government focused on three core tasks — creating jobs, reforming the way this country is governed and bringing fairness into the management of our affairs.  Economic recovery will not come on its own and it will not come by focusing exclusively on rescuing the banks and dealing with the public finances.  We need a strategy for jobs and for economic growth.  We need a Government that understands what is happening in the global economy and how Ireland can prosper within it.  We need a Government that gets the idea that jobs and growth will not come from a hands-off, light touch approach but from offering leadership and direction and from rolling up its sleeves to create jobs in a new, low-carbon, knowledge economy.What the global economy is going through is little short of a new industrial revolution.  The power centres of the world economy are shifting, billions of people are being brought into the global trading system and there is spectacular technological change.  The great recession is slowing these processes down but they will re-assert themselves as the global economy recovers.  This new economy, the knowledge economy, presents great challenges but also major opportunities to countries that understand it and know how to harness it.  It will bring change, not just to one or two sectors or high-tech firms, but right across the economy.  We have to capture that change and harness it.The Government talks about the smart economy but it does not act on it.  The innovation task force made several good proposals but they have not been implemented.  The Government talks about hard decisions but it is dodging the greatest challenge our country faces, namely, creating jobs.  The Government has taken on board some Labour Party ideas, like the earn and learn scheme or energy conservation in homes, but with no force, drive or energy.The Labour Party has been unwavering in its focus on job creation.The Labour Party's proposal for a strategic investment bank is designed to meet the financing needs of innovative Irish companies, and to assist in financing the infrastructure they need to thrive.  Using capital from the pension reserve fund, we can build a new institution that will focus directly on financing the new economy.  It can help to deal with the impact of the banking crisis, but it is a long-term solution to a long-term need.The Labour Party's jobs fund is designed to support this sustainable, knowledge economy.  It is designed to be allocated outside the Estimates process, as part of our broader proposals for reform of public expenditure management.  The jobs fund proposed by the Labour Party will provide additional resources to agencies that can deliver jobs.  It will be there to finance PRSI exemptions for new jobs, training schemes, and new strategies for agencies, provided they can show the money will be translated into jobs.Labour's "Just the Job" proposals on training and work experience are designed to meet the new needs of our workforce. Instead of proposing one big scheme, we have suggested a range of ideas to meet the needs of individuals, so that those who have no work can equip themselves to find new employment.  In that way we will avoid the build-up of long-term unemployment that happened in the 1980s.Not everyone will find a job in a high-tech start-up firm.  Labour's sectoral policies, such as those for clean tech and tourism, are designed, therefore, to build up sectors of the economy where Ireland has natural competitive advantages.  As a country, we have great resources of wind and wave that can be converted into clean energy, to meet our own needs and those of other countries.  In tourism, we can enhance and develop Ireland's tourism product in a sector with a presence in every region that offers employment across a range of skills.These are all Labour policy initiatives. They demonstrate that the knowledge economy is a progressive project.  It cannot be delivered by a hands-off Government that believes its role in the economy is to get out of the way.  That was the thinking that led to the disaster in the banking sector.  The same ideology is blocking the Government from taking action now. What we need is a Government that understands the extent of the change that this new economy needs, and a public sector that is infused with the same spirit.This is the second time in a generation that Ireland has been confronted by a profound economic crisis.  It happened at a time when public trust and confidence in our public institutions was already damaged.  It cannot go on.  We must stop lurching from one disaster to the next.  We have to change the way this country is run, beginning with a change of Government but also changing the way that politics works.  Last week we saw our national Parliament reduced to a farce.  We had national and international events that could not be discussed because the Government ran away from the Dáil. That cannot go on.  We need real reform of how the Dáil operates.  We need a national Parliament that meets at least four days a week, cuts out the long recesses and deals with relevant issues in a relevant way.  More than that, however, we must ensure that individual citizens feel a far greater sense of involvement in the decisions that shape their lives.  We need a more practical democracy that will bring back the people into decision making.Labour's proposal for a constitutional convention is designed to review the functioning of our institutions, with the direct involvement of individual citizens.  The Constitution belongs to the people and if there are to be proposals for far-reaching change they must come from a process that involves the people directly. We need to get on with the business of reforming the public sector as the Labour Party has long proposed.  Examples include reforming the HSE and our proposal to open up recruitment in the public service and encourage movement between the public and private sectors.   We also need to see private sector reform.  Many of those who sat on the boards of Irish banks during the making of this crisis remain in place.  The unduly deferential approach towards the banks identified by Professor Honohan still exists, in Government itself.  Labour's "Never Again" proposals for reform of corporate Ireland include far more demanding and modern standards of corporate governance, an end to the system of "You sit on my board and I set the remuneration for yours", a whistleblower's Act, and a break in the link between big money and politics.We must also change the structures of economic governance and management.  We need far greater openness about our public finances and far more scrutiny of the effect of Government decisions, especially in respect of taxation.  The era of design-your-own tax incentives is over. We need new structures to identify emerging threats to the economy, and to subject economic forecasting to greater scrutiny.  We should, therefore, establish an independent fiscal council to act as an external check on macroeconomic forecasts, the sustainability of public finances and the true cost of tax breaks.  We cannot just pretend the crisis did not happen.  We have to build in new checks and balances to make sure it does not happen again.We live in an era of limited resources, but that does not mean we have to ration our values.  There are certain basic principles that must guide us, such as the notion that health care is different from other services.  Health care should be delivered efficiently and with a clear eye to value for money but  it should not be driven by profit alone.  There is something far more important, far more basic to the human condition and to who we are as a people, in how we care and how we die, than the bottom financial line.I firmly believe that the future of health care in Ireland rests in the Labour Party's proposal for a system of universal health insurance, where all are treated equally and not in the out-moded, out-dated ideological reflex of this Government that wants to privatise the VHI.  It has no mandate to sell off the VHI.  The Labour Party will not do so.  We will retain it as a building block of a new and better health insurance system.Fairness demands that we do not inflict the cost of Fianna Fáil's mistakes on a new generation.  Once again, this State has been shamed, when it could not even count the number of children who have died in its care.  It is time to hold a constitutional referendum and to enshrine in our basic law the rights of the child.  It is long past time that we made a fundamental commitment to the future of our children and of our country by tackling the problems of literacy and numeracy.  The decision by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Coughlan, to withdraw the services of specialist librarians who work in 20 of the most disadvantaged secondary schools in the State is a callous act of unbelievable folly.This moment must be to this generation what 1958 was to a generation before — a watershed moment when old ways and past failures were left behind, and fresh thinking was embraced. For generations the political choices offered to the Irish people boiled down to two versions of the same thing.  Now there is a hunger for real change, and the Labour Party is ready to lead that change.It is time for Fianna Fáil to go.  It is time for a new start, and a new Government.  It is time to set aside the politics of division.  This is too small a country for setting neighbour against neighbour.  The Labour Party's vision is of one Ireland, a country that pulls together to get through this economic disaster and afterwards works together to build a better and fairer future.  It is of a country infused with fresh hope and with the core underlying idea that has driven the Labour Party for a century — solidarity.This is a great country.  Together, from the embers of this crisis, we can build a new and better Ireland if we have a vision of what can be achieved and the commitment to work together to achieve it.  It is time for a jobs strategy for economic recovery. It is time for reform to revive and renew our institutions.  It is time for fairness in everything we do.  It is time to move on, together as one Ireland.  However, to do so we need to be freed from the politics of the past and from a Government that is now preoccupied with justifying its past.  We need to move on and that moving on can come only with the defeat of this Fianna Fáil Government, the holding of a new election and an opportunity being given to the people to chart their own future, democratically, in a general election.

I sat on these benches in 1977 when the triumphant Jack Lynch came in with his manifesto of economic illiteracy that believed we could borrow our way into the future in other people's currencies.  That economy collapsed amid its own contradictions when Jack Lynch was ousted two years later.  Then there was Mr. Haughey, clinging to power for reasons we now understand, literally giving money to everybody and anybody.For those of us who are old enough to remember and for those of us who still have the scars, the crawl back through three general elections between 1981 and 1982 was a difficult time for everybody, but we did crawl back.  Slowly but surely, through that very difficult period in the 1980s, we tried to get the country back on its feet again.  It was not just people on this side of the House who did that; people on the other side of the House tried as well.  They recognised that mistakes had been made and they had the honesty to recognise them and to deal with them.When we went into government with Fianna Fáil in 1992 and when we left office in 1997, I had the honour of being Minister for Finance.  I had the responsibility and the courage to ensure that we would not try to buy the next election.  As a consequence, the Taoiseach and his colleagues inherited the first planned surplus in over 30 years and the most competitive economy in Europe at that time, creating 1,000 jobs a week, with unemployment rapidly falling.The 1997 to 2010 period should have been a wonderful period of prosperity, of shared opportunity, of modest and prudent investment, but the Government blew it and I can give one iconic example of this. One hundred years ago in this city and across the country, children were getting out of overcrowded tenement buildings in urban Ireland and poorly built thatched cottages in rural Ireland, with no running water, no decent construction, dampness and cold in the winter and walking to school, where they were housed and educated in classrooms that were in state-of-the-art buildings at that time.  The Taoiseach knows them because they are part of our rural landscape.  Those children got the best and were educated in the best physical surroundings that were available to them; better than anything they lived in at home.  If we fast forward to today, the grandchildren of those people get up in warm beds in centrally heated houses, double glazed windows and patios, walk to their cars and are driven to school, where they are educated in prefabs.A total of 100,000 children are currently in prefabs in this country, and that population is growing.  The children who are born tonight will be knocking on school doors in four years' time.  As it takes the Department of Education and Skills five years to process an application for a school extension, they will be knocking on the door of a prefab.Why did this come about?  The money was there.  Fortunes were made.  Builders could not get enough people at home to work and they had to import labourers from everywhere else.  Money was not a problem and the frequent cry was "I do not care how much it costs, just how soon can it be built?"I acutely remember listening to representatives from the chambers of commerce in Carrick on Shannon when they met me in a deputation in the spring of 1997 when I was on a visit to Sligo and Leitrim.  They told me they wanted the urban renewal scheme for Carrick on Shannon and I asked them what part of the town did they have in mind.  They told me I did not understand, that they did not want to discriminate within Carrick or between Carrick and the different villages and towns in Leitrim, but that they wanted Section 23 urban renewal for all of Leitrim.  I had to bite my lip.If one goes to that part of the country today, one will see the prefab schools and the empty buildings.  The whole of the north Shannon region is a wasteland of buildings that will never become homes, because the Government of which the Taoiseach was a member, under Mr. McCreevy as Minister for Finance, gave that section 23 facility to the whole north Shannon basin.The legacy of the Celtic tiger will not be the soundly built buildings in which our grandparents were educated, but buildings that we will have to plough back into the ground.  If ever there was such conspicuous, wilful and criminal waste, then this is but one example.  Time prevents me from citing many more, but we never heard a word about the wasted money for a generation that will never come back again.  That money is gone, like the savings people had in bank shares which made up their pension.  These were prudent, middle class people who were at an age where they could not buy proper pension plans for themselves and were advised to put their money in banks.  They were not advised to do this for an appreciation of the shares, but for the dividend that was to be paid out.  They are now impoverished, and who do they think of when they look at the despair around them because they cannot sell buildings that have lost their value and they fear old age.Does the Taoiseach appreciate or understand the deep seated anger, disgust and contempt in which the people hold him and his colleagues?  I had to visit Glasthule this morning on personal business.  I was asked at the DART station there when I was going "to get them out".  I was asked "how long more can we put up with them".There is palpable anger, disgust and a despair that does not affect just the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Party.  It has infected us all.  The Government has contaminated the republican democracy that is enshrined in this Chamber.  As some Members of this House were crooked, contemptuous or lax in what they did, we have all been infected.  That is the virus that has become Fianna Fáil.  That is why it is unbelievable that the Taoiseach would even have the temerity to come into this House and ask that we vote confidence in him and his colleagues.  There is a litany of waste and contemptuous dismissal, as the Minister, Deputy Dempsey showed by saying "What is €50 million?" for the voting machines that even Robert Mugabe would not buy.

Yet it was a piddling sum according to the Minister, or just petty cash.  The Taoiseach has treated taxpayers' money as petty cash and he has the temerity now to seek confidence from us.The Taoiseach spoke earlier about policies he has delivered and said that the Government is now on the right course.  How do we know we are on the right course?  Is it because The Wall Street Journal tells us?  How do we know that he is getting good advice or implementing it?  Why should we trust or have confidence that the people who have blown the boom will restore it back to some degree of credibility?The Government Deputies will escape in four or five weeks into the summer, and I can see in all their faces and in the weariness of the responses to questions that they cannot wait.  However, the people will not go away.  The Taoiseach does not even have the courage to call three by-elections.  As he does not have that courage, the children of this republic are not getting the referendum to which they are entitled.  This is happening not because of legal complexities or because the Government cannot afford the referendum, but because Government Deputies are so scared of their political futures with the result that children of this nation are not being cherished equally.  They are not being cherished equally due to mean and miserable political cowardice that prevents the Taoiseach from going to the country.The republican Oliver Cromwell gave advice to a decrepit, corrupt and now defunct Government and Parliament in Westminster many years ago.  I offer it to the Taoiseach:  "In the name of God, go".

However, the pressure has been taken off one set of incompetents — Fianna Fáil — by the political ineptitude of another set of incompetents — Fine Gael.The Irish people now know all too well where the political leadership of Fianna Fáil has brought the State and the economy.  Where would the political leadership of Fine Gael bring us?  With the Fianna Fáil Government on the ropes, Fine Gael has managed to deliver a knockout punch — to itself.  We have no confidence in either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael.  However, the motion before us today is about the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, and the Fianna Fáil and Green Party Government, and we have no hesitation in opposing this motion of confidence in them.When a motion of no confidence in the Government was tabled this time last year, I stated the coalition of corrupt politicians, property developers and bankers brought this economy to its knees and they will not and cannot lead it into recovery.  Those words have been vindicated by the reports on banking published last week.  I doubt whether any Government during its term of office has been the subject of such a damning verdict on its stewardship of the economy over a prolonged period.Fianna Fáil came to power with the Progressive Democrats in 1997 and it has been in office continuously ever since.  It has shaped the economy in a way that no previous Government could have done because of its length of time in office and the massive resources at its disposal.  Clearly, there is not a shred of credibility in its effort to shirk responsibility for what has happened to the Irish economy.After a decade in office it brought the economy to a critical stage in 2007.  In many ways this was a key year.  The electorate was already disillusioned with Fianna Fáil but there was a sense that there might be economic problems ahead and so, during the course of the general election of that year, many wavering voters swung back to Fianna Fáil, seeking stability and continuity and believing that the so-called "Celtic tiger" could be prolonged.In fact, the people were being deceived by the Government and the bankers.  As the report of Patrick Honohan states, as late as 2007 the Central Bank was predicting a soft landing for the economy.  Mr. Honohan's report states:  "This appears to have been "a triumph of hope over reality".  More generally, a rather defensive approach was adopted to external critics...".It was in 2007, in the wake of the general election, that the re-elected Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, lashed out at those he accused of "cribbing and moaning" and he wondered why they "don't commit suicide".  It was a nasty little outburst that revealed the deep insecurity underneath the Fianna Fáil swagger.There is a myth being peddled now by Fianna Fáil — we had evidence of it today in the Taoiseach's address — that all political parties in the Dáil were part of this collective self-delusion and encouraged the economic policies pursued between 1997 and 2007.  I will let other parties speak for themselves but Sinn Féin stands on its record and during that period we repeatedly advocated a radically different direction for the economy.  In the 2007 general election we were the only party not promoting a policy of tax-cutting.Let there be no mistake about it.  Sinn Féin presented a real alternative approach and a sound analysis of the economy in every year since 1997 and pointed out years before it happened that the property bubble was just that, and would lead our economy and citizenry into a serious financial downturn.  In successive pre-budget submissions from 1997 onwards we called for fundamental tax reform, the development of public services on a sound basis, wealth redistribution and housing policy based on social need and not the greed of speculators.  The proposals of Sinn Féin and of other progressive voices were treated with contempt by the Fianna Fáil-led Government and — let it be recalled — by the vast majority of economic and political commentators who cheered on Ministers for Finance McCreevy and Cowen.Before the property boom really took off, Sinn Féin identified the social and economic damage that would be caused by a housing policy based solely on the market.  When the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002 was being debated here in February of that year I stated:[Government] housing policy, such as it is and as reflected in the Bill, relies almost totally on the market, and the profit motive of developers and the construction industry, to meet a massive social need.  This policy has failed and always will.The Bill provides a legislative basis for what is called social and affordable housing.  The very terminology is an admission of failure.  It reflects the reality that decent housing is beyond the affordable reach of huge sections of our society.  The National Economic and Social Forum in its report on social housing concluded that "home ownership is now beyond the reach of most people on average incomes". ... In the marketplace, on which the Government relies totally for housing provision, what matters most is the price of houses as products for sale and as investments, not their value as homes for real people.The Taoiseach has claimed credit for abolishing some of the property-based tax relief, which was done very late in the day.  Again, in 2002, I stated:In Budget 2002, the Government restored interest relief on rented residential property and reduced stamp duty rates for investors.  This will worsen the housing crisis by increasing property prices.In November 2000 we stated, in our pre-budget submission for 2001:Sinn Féin's approach to the economy is distinctive, radical and rational.  We are not prisoners of the unbridled free market thinking which has dominated the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Coalition.  We reject their primary economic policy of cutting taxes in a way which has disproportionately benefited the higher paid.To go back further, in November 1998, we pointed out that Irish banks enjoyed a return on their equity which was double the European average, making them among the most profitable banks in the industrialised world.  It is clear now that greed and arrogance in Irish banks was inflated in such a situation and the ground was prepared for the property bubble and the lending spree to come.  We called for an increase in corporation tax for Irish retail banks with the resulting tax funds earmarked for community and local development projects in the most disadvantaged areas throughout the State.  We stated that ultimately, the banking sector should be nationalised so that the Irish people could be the true beneficiaries of this vastly profitable business.  We know what happened.  The only bank to be nationalised is the zombie Anglo Irish Bank, the pet bank of the golden circle and now a parasite on the Irish economy.In 1999, we called for no more reductions in corporation tax or capital gains tax.  In 2000, we pointed out that the Government's agenda was to implement tax cuts that primarily benefited the highest incomes.  While those on low incomes were rightly being taken out of the tax net, the Government refused to introduce wholesale tax reform.On the banks we said:It has been clearly shown that the private and public banking companies have at times been active participants in systematic tax fraud.  Their activities were compounded by a regulatory system that, at worst, was unwilling to tackle tax fraud and was, at best, incompetent and unable to enforce the tax laws of the State.That was in 2000.  We pointed out the deficiencies and the almost entire failure of the regulatory system to address the financial institutions.Crucially, in 2000 we also called for control of land prices with a statutory ceiling on the price of land zoned for housing to stop speculation and reduce soaring house prices, and we called for a constitutional amendment to allow for this if necessary.  In November 2002, in advance of budget 2003, we called for a cost benefit analysis of the battery of tax reliefs set up by successive Ministers for Finance.  That analysis was never done and untold millions were lost in property-based tax relief that fuelled the disastrous property bubble.Speaking on the floor of this House on the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill in 2004, my colleague Deputy Morgan said:Rather than tackling the housing crisis through the provision of increased levels of social housing and taking real measures to tackle house and land prices, the government is appeasing bankers and developers by introducing measures which may result in over borrowing.He went on to make another important contribution — if only the Government had listened.  He said:It is easy in a favourable economic climate to forget the dangers for those who over-borrow of any significant rise in interest rates.  They will end up paying mortgages way beyond their means and facing the threat of repossession.  If the house price bubble bursts, they will end up with negative equity.Deputy Morgan made his contribution in 2004, years before that very event took place, but nobody listened.  Today to listen to the Taoiseach one would think that nobody had ever sounded out these notes of caution, signalled these warnings or painted the reality of what was down the road as clearly as he did.  Without doubt, the record of Sinn Féin's contributions here over all those years stands the test of any scrutiny.In that same debate Deputy Ó Snodaigh pointed out that banks were giving mortgages of three times the salary of the principal earner and the amount of the salary of the second earner.  He reminded the Government that these were the same institutions which had been involved in many scandals and ripped off the State time and again.  Look at what it is doing today in 2010, six years later.  It is ripping off the State and its citizenry daily.  Let the record show that only eight Deputies voted against the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, the passage of which clearly helped to fuel the property bubble, the five Sinn Féin Deputies at that time and three other Members of the House.We in Sinn Féin were not alone in calling for a different economic direction and warning of the consequences of Government policy, but all dissenting views were dismissed by an arrogant Administration that expressed supreme confidence in its own wisdom.  Where is that supreme confidence now?  It seems now that it was not in control at all and certainly was not responsible for the collapse.  The Taoiseach has blamed the advice of the Central Bank and international factors.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, was the best of all when he said , “No one really is responsible.  It just happened”.  I wonder how many times the dog ate the Minister’s homework when he was going to school?We know now who the culprits are but who is being made to pay the price by this Government?  Not a banker or developer, speculator or so-called regulator has spent even a night behind bars.  A handful have been removed from their positions but most of them have had a very soft landing.  Mr. Patrick Neary, the chief executive of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, retired with a €630,000 pay-off.  In addition, he is receiving an annual pension of €142,670.  Mr. John Hurley was the Governor of the Central Bank until 2009 and received a payment on retirement of €525,000 and will receive a pension of approximately €175,000 a year.  Mr. Eugene Sheehy was chief executive of AIB until 2009.  He earned €2.1 million in 2007 and €1.15 million in 2008.  His pension is some €450,000 a year.  Mr. Brian Goggin was chief executive of Bank of Ireland until 2009.  His pay peaked at €3.1 million in 2007 and his pension is approximately €650,000 per year.  So much for soft landings.  What about the crash landings?The people who are being made to pay the price by this bankrupt Government are the 440,000 people unemployed in this State, the jobless young people whose dole has been cut, the social welfare recipients whose payments have been reduced, the carers whose already meagre support has been reduced further and the older people whose home help hours have been slashed.  The price is being paid by children in our schools and by patients in our hospitals.  It is being paid by families who are losing their homes or who are living in poverty and debt because they are saddled with huge mortgages, legacies of the Fianna Fáil property bubble.  People are hurting and are living daily in anguish and fear of the future.The tragedy is that this situation need never have developed if the right policies had been pursued but nothing has really changed and nothing will change under this Government.  We have a Health Service Executive that has proven to be even more dysfunctional than we thought it was.  How could it be otherwise?  It was established to act as a buffer between the Government and, specifically, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, who uses the HSE to insulate herself and her Cabinet colleagues from responsibility and accountability.  The HSE was established to underpin a grossly inequitable two-tier health system.  By the one act of maintaining such an inequitable and inefficient health system, the Fianna Fáil Government has forfeited any claim to have the confidence of the people or assert that it could expect it.The atrocious stewardship of the Government and the HSE has been exposed yet again in the scandal of the deaths of children in State care and in the miscarriage misdiagnosis scandal.  At this time, just to show that nothing has really changed, the Government has approved the appointment of the HSE CEO.  He is the former CEO of the privatised Eircom with a salary greater than that of the Taoiseach or Cabinet Ministers at €322,000 per annum of public money.Returning to the immediate issue that triggered this confidence debate, the banks, the two reports by Professor Patrick Honahan, and by Mr. Klaus Regling and Mr. Max Watson vindicate what we in Sinn Féin have warned about for years.  We called for stronger regulation, caps on remuneration for bankers, an end to property inflation, a fair tax policy based on stable direct taxation, improvements to corporate law, a tax on speculative trading and counter-cyclical budget policies.These reports show how Fianna Fáil Governments recklessly managed our economy and led us directly into the current financial crisis.  They are an indictment of Government policy and particularly of the Taoiseach's role as Minister for Finance.  They are also an indictment of the Financial Regulator, rating agencies and bankers.Sinn Féin stood alone in our warnings among the political parties.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party also wanted to feed the property bubble.  Their call to lower direct taxes and to abolish stamp duty in 2007 would have added fuel to the fire.The Government claims it has learned from its mistakes but it has not.  One of the criticisms is that it followed a pro-cyclical budgetary approach and relied on unstable taxes.  Pro-cyclical policy is Charlie McCreevy economics, that is, spend money when one has it and do not worry about saving.  A counter-cyclical approach saves in the good times so that one can spend in the bad times, and spends in the bad times to re-inflate the economy.  The Government is still pursuing these fundamentally flawed policies.  Its pro-cyclical approach now entails cuts which intelligent economists say are wrong because they are deflating the economy.The authors of the reports published last week were not permitted to investigate anything that happened in the banks subsequent to the night of the guarantee in September 2008.  Since then the Government has nationalised one of the most corrupt banks in the world, Anglo Irish Bank; awarded a €1 million pension to the former CEO of Irish Nationwide, Michael Fingleton; established NAMA to buy €54 billion worth of bad loans that are probably worth much less; and recapitalised several banks to the tune of billions of euro, with the result that AIB is all but nationalised.  Apparently inaccurate, if not fraudulent, accounts have been signed off at several banks by Government appointed directors and auditing firms that were subsequently awarded contracts with NAMA.These reports could not be clearer in showing that the crisis is domestic and that the Government's excuses about the collapse of Lehman Brothers are spurious.  They find, essentially, that the Government's economic policies caused the crash.  The banking inquiry arising from these reports will start over the summer and run for six months but its terms of reference are already compromised by the Government because it is refusing to let the inquiry investigate its economic policies.  It is instead appointing an Oireachtas committee, which of course will have a majority of Government Members, to report on its macroeconomic policies.Mr. Honahan's report states that the bank guarantee was necessary and justified to prevent the banking system imploding but that the terms and conditions fell short.  That is close to Sinn Féin's position.  We accepted that action had to be taken on the banks to protect people's deposits but we wanted strict conditions.  We urged that the guarantee be used as the first step to full nationalisation because we felt it was necessary to stop the banks imploding, based on the information put in front of us at that time.  However, as the terms and conditions fell far short of what was required and amounted to a bailout of the culprits, we voted against them.  Between the proposal of the bank guarantee scheme and the presentation to this House of its terms and conditions, we met the Minister for Finance to lay out precisely what we required in return for our support.  The Minister knew what he had to do but he failed miserably.We called for the wind down of Anglo Irish Bank.  We wanted taxpayers, not bondholders protected.  We demanded that the main banks be taken into public ownership and turned into a State bank.Regrettably the Labour Party took a totally short-term and contradictory position by opposing the guarantee without presenting an alternative.  It did not state what it would have done when people found the next day they were unable to access their wages in their bank accounts.  When it got around to calling for the nationalisation of the banks, which is a guarantee of sorts because  the State takes on all deposits and loans, it proposed giving the healthy nationalised banks back to the private sector.  Sinn Féin has been criticised by voices in the Labour Party since then but we will not accept criticism from that quarter about our position on the banks. Our position has been consistent and sound.Sinn Féin would remove all the bank executives and directors involved in causing the crisis who are still in positions of power.  We would also make sure the criminal aspects of what happened are pursued.  We would take care of the ordinary citizens who were ruined by the banking crisis and are being forced to pay for it even though it was not of their making.  That entails protecting those who are in negative equity, facing repossession and struggling with debt.  It would include protecting viable businesses which are struggling to access credit.  We would nationalise AIB and Bank of Ireland to create a State bank.  We would wind up Anglo Irish Bank and let other banks fold if they cannot exist on their own and take their good assets into the larger banks.We need rid of this rotten Government and we need a new beginning to Irish politics.  That will not happen under a Government led by either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael.  For the first time it may be the case that a majority are prepared to vote for parties other than these two conservative blocs that have dominated politics for so long.  We in Sinn Féin have a vision for a re-built Irish economy.  This would be done through saving and creating jobs; reforming the tax system to ensure the wealthy are paying their fair share; eradicating waste in public spending, such as exorbitant executive salaries; reforming national and local governance; drawing up a realistic debt repayment structure on the basis of an economy that will grow if it receives investment; and fully regulating a new finance system with necessary secure measures like stronger capital requirements for banks and the supervision of credit rating agencies.All of this would be done to build an economy that serves the people.  It would provide the basis for a transformed, equitable and efficient health service, education with access for all, decent and affordable housing, sound social welfare support for everyone who needs it and security for our older citizens.  That is our vision for the future and it is what we are committed to achieving.  The first step must be removal of this Government and, therefore, we oppose the motion of confidence that it has so shamelessly moved.  It is an absolute disgrace.

Deputy White is having considerable selective amnesia.  When her party was in opposition it had a completely different viewpoint on how Fianna Fáil was operating in government.  I want to be fair to the Taoiseach.  We are speaking in respect of the two reports covering the period from September 2004 to early 2008, when the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, was Minister for Finance.  Page 28 of Professor Honohan's report states:Although Ireland‘s public debt level immediately prior to the crisis was low, the fiscal deficit and public sector borrowing surged quickly with the onset of the crisis.  This was partly attributable to a rise in Government spending in GDP (after 2004) which became embedded in the system.Not only did we have pro-cyclical budgets, but they were turbo-boosted by the current Taoiseach.  The cyclical taxes that were property related represented 8% of our tax take in 1987 and in 2006 they represented 30%.  According to Professor Honohan's report real expenditure rose by 11% in 2007 and 2008, which coincides with the general election year.  I remember the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen, speaking on radio a week before the general election — when we were cautioning — telling the public there was not a problem and the fundamentals were sound.  After the general election he spoke to the House about soft landings for months.  The dogs in the street knew there were problems.  Furthermore in his speech today he spoke about eliminating tax incentive schemes.  He referred to "the decisions in the budget I presented to Dáil Éireann in December 2005 to abolish a very wide range of property-based tax incentives".  However, they were not introduced for a further two and a half years in July 2008, when the crash was happening.  He gives the impression that he made all these decisions, but he procrastinated over eliminating the tax incentive schemes.  We now have properties built — many of them sitting idle — and many people in negative equity.  The consequences of negative equity are not just in terms of the house itself.  It is affecting people's capacity to borrow and mobility of staff.The facts speak for themselves.  Three quarters of the fiscal and banking crisis was caused by local factors according to Professor Honohan's report.  The Taoiseach did not give any evidence to those preparing either of these reports.  He was Minister for Finance during the critical period.  We need a proper commission of investigation to investigate the motivational aspects of why the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, as Minister for Finance introduced these aspects.Two Green Party Members gave speeches — effectively on mature reflection.  The problem is that neither of them once mentioned joblessness — the 400,000 people on the live register.  What are they doing about that?  They spoke about bogs and other matters, which are all very well in their own regard.  The top priority should be jobs.

#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	195	The main criticism of the Government in the two reports was that it contributed significantly to the scale of the home-grown economic crisis because of the policies pursued in the past decade.  This helped create a climate of public opinion that led people to believe that the party could last forever.  The Honohan report concluded that "macroeconomic and budgetary policies contributed significantly to the economic overheating, relying to a clearly unsustainable extent on the construction sector and other transient sources for Government revenue".  The report by Klaus Regling and Max Watson stated that alarm bells should have sounded when the property booms and lending trends in the banking sector expanded as far back as 2003.  They added that vote-winning economic policies during the boom heightened the vulnerability of the economy and the then Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, began spending money while taxes were cut.Both reports clearly state that the Government was at fault and that the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, as the then Minister for Finance should take responsibility for that.  Even the present Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said during a radio interview on 10 June that he deeply regretted some Government decisions that led to the banking crisis.  He admitted that wrong decisions were made.  Speaking on "Morning Ireland" he said that the economy became much too dependent on tax receipts from the likes of stamp duty which created an asset bubble.  He pointed out that during the property boom, there was no appetite for the property tax, which would have curbed some of the activity.The two reports point the finger fairly and squarely at the Government that was in power at that time.  The Regling and Watson report states: "Fiscal policy, bank governance and financial supervision left the economy vulnerable to a deep crisis, with costly and extended social fallout."  We see that every day in health cuts, loss of hospital beds, welfare reductions, cuts in job-creation incentive, cuts in services for those with special needs etc.  The Opposition had no option but to table this motion today.  If Fianna Fáil was in opposition — which it will be soon enough — it would do the same thing.  These are the most damning reports on any Government I have seen since I was elected to the House more than 23 years ago and the Government should take responsibility for them.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	196	I am glad to have the opportunity to speak to this motion of confidence in the Taoiseach's leadership.  I have no confidence in the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, in Fianna Fáil or the Green Party in the leadership they are providing for the country.  As we speak approximately 500,000 people are unemployed.  They are looking for jobs and looking for a way to contribute to their families and communities.  They are looking for leadership from the Government to make this happen and are getting none of it.  For months and years we have been pointing out the lack of action and ideas from the Government on job creation.  I spoke on many occasions on the potential for job creation within our tourism, agriculture and food-production sectors to develop and grow in these difficult times.  I have highlighted on numerous occasions the skill and expertise we have among those people who are forced to sign on.  A stimulus package should have been created and brought to the House by the Government to help those 500,000 unemployed people.Policies to promote job creation and lead people into starting their own small businesses are non-existent.  The county enterprise boards which have provided a significant leadership role in allowing many small businesses to start up are starved of finance by the Government.The recession has had a devastating impact on families in this country.  People are struggling with money and lie awake at night in the fear that some of them will lose their homes.  That is not an empty fear but real for thousands of people.  It is not good enough for the Government, led by the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen and including the Green Party, to stand by and see so many people frightened in their homes, and fearing for their families and children.  We can laugh and sneer in this House from time to time but I am opposing the motion because the Government has stood idle and not acted to help the thousands of people leaving our shores.  Many young people are emigrating from every corner of the country, which is a national disgrace.  People should not say they have the interests of the country at heart when this is allowed to happen.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	201	It presents the Government with an opportunity not only to set the record straight but to reaffirm our commitment to recovery.  The recovery we have in mind is not a short-term opinion poll recovery but real and lasting economic recovery about which the Irish people will pass judgment in the only poll that counts in two years.The people know Ireland is on the correct path but they also know we have some distance to travel.  To make the journey safely, the country needs a steady, determined and calm hand on the tiller.  If events over the past number of days have crystallised anything for the people, it is that the leadership necessary for a nation in difficult times is available only on this side of the House.  This Government can take the heat, hold firm in its course and will not lose its nerve as there is simply too much at stake.Our debate this afternoon, which should have been on the merits of the reports, has been personalised to one of confidence in the man who over the past two years as Taoiseach has skilfully led Ireland through one of the most difficult and challenging periods in our post-independence history.  The capacity of any Taoiseach to lead a team of Ministers, particularly a team formed from a coalition of political parties, and through that team lead the nation, is best tested during a period of significant challenge where difficult choices must be made.  The leadership capacity demonstrated by Deputy Brian Cowen in this regard over the past two years is without precedent.  It is evident in his ability to understand the silent majority and appreciate the importance in leadership of bringing the people with him to achieve enduring change and progress.Deputy Cowen has mapped a course for this country that will not just see it recover from current challenges but see it achieve long-term and sustainable growth.  The actions taken to stabilise our public finances, restore our competitiveness, rebuild our tax base and repair our banks, run in parallel with the strategic vision for the development of a smart economy investing in critical infrastructure, job creation and the productive sector, have been prioritised.  In the past week crucial progress has been achieved in the reform of the public sector.The leadership demonstrated by Deputy Brian Cowen and this Government on these critical decisions received only hollow support when it suited from the main party opposite and even less from its would-be partners in any alternative government.  No Government can expect the Opposition to be cheerleaders on its behalf but there are times when the national interest must be put above political interest.  If, at such times, a proposed course of action by a Government is not to be supported, the minimum the public deserves to know is the alternative Opposition course of action.  At such critical times a simple cry of "We would not start from here" does not hold up to scrutiny as it offers no solution.Leadership is about being honest with the public and setting out a position.  Today, nothing but the question of leadership is on the minds of the Deputies directly opposite in the blue corner.  The issue of leadership and a cohesive policy position is so lacking from the red corner that neither the Irish public nor the rest of us in Dáil Éireann knows where that party stands in a spectrum of issues.  The most prominent recent example has been the party's position on the Croke Park deal but even in my own new portfolio dealing with education there appears to be a complete divergence of opinion emanating from within the party on issues of significant importance to the future direction of education policy.The disingenuous nature of Opposition contributions this afternoon are no surprise as they reinterpret the words and sense of the banking reports to suit their political target of the day.  There has been no scrutiny of their own policies or words during that period.  We know there are significant lessons for us all to be learned from the course taken by our domestic banking sector over the past decade.Support of the economic consensus and orthodoxy of the day was either explicit or implicit across all parties of the House and the proof of this was in the election manifestos.  It exists in many of the statements on the record of this House, calling for more homes to be constructed, more stamp duty relief for home buyers and for more spending on each area across the remit of the Government.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	203	To suggest we have blown the boom is probably the most disingenuous accusation often made across the Opposition benches.  We have faced into the challenges of today from a position of strength, coming from the good years when we invested smartly with purpose in Ireland's economic and social infrastructure and in our long-term future while also paying down national debt.  That should not be forgotten.On this side of the House we have overseen transformations in transport, water, communications and investment in education.  I take umbrage at the comments on education by Opposition Members.  When the Labour Party left the Department dealing with education we only had 300 special needs assistants but we now have 10,000.  There has been significant investment in 1,490 schools across the country this year, benefiting very much from investments in summer work schemes and capital.We know the path to recovery will not be easy and I am sure the political temperature will remain high in future.  I am honoured to have worked closely with the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen and I believe in his competence in leading this Government and the country through the difficult and challenging tasks ahead.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	204	Motions of no confidence, or in this case the motion of confidence tabled by the Government, are serious matters.  It is not a game, show or a piece of political theatre very often described afterwards as a damp squib.  The first duty on all of us as elected Members is to provide a strong and stable Government, and nowhere is this more important than during times of recession and economic difficulties.Under the 1937 Constitution, the Dáil has elected 11 taoisigh.  Some have been defeated in general elections, others have resigned during office while others have seen the writing on the wall that they did not command sufficient support and did not allow themselves go forward for election in this House.  The House has never formally withdrawn its support from any Taoiseach heretofore and I do not believe Deputy Brian Cowen should be the first Taoiseach to have confidence formally withdrawn by this 30th Dáil.I say this as somebody who has sat at the Cabinet table with Deputy Cowen for 13 years.  At that table I see a man who puts the national interest first on all occasions.  He advocates on behalf of the people of this country as he sees it.  I do not see, as has been suggested here, a man who is in any way corrupt.  Anybody aspiring to the office of Taoiseach knows that in Deputy Brian Cowen we have somebody who is straight, honest and hard-working.  We have a person of substance and enormous courage.As Minister for Health and Children I have seen this very clearly over the past two years.  He was rock solid on the cancer control plan and even when there was political pressure to dilute the plan, he did not waver.  Unlike others he did not march in his constituency for his local hospital but he put patients first.

There are other issues, such as the recent effort to reform health insurance to protect the old and the sick, as well as the fair deal scheme.  There are many other examples.  For too long party politics were often put ahead of patient safety.I know of no Minister for Finance in any democratic jurisdiction who takes the advice of the outlier; instead, they take the advice of the consensus.  The reality is that the consensus advice from all institutions and economic commentators was that the country would grow by between 4% and 5% annually.  Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil all based their 2007 election manifestos on that consensus advice and not on the outlier advice to which I refer.  That fact must be accepted.The challenge for us in the coming years will be to ensure, as is currently the case, that the flow of news from Ireland is positive.  We have a good reputation internationally that was hard won.  Ireland is seen as a country seeking to return its economy to growth.  It is from such growth that employment stems.  Ireland is also seen as a country that is stabilising its public finances, making its banks fit for purpose and reforming its public services and placing them on a sustainable footing.  The last thing the Government needs is to be deflected from that task.  Whoever is in government must place that task to the fore in the coming years.I am confident that Ireland has the positive, "can do" attitude necessary to achieve that which I describe.  We work well with others, we trade well on the international stage and we attract good investment.  We have done it before and we can do it again.  There are now almost 1 million more people at work than in the 1980s when we last experienced a serious economic recession.  We should not be afraid to place in perspective the positives in our economy as the negatives are continually highlighted in this House.

Needless to say, this debate comes at a difficult time for my party.  However, the Government should not make the mistake of thinking that Fine Gael is weakened or that its resolve is diminished.  We remain united in our determination to remove this broken and discredited Government and to replace it with a new one led by Fine Gael.The reports produced by Regling and Watson and Professor Honohan confirm our worst suspicions about the Government's involvement in creation of the economic crisis.  They also confirm that the crisis was home-made and that the worst of it could have been avoided if the Government had introduced different policies when it had the opportunity to do so.Since the economy went into recession two years ago, those on the Government benches have informed us that the collapse of Lehman Brothers was to blame for the current crisis and that an economic or financial storm created on Wall Street crossed the Atlantic and affected Ireland's economy.  We now know that this is untrue.  As the reports indicate, the crisis was home-made and could have been avoided if the Government had pursued different policies.The reports blame the banks, the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator — those Government institutions which barked but which did not bite — and the Government.  They blame the Government for its policy to reduce tax at a time when it should not have done so and certainly not to the extent to which it did.  They also blame the Government for increasing spending when it should have applied the brakes.  Furthermore, they blame the Government for allowing the banks to run amok by permitting inappropriate regulation and appointing the wrong people to regulatory roles.There has been some debate regarding ideology in recent times.  This is an interesting debate and it was touched upon in last night's television documentary on the Progressive Democrats.  People love to talk about Christian Democrats, Social Democrats, new liberalism, and so on, as if possessing an ideology or being idealistic is a bad thing.  Having an ideology and being possessed of some level of idealism — regardless of whether one is on the right or the left or one pursues a different philosophy — is good.The problem with the Government during the ten-year period of the boom was that it had no ideology or principles.  During the period to which I refer, the Government acted like a left-wing administration by increasing spending and throwing more and more money and resources at problems as if that were the only possible solution.  At the same time, it acted like a right-wing administration by cutting taxes, thereby undermining the tax base, and failing to put in place the crucial regulatory structures that were required.  The Government's major failing was that it believed in nothing and had no ideology.We would be in a much better position if a Government such as the rainbow coalition, which combined different senses of idealism and ideology and which tried to do what was right, not what was popular, had been in power.  The only matter of interest to those opposite is re-election.  They have been very good at doing this but consider the consequences of their actions for the country.  On every occasion, those opposite sought to buy the people's votes with the people's money.  In that context, one need only consider the extent to which public spending increased in the two years leading up to the general elections of 2002 and 2007.  If one put this information on a graph, one would be presented with a picture of twin peaks.  In the two years prior to elections to which I refer, the Government ramped up spending, cut taxes and bought the people's vote with their own money.  I am sure those in government will try this approach again.  They will introduce tough budgets and then try to throw in a pleasant one in its final year in office in the hope that people will fall for its brand of politics for a third time.  I sincerely hope that this will not prove to be the case.Speakers referred to my party's general election manifesto from 2007.  I accept that some of the criticism relating to said manifesto may be legitimate.  However, one thing is absolutely certain: nothing in my party's manifesto was responsible for causing this crisis.  As the reports of Regling and Watson and Professor Honohan show, the crisis was caused by decisions made by the Members opposite.  Those reports make no findings against the parties in opposition.It is crucial that there should be proper accountability.  In the banking sector, almost all of the chief executives and the chairmen and members of the boards have gone.  Messrs. Fingleton, Fitzpatrick and Sheehy are gone and good riddance to them.  On the regulatory side, the former Governor of the Central Bank and the former chief executive of the Financial Regulator have also gone.  The only people who remain in place and who have not accepted responsibility or been held accountable for what they have done are the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, and his Cabinet Ministers.  The position in that regard must change.It is not that I do not believe the Taoiseach to be a decent man.  I regard him as such.  Neither is it because I believe him to be corrupt; he is not.  However, the Taoiseach is responsible, in substantial part, for the current crisis and he is the only person who has not accepted responsibility and moved aside in the way that all others who were found to be responsible have done.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	218	What is the test of whether a Government should remain in office?  The answer to this question relates to the nature of the quality of life of citizens.  I am acutely aware of the appalling challenges faced by the ordinary people, with whom I am in contact on a daily basis, in my constituency, Laois-Offaly.  The economic collapse has affected those who live in the commuter belt, the small villages, the large towns and the countryside of Laois-Offaly on many fronts.  Every one of the areas to which I refer has been affected by the economic collapse and has suffered the negative side effects of the Celtic tiger boom.In the so-called good times, the population of Laois-Offaly expanded considerably and anyone hoping to buy a house in the locality was forced to pay an enormous price and be saddled with an onerous mortgage they would pay off for between 30 or 40 years.  This was thanks to the inept economic policies of the Government, which continued to throw petrol on the flames when the property market was spinning out of control and crucifying ordinary working families.  Many of the buyers of these grossly overpriced homes discovered they could not obtain school places for their children.  It was as if such places were a unique prize rather than an automatic right.  Those who did find a place for their child, often discovered that the classroom was a shabby prefab located on what used to be the playground.  The former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe will be aware of the schools in my constituency in which 80% of students are housed and taught in prefabs.Promises were made repeatedly by successive Fianna Fail-led Governments that new schools would be built or significant extensions would be granted throughout my constituency.  In most cases, however, those promises turned out to be nothing more than election gimmicks.  The town of Portlaoise was promised a new Garda station prior to the 2007 general election.  To date, that promise has not been honoured.  In rural areas, smaller Garda stations are in a vulnerable position.  People are constantly concerned about a lack of police presence in such areas.  That lack of a police presence obtains despite a rise in the number of burglaries and a real problem with anti-social behaviour and credit crunch crime.My constituency bears the physical scars of poor planning, evidenced by the existence of several ghost estates.  There was no difficulty building houses during the past decade but it was apparently impossible to build schools or to deliver infrastructure at hospitals.  The Minister for Health and Children referred to the hospital near the Taoiseach's home but did not mention Portlaoise Hospital, which was promised a maternity unit to cater for the dramatically increased demands on an overstretched under-resourced service.  To date, nothing has happened in this regard.In recent months, Laois-Offaly has been hit by factory closures and numerous small businesses are going to the wall.  The level of job losses has surged.  There are now 16,653 people on the live register in Laois-Offaly.  Our children face a bleak future in terms of unemployment and emigration.  I represent in the main a rural constituency.  According to a recent Teagasc survey, farm incomes have plummeted to a ten year low.  Almost 80% of farm families are now reliant on some form of non-farming income, including other employment, pensions or social welfare payments.How can we have confidence in this Government? Its legacy in Laois-Offaly is reflected in ghost housing estates, negative equity, over-stuffed school prefabs, absence of school places, diminished local hospitals and a long list of broken promises.  It is clear to me that this House cannot have confidence in the current failed regime.  I believe the test for this Government will be to hold the three by-elections, following which, having accepted that mandate, it should go to the country and have a general election.

I welcome the opportunity cúpla focail a labhairt ar an ábhar tabhachtach seo.The Opposition's main thesis appears to be that the increases in public expenditure during what became known as the Celtic tiger years were unnecessary and wasteful.  I believe this to be a remarkable argument coming from an Opposition, the biggest criticism of which at the time of that expenditure was that we were not spending enough.  If I heard once I heard a hundred times the phrase, "The country is awash with money, why is the Government not spending more?"

The Labour Party described his spending as hopelessly inadequate and totally insufficient.  There is a great deal of revisionist rhetoric going on today.  The reality is that the Opposition was not then asking us to spend less money but was screaming at us to continue to spend more.  At no stage did it seek increases in taxes to fund extra expenditure.  The Labour Party was the first to promote income tax cuts in its manifesto prior to the last general election.  Deputy Varadkar has admitted Fine Gael also made mistakes in its manifesto prior to the last election.

However, it shows that the Opposition parties accepted the same independent advice and forecasts that informed us as it was the best international and national advice at the time.  The Government acted on that advice.  I accept that mistakes were made but it is wrong for the Opposition to say nothing was gained and that people did not benefit from the expenditure made.  I say that having spent almost four years as Minister for Education and Science.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	228	When it came to spending on school buildings, expenditure increased from €600 million to €700 million to €800 million.  The situation has been transformed all over the country.  There is not one child, parent or teacher in any school who will say that because of the manner in which expenditure overran, their school should not have been built.  Every one of those projects were valuable.  I accept this work was necessary owing to under-investment in this area for a number of years.  However, the fruits of that investment are now to be seen throughout the country.  Only last week I opened a new autism unit.  There are now 395 such units in the country where only six years ago there was none.The same is true for children with special needs.  For the first time every school has access to resource teachers to assist those children.  Previously, this was not the case.  That is not a waste of expenditure but the targeting of good money to people who needed their potential recognised and to be supported.  From an economic perspective, expenditure on our higher education system during the past number of years — again I say this having spent four years in that portfolio — and the creation of extra places and improvements in infrastructure have ensured we have an economic resource that will attract and create jobs when the global upturn comes, as inevitably it will.We can show that in terms of education, the arts, tourism and sport facilities we are substantially better off than we were in 2002.  Some €730 million has been spent on sports facilities.  We all value and appreciate how important sports can be to our communities.  Deputy Flanagan spoke about quality of life.  Our education and sports facilities are part of our quality of life.  We have made that investment.  The same is true of our arts in terms of the number of new theatres and art centres there are now around the country.  There has been much investment in our cultural institutions and we are currently investing in the tourism industry.This Government has made mistakes.  We acknowledge that and apologise for any wrong that may have been done.

Exports are up, our public finances are stabilising and retail and manufacturing sectors have improved.  All of the indicators are good.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	235	I welcome the opportunity to support the Government's motion of confidence in the Taoiseach.The Taoiseach has, during the past two years, led a united Government, supported by the majority of Members in this House in implementing courageous policies that have won praise at home and abroad and have set Ireland on the road to economic recovery.  Our resolute action and determination to act as one in the common good have offered this country solid government at a time when solidarity and stability were needed more than ever.  The measures we are implementing include repair of the banking system, restoring order to the public finances, regaining our competitiveness and creating jobs.  Although many of these measures have been unpopular, they have been effective.  The economic fightback is on.  Because of the steps we have taken our country, led by the Taoiseach, is emerging from recession.While this may be the age of austerity, it also can be the age of endeavour.  The decision last week by the trade unions, SIPTU and IMPACT, to back the Croke Park agreement means we now have an opportunity to underpin industrial stability and to build economic prosperity.  By framing the agreement and urging that it be ratified, the Taoiseach has shown leadership and foresight in the effort to modernise the delivery of our public services.  The Labour Party's move to characteristically fence-sit on this important deal and to then welcome the unions' decision to back it shows that party would rather be all things to all people than make decisive calls when needed.Fine Gael, on the other hand, has moved from a position in which it rejected the public sector wage reductions and efficiency measures to help close the deficit and boost our competitiveness to one in which it urged trade union members to accept the deal.  As a Government, our focus is on securing recovery and reclaiming our prosperity.  The Government and its supporters have stepped up to the plate and have worked hard and long to get Ireland through this crisis.  We can look back to this recession and can say hand on heart as time goes by that we answered these questions with great pride and absolute conviction.Today, the Government is debating this motion which has arisen following machinations within Fine Gael.  We will later get on with running the country.  If this debate is to be of any service to the country, the Labour Party will it is hoped use it as an opportunity to tell us its policies.  Day after day, week after week, Deputies Gilmore, Burton and others denounce everything.  Does anybody know for what they stand?  To paraphrase Winston Churchill's comment on Communist Russia — a nation Deputy Gilmore and his old friends in the Workers Party admired so much — the Labour Party's policies are a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.  It is easy for the Labour Party to attack Government policy without providing a credible alternative.  This debate offers it the opportunity to put up or shut up.  If it has solutions then let us hear them.  The Government has moved with acknowledged speed to address the fiscal challenge, a way now being followed by many others across Europe.  The decisive corrective measures we have implemented for our economy and banking system means we are now well positioned to grow once more.  We have weathered the recession.  Now, it is time for recovery.Ireland's recovery is due, in no small measure, to the stability of the Government and the leadership of the Taoiseach.  His vision for Ireland is based on integrity and fairness, the primacy of principled politics and the ideals of the founders of the Republic.  The Government he heads shoulders its responsibility with courage.  We take pride in our efforts to bring about a future steeped in social justice and forged in the promise of enterprise.  Unlike the party opposite, the stability of the Government will endure because we put the country's interests first and not our own narrow political self-interest.On both sides of the House, we must take a road of post-partisanship.  The country is recovering and that effort is being led steadfastly by the Taoiseach.  The Government will hold firm to its decisions and will see Ireland through recession and back to growth.  We will do that with common cause and in the common good.

The Government got its mandate from this House and it is to the House that it is answerable.  Some regard the tabling of a confidence motion as politics as usual, to borrow the Taoiseach's phrase.  That is to misunderstand the role of Parliament and its Members.  We are the people's representatives.  We must be the people's voice.  The people have spoken, not in an opinion poll published last week but on every street corner and in every workplace, dole queue, shop, factory and home throughout the land.  The people have no confidence in the Government and they want rid of it.  Despite the bravado performance of the Minister, Fianna Fáil, the Green Party and the Independents, Deputies know the people want rid of them.  I do not need to make the case to indict the Government.  In the minds of the people, the case has already been made and the decision arrived at.It is, however, galling to listen to the rewriting of history by the Taoiseach.  He insults the people's intelligence.  His Government's case would be better served if genuine remorse for the lives so grievously wounded by his policies had been expressed.  I refer to the quarter of a million men and women added to the list of the unemployed since the last election, the thousands of young people in negative equity, who will spend the rest of their working lives, if they are in work, paying for overpriced houses and the thousands of Irish men and women who will follow these debates from Australia, Canada or England, a plague we thought we had overcome.The Taoiseach, tellingly, said that when it came to including subordinated debt holders in the bailout, anything short of a comprehensive simple-to-understand concept might cause confusion when the markets opened.  Unfortunately, the markets required no such simple-to-understand bailout for burdened mortgage holders saddled with disastrous debt.We need a change.  We need a new Government with new policies.  We will lay them out for the Minister if he wants to read them.  My party leader laid out some of them.  Our plan for a new strategic investment bank was comprehensively laid out.  A  jobs fund was comprehensively explained.  A package for training, upskilling and job placement was published 18 months ago.  We plan a new approach to health care involving universal health insurance, abandonment of the disastrous privatisation co-location policy and reform of the monster that is the HSE.  We have presented a programme for public life and the public service, and so much more.Confidence never comes from knowing all the answers.  It comes from being open to all the questions.  The Government is closed to all views but its own.  It has led us to ruin and no one outside the Government's ranks believes it has the capacity to lead the country to a better place.  The destroyers cannot suddenly become the rescuers.  A Government mandate is not frozen in time, as the Taoiseach seems to think.  On the historic day when the long-awaited Saville report is published, the responsibility of the House and of each of its Members to hold decision makers accountable is clear and inescapable.  If we claim to represent all the people, our duty is to vote no confidence.Sometimes the national interest is so clear that no other interest —  personal, party or any other — is relevant.  This is one such time.  The members of the Government know they have lost the confidence of the people.  It is our duty to reflect the people's will.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	242	Ministers have made mistakes since the State was founded.  They have taken decisions that have hurt ordinary people ever since Earnán de Blaghd cut the old age pension by a half crown.  However, nothing has ever been visited on our people on the scale of the devastation inflicted on them by the legacy of the Fianna Fáil-led Governments of the noughties.The Government inherited an economy in 1997 that was growing employment at a rate of 55,000 per annum, being managed to live within its means and producing consistent improvements in social provision.  Fianna Fáil has brought it all crashing down.  They have given us the highest jobless figures in Europe, a reduction in living standards for most of our people, including those dependent on social benefits, and educated young people waiting for emigration opportunities to get out of the country.  Worst of all, they have deprived the people of hope.  The Taoiseach has lost his confidence and his style of leadership is spreading pessimism like contagion.There has been only one Government in this country during all of the years when our problems accumulated.  At any point, that was a Fianna Fáil-led Government.  The Opposition is not responsible for the disaster that has befallen us.  Nor are our people responsible for the worst recession in living memory, even if the new mantra is that we all lost the run of ourselves.  We did not all lose the run of ourselves but it is clear that the revellers in the Galway tent lost the run of themselves, and now ordinary people must pay for their excesses.  When the crash came, the message that flashed on Fianna Fáil BlackBerrys was, "Blame the global crisis and keep mentioning Lehman Brothers".  The independent reports on the collapse of the banks have put an end to that mantra.  The Lehman brothers did not cause our crash.  The main agent of our economic downfall was the grossly irresponsible mismanagement of our economy by Fianna Fáil.Now we have a new mantra, best expressed by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey.  He said Deputy Brian Cowen may have led us into the crash but he is also leading us out of it.  Disaffected backbenchers express it slightly differently.  They say, "Look how Brian Lenihan is getting the public finances under control".  It never seems to occur to Fianna Fáil spokespersons when they praise Deputy Brian Lenihan for the skill with which he is driving the fire brigade through the crowded streets of this country, that he is heading to put out a fire that was started and fuelled by Deputy Brian Cowen.  We are supposed to marvel at the driving skills of Deputy Brian Lenihan.The major parties in this House, unprecedentedly, supported the Minister for Finance in taking €4 billion out of public spending in the last budget, even if we differed as to how it should be done.  There is no escaping the fact that Fianna Fáil-led Governments have brought us to the edge of ruin.    They did it because of cronyism, because of their addiction to the insider nod and wink culture, because of their unhealthily close links to builders and developers and because of laziness.  I take no pleasure in saying that the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, did not use his undoubted talents to monitor, supervise, interrogate, question, intervene and direct.  He surfed on the tide of property taxes and unthinkingly thought it would go on forever.  There is no point in trying to rewrite the banking reports — they could scarcely be more critical of the irresponsibility and inaction of the Government.  The failure of the regulatory system was total and seemed to have official acquiescence.Before I conclude, I would like to recall the time when the late Séamus Brennan was sent out, three days before his party's Ard-Fheis, to tell the public that Fianna Fáil did not intend to engage in auction politics.  Three days later, the then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, made a speech to the Ard-Fheis that left the assembled masses dumbfounded.  I would like to quote from a book, "Showtime", by the political correspondent, Mr. Pat Leahy.

Such an approach is not the path to recovery and does not represent a credible way of restoring employment.

We have shown that we are prepared to take unpopular decisions that will shape a positive future for people and their children, regardless of the impact on our poll ratings and our popularity.

I do not particularly like the phrase "difficult decision", although I am probably as guilty as anybody else of using it, because it makes it seem that the decision-maker is doing the suffering.  We are under no illusion that the harsh but necessary decisions we are taking are affecting the Irish people, who are leading Ireland to recovery, one by one.  The Government took the most important steps towards recovery last year, amid the most difficult political environment.  The Lisbon treaty was passed, public sector finances were addressed and NAMA was established.  More needs to be done quickly.  Credit to business most flow more freely.  Those guilty of corruption in the banking system must continue to be brought to justice.  More must be done to make political structures protect and serve citizens more effectively and efficiently.  The Opposition's approach is in sharp contrast to those aims.  Fine Gael has at least produced some policies, even if they are uncosted and unworkable.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	293	I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate and to affirm my full confidence in the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen.  I have worked closely with him in my various capacities as a Deputy, as a Minister of State and, more recently, as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  He has been a supportive colleague at all times, particularly since he became Taoiseach.  He has shown excellent leadership in that role.  The Government and the Taoiseach fully understand the importance of the Irish agri food sector and appreciate the potential of the sector in terms of economic recovery, job retention and, importantly, job creation throughout the country.  It is important that there is a regional spread in job creation that benefits all provinces.This country is extremely fortunate to have tremendous farm resources at its disposal.  Our challenge is to ensure we maximise the use of those resources and fully harness and secure the potential of the farming sector.  The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food's 2020 strategy, on which an enormous amount of work has been done, will be central to that.  The strategy will chart the course for the sector over the next decade.  My Government colleagues and I look forward eagerly to considering the outcome of that process.  We are acutely conscious of the potential of the sector.  The Taoiseach said recently that he hopes the strategy will include ambitious targets for growth in these sectors and will secure sustainable employment over the next decade.The agri food sector will make a significant contribution to export-led growth.  Despite the unprecedented pressures on the public finances, the Taoiseach has supported the maintenance of vital investment in agricultural schemes.  We all acknowledge the importance of these schemes in terms of both on-farm investment and contribution to farm incomes, particularly in providing some stability to farm households.The Government's consciousness of the potential of agriculture and the agri food sector, not only in an Irish context but also in Europe, was demonstrated earlier this year when the Taoiseach played a leading role in ensuring that the EU Heads of Government recognised that a sustainable, productive and competitive agricultural sector would make an important contribution to the new Europe 2020 strategy for the development of Europe's economy.  Through the intervention of the Taoiseach, the EU Heads of Government have underlined the importance of the Common Agricultural Policy to the future of Europe.Although concrete proposals for the new CAP will not be put on the table by the Commission until the middle of next year, I have been fully engaged with my counterparts in other member states and the European Commission in putting forward Ireland's view at every opportunity in this important phase of negotiations.  I am strongly of the view that the future CAP must support farm incomes and address the issue of price and income volatility while avoiding market distortions.  Promoting sustainability in all its dimensions and rewarding farmers for the public goods they provide are essential for the future of the industry.  In this way we can ensure the sector contributes to green growth as envisaged in the Europe 2020 strategy.  These negotiations are vital to the future of Irish agriculture and the agri food sector.The Government's position is clear: we must maintain a strong and properly financed agricultural policy in Europe, and we must make sure the CAP of the future encourages competitiveness and innovation through appropriate measures, including support for farm investment.  I intend to take every opportunity to ensure that Ireland's position is both voiced and heard when there is any consideration of CAP post-2013 at the European Council.  Irish farmers and those operating in the agri food sector can be assured of the absolute support of the Taoiseach for Ireland's stated commitment to a strong and adequately resourced CAP after 2013, which will preserve the principles of solidarity, support for primary production, food security, quality and safety and the protection of farm families.Although there are those opposite who would try to misrepresent the Government's support for the agri food sector, the facts do not bear out this contention.  The Government has invested and is continuing to invest in this productive sector and is determined to ensure the sector is robust, resilient and competitive in years to come.  Given global population growth, increased urbanisation and changing dietary habits, there are enormous opportunities for Irish agriculture and the agri food sector in the coming years and decades.  With those opportunities come challenges, and the Government's commitment is to stand with this most important indigenous sector to meet those challenges and fully exploit the undoubted opportunities that exist.  The sector can be assured of my full support as Minister, as well as that of the Taoiseach and the Government.

Over the two years of the crisis, the Government would have had us believe that Ireland was somehow a victim of circumstances outside its control — that the collapse of Lehman Brothers resulted in a series of events that caused our otherwise healthy economy to implode, and that somehow the Government was a blameless victim of circumstances.  The public, however, are not fools, and the realisation dawned that despite the spin, this was not altogether true.  They realised there had been reckless management of the economy, both on the fiscal front and as far as oversight of monetary policy was concerned.  Now, however, we know for sure, because the Government's own experts have confirmed its reckless behaviour.  Its cover has been blown.The Government's own two banking reports clearly show that the financial crisis was largely a common or garden, vanilla-flavoured, home-grown problem, and that our banks and national financial system were so inappropriately overheated that they would have collapsed anyway, even if the collapse of Lehman Brothers had never occurred.  I do not deny that the banks are to blame.  In addition, there was a lack of regulation, and the Financial Regulator must also bear much of the responsibility.  However, the Government's mismanagement of the economy is clearly demonstrated in these shocking reports.  It is to blame for what it did and for what it failed to do.The Taoiseach has graciously accepted that he made some mistakes, but what he has not actually grasped is that these were monumental mistakes which have had catastrophic consequences for hundreds of thousands of people — consequences which will continue for a generation.  Young people who have got into negative equity will carry this debt through their entire productive working lives.  They and their families will pay for the mistakes for which the Taoiseach today said he took full responsibility.  He cannot seriously expect people to move on as if it were time for the next item of business.  This will not be accepted.Almost everything the Government has told us since 2007 has been disproved.  It told us the banks were secure and sound, but within days we were told we had to rescue them.  The Government then told us that NAMA was the solution, and the discount on the NAMA loans would be of the order of 28%; we now know the discount was around 58%.  It told us the impaired loans at Anglo Irish Bank had a value of about €800,000; within weeks, we were told they had a value of €22 billion.Even now, the Government is telling us the economy is at a turning point.  In fact, it has been telling us that for 12 months.  However, a total of 430,000 people are unemployed, and that number is growing.  We have the greatest asset deflation of any country.  Our pensions have disappeared and share values have dropped completely.  Businesses are closing and savings have disappeared.  Young home-owners will be carrying the ball and chain of negative equity debt for probably the next 20 years.  Only extreme arrogance could make the Government think it was right, and only extreme arrogance could allow it to think that people will believe it is right or accept its leadership.  It has quite simply used up all its credit with the public.  It now owes it to them to accept that and resign.Not only should the Taoiseach resign, but the party should also resign from Government, because its members are all tainted with this.  They cannot deny the fuelling of the property bubble and the creation of long-term spending streams from what could only be regarded as short-term taxes.  They ignored concerns about tax incentives and benchmarking, and they solved every single problem by throwing money at it.  Every vested interest was satisfied and everything was done to avoid rocking the boat.  The Government allowed export growth and competitiveness to collapse as it spent and spent.Having overspent, it now tells us — in fact, it is its mantra — that the whole world is lost in admiration of the Government's spending cuts.  Unfortunately, the markets do not believe it.  In fact, they are completely unimpressed, because almost every week the Government's spending cuts, painful as they are for people, are more than dwarfed by the debts they are incurring to further bail out the banks.  In particular, the continued provision of money to Anglo Irish Bank is throwing good money after bad.  The decision to bail out the bank was a bad one to begin with, but the Government is compounding it by continuing to do so while refusing to accept it was wrong.  It was wrong, and the people are paying and paying as a result.The time has come for the Taoiseach to show that he has some humility and shame.  He must recognise that it is time to go and let somebody else get on with the job, because he will not accept that he was wrong from day one.

They made the builders rich and made the banks pour out the money.  I compliment the people who produced the two reports published last week.  At least someone was blamed at last.  The Government and the Taoiseach of the day, Deputy Cowen.  The regulator must have been at the Galway races and must have stayed there for the past ten years because he regulated nothing in the office in this city.

Where was the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the bankers?  Now we must bail them out.  This reminds me of an incident a few years ago.  I think of the poor old woman from County Mayo who came into me.  Her son used to send her a few pounds from England.  The bank manager told her to put it in an account but she did not know where the account was.  She had £12,000 in that account when they called it an offshore account.  Her family from England had to pay almost £40,000 and it nearly killed the woman.  What did we do with the bankers?  We rewarded them and gave them bigger jobs.A colleague of mine is a builder and told me he used to send his staff all over the country on holidays, trips and golfing outings.  He did not have enough staff to distribute all the benefits the banks were giving him as long as he was borrowing money to build more and more houses.  This country is in a terrible state and we need a new Government and new ideas.  We need fairness.I have always had time for the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Ó Cúiv.  I hope he will not be introducing the budget in December.  If the Minister does not protect the poor, the weak and the sick, he will let down his people who the generation before them stood for and the Republic.  What he will be defending is the bankers and the builders and they should all be in prison, rather than a poor person who cannot pay a television licence or the person who might get into a row at night.  The bankers and the builders should be in prison and if they are not the people will be outside the Dáil.

Ar ndóigh, tá an t-ádh linn gur ceannaire láidir stuama is ea an Taoiseach, an Teachta Cowen, agus an tír ag tabhairt aghaidh ar na dúshláin suntasacha atá romhainn faoi láthair.  Nuair a chas na cúinsí eacnamúla, sheas an Taoiseach an fód.  Tá sé ag tabhairt ceannasaíocht láidir don tír, agus é ag dul i ngleic leis an méid a tharla sa gheilleagar agus sna bainc.  Tá a chroí agus a anam ina chuid oibre chun leigheas a fháil ar na dúshláin sin, níos mó fostaíochta a chruthú agus tacaíocht a thabhairt do theaghlaigh na tíre.I am pleased to speak in favour of the motion of confidence in the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, and his Government.  The energy and hard work of all parties in this House would be best focused on driving forward the solutions that will create meaningful work for people and deal with the day-to-day challenges faced by them.  That is what the Government is focused on doing.Under the leadership of Deputy Brian Cowen, this Government is taking a number of key actions to protect the most vulnerable people of all ages.  We are directing €20.9 billion towards social welfare expenditure in 2010.  We have set up a group, which is due to report soon, to examine the issues facing those in mortgage arrears and those facing personal debt.  We are also focused on assisting those who have lost jobs and creating work opportunities for them.I agree with one minor point made by Deputy Ring.  The greatest challenge facing our people is joblessness and the major challenge it visits on households around the country.  People often think of unemployment in terms of income loss but it is also about dignity, confidence, the loss of something challenging to do everyday and the loss of social contact with workmates.  One of the important decisions taken by the Taoiseach and the Government, and one of the priorities given to me, is to place a particular focus on job activation.  The new Department brings a joined-up approach to examine job activation in its widest context, with income support.  We need to create a better future for unemployed people, with work activity in the short term, to upskill them and give them opportunities to get back into the mainstream workforce as speedily as possible.  We face a number of challenges in the next two years in creating opportunities for those people to work but we will make progress by being positive, finding new ways to draw on our traditional strengths and making ourselves competitive again.The Taoiseach has given my Department the sensible aim of ensuring that when a person visits the local social welfare office, the officials dealing with work placement will in time be working side-by-side with those dealing with payments.  The new Department will provide a one-stop shop for people who face the prospect of unemployment.  This will give people a better service.  In the wider context, the reorganisation announced by the Taoiseach focuses on the main challenges we face.  We speak about an innovation economy but for that we must have the best system of giving people new skills so they can avail of changed opportunities.  In the reorganisation we will be able to tackle the issues of work and support for people and communities and upskilling, training and education.Deputy Ring referred to the banks and the financial sector.  The reason we are straightening out the banks is not to make life easy for those in the banking sector, who got us into a mess, but to set a solid foundation on which we can support enterprise and create new jobs.  It is also about protecting people's investment, either made directly or indirectly through life assurance or pension policies, etc.

Since his election as Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen has shown the backbone, conviction and courage that are the hallmarks of strong leadership in times of difficulty.  For the past 18 months, the Taoiseach has led the Government that has taken tough and painful decisions in order to secure the future economic well-being of our country.  In a time of great financial upheaval, when to falter would have been to fail and when to waver would have had dire consequences for Ireland, he stood his ground and the Government stood its ground.  We made hard and necessary choices and when others questioned their judgment or lost their nerve, we stood by our decisions.  As we take our first steps on the road to economic recovery, we can be thankful the Government showed such resolve, that we held our nerve and that we made those difficult decisions in such difficult circumstances and at the right time.

Playing to the gallery would not secure the future of our country.For example, he stood firm and delivered on the Croke Park agreement.  While some stayed silent, for political reasons, he took a stand that will deliver the basis for stability and progress for public servants and citizens alike.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	323	As a former Chief Whip, and now as Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs, I have worked closely with Deputy Brian Cowan since his election as Taoiseach.  Without any hesitation, I can say he has always acted in the very best interests of the people of Ireland.  In a time of great uncertainty he has kept his nerve and has shown himself to be a leader of character and compassion, dedicated to securing the future of his country, irrespective of any short-term political consequences.The commitment shown by the Government has now been recognised, as international and domestic commentators have acknowledged there are signs of a return to growth.  Of course, the composure and conviction shown by the Government would have been to little avail were it not for the backbone shown by the Irish people throughout these challenging times.  I believe future generations will look back with a sense of gratitude for that fortitude shown by this generation.Meanwhile, the sound judgments shown by this Government have ensured that, step by step, we are leading Ireland back to a position of sustainable economic growth.  Today, we heard much political posturing and cheap rhetoric from the Opposition benches.  We have heard little or nothing by way of constructive criticism or credible alternative policies.  While it might be too much to expect our critics to acknowledge the real work this Government has done in facing down a series of international challenges, we will not be swayed from the path we have taken.  It is the correct one and is the path to recovery.  As we continue on this difficult path to recovery we will not be distracted by selective readings of history or dishonest attempts to misrepresent the regret we have expressed in regard to mistakes we made.  As Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs, I utterly reject the notion that communities across Ireland did not benefit from the investment made in recent times.Mar fhocal scoir, ceannaire cróga agus stuama is ea An Teachta Brian Cowen.

It has not heard it because it has not listened.  It has not listened to anybody.  A great number of constructive proposals were put forward by this side of the House but they fell on deaf ears and the country has suffered as a result.In the past week I heard a number of Ministers repeat something that has become a mantra for members of the present coalition.  They stated that since the Government and the Taoiseach decided to put the country first and take the hard decisions, they knew they would suffer at the polls and therefore they were expecting their present poor ratings.  I have one simple question for the Taoiseach and his Ministers.  When did they decide to start putting the country first?  In this explanation for its poor showing in the polls, the Government has unwittingly identified the cause of many of our problems, namely, the failure of the Taoiseach and his Government to always put the country first.There were many examples of this during the past number of years.  The most recent examples were evident in the banking reports published last week.  Blaming the present poor showing of Fianna Fáil in opinion polls for its recent decisions is incorrect.  The disdain in which Fianna Fáil is held is a direct result of its failure over many years to put the country first.  In regard to these reports, the Taoiseach stated he accepts full responsibility for his actions while he was Minister for Finance.  What exactly does this mean?  In any other arena such a statement would be followed immediately by a resignation.  Surely that is the logical outcome of accepting full responsibility for the economic disaster he has caused to this country.The trickery engaged in by the Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil has never been exposed so ruthlessly as it has been since this economic crisis began.  The Fianna Fáil modus operandi was always bad for this country; now it has become almost ruinous.  We cannot have any more of it and that is why this Taoiseach and his Government must be removed from office.  This country will never reach its full potential while the nod and wink standards that apply in the present-day Fianna Fáil party also apply to the governing of the country.  There has been a serious lack of leadership in many aspects of Irish life in recent times, whether in the business, political or religious spheres.  It is now time for a new leadership to assert itself and an example can be set from this House.The Taoiseach is known as a man who values loyalty above all else.  He seems to fail to realise that life is full of competing loyalties and whenever the Taoiseach's loyalty to Fianna Fáil competes with any other loyalty it has always been the loyalty to Fianna Fáil that wins out.  This has had devastating consequences for this country and has led to the betrayal of a generation for whom forced emigration has become a reality.There are things that are more important than Fianna Fáil and the Taoiseach, or indeed, Fine Gael, the Labour Party or any political party.  One such is Ireland.  Ireland and its people have been badly let down by this Government and its immediate predecessors.   Fianna Fáil and the Green Party have seats at the Cabinet table but Ireland does not have a seat at that table.  Every decision taken is in the interests of the parties at the table, even when those decisions are against the national interest.  The national interest is not represented by this Government.It is clear the economic cycle was bent by the Taoiseach and his predecessor to suit the political cycle.  It is time this Taoiseach and this Government left.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	326	I thank the Acting Chairman and my colleague, Deputy Timmins, for allowing me some time.  I have no confidence in our present Taoiseach, his party or his Green Party colleagues.  Having listened to the Green Party personnel some minutes ago,  it is clear to me they are much more committed to wildlife, bogs and dogs than to the 440,000 people who have no jobs.From the first day I met him, then Minister for Health, the Taoiseach has proved himself to be incompetent in whatever job he held.  He failed to do anything about the health service and when he left it all he could do was refer to it as Angola.  In this context he was supposed to deliver €5 million to Monaghan General Hospital but all he did was promise €500,000 while, at the same time, he was giving all sorts of money to hospitals in his own constituency.The fact that he still allows an Independent Deputy, Mary Harney, to hold such an important ministry raises further questions regarding his ability.  When there was plenty of money available she encouraged young people to train in specific services such as physiotherapy but when they finished their course no jobs were available as she had not planned how to use them even though such jobs were badly needed.  Now, the first services to be removed are those for the elderly and the disabled.  Only yesterday I received a telephone call to say that day care services were being curtailed at St. Mary's Hospital, Castleblayney.The Taoiseach built all his structures on the building boom and this has now left the situation in a total mess.  Today, 39 families in Ballyjamesduff, County Cavan, are left with a sewerage system switched off because their builder did not pay the ESB for the power to run the necessary sewerage pumps.  Would the Taoiseach or any of his Ministers like to live on that housing estate in weather conditions such as today's?Last week two important banking reports were published, instigated by the Government.  These state clearly that the present banking system conditions were very much Government related rather than created by the international community.  The reports specifically advised that decisions made by the then Minister for Finance, now the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, had serious implications for the entire economic downfall of our country.  There was the then Minister's failure to control the building boom, his failure to control the regulator and, above all, his failure to deal with the banking outrage.  How could the Taoiseach sit down with the board of Anglo Irish Bank a short time before it had to be bailed out and not know there was something seriously wrong?  The Taoiseach and his Government have left a legacy for the next generation which it will never forget.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	327	The leader of the Government has presided over the greatest abuse of the elderly, the sick, the vulnerable, the young and the unemployed in the history of this State, both as Minister for Finance and Taoiseach.  We did not need these reports to tell us what we already knew, namely, that the Government was guilty of the most outrageous cronyism, mismanagement and attempted cover-up that this country has ever seen.  Nevertheless, the rubber stamp was important to give validity to what was common knowledge.  It is, and always has been, a sick joke that the man who was primarily responsible for the mistakes of his Government should be voted captain of the ship, which is attempting to find its way out of the financial storm.The banking reports label the current fiasco as a homemade crisis.  While this is primarily meant to close the escape hatch for the Taoiseach to blame Lehman Brothers and international factors for the fall-out, it also gives a feel of the contempt the authors of the report seem to have for the judgment of the Taoiseach.When I see the impact the Taoiseach's actions have had in my constituency of Longford-Westmeath, I  see it as a testament to the forbearance of the Irish people that he is here today to fight this confidence motion.  The queues at my clinics are crowded with decent hard-working people, whose lives and livelihoods have been destroyed by the actions of the Taoiseach.  I feel incredible anger that he has the nerve even to attempt to justify his actions.  Has he even the smallest idea of what it is like for people to lose their employment, their homes, their children's chance of going to college, their health and all for no reason other than that they worked hard and trusted the Government?  Does he feel the weight of their suffering on his shoulders and the scales of justice tilting towards retribution?  How can he sleep at night, knowing the havoc that his policy of government for the few at the expense of the many has brought to hard-working families, who never saw any of the benefits of the Celtic tiger, but nonetheless were content with their lot and who had their lives set up?As usual, the Taoiseach waffled here this afternoon, blaming the usual suspects on the international scene for our woes.  He said he did not want history re-written.  Every time he opens his mouth, this is exactly what he does.  If he had any decency, he would have resigned months ago and not put the House through a time-wasting exercise this evening.  Knowing that he will win by strength of numbers unless some of his backbenchers or independents decide that enough is enough makes any vote of confidence a complete farce.  In any other country, he would be facing retribution for his actions.

Is ceannaire láidir, cumasach é don tír ag an am práinneach trioblóideach seo.  Ní chreidim go bhfuil ceannaire d'aon pháirtí sa Teach seo, seachas é féin, in ann tabhairt faoi na fadhbanna eacnamaíochta atá á shárú aige.  Tá sé dochreidte go bhfuil na daoine a dúirt go raibh dóthain á chaitheamh aige nuair a bhí sé ina Aire Airgeadais ag rá anois gur chaith sé an iomarca.It is very important to take account of the points which were made in the report by Professor Honohan and in the report by Mr. Regling and Mr. Watson, in respect of the two major issues that were under consideration in this House prior to the publication of those reports.  One of those issues related to the lead-up of the bank guarantee and theories about it.  The reports set out very clearly that it was absolutely necessary at the time to introduce the bank guarantees.  That is very important.  While an element of this debate is historical, going back over a decade or more, there is no doubt but that the concern of the vast majority of people is for the policies that are being adopted by the Government over the next three or four years while the difficulties persist.  That element, which was open to an enormous amount of criticism, has been dealt with very comprehensively in the two major reports.The other element that drew much criticism of the Taoiseach was the decision to ensure that Anglo Irish Bank did not fail.  It is very clear from any thorough reading of the reports that the failure of Anglo Irish Bank would have had the most serious ramifications for the Irish banking system.  In the context of the information currently available, it is very clear that an immediate wind-up of Anglo Irish Bank would have been disastrous for the Irish banking system and for the economy itself.  We sometimes do not spell out what the impact of that failure would have been.  It is clear that those who rightly worry about the impact of the financial cutbacks on the poorer sections of society, or indeed on many other people who had made commitments on foot of the kind of incomes that they enjoyed at that time, do not consider what the alternative would have been.  Had the bank guarantee scheme not been put in place, the inevitable economic collapse would mean that there would have been no payment for any of these people.  Unless we face up to that fact, the parties in the Government will not be able to bring forward the policies and to deliver on them in the manner in which Deputy Cowen has done as Taoiseach.It is an extraordinary achievement, for someone who is frequently depicted in the media as a man who puts party before country, for the Taoiseach to lead the Government in making what have been shown to be necessary decisions, notwithstanding the fact that they have had a negative impact on people and which he knew would have an impact on the standing of the party.  These decisions indicate clearly that the Taoiseach is a man of action, a man of great leadership qualities and a man who can claim quite fairly to have put the country before the party.There are lessons to learn and there will be a process in the Oireachtas committees and in the commission of inquiry to be set up.  An element of this process will examine historical issues and we will argue across the House whether it was better to do what the Government did or spend €40 billion more if we were to do all the things that were touted as desirable by various people on the Opposition benches.  Undoubtedly, people will be looking for the kind of leadership that the Taoiseach has produced over the last two or three years and will continue to provide for the next two years.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	329	I too am happy to stand here this evening in support of the motion of confidence in the Taoiseach.  I do so because I am happy that the reports presented to us last week by the three experts present very serious challenges to the State and to the way that we govern the State.  For once, these are challenges that will be dealt with in this House, in the Oireachtas committees and in the various institutions that will report on them.We have already learned the lessons of the light touch regulation that have led to this situation.  The appointment of Professor Patrick Honohan as Governor of the Central Bank represented the first time somebody from outside the system has come to that position.  The appointment of Mr. Matthew Elderfield as Financial Regulator is also clear evidence that we are going down a different path than that pursued before.  The policies pursued by the Government in the past two years, which have resulted in genuine hardship right across the country, have given us stability today and we can use that stability to grow this economy and to start creating employment for those out of work.That stability has entered into our relationship with the Civil Service and the public service, through the acceptance of the Croke Park agreement this evening by the public services committee of ICTU.  I look forward to working with Deputies and Senators on the implementation of that agreement and on the implementation and construction of the new public services board and implementation body.  Many of the blockages we find in our daily lives as public representatives may be unblocked and we will be able to deliver basic entitlements to people in a better and more efficient way which respects their dignity.The agreement was encouraged and fostered in very difficult circumstances by the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen.  It was put to him by many in the House that he had destroyed the relationship with the unions that had been the foundation of so much.  However, he persevered through the first half of the year to come up with an agreement that was more reflective of the economy and the times we are in that those that preceded it.  We are moving forward with confidence in implementing the agreement.The relationship to which I have referred is being changed in the context of the transformation that has happened throughout the economy since 1997.  Many would ignore the changes in infrastructure and services and the changes throughout the country that were brought about by the investment and surpluses achieved during that time.  We are in serious difficulties now and nobody will ignore that.  However, to ignore the fact that such visible physical progress was made as well as progress in other areas is also unfair and is not true of a real debate.We have had the standard Punch and Judy debate, with each side saying it is right and the other is wrong.  Let us go forward and decide, on the basis of these reports presented to us by outsiders to the political system, that those of us in the political system can, through the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service, make the various changes that must be made on the back of those reports so that there will be a new politics.  It will be a politics that is more reflective of the pressures people are going through and of what people have gone through in the past two and a half years.  It challenges all of us to change and up our game and to move away from the Punch and Judy politics we all engage in as a matter of course.  That is the message of the two reports published last week as much as they contain lessons on banking and on what went wrong in the economy.  It is a matter for all of us in both Houses to take that on board.I am happy that we will take those lessons on board, and that Deputy Brian Cowen's leadership as Taoiseach is the most stable that can be provided.  It is a leadership that is willing and encourages all of us to push through the tough decisions needed.We may have introduced stability to the economy but we must continue down the road we have taken.  The Government has shown it has the backbone to take those decisions and see them through.  We will have no difficulty in showing the electorate that when we were challenged to take those decisions we took them in the interests of the country.This debate and the debate on the other side of the House are overshadowed by what has happened today.  The House should welcome the findings of the report into Bloody Sunday.  We will have statements on it next week.  Nobody in the House could have imagined when waking up this morning that we would have read some of the statements that have come from that report or heard the statements made in the House of Commons.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	330	I join with the statement of the Minister of State on the report of the Saville inquiry.  It is interesting that the new British Prime Minister gave an extraordinarily heartfelt apology.  It was a very statesmanlike way to revisit the past policies of previous British Administrations.Coming to our debate, a week is most definitely a long time in politics.  The focus of media attention is on Fine Gael but the focus of this debate is on the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen.  The focus of next general election will also be on him and on what Fianna Fáil did in failing the country.  It is Deputy Brian Cowen who more than anyone else must survey the wreckage that now surrounds him.  His supporters hoped and expected that the international examiners, Regling and Watson, would give the beleaguered Taoiseach a get out of jail card.  Instead, they did the opposite and identified domestic policy failures by Deputy Brian Cowen as Minister for Finance as the primary cause of Ireland's current economic woes.  The terms they used to describe the property bubble were "homemade", "plain" and "vanilla".  The mumblings of the Taoiseach's loyalists in defence of their hero ring hollow because he is as much the culprit as the casualty of the circumstances that now threaten to overwhelm him.Much of the present crisis is of the Taoiseach's own making.  He can argue that he inherited much from Deputy Bertie Ahern as Taoiseach and Deputy Charlie McCreevy as Minister for Finance but he should have taken responsibility as a leader.  Instead, he took the inheritance and failed to deal with the legacy of toxic and poisonous issues that faced him when he came to his desk.  He reminds me of the Charles Dickens character from David Copperfield, Mr. Micawber, who was always certain that "something will turn up".  Something did turn up.  It was called Anglo Irish Bank but he willfully ignored it.Warning bells about Anglo Irish Bank rang time and again in the spring of 2008, with the St. Patrick's day massacre in its share value and the collapse of the share price.  In his report, the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Honohan, goes back even further to show that the warning signals were known to the authorities even earlier but former Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, postponed any remedial action and through most of 2008 continued to ignore the gathering clouds.  Surely the Northern Rock collapse in the UK in the late summer of 2007 should have been enough to force a reappraisal of policy on our own economy's excessive exposure to construction as the country's primary engine of growth and public revenue.  It was a love affair that had gone on too long and had become toxic.I want to look at two aspects that feature in the reports.  In his defence, the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, analysed the reports even when they are highly critical of him and his predecessors as Taoiseach and Minister for Finance.  The Cabinet held on to the two reports for as long as ten days before they were ready to publish them.  That tells its own tale of the shockwave that must have gone through Government Buildings when Ministers first read them.  They needed ten days, and an effective Dáil adjournment of a week, to go through both reports with a fine toothcomb just to find some tiny crumbs of comfort they could use to claim vindication of their policies for the whole of the past decade.  Crumbs of comfort were few and far between so they opted for wholesale distortion of the findings to suit their purposes, steadfastly refusing to accept any shred of responsibility for the policy errors that were the overwhelming contributing factors to our current economic and baking woes.Let me take the example of the Honohan view of the 2008 bank guarantee.  Ministers have tried to claim he endorsed the type of guarantee given on 30 September 2008 and that he had rejected the Labour Party's policy position.  He did no such thing.  He endorsed the idea of — to use his phrase — an extensive guarantee that would cover deposits and future senior bonds.  He most certainly did not endorse — and specifically says so at several points in the report — the type of blanket guarantee that was the key element of the Government decision that night.Our objection was always to the notion of a blanket guarantee.  We never had any objection to an extensive guarantee of deposits.  I wrote to the Minister for Finance and issued a statement a week or so prior to the guarantee urging that deposits would be guaranteed.  We baulked at the scale of the Government guarantee proposal and nothing in Mr. Honohan's report last week disputes the wisdom of our approach.This is what he had to say as distinct to what Ministers pretend he said:The inclusion of existing long-term bonds and some subordinated debt was not necessary in order to protect the immediate liquidity position. These investments were in effect locked in. Their inclusion complicated eventual loss allocation and resolution options.We should think even for a moment about those simple sentences.  They do not sound to me like any kind of support for the guarantee of the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, and the Taoiseach.  Quite the reverse in fact, it reads as though it is written by someone with grave doubts about the wisdom of a blanket guarantee which had two failed institutions, Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, at its core, not the high street banks we needed for ordinary deposits and business.  A statement that recognises the need to do something extensive to stabilize the banks cannot be read as tacit agreement with what was actually done, a blanket guarantee that went far beyond what was wise and prudent, and which will probably end up costing this country at least €20 billion to €35 billion more than a more limited kind of guarantee of deposits would have involved.Ministers and spin-doctors refuse, understandably, to read nuanced comments.  They deliberately confuse the words "extensive" and "blanket".  Like in Alice in Wonderland, words mean what they choose to make them mean.  The truth is that the guarantee of the existing bonds and the subordinated bonds was a critical and expensive error that will haunt taxpayers for a generation.  Fianna Fáil Ministers are understandably fond — I share much of it — of commending the National Treasury Management Agency and, in particular, its senior management, and allocates a lot of different responsibilities to it which the agency has taken on and handled in a way that is admirable.Dr. Michael Somers, who was head of the NTMA for all of the years since its inception until recently and was chief executive at the time of the guarantee recently said:As an independent observer, I was aghast at what was happening and feeling what a shame, all this effort that we had made at making the country solvent blown like that.  It's incredible and it's going to affect us for several generations.That is what the Government's favourite person in the NTMA whom the Government has quoted again and again has to say about the guarantee.I want to discuss tax breaks.  Mr. Regling and Mr. Watson ranked property breaks as one of the main ingredients of the home made triggers of the collapse.  This has been my song for so long that it was a pleasant surprise to hear it sung with so much gusto by others.  According to Mr. Regling Irish property tax incentives were three times the scale of similar breaks elsewhere in the eurozone and that by 2005 the cost of these breaks was larger than the remaining income tax receipts.  That is how big they were.The Taoiseach has tried to present a misleading picture of himself as the great reformer who abolished them.  As both reports show, the Taoiseach, who was the former Minister for Finance, extended the tax breaks.  He had headline abolition of the tax shelters, tempered by small print expansion, from 2005-08.  Both reports suggest that it was at this point that the tax breaks ended up costing the Irish taxpayer such a colossal amount.The Taoiseach was reckless and cowardly in the face of mounting evidence of tax avoidance and the excessive bank lending in one sector.  Indecon and the Department of Finance officials pointed this out in various reports.  He had the evidence before him on his desk.  He procrastinated.  He caused immense damage and in the end he caused a huge transfer of wealth from the ordinary, average working Irish person to the super rich.  Time and again in this House I exposed the issue of the millionaires who were paying no tax because of the Fianna Fáil tax breaks.  The Taoiseach stands condemned out of his own mouth by the very faulty self-defence which he tried to put forward.

I will not dwell on that; it is a matter for Fine Gael.  I will, however, dwell on the Alice in Wonderland that has been adopted by the Labour Party.  I want to illustrate this, in particular, by reference to the two extraordinary reports which were published last week.  Let us recall for a moment that when the reports were first proposed the Labour Party suggested they would be whitewashes.In his opening comments today Deputy Gilmore, with all his theatrical splendour, did better than I have seen him for a long time.  He produced a flourish that would have done justice to Laurence Olivier in his best moments.  Let us think for a moment.  Where was the Labour Party on 30 September 2008 when the real test of political leadership in this country was coming to reality?  To give credit where credit is due, when the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, at 7 a.m. on that day telephoned Deputy Enda Kenny he was assured that Fine Gael would behave in the national interest.  I want to recognise that because Fine Gael has done that before and it is right and proper to do so.What was the response from the Labour Party?  It was extraordinary by any standard.  This country faced one of the worst challenges it had ever faced.  We can debate as much as we want backwards and forwards and engage in Punch and Judy politics about what happened.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	335	It is at the time when one faces a crisis that leadership is tested.  What happened with the Labour Party?  It did what it always did, it panicked, ran away and failed to address what was of interest to the nation.  Quality of leadership is tested in those times and when the Labour Party was tested it failed.  It did not have the capacity in those days.  As I said, when the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, approached the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Kenny, he was given a positive response, and I want to acknowledge that.Let us consider what the reports actually say, as oppose to the mythological interpretation given by Deputy Burton.  For example, in the case of the reports produced by Mr. Regling and Mr. Watson and Professor Honohan, their judgment on the case of Government and the responses to the crisis are very positive, but not unquestionably so.  For example, when they appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service last week, Mr. Regling and Mr. Watson were specifically asked by the Opposition spokespersons on a number of occasions about their response to the Government's handling of the banking crisis.Mr. Regling said, "Both of us have the view that the crisis management in this country has been very good, in particular when compared to other countries in the European Union".

He continues: "Given the hysterical state of the global finances in these weeks, failure to avoid this outcome would have resulted in immediate and lasting damage to the economy and society".  He raised the issue of subordinated debt which was about 3% of the total amount in that issue.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	345	It was approximately 3%.  We should remember what some of it, in particular the senior debt, involved.  Some of it was from other banks within the institutional framework in Ireland.  Some was from treasury management activities by international companies which have invested in this country and some was from credit unions.  It was great credit to the Labour Party that it would have flushed them all down the toilet.Consider another of the Labour Party's favourite issues, Anglo Irish Bank and the question of whether it was of systemic importance.  Professor Honohan is unequivocal in stating:Anglo was clearly systemically important in the prevailing conditions at the end of September 2008 . . . There can be little doubt that a disorderly failure of Anglo would, in the absence of any other protective action, have had a devastating effect on the remainder of the Irish banks.Given the clarity of these reports, I find it incredible that Punch and Judy politics continues to be played in this Chamber.  Instead of focusing on how we can combine such wisdom as exists in this House to craft a new approach, we have the nonsense we just heard from the Deputy.  I suggest the best service she could do for this House and the nation would be to spend next weekend reading the reports before showing some of the clarity and positivity we have seen from other parties.

One of the factors which resulted in our present predicament was the property bubble but in the interest of fairness it must be pointed out that the Taoiseach, as Minister for Finance, decided to do away with property related tax incentives even though there had been no outcry for their abolition.  Furthermore, we are experiencing a worldwide crisis and many other economies, including the United States, Greece, Spain, Britain, Italy and Iceland, are also suffering at present.  The Opposition may, however, wish to blame us for the problems these economies are experiencing.We are committed to putting the economy and the country ahead of short-term partisan or party political interests.  It is more productive to concentrate our energies on resolving our current difficulties and planning for economic recovery than to spend countless hours in political navel gazing about recent events.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	351	It is now widely recognised by independent commentators that we are taking the right approach and making the tough decisions.  The Central Bank, the IMF and the ESRI are broadly in favour of the economic policies we are pursuing.  Other bodies, such as the European Commission and the OECD, forecast a return to positive growth in the near future.The fact we are meeting our budgetary targets for public expenditure and taxation illustrates that the economy is stabilising.  Manufacturing output and retail sales figures are improving and labour costs are falling.  Unemployment figures, while still high, show signs of stabilising.Perhaps Opposition Deputies, with their rose tinted glasses, would have us believe they had the foresight to predict our current difficulties but this is far from the truth.  Their 2007 election tax policies and their proposals on stamp duty for first time buyers would have added further fuel to the property bubble had the previous Government followed their inappropriate advice.  Over the past decade, few people called for increases in stamp duty.  Many more wanted it to be reduced but, thankfully, this demand was resisted by the Government.  If the structural deficit that is now apparent in our public finances was to have been avoided campaigners in recent elections should have called for increases in personal taxation, a property tax, water rates and the abolition of certain tax reliefs.Perhaps there is a need for a collective mea culpa from all the main political parties.  Focusing on past activity is a necessary part of the discourse of every democratic society but a preoccupation with past events to the detriment of addressing present difficulties is like fiddling while Rome burns.  We are attempting to stabilise the public finances and we have taken steps to protect the banking system and implement several measures to enhance our competitiveness.  The Government has published its economic blueprint, Building Ireland’s Smart Economy: A Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal.  Any fair-minded person would agree that the Taoiseach and the Government have made great strides in tackling the unprecedented crisis we face.

The Minister of State, Deputy Roche, referred to “Alice in Wonderland” and he must have been watching the movie because his reaction to the two reports under discussion was a far cry from my understanding of them.Last week the Honohan report and the Watson and Regling report set out the Taoiseach's legacy.  These reports reveal beyond doubt that, as Minister for Finance, he followed a course that led to our current disaster.  Fault for our economic collapse lies not with the international markets but with Fianna Fáil's mismanagement of the economy, inept regulators and bankers who lost the run of themselves.The new Governor of the Central Bank, Patrick Honohan, carried out an inquiry into the regulatory regime, Government policy and the actions of bank management.  He blamed macro-economic and budgetary policies for contributing to economic overheating and stated the Government relied to an unsustainable extent on the construction sector and other transient sources for revenue.  He further stated: "The Government's pro-cyclical fiscal policy stance, budgetary measures aimed at boosting the construction sector, and a relaxed approach to the growing reliance on construction-related and other insecure sources of tax revenue were significant factors contributing to the unsustainable structure of spending in the Irish economy".We all know the history.  Tax revenue was buoyant and the response was to forget about prudent economics when spending the money.  Any prudent housekeeper knows that excess funds should be invested in improvements to the house rather than blown at a party.Mr. Honohan debunked the myth that the weakness of Irish banks was caused by external factors.  He stated: "Even before the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, Irish residential property prices had been falling for more than 18 months and few observers expected their fall to end soon".  He argued that banking practice and Government policy both played a central role in creating the crisis.  As Minister for Finance during this period, the Taoiseach closed his eyes to the realities facing the country.The report by Klaus Regling and Max Watson also found that budgetary policy veered towards spending while revenues were buoyant.  In addition, the pattern of tax cuts left revenues increasingly fragile because they were dependent on taxes on the property sector.The public never had the chance to vote for Deputy Cowen as Taoiseach but they will have to live with his legacy in terms of inadequate health services and lack of investment in infrastructure.  The Chief Whip, Deputy Curran, stated on radio this morning that he expects the Government to win the vote on the motion but the real vote will be when the people have an opportunity to decide on the Taoiseach's legacy.  I know how they will vote.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	359	How can anyone have confidence in a Government which has brought the country to its knees?  That we are in the midst of the worst crisis ever to hit the country is obvious to every citizen.  For every action there is a massive reaction in every home.  The crisis is especially obvious to all those who have lost their jobs.  Employment is being lost in all areas, including the retail and restaurant sectors and small companies.  Unemployment has increased by nearly 12% in County Sligo and almost 6% in County Leitrim in the past 12 months.  The total number of unemployed in the two counties is more than 9,000.  Each one of these unemployed persons represents a personal tragedy and wasted opportunity.That we are in the midst of the worst crisis ever to hit the country is obvious from the scale of youth unemployment, a problem that diminishes us all.  Not only does youth unemployment damage individual families, it corrodes entire communities.That we are in the midst of the worst crisis ever to hit the country is obvious from the return of forced emigration.  As in the past, it seems this Fianna Fáil-led Government plans to rely on emigration to solve the unemployment problem.That we are in the midst of the worst crisis ever to hit the country is obvious from the fact that the standard of living of those lucky enough to still have a job is sinking by the day and people are struggling to meet their mortgage repayments.  Mortgage companies have massive arrears on their books because people are defaulting on their payments.  Homes are being repossessed and the impact is unbelievable.  The cost of Government services and charges are increasing, while incomes are being squeezed by income levies and tax increases.That we are in the midst of the worst crisis ever to hit the country is obvious in the slashing of public services and the closure of community based projects.  Following the closure of breast cancer services at Sligo General Hospital, it is now proposed to reduce coronary care services at the hospital.These issues and many others are the direct responsibility of the Government.  The independent banking reports state clearly that the crisis is home grown and that the Taoiseach, when Minister for Finance, pursued policies that proved catastrophic for the nation.  Throughout the developing crisis, the Government's attitude to the future problem was one of evasion.  The Taoiseach continues to adopt the evasion tactic, informing us, for example, that no one told him the ship of State was heading for the rocks.  I have news for him.  As captain of the ship, it is his job to know when it is off course.  It is a sign of incompetence to argue, as he does, that no one told him.  This is the traditional Fianna Fáil style of leadership, with the Taoiseach the actor-in-chief in an artistic environment of the performing arts, make-up and all.  His job was to be sufficiently competent to pull the brake as the ship of State headed for the rocks.  To argue that he would have done so if someone had told him is the lamest leadership excuse I have ever heard.  The country has no confidence that he is the man to lead us out of the crisis.  It is time for the Fianna Fáil-led Government to go to give the nation an opportunity to determine who can lead the country.We have had appalling losses.  Small companies have a major role to play in job creation, yet the Government has decided to provide €24 billion for a bank which is closed.  Anglo Irish Bank pretends it is open for business, but it is not taking on new customers or providing money for existing customers.  The Government should be honest enough to state the bank is closed for business.  It has done everything  bar place a "Closed for Business" sign on the door.A sum of €24 billion of taxpayers' money has been invested and there is more to come.  Despite this, the banks are not providing funding.  Loans are provided with so many caveats to preclude them from being drawn down.  If a branch states it is granting 100 loans a week, the question is: how many of them are being drawn down?  The number of caveats attached to these loans means that perhaps ten of every 100 loans granted are drawn down.  The banks are seeking double security, audited and retrospective accounts and various other figures.  They are giving ten reasons to prevent companies from obtaining funds and enable them to build their cash reserves.One must understand the catastrophic circumstances faced by employers who are finding it increasingly difficult to survive.  Businesses must meet excessive requirements to obtain tax clearance certificates.  Small companies employing fewer than ten people, the backbone of the economy, are on the rocks and are being hounded out of business.  When one considers what could be done with €1 billion in terms of job creation, it is astonishing to learn that €24 billion has been provided for a closed, zombie bank which capitalised Fianna Fáil developers.  The politically well connected did not need accounts or a tax clearance certificate to secure a loan from Anglo Irish Bank.  All they had to do was turn up to be given whatever they wanted.People are in an unforgiving mood.  When Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach had a critical role in propelling the building boom which was generating annual revenue of €8 billion.  One did not need to be an economist to know this money would not continue to be forthcoming from the construction sector.

#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	365	My ministerial colleagues have eloquently outlined the Government's successful economic policy and how they are dealing with the responses to the reports.  In the few minutes available to me, I propose to discuss the character of the Taoiseach because he has been the subject of a well organised strategy to attack him as an uncaring, incapable politician and poor leader.  When one considers the many aspects of his ministerial career, this is clearly not the case.For the past two years I have had responsibility in the Department of Health and Children for dealing with people with disabilities.  The Taoiseach is credited by all sides with introducing a multiannual investment programme.  This decision will be to his eternal credit.  Having lived in the same constituency as the Taoiseach for the past 40 years, I know him well.  It is a pity Deputy Quinn is not present to respond because I resent his attempt to attach the tag of "corrupt" to the Taoiseach and link it with Oliver Cromwell.The Taoiseach has the full support of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party on the basis of his honesty and integrity as a politician.  As my colleagues noted, he has at all times gone out of his way to place the country first and pursue policies that will safeguard our economic solvency.  In doing so, he has risked his popularity.  It is, unfortunately, a truism that politicians often take the soft option.  That is not the case with the Taoiseach.I must repudiate the allegation that the Taoiseach has committed economic treachery.  This accusation has never been made previously in the House and does not stand up to scrutiny.  If the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, were permitted to survey and inspect the banking and economic policies of other countries, I am certain there would be the same level of opposition.There were suggestions during today's debate that the Taoiseach had little success in the Departments in which he has been Minister.  One could say the opposite to that.  I have already explained about his major involvement in the multi-annual investment programme.  I reiterate the point made by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, about his total involvement in promoting reform in the health service.  I heard criticism today from Deputy Kenny about the levels of suicide and that there was little investment in mental health.  These matters go unnoticed when things go right.  The Government commitment, proposed by the Taoiseach, on the reform of mental health under A Vision for Change, has seen this year alone €45 million committed to mental health and a further €50 million each year ongoing.  That clearly indicates a Taoiseach who not alone has a serious grasp of the economic realities, but also has a great understanding of the difficulties on the social aspect.It goes without saying that I have the greatest pleasure in supporting the motion.  I might say that if I had two more votes I would cast them also.
#NiallBlaneyIND	unknown-#NiallBlaneyIND-party	unknown-#NiallBlaneyIND-dob	unknown-#NiallBlaneyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	366	I thank the Minister of State for sharing time.  There has been much smudging of facts in the past week by many Members of this House, most of whom should know better.  The two reports that came into the public domain last week on our economic situation provided some clarity on the root of Ireland's difficulties.  Needless to say those on the Opposition benches focused on those aspects of those reports they felt might bring political advantage to themselves, a case of opportunistic politics at its best.Many issues were addressed in the financial reports.  Lessons must be learned by those in power, including those in the banks, the regulator and those in government.  The Taoiseach has never shirked his responsibilities and has shown great courage in accepting any responsibility he may have had in this regard.  He has rightly focused on righting any wrongs that might have taken place.  Professor Honohan reported that the major responsibility lies with the directors and senior management of our banks that got us into trouble.  He also acknowledged the good work that has been done since by the Government in ensuring these institutions will never be able to repeat their actions again.  As Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, introduced measures in various budgets in an effort to curb spiralling dependence on the property market.  In hindsight these measures were inadequate, but then hindsight is always clear.  This week it has been confirmed that advice from the OECD, the IMF and the Central Bank at the time was inadequate.  A large share of responsibility must also lie there.In the past week Members of this House have called for the Taoiseach's head, have called for a general election and, I suppose, have called for everything under the sun except common sense in regard to this matter.  These are the same people who called on the Government to spend more when we were enjoying good times, even going so far as to call Deputy Cowen's budgets measly.  Now that we are experiencing changed times they are telling us that we spent too much.  Despite pressure from Opposition parties when the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance to abolish stamp duty over a number of years, thankfully he refused to relent to these populist demands.  These are the same parties that are now engaged in finger wagging.  Rather than curb the reliance on property, they called for the introduction of measures that would have increased the overheating of the economy at the time.The Labour Party moved to the top position in the opinion poll last week leading it to believe it will form the next Government.  I am particularly pleased to see the Labour Party with such popularity at this time.  To reach the peak is one thing, but staying there requires leadership, policy and economic direction.  These are attributes that the Labour Party and in particular Deputy Gilmore do not have in abundance.  This afternoon Deputy Gilmore accused the Taoiseach of having a hard neck.  It takes a hard neck for him to put himself forward as an aspirational Taoiseach, when he lacks policy and leadership.  Over the next year to 18 months I believe he will go back down the polls.  Deputy Gilmore should enjoy his current days of glory because they will not last.  He and his party have sat on the fence on every tough decision that needed to be taken in recent years.  It opposed the bank guarantee scheme, which has been hailed as necessary by Professor Honohan in his report last week.  This is the same guarantee that other countries around the world copied in an effort to stabilise their banking systems.  The Labour Party also sat on the fence regarding the Croke Park deal with the unions.  This is the Labour Party that could not make up its mind on what is ultimately a labour dispute.  Is this the kind of party we want running our country?  I certainly do not think so.  History will not be kind to it and I believe its time at the top of the polls will be short lived.Fine Gael proposed a motion of no confidence in the Taoiseach and the Government, while at the same time its own leader is facing a leadership bid within his own party.  Even those within do not have confidence in him to lead their party never mind the country.  It cannot even get its own house in order, never mind getting the country back on its feet.I acknowledge that every party has its own internal issues and Fianna Fáil is not immune.  The difference is that in Fianna Fáil we are not focused on internal rifts but on bringing the economy back from the brink.  That is what we were elected to do.  We are not engaging in popularity contests.  We did not expect to be doing well in opinion polls given the tough decisions we have taken which are affecting every family.  We take no joy in taking tough decisions, but I believe we are reaping and will reap the benefits of these decisions in the years to come.  In the meantime if we suffer in the opinion polls so be it.  We must continue on the path of corrective action we are taking.  The decisions taken by the Government in the past two years have been courageous.  We need to continue on this road and that is what we intend to do with the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, at the helm.The people are angry that the banking meltdown took place.  In two years' time when the media and nation look back over the Government's handling of the economy, the Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, and his Government will be appreciated for the guidance they have given the country.  We will then see the opinion poll that matters, the general election, what proper policy for the sake of the nation has gained for the Taoiseach, his Government and Fianna Fáil, and what the cheap populist policies of the Opposition have gained for it.

The banking crisis was home-baked.  This week, when Max Watson was speaking at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service he said it was clear there was a culture of not rocking the boat here in recent years.  He is right that such a culture existed during the Fianna Fáil period in Government in recent years.  The ingredient for this home baked crisis was a cosy cartel which developed between the Government, the bankers and their developer friends.  Nobody wanted to rock the boat.  Good banking practices and regulatory controls were abandoned in the stampede to keep pace with the property boom.To compound our difficulties when concerns were raised that our economy was overheating and that corrective action was required, those who spoke out were accused of being the prophets of doom.  Even in July 2008, when the dogs in the street knew corrective action was required to deal with the country's deteriorating finances, the Taoiseach urged people to stop talking as if the economy was facing Armageddon.  Turning a blind eye to any alarm bells was common practice.  The Central Bank of Ireland buried data from a crucial report months before the collapse of the housing market here in 2007, which bears remarkable similarity to what happened in the United States and Goldman Sachs.It is now the most vulnerable and weakest in our society who are suffering because of the Government's mismanagement of the economy.  Yesterday, the respite day centre which is run by the Brothers of Charity in Limerick, and which accommodates a number of people with disabilities and their families from County Clare closed its doors because €150,000 could not be found to keep it open, yet every householder in the country is being saddled with a €30,000 debt by this Government to support the €54 billion gamble on NAMA.An opinion poll over the weekend indicated that 57% of people want a general election.  The Taoiseach should consider that and dissolve this Dáil to give the people a say in what they want.The economy has been mismanaged and the Government has been there too long.  It is tired, jaded and has run out of ideas.  That is what has put us in the current position.

Has the Government no pride in its country and its fellow men and women?

It affects people who are immediately touched by unemployment, financial crisis and fear of losing one's home and consequent interpersonal relations difficulties within families.  There is a sizable need to ensure that the psychological, emotional and mental well-being of people is looked after and the resources are allocated.We have criticised the Government for reducing the level of social welfare but it has substantially increased the cost of social welfare because of the numbers out of work.  Some 440,000 people now receive social welfare payments.  I am making the point that there is another need caused by this crisis; there must be support for the psychological, emotional and mental well-being of our people.People are inherently vulnerable and can go through life doing well at school and college and being in a good marriage and job.  If people lose that job and are in a financial bind, they would be extremely vulnerable.  The Government should not reduce the resources for protecting and assisting such people.There are statistics for the first three quarters of last year showing an increase in suicide rates of 26%.  That was predictable as all recessions bring about an increase in suicide rates around the world but some states respond differently to it.  When Finland experienced serious recession, the country responded in a different way than New Zealand, which experienced a substantial increase in suicide rates.  The suicide rate increase in Finland was limited.  The Taoiseach and Government should recognise that there is a serious issue that needs resourcing.

#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	544	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording Independent Deputies the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.For me, this matter is not about personalities and I do not engage in personal attacks.  This debate relates to being straight and honest with people.  When someone messes up, he or she must take responsibility, accept the consequences, apologise and make amends.  It is only then that we can try to move on.  Sadly, such an approach has been lacking in recent weeks.  The use of terms such as "I regret" or "I take full responsibility" does not go down well with me or the rest of our people.  This is where we are in terms of this debate during a time of economic crisis.  People do not mind taking hits provided they are fair and just.  I will put all of this into perspective by highlighting two cases brought to my attention last week at the my constituency clinic.  The first involves a young man with a severe disability who had to go into hospital and is now ready to be released but has been told by his disability service that they cannot take him back because they are one staff member short.  The question that arises from this debate is about the vulnerable.  The second case brought to my attention relates to a young disabled man whose five day service with the Central Remedial Clinic in Clontarf has been cut to three days.  What is going on?  I brought this to the attention of the Minister and the Health Service Executive but nothing has happened.  For this reason, I have no confidence in this Government.  This is the reality for many people on the ground.  It is about credibility, competence and confidence.  I might add that I do not necessarily have confidence in some of the other parties who cannot make up their minds on particular issues and do not know where they stand on these matters.I have in the past made some unpopular decisions in regard to banking but I did so in the national interest.

#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	546	Unlike others, I do not play politics with the economic future of this country.  The Government must accept responsibility for its part in wrecking this economy.The Minister, Deputy Martin, referred earlier to the banking reports and alleged that many people in this House have not read them.  The following are the conclusions of those reports: Ireland was heading towards an economic crisis long before the collapse of Lehman Brothers; section 23 tax incentives and mortgage interest reliefs were behind the property bubble; Anglo Irish Bank was not the only bank at fault; the banks often ignored lending guidelines, which was a disgrace; bonuses for senior and middle management created the wrong incentives; supervisors right up to the end clung to the hope of a soft landing for the economy and property market; and regulators had little experience and bankers were overly optimistic.  These are the conclusions of the reports.  It is further stated that regulators were too "timid" and excessively deferential to their bosses and the banks.  Another important conclusion is that the Central Bank and IMF failed to warn about the danger in vivid terms.  Also, there was no supervision of building when lending to developers began.  They are the main conclusions of the banking reports which point clearly to the cause of the situation in which we now find ourselves.In the overall context, the blame lies at the hand of the Government, the bankers, the developers and those in the broader society, not yet mentioned in this debate, who were greedy and lost the run of themselves.  This includes some sections of the media.  To these people I say get off the high moral ground and face up to your own mistakes.  I believe it was one of the Kennedys who said that integrity is the lifeblood of democracy; deceit is a poison in its veins.  These words are true and relevant to this debate.  For me politics is about integrity and public service.  For me integrity means more than the absence of corruption.  It means more than just transparency, accountability or honesty in Government or business.  It is the sum of all these values.  This is what the country needed some years ago and is what it needs now.  Part of the solution to the further development of the economy, banks and public service in this country is groups such as Transparency International, whose work, efforts and commitment on these issues I commend.I have cautiously welcomed the Government's proposals in regard to whistleblowers and a crack down on white collar crime.  However, I have concerns.

#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	550	Go raibh maith agat don deis a labhartha ar an ábhar seo.  On 7 May 2008, some months before his untimely death, my predecessor, the late Deputy Tony Gregory, spoke on the nomination of Deputy Brian Cowen as Taoiseach.  On that occasion, he offered his good wishes to Deputy Cowen while also saying he would not be voting for him.  He stated he hoped Deputy Cowen would see the justice in taking steps to end the divisive inequalities that exist in Ireland today, in particular in our health service and education and housing sectors.  He continued that it was his view that the increasing social inequalities of recent years was the major issue facing all of us elected to the Dáil by the people.In regard to this motion of confidence in the Taoiseach, I bear those words in mind and ask if justice is being served by this Government under the stewardship of the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, in the areas of health, education and housing and how much is being done to lessen, never mind completely reduce, social inequality.  The positive steps that have been taken are the appointment of real experts, Mr. Patrick Honohan, Mr. Matthew Elderfield, Mr. Regling and Mr. Watson who believe in truth, honesty, transparency and accountability, qualities which sadly have been lacking.  It is the lack of those qualities that have been the hallmark of successive Governments.I welcome the Taoiseach's statement in his speech that he will continue with examination, analysis and reflection leading to full and fair assessments.  Another positive is the full acceptance of the Taoiseach of responsibility for his decisions as Minister for Finance and Taoiseach.  I welcome the acknowledgement of the mistakes in management of banks' excessive risk taking, inadequate financial regulatory controls, property tax incentives that should have been abolished many years before and acknowledgement of failures of corporate governance.  However, I note that not once are the words "greed and self interest" used."A turning point in our economy" is a phrase that has become somewhat hackneyed at this stage.  We may have turned a certain corner statistically — the Taoiseach referred in this regard to a recent OECD outlook — but on the ground in terms of homes, workplaces, community, youth and drugs projects, schools and hospitals we have not turned that corner to optimism.  My difficulties lie with the continued propping up of the institutions that have failed this country so drastically owing to those institutions being led by men motivated by greed and self interest and supported by their political friends.  Has one developer, banker or board member of those institutions in any way suffered let alone faced appreciable penalties or a prison term?  It was gratifying to see the recent apprehension of drug barons, men who brought so much devastation to communities in Ireland.  Another group of men involved in banks, financial institutions, property development and speculation have brought equal if not more devastation to our country.  I accept the need for due process but these men had no regard for due process.  How can I have confidence in a Government and a Taoiseach who leave this unpunished?Those suffering today because of this recklessness are hardworking families, people who have worked all their lives and are now jobless and young people.  I recently visited a school in my constituency and met with the leaving certificate class of 2010.  I was struck by their lack of possibilities and how difficult it will be for them to realise their career dreams in this country.  Again, it is the vulnerable and poor who are being penalised with cuts in individual allowances, local services, regeneration housing and integrated primary community care.  Funding for community swimming pools has been withdrawn and there have been cuts in respite, special needs and learning support.  There is no replacement in schools for posts of responsibility.  There are cuts in health services and there are not enough places in education and training for the unemployed.  Homelessness has increased.  What will happen to our commitment to overseas aid?I wonder if anything has been gained from this debate or from the various activities of other parties during the past two days.  I recently received a letter from a constituent who stated she feels helpless, disenfranchised and a victim of other people's greed and laziness.  There are too many examples of increasing social inequality to enable me to support this motion of confidence in the Taoiseach.

No doubt they will take care in future to check out the possibility of a clash of engagements.The Fine Gael motion of no confidence in the Taoiseach was an instant response to the publication of two major reports into the causes of the banking and financial crisis before most people even had an opportunity to read and digest them.If one wants a prime example of political and media spin, it is the crude oversimplification of these two reports through reductionist personalisation.  There is a great deal of relevance in them to many organisations and sectors and even to our entire society, and such an approach does no justice to these reports.  Perhaps dealing with this motion today will facilitate more concentration on the substance.  Earlier fears that these reports would not go near the heart of the matter have proved entirely unfounded.Each Deputy elected to this House has a mandate for up to five years, unless the Dáil is dissolved earlier.  It is the Dáil who elects the Taoiseach and who mandates and sustains the Government, in case of doubt by an explicit confidence motion such as this.  The notion of an electoral policy mandate, or a mandate contingent on opinion poll ratings, while it may have a place in political debate, has no constitutional foundation, quite rightly from the point of view of political stability.  All Governments have to manage unforeseen crises and contingencies.  As a matter of fact, it was clearly indicated to the electorate in 2007 that Deputy Bertie Ahern would hand over to a successor in the course of this Dáil, and that successor was likely to be Deputy Brian Cowen.

I am not making a ministerial opening statement.  I will happily give the Deputy a copy afterwards.Government by opinion poll is quite impossible, especially in difficult times. I am incredulous that anyone aspiring to be in government should treat an opinion poll as a catalyst for anything, especially one that stretched core votes of 16%, 21% and 22% respectively to 17%, 28% and 32%, or whatever you are having yourself, with the promise that next time there will be a new improved methodology.  The issue, not least stated in these two reports, is whether, in the words of Edmund Burke, we offer the public our best judgment and lead or whether we follow whatever the last poll, constituent or campaigning organisation said to us.  The Taoiseach and the Government since 2008 have provided a new style of leadership in the handling of the economic crisis, which has been widely praised by influential opinion formers on whom, indirectly, our future credit standing and our ability to meet our social welfare, pay and interest bills depends.

The Fine Gael Party, to its credit, has put forward alternatives, but I think the NewEra policy has to go back to the drawing board, because the projected increased net indebtedness in an attempt to provide a stimulus and jobs runs directly counter to the absolute need to reduce sovereign indebtedness.  Ireland is in no position to swim against the tide.With regard to the past, the claim is that the then Minister and Government should have known better, better than the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator, better than the IMF, the EU, The Economist and the Financial Times and better than the broad consensus among most economists in this country, that there would be a soft landing for demographic and other reasons.  EU President Van Rompuy told the Financial Times  yesterday: “The euro became a strong currency with very small interest rate spreads. It was like some kind of sleeping pill, some kind of drug, we weren’t aware of the underlying problems.”  We are talking about a far wider failure than just Ireland.  Indeed, I bought a book at an airport recently by Thomas Wieczorek entirely about Germany called — and I translate — The Plundered Republic: How banks, speculators and politicians drove us to ruin.  Does it sound familiar?While Fine Gael was critical of benchmarking, and Labour of property incentives, mainly for equity reasons, both parties in aggregate sought more spending and lower taxes.  Deputy Quinn spoke today about how Fianna Fáil bankrupted the State, but a few years ago his mantra was that we were the second richest country in the EU.  As finance spokesperson in the Seanad pre-2007, I can testify that what Deputy Bertie Ahern said is true.  The only reason the Seanad discussed the economy about once a month was that Fianna Fáil put down Private Members' motions.  Opposition interest in promoting discussion of economic policy was nil.The Taoiseach, as a Minister, made important contributions to funding disability, to restoring the integrity of policing reform in Northern Ireland and to more egalitarian fiscal policy.  As Taoiseach, both he and his colleagues have been tough and determined. They have steered the ship of state safely through mountainous seas. It is not time to change the captain.

It was a tough decision for the Green Party to enter Government and it has been tough to stay in government during the perfect storm.  I know, from my own experience of stormy weather, that hindsight is a luxury one does not possess when one is at sea and the barometer falls.  One needs a captain who can make the right, not the popular, decisions when one is in the eye of the storm.  I am no friend of Deputy Brian Cowen——

He not only regretted some decisions that were made, he apologised for certain decisions.  I respect someone who knows when to apologise.  I will not say I have warmed to Fianna Fáil in government but I like to think I get on with those I work with on a daily basis in that party.I am critical of decisions that were made during the boom years but I am critical of my own party also.  We talked about moving away from boom time taxes, such as stamp duty receipts, but we also, along with the Opposition, advocated more spending.  If we could relive the boom years every party would advocate different approaches to taxation, spending and not losing the run of ourselves when the tricolour was raised on London's Savoy Hotel.That was then.  This is now.  How are we restoring confidence in providing the conditions to allow Ireland to recover?  We have made appointments.  Many speakers have talked about Matthew Elderfield and Patrick Honohan.  I have much respect for both of those individuals.  We have put in place a pay deal.  The Labour Party sat on the fence when it came to the pay deal.  They came down in favour of the deal once it was approved.  That is not leadership.  It is following the flock.

They said the pay deal did nothing to tackle many issues but, on the positive side, said it offered stability.  The Green Party and Fianna Fáil proposed, supported and delivered that pay deal.We have made tough decisions on taxation.  The Labour Party has proposed a third rate at 48%.  That would mean a marginal rate of income tax of 62% for self-employed people earning more than €100,000.  In economics, marginal tax rates are important because they are one of the factors that determine the incentives to increase income.  At high marginal tax rates, the individual has less incentive to earn more.  We must encourage small and medium sized enterprises.  We will not do that if we tax them at 60%.We are taking action on the environment and creating green jobs.  A carbon levy was talked about for years and, despite the Opposition's efforts, it is in place.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party wanted opt-outs for commuters, agriculture, rural dwellers and whatever you're having yourself.

The next time the Labour Party talks about opt-outs, remember that six months ago, in their proposals for taxation, they said they would raise €500 million from taxation.  One cannot do that if one gives opt-outs to everybody.Fine Gael talked about rebuilding Ireland.  That is what we are doing.  At times of huge difficulty, companies like Airtricity, Microsoft and the ESB are creating jobs in the green economy, renewable energy and clean technology.  They do not talk about this in a debating forum.  They deliver real jobs.I was struck by the many references to planning made by Deputy Richard Bruton over the last 24 hours.  In Dún Laoghaire, Fine Gael councillors have been burning the midnight oil recently trying to rezone agricultural land, take buildings off the list of protected structures and convert architectural conservation areas to shopping centres.  We are providing a better planning system.There is no Nirvana around the corner if the captain and the crew are changed.  Tough decisions have to be made by any party, and have been made by ours.

Voters would be given the choice between an incompetent Fianna Fáil Administration and a bland uninspiring Fine Gael alliance with their Labour Party clones, chips off the old block. It would be the Dolly alliance.We Greens love to recycle.  That is why I have quoted a speech I made in July 2006.  Today, Deputy Eamon Gilmore said we need to be free from the politics of the past.

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	582	Those who thought the movie "Wall Street" was far-fetched should read the two banking reports, which highlight a world of corporate greed, political ineptitude and disastrous regulatory failure.  One could not make this stuff up.  The cycle of boom and bust is as old as recorded history.  Wise leaders should use the wealth of good times to weather the storms that inevitably follow.  It is a question of prudence.  Many members of recent Cabinets were supposed to be accountants, although I would question Deputy Bertie Ahern's qualifications as an accountant.  They should have known that in good times, one should save money for the bad times.  That did not happen, however.  Over the course of more than ten years of prosperity, sufficient wealth was generated not only to address our infrastructural deficits but also to retain enough in the Government kitty to carry us safely through the global financial crisis.  The Government squandered the fruits of the boom, however, and allowed the banking community to lose the nation's wealth on a massive property crap game.  The greatest economic opportunity ever given to any Irish Government was not just missed — incredibly, it was turned into a financial trap from which people of my age and my child's age will struggle to escape for the next 30 or 40 years.  Not since Herbert Hoover sleep-walked America into the Great Depression has a political leader destroyed so much in such a short space of time.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Cowen, and his predecessor, Deputy Bertie Ahern, have entered the record books for all the wrong reasons.Many people will have a noose around their necks for the next 30 or 40 years as they try to repay mortgages, credit union loans and other personal debts.  In many cases, their houses are not even worth half the value of their mortgages.  We have spoken about credit unions.  They are stuck with their debts because the boom suited Fianna Fáil, for many reasons.  Every time a house was sold, the Government received taxes — PRSI, PAYE and VAT, etc. — worth approximately 40% of the total cost of the house.  It was worth its while to maintain that position.  Year after year, it used that money to drive up expenditure and buy elections.  The biggest thing that went wrong was that the Government planned an election in 2001, but that was prevented by the outbreak of foot and mouth disease.  We had another year of massive expenditure in advance of the 2002 election.  Spending was hyped up for two years to try to buy votes.  The Government did the same thing in 2006 and 2007.  The two reports make it clear that expenditure increased by 11% and 10% in those years.  I suggest that was done to buy votes at election time.I do not have confidence in the ability of the Taoiseach and his Ministers to run this country and get us out of these problems because their decision-making in past years was fundamentally wrong and will have a serious impact on people's lives in the years ahead.  These decisions were made consciously — not by mistake.  The Taoiseach has come in here with a half-hearted apology.  On other occasions, he said he received bad advice but I do not accept that.  There were enough Ministers to make good decisions.  They received warnings from this side of the House.  Deputy Kenny was right earlier when he said the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, appointed Deputy Cowen as Minister for Finance because he knew he would do what he was told.  Year after year, I sat behind Deputy Bruton on budget day when he clearly warned that what the Government was doing was wrong.

The people do not have confidence in its ability to get us out of this.  It is time for the Government to accept that.  These reports give it a chance to accept that it got it wrong.  The Government should go to the country and thereby give all parties a chance to set out their plans for the future.  We should have a proper debate on their spending plans and their plans for getting us out of this.  The Government does not have the backing of the public to be in office and to be in government.

However, the truth is that the love affair with tax incentives continues.  As recently as last February, Deputy Bruton, during the under-reported Report Stage of the Finance Bill, tabled an amendment which proposed tax reliefs for general practitioners setting up primary care centres.  He did so, I assume, in response to a campaign by general practitioners and a report from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children which he must have known provided no reasoned case for the various tax incentives it recommended for a sector which is already in receipt of substantial public funding.

The initiative provides that a former Taoiseach may employ two secretarial assistants for a period not exceeding five years from the date when s/he was last Taoiseach.  After the five year period has elapsed only one secretarial assistant may be employed.  The initiative also includes provision for purchase of computer equipment necessary for this type of service.While there are no guidelines in relation to the type of work for which secretarial assistants are employed by former Taoisigh, I understand that they carry out a normal range of secretarial duties to support the former Taoisigh in carrying out those aspects of work associated with their former roles which remain after their period in office has ceased.  However, under the initiative the secretarial assistant cannot engage in constituency or active party political work.The table below provides details of the costs incurred in providing secretarial assistants to former Taoisigh who have availed of the scheme since its introduction.Former TaoiseachCost of Scheme by YearMr. Charles J.

It is my understanding from the OPW, which has primary responsibility for the procurement of suitable office accommodation for the Government's Decentralisation Programme, that the fit-out costs of the advance office in Carlow were approximately €2,068,000 and that the yearly rental cost for this temporary office is in the region of  €369,000.The non-property decentralisation costs incurred from January 2004 (when the Government's Decentralisation Programme started) to end May 2010 amount to €505,323.  The breakdown of the €505,323 figure into its constituent elements is as follows:€Office Machinery171,849Salaries & Allowances136,980Incidental124,057Consultancy29,620Office Premises27,883Travel and Subsistence14,628Postal & Telecom Services306The OPW has also acquired a site, at a cost of €1,440,000, in Carlow town centre for the construction of a permanent office there for the staff of NERA and the CRO and for other staff of my Department who were scheduled to decentralise to Carlow.  The former Minister of State, Noel Ahern TD, announced on 13 December 2007 that the OPW had invited the Macquarie Partnership to be the consortium to become the ‘successful tenderer' in respect of this project.  However, as the construction of the permanent office in Carlow had not started and as no contracts had been signed, the Minister for Finance decided, in December 2009 in the context of the Budget, to defer construction of the proposed permanent office for my Department in Carlow for the time being, pending an overall review of the Government's Decentralisation Programme in late 2011.Apart from the ongoing costs associated with having NERA and CRO staff in the advance office in Carlow, it is not anticipated that there will be any further costs incurred by the OPW on behalf of my Department between now and the completion of the review of the Government's Decentralisation Programme in late 2011.

#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	789	It is current Government policy to issue new work permits for highly skilled, highly paid positions or for non-EEA nationals who are already legally resident in the State on valid employment permits or where there is an officially recognised scarcity of workers of a particular type or qualification. There are no restrictions on non-EEA nationals changing employer after a period of one year and my Department already facilitates those who wish to change employers with new employment permits.The Employment Permits Act 2006 sets out in legislation the rules governing employment permits.  One of the main focuses of this Act was in increasing the rights and protections afforded to migrant workers and the means to ensure redress in the event of exploitative practices. The Act's provisions gave immigrants greater freedom, autonomy and control over their own employment choices by enabling workers for the first time to apply and re-apply for their own permit and allowing workers to change their employer after a period of a year and move to another employment in order to take advantage of better conditions or career options.  Last year, my Department issued almost 1,500 employment permits in respect of employees changing to new employers.It is important to retain the current arrangements, which operate to protect employees, as they allow the system to trace employers who employ permit holders.  I believe that the current arrangements for moving jobs are sufficiently flexible.  A properly controlled employment permit system requires that permits be issued to a specific employee for a specific job with a specific employer.  To do otherwise would not only risk abuse of the employment permit system but would make it much more difficult to ensure that employers observed the employment rights of employees.My Department condemns any practices by employers that may result in non-compliance with employment rights entitlements or any other mistreatment of employees including those on employment permits.  Ireland's Employment Rights Legislation establishes the statutory rights applicable to all people working in Ireland whether they are Irish citizens or otherwise.  I would urge all whose employment rights are being breached by an employer or those who know of such exploitation to contact the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA).The Employment Permits Act 2006 allows for regular review of Ireland's economic migration policies and my Department keeps these policies under review, in line with the emerging needs of the labour market, on an on-going basis.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	790	Since the onset of the global downturn, Agencies and groups associated with my Department, including Forfás, EI, IDA and the National Competitiveness Council, have examined the underlying factors affecting Ireland's competitive position and our ability to grow indigenous enterprise, as well as continue to attract mobile international investment, with a view to returning to economic growth. Specific actions to both protect jobs and create opportunities for employment in the future are set out in reports such as "Jobs and Growth 2010", the report of the High Level Action Group on Green Enterprise and the Innovation Taskforce.Supporting jobs and promoting economic growth involve direct and indirect measures. My Department and the enterprise development agencies have a role to play in both, by directly supporting business and by ensuring that the policies pursued across Government are consistent and support our overall national objectives of promoting employment and strengthening the smart economy.Our enterprise support policies have consistently evolved to meet the needs of both foreign direct investment (FDI) and growth–orientated indigenous firms.  The enterprise agencies have a range of new schemes which have been designed in response to the economic downturn.Enterprise Ireland launched its "Job Expansion Scheme" earlier this year.  This is designed to assist Enterprise Ireland client companies achieve increased employment through increased sales and international trade, through a competitive fund.  Enterprise Ireland is also providing supports to 3 programmes in a "LEAN" Initiative, which is focused on helping companies improve their processes and overall competitiveness to ensure they can compete in the global market.  Enterprise Ireland is targeting the creation of 40,000 new jobs over the period 2010-2014 and through the multiplier effect this is expected to lead to an additional 28,000 jobs elsewhere in the economy.The 35 City and County Enterprise Boards are the principal deliverers of State support to the micro-enterprise sector and, in particular, they have deepened their role in promoting a culture of entrepreneurship in their locality.  I am examining the CEB network and will bring proposals to Government in the coming weeks on the best structure to support micro-enterprise.The recently launched IDA strategy entitled "Horizon 2020" presents a view for the next decade, outlines the opportunities for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), and sets the goals to capitalise on these opportunities. In addition to setting challenging job targets of 62,000 new jobs to be created in the medium term (2010 to 2014), which will generate an additional 43,000 jobs elsewhere in the economy, IDA aims to support this strategy by focusing on the Transformation Agenda with its client companies to allow them become leaner, more flexible and innovative; by targeting investments in new forms of FDI — partnership opportunities from the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China); and by targeting growth prospects in nanotechnology, biotech, alternative energy and nanotechnology to name a few.The Taoiseach has asked me to chair the High Level Implementation Committee to oversee implementation of the Report of the Innovation Task Force.  This Report contained many new ideas, as well as calling for a reinforcement and better alignment of existing efforts and programmes.I chaired the first meeting of the Implementation Committee on 1 June, where we identified the issues where we can move immediately to implementation; the need, in the first instance, to constitute and deploy expert working groups as specified by the Task Force; and the requirement for close engagement with agencies and other Government Departments to progress implementation.  The Committee will meet on three more occasions in 2010; in late July, October and December.Following this first meeting, an Intellectual Property Implementation Group, was appointed and charged with developing and realizing the intellectual property related (IP) recommendations of the Innovation Taskforce Report and of a detailed IP review conducted by Forfás for my Department.  The development of an IP Strategy will help Ireland maximise the return on public investment and support the commercialisation of Irish research and development.Since my appointment as the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, I have met with a range of stakeholder groups, including individual companies and business people both in Ireland and abroad.  In my discussions, I have underlined that my priority is to facilitate economic recovery through ensuring that the business environment is supportive of Irish enterprise, both manufacturing and services, in order to grow exports and to continue to encourage high value foreign investment.  Most commentators, including the Central Bank and Economic Social and Research Institute, now forecast positive growth in the second half of this year.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	791	I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 94 together.The National Competitiveness Council's report, "Benchmarking Ireland's Performance", provides a comprehensive assessment of Ireland's competitiveness on an annual basis.Our competitiveness is derived from a complex set of factors, not all of which are within our control.  The factors with the greatest influence on our competitiveness are costs, productivity and exchange rates with our trade and investment partners, and the overall business environment.  The business environment covers areas such as regulation, infrastructure and the availability of necessary business services.Since January 2008, Ireland has regained competitiveness as domestic inflation remains below that of our main trading partners and the euro weakened.  We are seeing lower business costs, which is easing pressures on the business sector.  Wage costs, asset prices and energy prices are all on a downward trend.  Annual inflation fell by 2.5% in the twelve months to April, in contrast to the rest of the euro area where it rose by 1.5%.  The Irish consumer price level relative to its trading partners is now back to levels last seen in 2000/2001.The price of services to business fell by 5.7% in Q3 2009 compared to Q3 2008, with the largest price reductions in architecture, engineering and technical testing (-9.8%), and computer programming and consultancy (-8.5%).  The European Commission forecast that our Unit Labour Costs will fall by 9.4% over the 2009 to 2011 period, against a projected increase of 3.5% for the Eurozone. This equates to a positive swing of 13% in Ireland's favour over the three year period to 2011.The Government introduced an extensive package of measures to contain energy costs last summer — and this is reflected in a much improved position relative to competitors. Data released in May shows that electricity and gas prices fell for all types of energy consumers in the second half of 2009, and have moved closer to the EU average for most business users.Competitiveness also includes boosting the total productive capacity of the economy.  We are doing this, for example, through targeting R&D and Innovation to drive productivity and ensure that we have the skills and technologies available in Ireland that will give us a competitive advantage.  The entire Irish economy must be a smart economy, that is to say, a high-productivity and technologically advanced economy if we are to compete with the rest of the world.  The Taoiseach appointed me to Chair the group tasked with implementation of the recommendations of the Innovation task force and this met for the first time earlier this month.We are focused on opportunities for growth in a number of key sectors. For example, the Green Enterprise report estimated that 80,000 new jobs could be created in the coming years and there are other opportunities for growth in high-end manufacturing and services.  Since my appointment as the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, I have met with a range of stakeholder groups, including individual companies and business people both in Ireland and abroad.  In my discussions, I have underlined that my priority is to ensure that the business environment is supportive of Irish enterprise, both manufacturing and services, to grow exports and to continue to encourage high value foreign investment.

There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.As I informed the Deputy in my answer of 29 April 2010 my Department received a lump sum claim for the individual concerned on 11 January, 2010.  In the course of processing the claim, a query was raised with the employer.  I understand that this has been resolved in recent days and that the claim has now been authorised for payment. Payment is expected to issue in the next two to three week period.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	796	Information on salary, allowance and overtime payments to named individuals working for a named employer constitutes "personal data" for the purposes of the Data Protection Acts as the individuals concerned are or can be identified from the data.Such data in respect of staff of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation is held for the purposes of paying appropriate levels of salary, and where applicable, allowance and overtime, to them.  The Department, as a "data controller" for the purposes of the Data Protection Acts, is required to comply with those Acts.  Section 2 of the Data Protection Act 1988, as amended, requires data controllers to ensure appropriate security measures against, among other things, unauthorised disclosure of the data.  Consequently, other than as required by law (i.e. to the Revenue Commissioners), the Department does not disclose salary etc. details of any individual member of staff unless explicitly authorised to do so by that member of staff.However, I can advise the Deputy that in 2009 expenditure by my Department on salaries, allowances and overtime was as shown in the table below.  These expenditure figures relate to the staff of the Department and its offices (1,074.93 FTE at 1 January 2009) plus staff employed directly by the National Consumer Agency (NCA) who are not members of Department's staff but for whom the Department provides a payroll facility.(1)

There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.I can confirm that my Department received a lump sum claim for the individual concerned on 4 May, 2010.  This claim awaits processing.  In respect of redundancy lump sum payments paid directly to employees, such as in this instance, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from October 2009.In relation to Redundancy claims, the scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims in 2009 amounted to 77,001 which represents a threefold increase over the level of claims lodged in 2007 and earlier years.  In 2007, claims received were of the order of 25,000.Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for Redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken in the Department in 2009 to alleviate the pressures on the Payments area include:almostdoubling the number of staff through reassignment to a current level of 52 full time equivalents;prioritisation of the Department'sovertime budget towards staff in the Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;establishment of aspecial call handling facility in NERA to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses concerned about their payments;Better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website;Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate theoffset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against existing outstanding tax  liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.The backlog and waiting times remain at unacceptable levels.  However, improvements are evident.  I should point out that my Department has, in 2009, processed 50,664 claims, up 70% on 2008.  In the period 1 January 2010 to 31 May 2010 new claims amounted to 28,587 — a fall off of almost 20% on the corresponding 5 month period in 2009 when 35,559 new claims were lodged.  The reduction in incoming claims is most welcome.  Inroads are being made in the backlog of claims reducing from 42,591 in December 2009 to a current level of 34,881 at end May 2010.  In the first five months 34,036 claims were processed, up 130% on the same period last year.Responsibility for the payment functions arising under the Redundancy and Insolvency payment schemes is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.

There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.I wish to advise the Deputy that on the basis of valid claims entered in the Redundancy Payments System in my Department, there is no record of a redundancy claim having been received in respect of the individual in question.  Application should be submitted to my Department on an RP50 form completed and signed as appropriate by the employer and the employee.  This form can be completed online or downloaded from the Department's website at www.entemp.ie.  In the case of forms submitted online, it is necessary also to submit a signed hardcopy of the form. Claims are not imported onto the Redundancy Payments System until a signed copy is received.It is also my Department's practice not to enter incomplete claims on the system as these claims cannot be processed until the necessary documentation is submitted.  Forms are returned to allow missing details and/or supporting documentation to be submitted.  The documentation required in support of lump sum claims is set out on my Department's website at www.entemp.ie.  Submission of correctly completed Redundancy claim forms (RP50s) with all of the required documentation greatly facilitates the processing of claims.The documentation required in support of lump sum claims is evidence of the employer's inability to pay the redundancy entitlements to the employees.  This involves requesting a statement from the company's Accountant or Solicitor attesting to the inadequacy of assets to make the redundancy payments and the latest set of financial accounts for the company.  The employer is also asked to admit liability for the 40% liability attaching to the company arising from the redundancy payments.If this information is provided to the Department, the employees are paid their redundancy entitlement from the Social Insurance Fund.  Upon payment, the Department pursues the company for the 40% share that the company would ordinarily have been expected to pay to the employees.If the necessary supporting documentation required from the employer is not provided to my Department, the employee will be advised by my Department to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) against the employer to seek a determination establishing the employee's right and entitlement to redundancy.  Once such a determination is available, the Department is then in a position to make the payment to the employee concerned.  Should the outstanding documentation be provided by the employer during the period while the case is pending a hearing before the EAT, this would allow the claim to be processed by my Department in the usual way.

In selecting locations to show companies, IDA Ireland seeks to include locations which have been affected by closures/job losses and also gives priority to the Border, Midlands and West regions.It is not possible to indicate the outcome of these particular site visits because it is often the case, following such visits, that a considerable number of meetings and discussions take place between the potential investor and IDA Ireland before the company makes a final decision on location.While IDA Ireland seeks to influence the selection of location, the final decision on both visits and final location is taken, in all cases, by the promoting company.

Measures already taken in the Department in 2009 to alleviate the pressures on the Payments area include:almostdoubling the number of staff through reassignment to a current level of 52 full time equivalents;prioritisation of the Department'sovertime budget towards staff in the Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;establishment of aspecial call handling facility in NERA to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses concerned about their payments;Better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website;Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate theoffset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against existing outstanding tax liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.The backlog and waiting times remain at unacceptable levels.  However, improvements are evident.  I should point out that my Department has, in 2009, processed 50,664 claims, up 70% on 2008.  In the period 1 January 2010 to 31 May 2010 new claims amounted to 28,587 — a fall off of almost 20% on the corresponding 5 month period in 2009 when 35,559 new claims were lodged.  The reduction in incoming claims is most welcome and while inroads are being made in the backlog of claims, it remains at an unsustainably high level — reducing from 42,591 in December 2009 to a current level of 34,881 at end May 2010.  In the first five months 34,036 claims were processed, up 130% on the same period last year.Responsibility for the payment functions arising under the Redundancy and Insolvency payment schemes is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	801	The Renewed Programme for Government contains a specific commitment to "implement a Code of Practice for doing business in the Grocery Goods sector to develop a fair trading relationship between retailers and their suppliers" and "to review progress of the Code and if necessary to put in place a mandatory code". The introduction of a Code is intended to ensure that there is a fair balance in the relationships between the various stakeholders in the grocery goods sector.  The Code is not intended to protect one stakeholder over another nor is the Code intended to prevent stakeholders such as retailers and suppliers from engaging in robust contractual negotiations as happens in most other sectors of the economy.The Government will give effect to this commitment by including a specific provision in the legislation, currently being prepared to merge the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority, which will allow for the introduction of a statutory Code of Conduct in the grocery goods sector. I expect to publish this legislation later this year.In the interim period, until the legislation is enacted, the opportunity will be taken to explore with all relevant stakeholders the possibilities of agreeing a Voluntary Code.  To this end I recently appointed a facilitator to engage with stakeholders in relation to the drawing up of a Voluntary Code.The Government recognises the importance of ensuring that there is a fair balance in the relationships between the various players in the grocery goods sector, particularly given the importance of this sector to the national economy. The introduction of a Code, as provided for in the Programme for Government, is intended to achieve such a balance taking into account the interests of all stakeholders including the interests of the consumer.Insofar as the issue of prices is concerned, Government policy has consistently favoured the promotion of competition and consumer choice as the best way of tackling high prices.  Previous policies which sought to control prices by legal instruments such as maximum price control orders, as applied particularly in the 1980s, were not effective as the experience was that maximum permitted prices often became the minimum price and price inflation in that era was in double digits.In support of the policy of promoting competition, competition law prohibits undertakings who hold a dominant position in the market from abusing that position of dominance.  In this regard undertakings who engage in practices such as predatory pricing with the aim of eliminating competitors and, following such elimination to significantly raise prices, may be engaging in an abuse of dominance.  Persons who have evidence of undertakings engaging in an abuse of dominance should bring that evidence to the attention of the Competition Authority in order that it may be investigated.  It is important to point out, however, that predatory pricing should not be confused with competitive pricing which is the result of a properly functioning market.  The purpose of competitive pricing is to retain market share whereas predatory pricing is aimed at driving efficient competitors out of the market by abusing a dominant position.

All of the CEBs operate to the same criteria in relation to the assistance which they can offer i.e. they can support the establishment and/or the development of enterprises provided that the projects have the capacity to achieve commercial viability and which over time may develop into strong exporting entities.  The criteria under which financial assistance is available from the CEBs are based primarily on factors such as the sector of the economy in which an enterprise is operating or intends to operate and the size or proposed size of the enterprise.  Support to an enterprise must not give rise to displacement of existing enterprises.Priority is given to projects in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors.  It is considered inappropriate to support other areas such as retail enterprises, personal services (e.g. hairdressers, gardeners, etc), professional services (accountants, solicitors, etc) lacking export potential, and construction, as it is considered that these enterprises generally give rise to unacceptable deadweight (where projects would have proceeded anyway) and/or displacement (where the projects simply displace business from other players in the market) concerns.I would advise the company to remain in contact with their local CEB in North Cork to explore their options as their business develops as the CEBs also deliver a range of non-financial supports in the form of business advice, training and mentoring designed to improve management capability development within micro-enterprises to help new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow, which may be available to the company.

For strategic skills or labour shortages in designated occupations in key economic sectors, Government policy is to issue employment permits for the employment of non-EEA nationals for specific vacancies and in response to employer demand.  The various schemes that give effect to such policies — Green Cards, Work Permits, Spousal and Dependant Work Permits and permits for Intra-company Transferees — were introduced following enactment of the Employment Permits Act 2006 and came into effect on 1st February 2007.In early 2009, the Department undertook a review of employment permit arrangements to ensure their ongoing relevance to the needs of the Irish labour market.  As an outcome of this review, more stringent eligibility criteria were implemented for prospective new entrants to the work permit schemes from 1st June 2009 onwards.  The main changes to the Work Permits Scheme were:Making more job categories ineligible for new work permits (equestrian work riders, domestic workers and HGV drivers now ineligible), and an ongoing assessment of other occupational categories regarding their continued eligibility.No new permits for jobs carrying a salary level of less than €30,000 per annum except on an exceptional basis.Strengthening the labour market needs test by doubling FÁS advertisement of the job vacancy from 4 weeks to 8 weeks, and national press advertisement from 3 days to 6 days.More stringent conditions for the renewal of permits — higher fees and requirement for labour market needs test on renewal.Spouses and dependants of new principal work permit holders, who have entered the State after 1st June 2009, having to apply for work permits in their own right and are subject to the standard eligibility criteria and fees for work permits.The Employment Permits Act 2006 allows for regular review of Ireland's economic migration policies and my Department keeps these policies under review, in line with the emerging needs of the labour market, on an on-going basis.

Recommended procedures for the implementation of this provision are set out in Guidance Notes issued under the aegis of the Money Laundering Steering Committee which is chaired by the Department of Finance and includes representatives of financial services industry bodies, the regulatory authorities and State Agencies, including the Garda Síochána.Identification of a customer comprises two elements.  These are name verification (typically evidenced by photograph — bearing document such as passport, driving licence or other reputable source document) and address verification.  Paragraph 28 of the Guidance Notes states that any measures adopted by credit institutions should not deny a person access to financial services solely on the grounds that they do not possess certain specified identification documentation.  Paragraph 45 of the Guidance Notes provides for those persons who cannot reasonably be expected to produce certain forms of identification, such as a person who does not have a passport or driving licence and/or whose name and Irish address does not appear on a utility bill, electoral register or directory.The credit institution may use either of the following methods, as an alternative to a passport/driving licence, to verify name:Identification form with photograph signed by a member of the Gardai orDocumentation/cards issued by a Government Department showing the name of the person andLetter/statement from a person in a position of responsibility (e.g. a solicitor, accountant, doctor, minister of religion, teacher, social worker, community employment scheme supervisor) who is in a position to confirm the person's identity to the credit institution.  In such instances the person providing the letter/statement must present themselves to the relevant credit institution providing proof of their own identity and verifying their status to the credit institution.The Deputy may be aware that the Anti Money Laundering provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 will be replaced by the Criminal Justice Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Act 2010 whose provisions are expected to be commenced shortly.  The new Act requires customers to be identified on the basis of documents or information that a credit institution has reasonable grounds to believe can be relied upon to confirm the identity of the customer including documents from a Government source.  This requirement will be supplemented by guidelines which will give examples of the type of documents which may be accepted for identification purposes.  The range of acceptable documents under any new guidelines is likely to be broadly similar to those provided for under existing guidelines.

This requires that credit institutions maintain an amount on deposit with the CBFSAI in the deposit protection account.  The amount is prescribed by the Minister for Finance by regulations.  Section 12(2) of the Act provides that Section 4 will come into operation on such day as the Minister may appoint by order.  In addition, Section 7 of the Act provides that a group or groups of credit unions may, subject to the prior approval of the Minister, make an aggregate payment or payments on behalf of each credit union which is a member of such a group in satisfaction of the amount of a deposit in the deposit protection account.  My Department, in consultation with the CBFSAI, is considering the amount of the deposit to be paid and the method of payment of the deposit and I will make a decision of this in the near future.  I will then, as Minister for Finance, appoint the date of commencement of Section 4 of the Act for credit unions.The amount of the deposit to be held in the deposit protection account has already been set in European Communities (Deposit Guarantee Schemes) (Amendment) Regulations 2009 at 0.2% of a financial institution's total deposits held in EU Member States. This represents a figure of €26m approx. across the credit union movement.  As provided for in Section 5 of the Act, the amount of the deposit by a credit institution in the deposit protection account, after the initial calculation, shall be recalculated annually by the CBFSAI for each credit institution or class of credit institutions by reference to the returns made by them.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	814	There are a number of aspects to the Deputy's questions and I will answer each individually.The formula for calculating the guarantee fees paid under ELG is based on European Central Bank recommendations on government guarantees for bank debt dated 20 October 2008, available at http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/other/recommendations_on_guaranteesen.pdf .I am aware that the European Commission has produced a staff working document on the application of State Aid rules on Government Guarantee Schemes covering bank debt to be issued after 30 June.  The pricing structure outlined in the document will be taken into account in discussions between the Department and the European Commission on a possible extension of the ELG Scheme.In line with the ECB recommendations above, the fee structure is differentiated for institutions based on their credit ratings for liabilities with a maturity of greater than one year.  A flat rate fee of 50bp applies to all liabilities of less than or equal to one year.The ELG Scheme envisages that institutions will issue unguaranteed debt, which has began to happen, and will gradually reduce their dependence on the guarantee.  This makes it is difficult to estimate what fees will be received over the coming years.  However on the basis of information we have to date, we have estimated that €700m will be received in 2010, €600m will be received in 2011 and €300m in 2012.The fee income is paid into an interest bearing mandated account in the Central Bank where it is held on deposit.  To date €90.5m has been received which was in respect of Q1 2010.I have previously referred to the €1bn which will be raised under CIFS and ELG by end September 2010 and which will be transferred to the Exchequer thereafter.  I am presently considering the best mechanism for receiving and holding payments under ELG after September.

The lending limits are set in primary legislation and an amendment to Section 35 is, therefore, required to be made at this point.  Accompanying measures are also required to balance the increased flexibility in relation to rescheduling and the Registrar of Credit Union does not have the power to impose these additional conditions that are required to be introduced across the sector.The restrictions contained in Section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997 are an important asset and liability instrument which has protected the financial stability of the credit union movement over many years and it would not be prudent to await the outcome of the strategic review.  While the review itself is planned to be completed by March 2011, any primary legislation arising would require some considerable further time to implement.  The credit union sector needs to be safeguarded further now to ensure that it can continue to provide assistance to its members in the current difficult economic climate while at the same time lending only within its capacity to do so.I have decided therefore to proceed with the amendments to Section 35 now.

In this regard, the Chairman made it clear that NAMA will require each borrower to set out how he plans to reduce his debt significantly over a three to five year horizon.  Failure to demonstrate the capacity to do so would leave NAMA with no option but to foreclose.  The Chairman also made it clear that NAMA reserves the right to recover arrears at any stage if it emerges that a debtor recovers the capacity to repay his or her debts.I am also advised that NAMA has informed borrowers whose loans have transferred to it that the Agency will be very stringent in terms of any management costs allowed to them as part of their business plans.

The total transferred was some €15.3 billion and the consideration paid was €7.7 billion, making an overall discount of 50% on this tranche.I am advised by NAMA that some of the loans transferred have been subjected to 100% discounts because of various legal deficiencies. In a number of other cases, institutions asked for additional time in order to remedy deficiencies.  This was granted by NAMA subject to strict deadlines and, in most of those cases, appropriate remedial action was taken by the institutions. Where an institution failed to remedy the deficiency, the full discount was applied.Where a valuation remains in dispute between NAMA and an institution, the loan is not left with the institution; it is acquired by NAMA.  The institution may only challenge that valuation under Section 121 of the NAMA Act 2009.  After completion of all transfers from the institution, Section 122 of the Act provides for disputes on the overall portfolio valuation to be referred to a Valuation Panel for review providing certain criteria are fulfilled.

I further stated that, as of end April, a total of €188bn was expected to mature before 1 October. This figure assumes demand deposits mature in the first month and notice deposits mature as if notice were given at end April. I also said that the position of individual covered institutions is sensitive commercially and I therefore confined my reply to aggregate figures.

The CIFS scheme covered all deposits (retail, commercial, institutional and interbank), covered bonds, senior debt and dated subordinated debt (lower tier II) until 29 September 2010. Anglo Irish Bank has a continuing contractual obligation to all of its bondholders.On 9 December 2009 the State entered into the Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities Guarantee) Scheme 2009 (the ELG Scheme) as a further measure to maintain the stability of the financial system of the State. The ELG Scheme provides for an unconditional and irrevocable State guarantee for certain eligible liabilities (including deposits) of up to five years in maturity incurred by participating institutions in the relevant period.At 31 May 2010 €2.39bn of Anglo bonds with maturities after 30 September 2010 had been guaranteed under the ELG scheme. In addition to these bonds, Anglo has both commercial paper and certificate of deposit programmes operated under the ELG scheme.

The two copies of the Inland Revenue Affidavit are now submitted directly to the Probate Office, which then forwards one copy to Revenue when the Grant of Representation is issued.I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the opportunity was taken, as part of the modernisation and simplification of CAT administration, to re-design the Inland Revenue Affidavit to facilitate scanning and the information sought is primarily unchanged.Neither the old nor the new versions of the Inland Revenue Affidavit is capable of being filed on-line using a system similar to Revenue's On-line System (ROS).  To provide for such a system, the Courts Service would have to develop an appropriate secure IT platform.  However, putting the Inland Revenue Affidavit in an on-line environment will be kept under review by Revenue and the Courts Service in the context of the development and roll-out of e-Government services over the coming years.

As the majority of new houses purchases are exempt from stamp duty — only new properties in excess of 125 square metres for owner-occupiers or new properties purchased as investments are stampable — it can be reasonably assumed that the bulk of stamp duty paid transactions in respect of residential property relates to second-hand properties.The available information is in respect of the total number of residential property transactions, where stamp duty was paid in the years 2004 to 2009, broken down by reference to the consideration price bands corresponding to the rates of stamp duty, and is set out in the following tables:Consideration Price Bands:Number of Duty Paid Transactions€127,001 – €190,50010,706€190,501 – €254,00013,432€254,001 – €317,5008,504€317,501 – €381,0004,679€381,001 – €635,0004,653Over €635,0001,968Total43,942Consideration Price Bands:Number of Duty Paid Transactions€127,001 – €190,50011,268€190,501 – €254,00011,014€254,001 – €317,5007,181€317,501 – €381,0005,919€381,001 – €635,0006,478Over €635,0002,939Total44,799Consideration Price Bands:Number of Duty Paid Transactions€127,001 – €190,50010,877€190,501 – €254,00011,088€254,001 – €317,5008,007€317,501 – €381,0008,600€381,001 – €635,0009,833Over €635,0004,496Total52,901(a) Deeds executed up to 5 November 2007Consideration Price Bands:Number of Duty Paid Transactions€127,001 – €190,5008,159€190,501 – €254,0008,512€254,001 – €317,5006,568€317,501 – €381,0005,785€381,001 – €635,0007,231Over €635,0003,364Total39,619Consideration Price Bands:Number of Duty Paid Transactions€0 – €125,00015€125,001 – €1,000,0001,374Over €1,000,00071Total1,460Consideration Price Bands:Number of Duty Paid Transactions€0 – €125,000120€125,001 – €1,000,00024,473Over €1,000,000778Total25,371Consideration Price Bands:Number of Duty Paid Transactions€0 – €125,000277€125,001 – €1,000,00011,289Over €1,000,000200Total11,766For the years 2007, 2008 and 2009 figures are available to show that some duty paid transactions fall within the lowest consideration price band because they formed part of a larger transaction or series of transactions.Particulars of transactions where no stamp duty is payable are not normally captured and, accordingly, it is not possible to provide reliable information in relation to exempt categories.

They point out that insurers look at the claims history of the individual risk when deciding what underwriting action to take. They  also look at any flood protection measures implemented by the local authority or OPW in the area. They say that where the flood risk is higher than normal people will generally pay a higher premium, or have a higher flood excess on their policy. They make the further point that withdrawal of flood cover at renewal generally only happens in exceptional cases  e.g. repeated flooding, as the industry tries to provide such cover wherever possible.My Department is currently seeking more detailed information from the IIF on the non-availability of flood cover, but particularly in relation to location. The intention is that there would be a match up of these problem areas where people are having difficulties obtaining or renewing cover with whatever corresponding remedial work is being carried out by the Office of Public Works. By approaching it in this way it should allow better resource allocation of the remedial works and also better address the underlying problems.When this information is provided it should give us a better idea of the scale and nature of the flood insurance problem.

However, arrangements were put in place on an administrative basis between the Chief Justice and the Revenue Commissioners in April 2009 to facilitate voluntary payments by members of the Judiciary in the context of the pension related deduction scheme.I have no function in relation to those arrangements. However, I understand that information in relation to the voluntary payments in 2009 was published in Revenue's Annual Report for 2009.  I also understand that information covering the period up to 1 March 2010, was forwarded to the Deputy arising from Parliamentary Question No. Reference 10738/10. I am informed that the reply to that PQ  was prepared in March 2010, prior to the enactment of the Finance Act 2010 but there was a delay in the information reaching the Deputy.The Deputy will be aware that Section 161 of the Finance Act 2010 replaced the administrative arrangements mentioned above by providing for a voluntary scheme which enables members of the Judiciary to make a gift to the State of an equivalent amount to the pension related deduction imposed on State employees under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009.  Subsection (8) of that Section specifically provides that:"(8) The Revenue Commissioners shall publish for each year of assessment only details of the number of donors who avail of this scheme in the year, and the aggregate amounts gifted for the year".The Deputy will appreciate that in view of this provision, information cannot be made available at this stage in respect of voluntary payments in 2010 under the Section 161 arrangements, but I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that it is their intention to publish information in accordance with section 161(8) after the end of the year of assessment.I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the category of judge is not a relevant factor for the operation of a voluntary scheme and accordingly a breakdown of payments received as between judges of the different Courts is not available under either the old or new arrangements.

The Plan identifies specific viable structural and non-structural options for managing the flood risks within the catchment as a whole and for localised high-risk areas.The period of public consultation for the Plan finished on 30 April 2010.  A substantial number of observations were received during the public consultation.  These contributions are currently being considered and will be incorporated into the final Plan, as appropriate.In addition to the measures being pursued through the CFRAM framework, consultants have been appointed to undertake a hydrological and hydraulic review of the November 2009 floods for the Rivers Lee and Owenboy.  This review will examine, inter alia, rainfall depths and return periods, flood flow paths, extents and probabilities, with a view to providing an up-to-date model for this catchment.  The initial review of the modelling is due to take place in mid-Summer.A Steering Group has been set up, comprising of Cork City and County Councils, ESB and OPW, to deal specifically with Lower Lee Flood Risk Management issues and has already met twice.  Procurement of consultants to bring the current proposals to a point, which confirms their feasibility, will shortly be commenced.  The consultants will have the benefit of having the results of the various dam discharge scenarios, currently being undertaken, available to them.  It is anticipated that proposed measures, if found to be feasible, would then be brought to public exhibition in 2011.The OPW understands that the City Council has already carried out surveys of the quay walls.  The OPW has agreed to fund interim repair works at two locations of Cork Quay Walls.  This funding is subject to the invitation of tenders by Cork City Council and will not exceed the sum of €450,000 for each location.  An allocation of €318,600 has also been made to Cork County Council for flood mitigation works at Crookstown.  It would be open to both Councils to submit further applications for minor interim works.

Relevant notes relating to items in the tables are also included.Estimates of the prospective yield to the Exchequer in 2011 from the abolition or standard rating of each deduction and relief from incomes over the specified ranges are not available. These estimates could not be provided without undertaking an extensive and costly development of the Revenue tax model nor would they capture any behavioural change on the part of taxpayers as a consequence of such change or their economic effects.
Cost of Tax Credits, Allowances and Reliefs 2006 and 2005
The following table IT 6 shows the estimated cost in terms of revenue forgone of the personal tax credits and the main reliefs and deductions allowable under the income tax system. A number of reliefs which apply both to individuals and companies is also included and the cost shown in relation to these reliefs covers income tax and corporation tax.An adjustment is included in the cost figures applying to income tax to compensate for incomplete numbers of tax returns on record at the time of compiling the estimates.The tax credits and reliefs listed in the table serve varying purposes. Many are essentially structural reliefs through which individual tax liabilities are adjusted to reflect relative taxable capacity. The main personal tax credits are a good example of this since they may be regarded as part of the progressive income tax structure representing a band of income chargeable at a zero rate. Others, such as relief for interest paid in full or investment in corporate trades, are tax-based incentives in favour of specific groups or activities which are designed to promote certain aspects of public policy.In computing taxable profits, account needs to be taken in some way of the depreciation of capital assets incurred in earning those profits. To this extent, the figures in the table of the "costs" of capital allowances should not be regarded as measuring a "loss of tax revenue" on profits. To compute such "loss", regard would have to be had to the excess of the amount of the capital allowances at current rates over the amount of the normal allowances.The figures shown for the basic personal tax credits (married, single and widowed) are the costs of these tax credits as if all other tax credits and the exemption limits did not apply. They do not include individuals who are not on Revenue records because their incomes are below the income tax thresholds. The cost figures for the exemption limits are based on the excess of the exemption limits over the basic personal tax credits.The figures of cost are for 2006 and 2005 and all figures are based on tax due in respect of assessments for each year and not on tax receipts within that year.The figure against each credit or allowance represents the additional tax which would become payable if the tax credit or allowance were withdrawn assuming no consequent change in the behaviour of taxpayers (for example, in relation to the reliefs for savings), or the amounts of payments (for example, interest payable on certain savings schemes might need adjustment to take account of the new tax liability).The numbers of claimants of each credit or relief are shown for both years to the extent that they are available. The numbers included are the taxpayers who would be adversely affected by the withdrawal of the respective credit or relief.In the calculations, each tax credit or allowance has been dealt with separately and on the assumption that the rest of the tax system remained unchanged.  It would be therefore inaccurate to calculate the effect of withdrawing all the credits, reliefs and allowances by simply totalling the figures.  For example, the costs shown for capital allowances and stock relief are also calculated on the basis of separate withdrawal of these reliefs. Their combined cost would be greater than the sum of the separate costs because allowances are not always fully set off against available profits. For instance, a person with €1,000 gross trading profits, €1,000 capital allowances and €1,000 stock relief would pay no tax if either of the reliefs were withdrawn but would pay tax on €1,000 profits if both reliefs were withdrawn. In this case, the cost of each relief separately is nil but the combined cost is tax on €1,000. Basic data is not available to enable an estimate of the combined cost of these reliefs to be made.The figures for estimates based on tax returns have been grossed up to an overall expected level to adjust for incompleteness in the numbers of returns on record at the time the data was extracted for analytical purposes.Finally, the estimates shown in many cases are tentative and are subject to revision in the light of later information. Some of the cost figures included in the table for 2005 reflect revisions to figures previously published in the 2007 Report.TABLE IT6: Cost of Tax Credits, Allowances and Reliefs 2005 and 2006(1) Estimated cost forTax Relief Provision20052006€mNumbers€mNumbersINCOME TAX

65.213574.7141NOTES ON TABLE IT 6(1) Figures accompanied by an asterisk* are particularly tentative and subject to a considerable margin of error.(2) The cost figures for the exemption limits are based on the excess of the exemption limits over the basic personal tax credits. They include the cost of marginal relief for taxpayers whose incomes are not greatly in excess of the exemption limits.(3) The figures shown for the basic personal tax credits (married, single and widowed) are the costs of these tax credits as if all other tax credits and the exemption limits did not apply. They do not include individuals who are not on Revenue records because their incomes are below the income tax thresholds.(4) Arising from the change over to Tax Relief at Source the figures relate to the number of policies issued. These include policies where subscriptions were paid by businesses on behalf of their employees.(5) Part of the cost of contributions to Permanent Health Benefit Schemes is not identifiable as a result of the move to a “net pay” basis for contributions by PAYE taxpayers from 6 April 2001.(6) See the following table “Green Paper on Pensions” for background commentary and cost figures for 2007.(7) Arising from the work on the “Green Paper on Pensions” (2007) the basis for costing this item was changed for 2005 and is not directly comparable with the figures for earlier years. See also the following table “Green Paper on Pensions” for more recent figures.(8) “Other” relates to borrowings for purposes such as acquiring an interest in a company or partnership or to pay death duties.(9) The cost of exempting the income of charities, colleges, hospitals, schools, friendly societies, etc. from income tax includes the sums repaid in respect of tax credits, income tax deducted at source (certain dividends, other investment income and payments received under covenant), and also includes tax on (see Note 10) (a) donations made by the PAYE and self-employed sectors to approved bodies (b) income tax repayments on foot of PAYE donations. It also includes the cost of exempting certain bodies from the deduction on income arising from government securities. Information is not available about other income received gross.(10) The cost figures for relief for donations to Approved Sports Bodies and for certain Sports Persons are based on self assessment returns.(11) In the absence of other information, tax has been assumed at the standard rate of income tax even though a different rate might be appropriate in many cases.(12) The costs included for corporation tax are by reference to accounting periods which ended in the years 2005 and 2006.(13) The cost shown for capital allowances does not include any cost associated with “unused capital allowances”, that is, capital allowances which are not absorbed by a company in the accounting period in which they arise because they exceed the amount of the company’s profits of that accounting period which are available for offset. Unused capital allowances can be offset as losses against taxable profits arising in the previous accounting period and against certain profits arising in future accounting periods and can be offset against the profits of another company in the same group of companies. It is estimated that €3,340 million of unused capital allowances were claimed in respect of 2006 accounting periods but as the proportion of this item which is included in previous years losses and in group relief is not separately identifiable a reliable estimate of the cost of the capital allowance element cannot be provided.(14) The tax cost shown for section 23 type relief is the estimated ultimate tax cost relating to the total allowable expenditure in respect of claims made in 2005 and 2006 tax returns for the first time. The cost shown is for income tax cases only.(15) The cost does not include any notional cost associated with IFSC companies. The International Financial Services activity in Ireland represents new business which has developed as a result of, among other things, the concessionary tax rate. This means that as the cost of the concessionary rate is not just the difference between the concessionary tax rate and the full tax rate, it is therefore not quantifiable. In regard to the cost shown for the effective rate of 10 per cent for manufacturing and certain other activities, no account is taken of the fact that without these incentives, many enterprises may not have set up here. To the extent that profits earned by such enterprises would not have been available for Irish tax purposes, part of the cost figure shown might be regarded as notional.(16) The costs shown for R&D is for claims for R&D on corporation tax returns for accounting periods ending in 2005 and 2006. However, the cost includes the cost associated with claims where the company was entitled to the credit but was unable to absorb it in that accounting year.
Green Paper on Pensions — updated estimates of cost for 2007
As part of the work on the Green Paper on Pensions, a review was carried out of the current regime of incentives for supplementary pension provision with a view to developing more comprehensive and reliable estimates of the cost of reliefs in this area. The review examined, among other things, the current reliefs and incentives for investment in supplementary pensions and the data available on which to base reliable estimates of the costs in revenue foregone to the Exchequer.The review drew on newly available 2007 aggregate data on contributions to pension schemes by employers and employees arising from a P35 initiative introduced on foot of provisions that were included in Finance Act 2004 with a view to improving data quality. Estimates of the cost of tax for private pension provision updated for 2007 are included in the table below:Estimated costsNumbers*€ millionEmployees’ Contributions to approved Superannuation Schemes590708,100Employers’ Contributions to approved Superannuation Schemes150385,100**Estimated cost of exemption of employers’ contributions from employee BIK540385,100Exemption of investment income and gains of approved Superannuation Funds900Not availableRetirement Annuity Contracts (RACs)420123,900Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs)6556,400Estimated cost of tax relief on “tax-free” lump sum payments130Estimated cost of PRSI and Health Levy relief on employee and employer contributions240Not availableGross cost of tax relief3,035Estimated tax yield from payment of pension benefits410Net cost of tax relief2,625*Numbers as included in P35 returns from employers to Revenue for 2007.

Certain property-based tax incentives and incomes exempt from tax — uptake and estimated potential cost to the Exchequer in terms of income tax and corporation tax forgone based on 2006 tax returns
Provisions were included in the Finance Acts of 2003 and 2004 to enable new statistical data on the uptake of tax relief for certain property-based tax incentives and incomes exempt from tax to be obtained from tax returns. This information, derived from changes introduced by the Revenue Commissioners to income tax returns and corporation tax returns for 2006, is set out in the following table.The figures shown include the amounts claimed in the year but exclude amounts carried forward into the year either as losses or capital allowances, and include any amounts of unused losses and/or capital allowances which will be carried forward to subsequent years.Tax Incentive/Income ExemptionAmount ClaimedAssumed maximum tax cost €mNumber of claimants€m€mUrban renewal351.7140.53,436Town Renewal93.038.71,149Seaside Resorts15.76.41,167Rural Renewal94.038.02,137Multi-storey car parks40.216.6119Living Over the shop7.12.782Enterprise Areas7.43.0129Park and Ride6.92.832Holiday Cottages22.99.5660Hotels277.1106.61,515Nursing Homes35.514.7538Housing for the Elderly/infirm3.41.495Hostels1.960.8223Guest Houses0.20.17Convalescent Homes4.11.718Qualifying Private Hospitals25.210.6284Qualifying sports injury clinics0.103Buildings Used for certain childcare purposes14.36.0304Student Accommodation162.564.31,059Exemption of profits or gains from Greyhounds0.40.16Exemption of profits or gains from Stallions90.722.5185Exemption of profits or gains from Woodlands13.65.41,231Exempt Patents (section 234, TCA 1997)395.083.81,120Totals1,662.9576.215,299Notes:The figures shown  relate to the various reliefs/incentives and exemptions as specified in the 2006 form 11 and CT1.There were concerns that in some instances the new, separately categorised data on property incentives may not have been correctly entered on the Tax returns. Revenue drew the attention of the relevant tax practitioner bodies to these deficiencies to rectify them in future returns and also increased awareness among its own staff involved in processing tax  returns of the need to ensure, through closer examination of the returns, that they are correctly completed.The estimated costs have assumed tax foregone at the 42% rate in the case of income tax and 12.5% in the case of corporation tax. This means the figures shown correspond to the maximum Exchequer cost in terms of income tax and corporation tax. However, the actual Exchequer cost could be lower, particularly in relation to the exempt income items, as the income could be subject to deductions for allowable expenses and other costs thereby reducing the level of income that would be actually  subject to tax.Some of the costs shown above are included in the costs shown for capital allowances and section 23 relief in Table IT6. For example, exempt income included above is not part of capital allowances.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	832	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the latest relevant information available is in respect of income tax relief allowed for contributions to Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) for the income tax year 2007.RACs and PRSAs are available to the self-employed and to employees not in occupational pension schemes. The information is set out in tables following this reply which provide the number of cases, amount of deduction and reduction in tax for tax relief for RACs and PRSAs for the various contribution ranges. The information is based on income returns contained in Revenue records at the time the data were compiled for analytical purposes, representing close on 90% of all returns expected. A married couple who has elected or has deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.The figures for the total number of cases and the total reduction in tax shown in the tables are lower than those indicated in the table supplied with the reply I gave on 3 November 2009 to Parliamentary Question ref 38545/09 tabled by the Deputy. This is due to the fact that the figures in the tables represent under 90 per cent of all income tax returns expected for 2007, while the figures supplied on 3 November were, in accordance with normal practice, grossed-up at aggregate level to adjust for this incompleteness.The latest tax year for which income tax returns are required to have been made (and in respect of which data on contributions to RACs and PRSAs would be included) is 2008. The deadline for making those returns was 31 October 2009 (or 17 November 2009 if submitted via the Revenue on-line Service — ROS). I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it takes time to process the various data on the returns received and, moreover, that many return forms for 2008 continue to be received in the months beyond the October/November deadlines. Before providing any figures for 2008, the Revenue Commissioners prefer to have as high a proportion of tax returns for that year as is possible represented in the data by allowing sufficient time to elapse to ensure that an acceptable level of maturity in the figures is attained. In that context, it is hoped that sufficient data should be available by September next to provide comparable tables for 2008,It is not possible to provide corresponding figures in regard to the take-up of the tax relief for pension contributions by employers and employees to occupational pension schemes as the relevant data are not captured in such a way as to make this possible. Provisions were included in the Finance Act 2004 with a view to improving data quality and transparency without overburdening taxpayers or employers. The Act includes provisions that require employers to provide data on superannuation contributions in the P35 form to be filed by employers from 2006 on. These changes have yielded additional information regarding the overall cost of tax relief for pension contributions but, as the returns are aggregated at employer level, they cannot provide a precise basis for measuring the potential impact on the Exchequer of any proposals to limit tax relief for pension investment for individuals across different income ranges.Personal Retirement Savings Accounts —  by range of Gross Income.Range of gross incomeTotalsFromToNumber of casesAmount of deductionReduction in taxTax due for paymentGross Tax*Reduction in tax as % of Gross Tax€€€€€€%—10,000150230,8481,8181651,98391.710,00020,0007901,519,146224,686152,616377,30259.620,00030,0002,2404,615,210879,8022,171,0283,050,83028.830,00032,7307241,688,295329,4121,262,8711,592,28320.732,73040,0001,9345,089,0741,326,5004,880,2186,206,71821.440,00050,0002,1937,066,8572,258,9559,097,52911,356,48419.950,00060,0001,7986,614,6922,198,98010,841,06913,040,04916.960,00070,0001,5036,798,9962,111,21911,647,23613,758,45515.370,00080,0001,1706,200,7822,219,15611,752,27313,971,42915.980,00090,0009125,625,6552,193,25611,821,12414,014,38015.790,000100,0006154,705,7441,900,4129,609,22611,509,63916.5Over100,0002,62142,381,89717,300,020121,388,445138,688,46612.5Totals16,65092,537,19632,944,217194,623,801227,568,01814.5*"Gross tax" means the tax that would be duebefore relief is allowed for PRSA deductions Average Industrial Wage is €32,730.The figures do not include contributions made by employees through employers' payroll systems and in respect of which tax relief is provided on the net pay basis.

For 2008, the latest year for which it is available, the number of policies issued is provisionally estimated at 1,017,400.The cost figure above does not include the cost to the Exchequer of €216 million of the age-related tax relief at source, which is established by the Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009. This tax credit is part of a scheme designed to address the issues covered by the Supreme Court judgment of 2008 that found against the risk equalisation scheme for the provision of private health insurance.The scheme is two-fold, an age-related tax credit to compensate for the higher cost of insurance for older persons, which is funded by a levy on health insurance companies based on the number of people covered by policies underwritten by them.  This scheme is a temporary measure for three years from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011.  It is intended that it will be revenue-neutral over its duration.

In addition, the realisation of any estimated yield from an increase in taxation on assets relating to property is subject to movements in the value of such assets, which are currently occurring in the economy.A basis for providing corresponding figures for 2011 is not yet available.

These estimates assume no behavioural changes on the part of taxpayers.CGT is very dependent on individual behaviour and a change in rate may not produce a corresponding increase or decrease in tax yield.  In current economic conditions any estimate of additional yield must be treated with caution. In addition, increasing the rate could, in theory, lead to a reduction in yield from the tax.A basis for providing corresponding figures for 2011 is not yet available.

The only basis for estimating the yield from a tax on text messages is the figures for mobile telephone usage per quarter supplied by the companies to ComReg.  In the 12 months to end December 2009, the last 12 month period for which figures are available, over 11.912 billion SMS messages and over 56 million MMS messages were sent in Ireland, a total of over 11.969 billion messages.  At those usage rates, a levy of one cent on such messages could raise c. €119 million per annum.  However, this potential yield does not take account of any behavioural impact that might result if a levy was directly imposed on customers or imposed on the mobile phone companies and passed on to customers.While I am not aware of a similar tax anywhere else in the world, I would point out to the Deputy that text messages are already subject to VAT at 21%.

On this basis, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the full year yield to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to the claims for the exemption made in income tax returns for the tax year 2007, the latest year for which the necessary detailed information is available, could have been of the order of €20 million.However, it should be noted that this figure does not take account of the current application of the restriction of reliefs measure to the exemption of certain earnings of writers, composers and artists and thus the actual yield achievable at this stage could be significantly lower. The restriction was originally provided for in section 17 of Finance Act 2006 and was significantly tightened in Section 23 of Finance Act 2010. Individuals are now subject to the restriction where they have adjusted income of €125,000 and claim specified tax reliefs of €80,000 or more. Those subject to the full restriction will pay an effective income tax rate of 30% in addition to PRSI and levies.In addition, it must be stressed that this estimate assumes no significant behavioural change on the part of the affected taxpayers. Moreover, the application of income tax to this income source could also lead to additional claims being made for expenses and allowances by persons currently exempt.

On this basis, the full year yield to the Exchequer of abolishing tax relief for trade union subscriptions would be of the same order, although it should be noted that the value of the relief was increased from €300 to €350 in Budget 2008. At that time, it was estimated that the increase in the relief would cost approximately €3 million in a full year.

The estimates sought by the Deputy are based upon the pay reductions implemented with effect from 1 January 2010.A substantial cohort of staff, principally medical consultants, who were earning in excess of €200,000 in 2009 are, after the implementation of the pay reduction, encompassed by the proposed pay cap thresholds of  €175,000 and €200,000. On this basis, it is estimated that if a cap was imposed on public sector salaries at €200,000 it would yield savings in the region of €1.6m in 2010 and €3.1m on a full year basis in 2011, while it is estimated that a similar cap on salaries at €175,000 would produce savings of the order of €9.1m in 2010 and €18.2m on a full year basis in 2011.The estimated yield through the application of an increase of an additional 1% in the pension levy on all earnings in the case of those earning above €150,000 would be in the region of €2.5m in 2010 and €5m on a full year basis in 2011.

I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are not in a position to provide data for 2009 and later years as the tax returns for that year and subsequent years are not yet due.The figures for 2008 are subject to adjustment in the event of late returns being filed or where returns already filed are subsequently amended.It should be noted that any corresponding data returned by PAYE taxpayers in the income tax return form 12 is not captured in the Revenue computer system. However, any PAYE taxpayer with non-PAYE income greater than €3,174 is required to complete an income tax return form 11. This return is the source of the figures provided in this reply.The Deputy will no doubt be aware that the level at which interest repayments can be claimed against tax for residential rental properties was reduced from 100% to 75% in section 5 of the Finance Act 2009 at an estimated full year yield of €95 million.

Those subject to the full restriction, at adjusted incomes of €400,000 or greater, will pay an effective income tax rate of 30% in addition to PRSI and levies.The list of specified reliefs that are subject to the restriction are set out in Schedule 25B of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. Broadly, the reliefs restricted are the various property based tax incentives and certain other reliefs such as the Business Expansion Scheme, film relief and donations relief. Also restricted are certain tax exemptions including artistic income and patent royalties. The normal deductible items available to the broad range of taxpayers such as medical expenses, trade union subscriptions, the personal tax credits and exemptions such as that for child benefit are not restricted. Similarly, normal business expenses and deductions for capital allowances on plant and machinery, as well as genuine business related trading losses are not restricted.The calculations requested by the Deputy on the basis of restricting all tax reliefs and tax credits could only be provided by a significant development of the costing model, which would be prohibitive in terms of the resources required.

Currently they are around 133.9 and 124.9 cent per litre respectively.  The carbon tax, inclusive of VAT, amounted to around 4.2 cent in the case of petrol and 4.9 cent on auto-diesel.  However it should be noted that the carbon tax applied to such fuels released from warehouse after Budget night 9 December 2009, and furthermore the standard rate of VAT was reduced from 21.5% to 21% with effect from 1 January 2010.  Consequently, while tax may have contributed somewhat to the increase in fuel prices, the main contributing factors to the increase in fuel prices since early January 2010 arise outside of taxation.

I would also like to point out that a long-term impact of the carbon tax will be to incentivise energy efficient processes such as CHP.

The revenue will, amongst other things, be used to boost energy efficiency, to support rural transport and to alleviate fuel poverty.  It is the general practice not to ring-fence revenues for specific purposes but rather take an overall view on priorities in the context of Expenditure decisions which, of course, are dependent on Exchequer revenues. In this regard revenues from the carbon tax will facilitate investment in the aforementioned areas.

However, any PAYE taxpayer with non-PAYE income greater than €3,174 is required to complete an income tax return (Form 11).The estimated relief claimed has assumed tax forgone at the 41% rate for 2007 and 2008 in the case of individuals and 12.5% in the case of companies for both years.  The figures shown correspond to the maximum Exchequer cost in terms of income tax and corporation tax.The figures for 2008 are subject to adjustment in the event of late returns being filed or where returns already filed are subsequently amended.I have also been given information by the Revenue Commissioners in relation to when a building can qualify for allowances.  This depends on the particular scheme or type of building.  In general, buildings that are to be used for commercial purposes in the various area-based schemes, such as the Urban Renewal Scheme, can qualify for allowances in a number of ways.  In the case of an initial allowance (i.e. an accelerated up-front allowance), the allowance is given for the chargeable period in which the expenditure is incurred or, in the case of a lease, the chargeable period in which the tenancy commences.  Annual allowances are given when the building is in use for the purposes of a trade or profession or, in the case of a lease, when the building has been let on bona fide, arm's length commercial terms.  Thus, it is not necessary in all cases that the building be occupied for a specific purpose before allowances are given.In general, in the case of the sectoral schemes, such as hotels, nursing homes and hospitals, the building has to be in use for a specific purpose before allowances are given.  This is the case whether the building is occupied by an owner-operator or is leased.  However, in the case of residential units associated with registered nursing homes, the allowances can be claimed when the units have been leased to the nursing home for onward leasing to the elderly or infirm tenants.In the case of residential buildings, ‘section 23' type relief and the relief under the Countrywide Refurbishment scheme are given when the building has been leased, while owner-occupier relief is given when the building is occupied by the owner of the building.This information is given in tabular form below.  The table that was recently given to the Deputy in the reply to Parliamentary Question Number 23749 has been adapted for this purpose.SchemesInitial AllowanceWhen allowances given

Liaison and sharing of information also takes place with the Office of Tobacco Control.  Ireland, together with other Member States and the EU Commission, has signed international anti-smuggling agreements with Philip Morris International and Japan Tobacco International and agreements with other tobacco manufacturers are pending.With regard to performance reporting, Revenue regularly publishes, both in press releases and on its website, details of major tobacco seizures and of convictions for tobacco smuggling and its Annual Report provides yearly statistics in this regard.In considering the level of Customs controls at Irish ports and airports it must be borne in mind that a large majority of tobacco smuggled to Ireland by passengers comes via intra-Community flights, in particular those arriving from some of the new Member States in Eastern Europe.  In this regard the operating environment for Customs has been shaped to a significant degree by the introduction of the EU Internal Market and the related principles of freedom of movement.  Of specific relevance is the abolition of routine and systematic Customs checks on goods and passengers moving within any part of the EU.  In this context specialist intelligence teams based at all the main airports use profiling and risk analysis together with detector dogs to assist them in identifying contraband.The main volumes of illicit tobacco arrive in Ireland through maritime freight.  The strategy utilised to counter this involves the use of intelligence and profiling techniques, together with the latest scanning technology, to detect contraband in containers.  In this regard Revenue recently acquired a second Mobile Container Scanner for use in the State's ports.In excess of thirty voluntary cooperation agreements have been signed by Revenue with port and airport operators, carriers and freight agents.  In addition, Revenue continues to receive informal assistance from a wide spectrum of the import/export trade.Revenue works closely with the European Anti- Fraud Office, OLAF in their efforts at tackling the illicit sale of tobacco.  Revenue also provides and receives intelligence from other Customs Administrations.  This international cooperation and sharing of intelligence and expertise plays an important role in combating illegal tobacco smuggling on a global scale.There is also close co-operation with An Garda Síochána and multi-agency operations are mounted where appropriate to detect the distribution and sale of illicit tobacco products.  In particular, since 2008 enforcement officers have been conducting checks at retail outlets, markets and distribution centres in an ongoing operation entitled "Downstream".  This operation focuses on seizing illicit cigarettes that evaded detection at the point of importation.On the legislative front, my Department, in consultation with Revenue, regularly reviews the adequacy of the legislative framework supporting the overall enforcement strategy.  In this context the penalties for smuggling were significantly increased in this year's Finance Act.

The necessary legislative basis was provided in this year's Finance Act and the Bond was launched on Tuesday 4 May.As of Friday last, 11 June, a total of €47 million had been invested by 1,800 customers.  On average, this means that, each working day since it was launched, some 64 customers invested a total of €1.7 million in the Bond.The Deputy asked specifically for the uptake on the Bond to Monday 31 May.  As of that date, the amount invested in the Bond was approximately €34 million from 1,300 customers.Brochures, application forms, terms and conditions and Frequently Asked Questions on the National Solidarity Bond are available on the internet (www.StateSavings.ie) and additional information is available from a dedicated telephone line 1850 30 50 60 or by visiting any Post Office.

While some of the Bodies have produced preliminary estimated figures for the value of the assets and liabilities of the funds, final valuations as at the transfer dates will only be available when the audited accounts of the funds are finalised. I would be happy to advise the Deputy when I receive the final audited accounts for each of the funds.

AIB and Bank of Ireland also committed to public campaigns to actively promote small business lending at competitive rates with increased transparency on the criteria to be met.Both my officials and the Financial Regulator receive quarterly reports in relation to the lending commitments made.  The performance of the banks in this regard was published in the NAMA supplementary information booklet (blue book).  The main highlights showed that AIB and Bank of Ireland both lent in excess of €2.5bn to SMEs in 2009 while there was significant lending to FTBs.  Both banks have maintained a strong presence in the promotion of mortgages to FTBs.In the context of NAMA and the associated recapitalisations I sought further contributions to economic recovery from the banks.  In my statement on 30 March I announced further specific lending targets on the main business banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland.  They will make available for targeted lending not less than €3 billion each for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs in both 2010 and 2011.  The two banks have each submitted SME lending plans both by geography and sector for 2010 and 2011 in light of the €3 billion target.  These plans are being reviewed by my officials and Mr. John Trethowan, the Credit Reviewer.

In addition, NAMA has powers under section 141 of the Act to take measures to protect the value or conditions of land or buildings where it has acquired bank assets secured by a charge over land.The transfer of the first tranche of loans from the five participating institutions concluded last month.  At this early stage, NAMA has taken over only the loans of the largest borrowers and has not realised any underlying securities.NAMA has advised me that it is not aware of developments in which its borrowers have an interest being stripped out of fittings in the manner in which he has described.  There is an onus on such borrowers to take appropriate security measures to protect such property.If the Deputy is aware of instances of possible illegal activities, he should bring the matter to the attention of the appropriate authorities.

I am now reviewing the issue.  My officials have sought legal advice to help inform the deliberations to formulate a clear policy position.  This is a complex issue which requires detailed examination prior to bringing forward legislation.  For example, the criteria for publishing would have to be identified in the legislation.  Any amendment to the current legislation would need to be validated, justified and applied in an objective and reasonable manner to all financial services providers.  I will reflect on the options and consider possible legislative solutions in the context of the second Central Bank Reform Bill later this year.

The regulations do not take effect until I consent to their making.  The regulations prescribe the amount of the levies and the charges that are to apply to specified classes of financial service providers.  All such providers contribute towards the funding of the Financial Services Ombudsman and of the Council.  Now that the office is 5 years in existence I am advised that the Ombudsman and the Council are to review the method for determining the levies and charges and their manner of collection.I am advised that a legislative change is not required should the Ombudsman and the Council wish to amend the methodology of determining the levies and the manner of collection.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	871	Primary legislation would not be necessary to achieve 100% industry funding of financial regulation and the Central Bank Reform Bill 2010 does not contain any specific proposals in this regard.  However, I have asked officials in my Department to undertake a process of consultation with the Central Bank and Financial Services Regulatory Authority and representatives of the financial services industry with a view to examining how we might move towards 100% funding of the regulation of financial services by the industry.  The Governor of the Central Bank, in a statement to the financial services industry in December 2009, also signalled his expectation of an increasing degree of industry funding for financial regulation.Under the provisions of the Central Bank Act 1942 (Section 33J) Regulations 2009 a supplementary levy was imposed on credit institutions covered by the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008 which is designed to recoup 100% of the costs of the more intensive level of supervision necessary to ensure compliance by relevant credit institutions with the provisions of the Scheme.

These Agreements specify that no performance bonuses for senior executives are to be paid for the years 2009 and 2010.  Thereafter, any proposal to pay an annual performance bonus to any senior executive is subject to agreement between the bank concerned and the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission.  I have issued directions to the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission governing these investments which, inter alia, require the Commission to consult me before agreeing to any changes to remuneration arrangements pursuant to the Subscription Agreements.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	873	I propose to take Questions Nos. 187 and 188 together.Under the terms of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme [the Scheme], I established the Covered Institutions Remuneration Oversight Committee (CIROC) to oversee all remuneration plans of senior executives of the covered institutions.  Paragraph 47 of the Scheme 2008 required that each covered institution prepare a plan to structure the remuneration packages of directors and executives so as to take account of the objectives of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008.  For this purpose, remuneration includes total salary, bonuses, pension payments and any other benefits received from a covered institution and its group entities, or otherwise received by a director or executive arising from the performance of his or her functions as a director or executive.  These plans covered executive bonuses including share options, if any.CIROC reported on 27 February 2009, recommending reductions in prevailing base salary, bonus and pension levels for Chief Executives, Chairs and ordinary board members that it considered to be, in many cases, markedly excessive.  These recommendations were then to be incorporated in revised remuneration plans of the covered institutions to reflect compliance with the Act.CIROC fulfilled its mandate by submitting its report to me in February 2009 on the covered institutions and has no further function under the terms of the existing scheme.  However, through the terms of the respective subscription agreements and/or relationship frameworks, the Government has implemented further controls on remuneration policy at the respective covered institutions beyond the provisions of CIROC.It can be seen from the publication of the respective 2009 financial statements of the covered institutions that, taking the above into consideration, the recommendations of CIROC are generally been implemented and accordingly the objectives of Act are being taken account of by the covered institutions in setting their remuneration policies.  The Deputy will be aware that exceptions to some of the CIROC recommendations have been made but these were subject to approval in advance based on particular circumstances.On the specific issue of "pension cap" practice noted by CIROC and their view that it was unacceptable that arrangements should be put in place which would be inconsistent with the intent of the relevant legislation I specifically informed the affected institutions that this practice should cease immediately and this has happened.  At two of the covered institutions payments continue to be made because of pre-existing contractual arrangements to four individuals.  In all of these cases reductions in base salary and/or the "pension cash payment" have been made.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	874	I propose to take Questions Nos. 189 to 191, inclusive, together.The Financial Regulator is currently undertaking a public consultation on corporate governance through its consultation paper, Corporate Governance in Financial Institutions, published in April 2010.The consultation paper has been prepared and issued directly by the Financial Regulator, on foot of a commitment in the renewed Programme for Government, to develop new statutory rules in relation to the governance of major financial institutions.As the Deputy is aware the Financial Regulator is independent in the performance of its functions and my Department has not had any role in the preparation of the consultation paper.The consultation paper sets out proposed minimum requirements as to how banks and insurance companies should organise the governance of their institutions including membership of the Board of Directors, the role of the Chairman and the operation of various board committees.  It is proposed that the requirements will apply to all credit institutions and insurance companies licensed or authorised by the Financial Regulator including Irish licensed and authorised subsidiaries of international financial services groups.The Financial Regulator's consultation paper also sets out the statutory basis on which it will implement the proposed new corporate governance rules.It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the specific issues raised by the Deputy as these are a matter for the Financial Regulator to consider in finalising its proposed corporate governance standards.  The Deputy may, however, wish to bring her views to the attention of the Financial Regulator by way of a formal submission to its consultation.  I am informed that the Financial Regulator has invited views on its consultation paper up to 30 June 2010.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	875	My Department and the Financial Regulator have set up mechanisms for monitoring the financial institutions in relation to the Guarantee.  The Scheme requires that covered institutions submit a compliance certificate to the Financial Regulator each quarter which must be certified by the CEO and Chairman of the institutions and reviewed by the institutions external auditors.  The requirement that costs are not passed on in an unwarranted manner must be addressed under this compliance certificate.  Nothing has arisen to date which suggests that the Covered Institutions are not acting in accordance with Section 44.  Additionally, the Financial Regulator monitors, reviews, and approves bank charges as outlined under section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act.  In particular, the Financial Regulator must be notified of any charge imposed by a bank in relation to the provision of a service to a consumer and any increase in a charge previously notified.  The notification to the Financial Regulator must be accompanied by a statement of commercial justification (including a detailed statement of cost) and details of the estimated amount of additional income accruing from the proposal.  The Financial Regulator can waive or reduce a fee notified to it under section 149.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	876	In accordance with Paragraph 45 of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008, the biannual reports on Corporate Social Responsibility are published on each institution's website.  Copies of the reports are also available on the IBF website.  In relation to progress on the specific issues mentioned, in 2009 the Social Finance Foundation reached agreement with twelve banks and building societies to access €72 million in funding over the period 2009-2020.  This funding is being provided by the institutions at a discounted rate of interest and is key to the future of the Foundation, and the growth of social finance in Ireland.  This new funding arrangement is consistent with the requirements on the "covered" financial institutions in the area of corporate social responsibility under the terms of the Government Guarantee Scheme introduced in September 2008.In relation to payments, the Government's policy is to promote the increased use of electronic payments throughout the economy, with the longer-term objective of significant reductions, over a number of years, in the volume of paper-based payments in use throughout the economy.  This policy is fully aligned and is developing in tandem with market and regulatory developments at EU level, including the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), the introduction of the Payment Services Directive from November 2009 and the introduction of the revised Electronic Money Directive from April 2011.  In promoting this policy objective, the Government has reduced stamp duty on combined ATM cards from €10 to €5 in Budget 2009, building upon changes in the previous year's Budget.  Stamp duty on cheques was also increased from 30 cent to 50 cent per cheque, to act as a further disincentive to cheque usage.I previously indicated the need to establish new governance arrangements to further promote the development of electronic payments in our economy.  As part of this process, the National Payments Implementation Programme Advisory Group has provided recommendations in a report on the possible mechanisms and mandate to further promote the development of electronic payments.  I am currently considering these recommendations.In accordance with the Government's recapitalisations in February 2009 the recapitalised banks were committed to work towards broadening the provision of basic or introductory bank accounts in order to progress financial inclusion.  Specific proposals have not yet been finalised.  Basic bank accounts are current accounts designed for people who are unbanked and for those who want to ensure that they cannot overdraw their account or who might not meet the banks' criteria for opening a standard current account.  While the features of a basic bank account can differ the following European Commission definition captures its essence: "A basic bank account is understood as a bank account which includes services like making and receiving electronic payments for goods and services  (e.g. transfers, direct debits, standing orders) and making withdrawals, but excludes any overdraft facility".The Financial Regulator has included in its Consumer Protection Code a requirement that any measures adopted in relation to the identification of consumers should not deny a person access to financial services solely on the grounds that they do not possess certain specified identification documentation.  In relation to financial education, the information and education role of the Financial Regulator was recently transferred to the National Consumer Agency (NCA).  The NCA recently invited a number of stakeholders (including covered institutions) to form a working group to co-ordinate some of the key commitments in the Report of the National Steering Group on Financial Education — published in 2009.  Specifically, the NCA plans to develop a workplace financial education programme.

The National Treasury Management Agency is currently carrying out a detailed review of how the code can be adapted to the specific structure of the Agency and its associated bodies.An Post National LotteryThe National Lottery Company, which operates the National Lottery under a licence issued by the Minister for Finance, is a subsidiary of An Post, which is under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Corporate Governance of the National Lottery Company is a matter, in the first instance, for the Board of the Company and are overseen by An Post as parent company and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources as parent Department.  The annual reports of the  National Lottery Company for each of the years 2007, 2008 and 2009 confirm that the Company is fully compliant with the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies.Anglo Irish BankThe Bank has confirmed in its annual report for 2009 that during 2009 the bank adopted the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies and is working with my Department towards full compliance.  Compliance with the code is currently being reviewed by the Department.  It is likely that some elements of the code will be superseded by other reporting requirements.Financial Services Ombudsman Council and Financial Services Ombudsman's  BureauThe Financial Services Ombudsman's Bureau have confirmed that both it and the Financial Services Ombudsman Council are compliant with the Code of Governance of State Bodies.Irish  Financial Services Appeals TribunalThe Financial Services Appeals Tribunal have confirmed that they have a code of conduct in place which is compliant with the Code of Governance of State Bodies.While within the current statutory provisions, the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland are independent of the Minister for Finance in this area, I understand that the Board of the Central Bank and the Regulatory Authority have adopted codes of practice which reflect the document prepared by my Department.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	878	In accordance with the Central Bank Act 1942 (as amended), the Treaty of Rome and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority as a constituent part of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland is an independent body and not subject to direction by the Minister for Finance in this regard.  The Central Bank Reform Bill 2010 creates a single, fully-integrated Central Bank with a unitary board chaired by the Governor of the Central Bank.  New and more transparent arrangements for the accountability of the Central Bank to the Minister for Finance and the Oireachtas will facilitate a more thorough and regular examination of the financial regulatory authorities including the extent to which they conform to best practice in relation to governance.  However, I understand that the board of the Central Bank and the Regulatory Authority have adopted codes of practice which reflect the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies prepared by my Department.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	879	The European Council has taken a number of steps in recent weeks and months to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area. However, there is a broad understanding that economic governance within the euro area needs to be improved.  The Commission has contributed a Communication (2010) 250 on reinforcing economic policy coordination to which I assume the Deputy refers.  The President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy has established a Task Force to look more closely at reform and is considering many of the Commission's proposals.  The Task Force — of which I am a member — has met twice already and is looking at a number of issues, including a crisis resolution mechanism for the euro area, addressing macroeconomic imbalances, reinforcing the Stability and Growth Pact and enhanced budgetary coordination.  In discussing these issues, a general view is emerging that all avenues for improvements that could be advanced quickly should be considered, while taking account of national budgetary procedures and the role of national parliaments.  The President will provide an interim oral report to the European Council this Thursday 17 June.  A final report will be made to the European Council in October.

The air travel tax was one of a number of Budgetary measures introduced recently that was necessary in the context of an overall response to the fiscal challenges we face.  I have stated before that the impact of the tax on passenger numbers is being overstated.

In light of the severe flooding, the Government allocated €68.326m, including €50m for Capital expenditure, to be administered by the Office of Public Works, for flood risk management activities for 2010.  This increased allocation will allow OPW to continue with and expand its Programmes for flood relief activities.Within the overall allocation, there has been an increase for Minor Flood and Coastal Protection Works to be undertaken by Local Authorities in 2010.  OPW allocated €6.7m in March this year under the Programme, and a further €3.9m earlier this month to a total of 24 Local Authorities.  The application assessment process is continuing, and OPW are liaising with a number of Local Authorities regarding applications in respect of which additional information is required.  In addition, it is still open to Local Authorities to make further applications under this Programme, which may be considered, having regard to the overall resources available.OPW has undertaken a rigorous collection of data and information since the November 2009 floods, and has already met with several local authorities to review the flood events of November 2009 and identify actions required.  Indeed, a Feasibility Study for Bandon, Co Cork has already commenced and may result in a full flood defence scheme for the town.  OPW is also continuing to actively pursue potential mitigation measures in a number of other locations where it is envisaged the works would be carried out by OPW's own workforce on behalf of the relevant Local Authorities.  All these works are in addition to the major schemes already under construction in Clonmel, Co. Tipperary, Mallow Co Cork, Fermoy Co Cork, Ennis Co Clare, Mornington Co Meath and the River Dodder in Dublin, and the schemes at various stages of development which include Enniscorthy, Co. Wexford, Templemore, Co. Tipperary, Bray and Arklow, Co. Wicklow amongst others.  OPW is also in discussions with Dublin City Council with a view to undertaking its first major coastal flooding scheme in Clontarf, Dublin City.In recognition of the flooding situation countrywide, OPW has profiled expenditure of approximately €300m up to 2014 with expenditure in excess of €200m being profiled on capital works in this period.  I am confident that this expenditure under the current work programmes being undertaken by the Office of Public Works will reduce the national level of flood risk to people, infrastructure, businesses and the environment.

The Plan identifies specific viable structural and non-structural options for managing the flood risks within the catchment as a whole and for localised high-risk areas.  The period of public consultation for the Plan finished on 30 April 2010.  A substantial number of observations were received during the public consultation.  These contributions are currently being considered and will be incorporated into the final Plan, as appropriate.In addition to the measures being pursued through the CFRAM framework, consultants have been appointed to undertake a hydrological and hydraulic review of the November 2009 floods for the Rivers Lee and Owenboy.  This review will examine, inter alia, rainfall depths and return periods, flood flow paths, extents and probabilities, with a view to providing an up-to-date model for this catchment.  The initial review of the modelling is due to take place in mid-Summer.  The OPW understands that the City Council has already carried out surveys of the quay walls.  OPW has agreed to fund interim repair works at two locations of Cork Quay Walls.  This funding is subject to the invitation of tenders by Cork City Council and will not exceed the sum of €450,000 for each location.  An allocation of €318,600 has also been made to Cork County Council for flood mitigation works at Crookstown.  It would be open to both the Councils to submit further applications for minor interim works.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	888	Work has already commenced on the establishment of a national colorectal cancer screening programme.  This programme will initially be offered to men and women aged between 60 and 69 years.  Screening will commence in early 2012 following an intensive period of preparation which began in January 2010.  The programme will be extended to all those in the 55-74 year age group as logistics and resources allow.The HSE's National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) has responsibility for the implementation of the screening programme and it is working closely with colleagues across the Health Service Executive on preparations for this.As part of the two year pre-implementation phase for the programme, the NCSS is undertaking a series of baseline assessment visits nationwide to assess colonoscopy capacity in existing hospital services.   Between 10 and 12 screening centres will be required by the programme.  One of the criteria for hospitals wishing to participate in the programme is that they reduce waiting times for urgent colonoscopies to less than 4 weeks prior to the initiation of the screening programme.  Thirty public hospitals expressed an interest in providing colonoscopy services to support a national screening programme and all visits are due for completion by December 2010.   The outcome of the baseline assessment visits will identify potential areas for improvement and additional investment and staffing requirements. The NCSS will report these findings to my Department.There are estimated to be around 400,000 people in the initial target age group (60 to 69 years). Half of these will be invited for screening each year. Based on expected uptake rates and incidence rates, it is expected that around 6,000 colonoscopies would take place each year within the screening programme. Currently, around 59,000 colonoscopies are performed in the public healthcare system annually.The cost of the screening programme during the pre-implementation phase will be found from within existing NCSS resources.  The programme will be introduced in early 2012 to the 60 — 69 year age cohort, with additional costs of at least €5.5m for this purpose. There will also be costs associated with the refurbishment and equipping of the colonoscopy centres to ensure they meet appropriate standards. The programme will be extended to those aged 55 to 74 years of age as logistics and resources allow.The screening programme will not be allowed to adversely affect waiting times for urgent colonoscopies in the symptomatic services. The need to comply with the 4 week time limit for urgent colonoscopies has been emphasised to the HSE and I am satisfied that the public health service is capable of delivering a quality assured service for both symptomatic and screening colonoscopies.

However, I will set out the position for the Deputy in so far as information is available to my Department.In approving its National Service Plan for 2010, I have instructed the HSE to ensure that urgent colonoscopies are provided within four weeks. In the case of non-urgent colonoscopies, the HSE has instructed hospitals to refer patients waiting for longer than three months to the National Treatment Purchase Fund.The latest information (May 2010) available to my Department shows that in the 19 hospitals which reported data on colonoscopy waiting times, no patient is waiting longer than 28 days for an urgent colonoscopy. In the case of non-urgent colonoscopies, the latest figures (May 2010) available to my Department from the NTPF show 877 people waiting between three and six months, 179 people waiting between six and twelve months and a total of 25 people waiting longer than a year.  Colonoscopies are carried out for a range of possible conditions and this figure would include cases where cancer is not suspected.

The national roll-out of BreastCheck reached all counties in 2009.  During 2009 approximately 122,000 women were screened.  The National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) projected cost of BreastCheck in 2010 is €22.4m.It remains my intention to extend Breastcheck to women in the 65-69 age group as soon as resources and capacity allow. In the meantime women of any age who have concerns about breast cancer should seek the advice of their GP who will, if appropriate, refer them to the symptomatic breast services in one of the eight designated specialist cancer centres.The NCSS has estimated that there are approximately 85,000 women in the age group 65-69 and that the additional cost of expanding the programme over a number of years would be around €5 million, with a capital investment of  approximately €3 million.   However its main priority in 2010 is to maximise national uptake in the 50-64 year age cohort.The other priority for the NCSS is to ensure that preparatory work for the national colorectal screening programme takes place this year and in 2011 in order for screening to commence in early 2012 for men and women in the 60 to 69 age group.

The person does not need to have an enduring power of attorney or any other form of legal appointment in place in order to do this. This authority is set out in primary legislation; a fact which should be recognised by financial institutions when a person is compiling the documentation required to support an application.The issue of a person obtaining bank and credit union statements in respect of another extends far beyond the scope of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme. The requirement to provide evidence of income/assets applies in respect of means-tested schemes generally, including those operated by the Department of Social Protection. To this end, the Deputy may wish to note that the Department of Social Protection provides for the appointment of an agent where a person is unable to manage their own financial affairs. It is likely that anyone who needs assistance applying for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme would already have an agent in place to assist with the collection of their pension and the management of their financial affairs.

In assessing eligibility, the HSE must have regard to the overall financial situation of the applicant and his/her spouse and dependants.  The HSE has guidelines to assist its staff in assessing the financial situation of applicants.  Under the current guidelines, the Pension Levy payable by public servants is not deductible from gross income for assessment purposes.My Department is currently reviewing the legislation relating to eligibility for health and personal social services with a view to making the system as fair and transparent as possible.  As part of this exercise, a review of the eligibility criteria for medical cards is being undertaken.  This includes consideration of assessable income and outgoings.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	899	I accept that it is inappropriate to admit children to units providing care and treatment to adults but I recognise that in the absence of an alternative, such admissions are sometimes necessary for the safety and treatment of the child.  In arriving at a decision to admit a child to an adult unit, due consideration is given to the risks to the child of not admitting him / her, and the potential adverse effects of such an admission.  The Mental Health Commission has issued a code of practice relating to the admission of children under the Mental Health Act 2001 which outlines arrangements and facilities that should be put in place to ensure the protection and safety of such children.  An addendum to this code of practice was issued by the Commission in June 2009 which provides that: a) No child under 16 years is to be admitted to an adult unit in an approved centre from 1st July 2009; b) No child under 17 years is to be admitted to an adult unit in an approved centre from 1st December 2010; and c) No child under 18 years is to be admitted to an adult unit in an approved centre from 1st December 2011.I am confident that the addendum to the code of practice coupled with recent developments in the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) will ensure that going forward, the number of children admitted to adult  facilities will reduce significantly, and in due course be eliminated.  In this regard the development of CAMHS is a priority for the HSE.  There are now 55 consultant led child and adolescent teams in place throughout the country and a further 8 teams are in development.  During 2009 the bed capacity for children and adolescents almost doubled, bringing the total number of in-patient beds to 30.  Construction is almost complete on two purpose built 20-bed units in Cork and Galway and work commenced recently on the Linn Dara, Child and Adolescent Facility at Cherry Orchard, which will provide a day hospital as well as accommodation for mental health teams and administrative staff, and training and library facilities.In October 2009, the HSE launched the first annual report on CAMHS which provides comprehensive data on activity in the CAMHS services.  The HSE now has baseline information which can be built on to improve performance and to assist in decisions regarding how mental health services are developed into the future.  The appointment by the HSE of an Assistant National Director as national lead on Mental Health in November, 2009, is key to ensuring that the delivery of mental health services is in line with legislation and Government policy.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	917	In the process of re-negotiating the bilateral agreement on inter-country adoption with Vietnam serious issues came to light in relation to the Vietnamese adoption process. The issues were contained in the report on inter-country adoption commissioned by UNICEF and the Vietnamese Ministry of Justice and carried out by International Social Services (ISS).  An earlier report published last August by the Vietnamese Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA) was also considered in this regard. The UNICEF/ISS report, which was accepted by the Vietnamese Government, "proposes that Vietnam suspends inter-country adoptions for the necessary period during the year 2010 that will enable it to ensure optimal implementation of the Hague Convention and to prepare for the entry into force of the new law on adoption in 2011".  The Report also raises serious questions regarding adoption practices in Vietnam, including as follows:(a) inter-country adoptions from Vietnam are essentially influenced by foreign demand, i.e. the availability of children who are "adoptable" abroad corresponds more to the existence of foreign prospective adopters than to the actual needs of "abandoned" and orphaned children;(b) the circumstances under which babies become "adoptable" are invariably unclear and disturbing;(c) the inter-country adoption system is grounded in a remarkably unhealthy relationship between the mediating agencies and specific residential facilities; and(d) Governments and central authorities of "receiving countries" collectively at least, and individually in many instances have not effectively committed themselves to applying the basic principles of the Hague Convention or the recommendations of the treaty's practical operation, in their dealings with Vietnam.Having considered the contents of the two reports the Government decided, on 13th of January, to suspend indefinitely negotiations on a new bilateral inter-country adoption agreement with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.  As a result of this decision, all inter-country adoptions from Vietnam will be suspended until such time as the Adoption Bill 2009 has been enacted and both Ireland and Vietnam have ratified the provisions of the Hague Convention.

This unit provides services directly to adoptees, natural mothers and birth families.  It also works closely with the registered adoption societies and the HSE nationwide information and tracing services.  Improvements to this service have been effected by the computerisation of the unique adoption files held by the Board.The National Adoption Contact Register was established in 2005 to assist adopted people and their natural families to make contact with each other, exchange information or state their contact preferences.  They decide, through a range of information and contact options, how to proceed.  Already 440 matches have been made on the Register representing over 900 individuals who have now received a service.  The operation of the Register was reviewed in 2007 and a major upgrading of it has recently been completed.The Adoption Board, together with the societies, the HSE and the support groups, developed the "Standardised Framework for the Provision of a National Information and Tracing Service".  This framework was published in November 2007. It sets standards and provides guidance and advice for information and tracing services providers nationally. The standardised Framework is currently being piloted nationally. In relation to Information and Tracing for persons adopted from abroad, the Adoption Board is undertaking a process, with Romanian authorities initially, to determine how best to address the needs of those adopted from abroad.Registration of domestic adoptions is governed by Section 22 of the Adoption Act 1952.  Under that provision, an tArd Chlaraitheoir (Registrar General) is required to maintain a register of domestic adoptions (i.e. adoptions effected in Ireland, regardless of where the adopted person was born).  The register is called the Adopted Children Register.  An index to the register is maintained and can be searched by any person.  Any person may obtain a copy of any entry in the register.  The legislation also provides for an index linking the birth entry in the register of births (in the case of an Irish-born adopted person) with the entry in the Adopted Children Register.  Information from this index may not be given to any person except by order of a court or the Adoption Board. I am aware that the treatment of adopted persons in this regard differs from the rest of the population but consideration of this issue must take place in the context of the complex legal, ethical and constitutional issues arising from the need to fairly balance the rights of all parties to the adoption process.During the Committee stage debate for the Adoption Bill I indicated my intention to bring forward legislation in this area. In this regard, the policy position is currently being assessed by my Office. Once this process is complete Government approval will be sought to commence the process of preparing legislation.

#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	933	In 2009 the Science Group of the European Alcohol and Health Forum, which was an independent group of scientists commissioned by the EU, published a report on alcohol marketing.  The Science Group stated that "the findings of the review are clear, namely that commercial communications increase the likelihood that adolescents will start to use alcohol and to drink more if they are already using alcohol."  Therefore, controlling the volume and placement of alcohol advertising or, indeed, the introduction of a ban on alcohol advertising would be expected to impact positively on the health effects and health care costs associated with the use and misuse of alcohol in Ireland.On 31st March, 2009 the Government agreed to include alcohol in a National Substance Misuse Strategy that would be coordinated jointly by the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs and my Department. A Steering Group has been established to develop the alcohol element of the National Substance Misuse Strategy.  It will base its recommendations on evidence based measures to deal with the significant public health issue of alcohol in areas such as supply, pricing, prevention, treatment and advertising. The Department's future policy in relation to alcohol advertising will be informed by the recommendations of the Steering Group. The Report of the Steering Group is expected to be submitted to Government by the end of the year.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	937	In 2005, as set out in the following table, there were six linear accelerators in St Luke's Hospital, Rathgar, four in Cork University Hospital (CUH) and three at Galway University Hospital (GUH).  At present, there are 15 linear accelerators in the public system; eight at St Luke's, four at CUH and three at GUH. The increase in capacity at St Luke's follows the commissioning of two new and two replacement linear accelerators in 2008, to provide interim capacity pending the roll-out of the National Plan for Radiation Oncology (NPRO).  Agreements are in place under which the National Cancer Control Programme purchases services for HSE patients from the south-east and the mid-west from private facilities in Waterford and Limerick.On completion of Phase 1 of the NPRO at the end of this year, radiation oncology services will be provided at new facilities in Beaumont and St James's Hospital, with four linear accelerators in each.  On completion of the two new facilities, some staff and resources from St Luke's will transfer to the new centres and the three facilities will form the St Luke's Radiation Oncology Network for Dublin Mid-Leinster and Dublin North-East. This will provide adequate capacity to deal with patient needs until at least 2015.  As regards the number of linear accelerators in the private system, this is a matter for the providers of those services.LocationNo. of Linear Accelerators 2005No. of Linear Accelerators 2010Phase 1 National Plan for Radiation Oncology (end 2010/early 2011)St Luke’s684*Galway University Hospital333Cork University Hospital444St James’s Hospital——4Beaumont Hospital——4*As the eight new linear accelerators in Beaumont and St James's are commissioned, older machines at St Luke's will be decommissioned, leaving a total of 12 linear accelerators in the St Luke's Radiation Oncology Network. This is a net increase of four on the current numbers.The NPRO provides for the national infrastructure for radiation oncology for the next 25 years.  A total of approximately €75.5m in capital funding will be spent by end 2010 on the NPRO. This includes the four linear accelerators provided for St Luke's in 2008, the new facilities at St James's and Beaumont Hospitals and preparations for Phase 2 of the Plan.On completion of the NPRO, it will provide a fully integrated national solution to deliver equity of access for patients irrespective of geographic location.  Phase 2 of the NPRO, presently under consideration, will be delivered through Public Private Partnership and will provide additional capacity at St James's and Beaumont Hospitals, GUH and CUH. Satellite centres will be developed at the Mid-Western Regional Hospital in Limerick and at Waterford Regional Hospital.  Details of additional linear accelerators or costs of these plans must remain confidential until completion of the procurement process for these facilities, which awaits the Government's consideration of the Public Sector Benchmark for the Plan.Government also agreed in 2005 that the best option for patients in the north west was to facilitate access for those patients to radiation oncology services as part of North/South cooperation on cancer. Accordingly, patients may be referred from Letterkenny General Hospital  in Donegal to Belfast City Hospital. Also, following the announcement of Minister McGimpsey of the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Northern Ireland of the provision of a satellite radiotherapy centre, linked to Belfast City Hospital, at Altnagelvin, I undertook to make a capital contribution towards the project in addition to meeting the ongoing costs of patients from the Republic. The business case for the project has been finalised and a decision is awaited from the Northern Ireland authorities. I understand that the facility is expected to be operational by 2015.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	942	I would first like to say that all incidents of this kind are serious and are treated as such.  They are distressing to the women and families involved and I wish to again express my sincerest sympathies to all of those that are affected.  On 7 August 2009, the Solicitors for this person wrote to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda seeking certain assurances about her care and other actions to be carried out by the hospital.  On the same day, the solicitors wrote a short letter to me enclosing a copy of that letter.  This was also copied to the CEO of the HSE and to the State Claims Agency.The case was handled by my Department in line with the Patient Safety Protocol which was adopted in September 2008.  The protocol deals with correspondence from patients, doctors, health service staff and solicitors.  It is managed by the Chief Medical Officer on my behalf as a medical assessment of any potential patient safety issue is required.  Both my Department and the hospital treated the letters with urgency.  Within one week the HSE responded to the solicitors and a further letter was sent on 24 August.  I was copied on both these letters.In line with the Protocol, my Department followed up by telephone and by letter with the HSE to determine if there were risk issues arising from their investigation of the case.  The HSE reviewed the case and confirmed that it had put a number of measures in place to ensure that the chances of making an error of this kind again are minimised.  The Chief Medical Officer was satisfied that the case had been dealt with appropriately by the HSE.  At the time of completion by April last, it was assessed that the review and follow up actions for patient safety had been put in place at the hospital.Measures put in place by the HSE in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, following this incident include:A policy was put in place to ensure that no patient is prescribed a drug to take prior to a D&C (Dilation and Curettage) until the diagnosis of ‘missed miscarriage' has been confirmed by a qualified sonographer through a second scan;A "split" examination couch was put in place in the unit to facilitate the scanning procedure;The scan machine that was in use in the hospital was replaced;In July of this year a dedicated qualified sonographer will be assigned from 9.00 to 13.00;The adjacent rooms/offices of the Gynaecological ward are used to speak privately with women and their partners.A number of actions have been agreed by the HSE in conjunction with my Department to ensure the safe management of early pregnancy loss across the country.  The HSE is in the process of initiating a review of cases over the past five years to determine the number of patients who were recommended drug or surgical treatment when the diagnosis of miscarriage was made in error, and where subsequent information demonstrated that the pregnancy was viable. The terms for the conduct of the review are being finalised at present and will be made public very shortly.  At that stage the HSE will be in a position to provide an indicative timeline for the completion of the review.

However the Deputy may wish to note that The Eating Disorders Network Programme, a CAWT (Co-operation and Working Together) initiative, has received funding of Stg£2.5million from the European Union.  As well as providing 12 whole time equivalent eating disorders practitioners, the project will improve the quality of care pathways for people with eating disorders, raise awareness and develop skills to improve therapeutic capacity and build carer support group capacity within communities in the border region.  A Project Manager has now been appointed and a cross border clinical pathways working group established.I regret that due to the current industrial action in the Health Service Executive I am not in a position to provide a substantive response to the remainder of the questions.

Subject to this approval, I will publish the General Scheme of a Human Tissue Bill.  Two separate but related public consultations took place in 2009 to inform the preparation of the draft legislation.  The first was a consultation process on consent for organ donation which took place between January and March 2009.  Invitations for written submissions were complemented by a consultative forum which took place in February in Dublin Castle.  The second public consultation was in relation to proposals for a General Scheme of a Human Tissue Bill which took place between April and May 2009.  Information on these consultations is available on the Department's website.  Consultations with Government Departments and Offices are on-going and the draft General Scheme of a Human Tissue Bill will be further developed based on the outcome of the consultations.

While some centres have decided to close for various reasons since the introduction of the new regime only one home has been deregistered.  In this regard, pursuant to Sections 59 and 60 of the  Health Act 2007, an ex parte interim order was made by the District Court in Bray, Co. Wicklow on 29 March 2010 cancelling the registration of Glenbervie Nursing Home, Sidmonton Road, Bray, Co. Wicklow as a designated centre under part 8 of the Health Act 2007, with effect from 30 March 2010.   The service provider decided not to contest the decision and the order was confirmed as final and permanent pursuant to Section 61(3)(a) of the Act on 23 April 2010.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	955	The Government's decision to limit the funding available to the Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS) was made in view of the current position of the public finances and the 60% increase in expenditure in the DTSS over the past five years.  The Health Service Executive (HSE) has introduced measures to contain DTSS expenditure at the 2008 level of approximately €63 million.Under the new measures the range of treatments available are being prioritised. Some treatments which had previously been available in the Scheme, for example, dental cleaning and polishing have been suspended.  Other treatments, such as oral examinations and fillings, will continue to be provided but will be limited in number or frequency. More complex, non-routine treatments, such as protracted periodontal treatments, will be available only in the case of clinical emergencies. While I understand that the suspension or reduction in some services will cause difficulties for some patients it is important that those with greatest need take priority.  These measures have been introduced to protect access to emergency dental care for medical card holders and to safeguard services for children and special needs groups. The HSE will monitor the ongoing effect of these changes from a clinical and budgetary perspective. The dental and oral health services currently provided through the HSE Public Dental Service will not be affected by these changes to the DTSS.

The regulations, which have national application, generally limit the use of bus lanes to buses and, in the case of with-flow bus lanes, to cyclists also.  The key consideration underpinning the current policy is that bus lanes are provided to support and promote bus-based public transport and to protect the carrying capacity of bus lanes so as to optimise journey times for the members of the public who use that mode of transport.Taxis are available for hire on-street to the public at large and are regarded as being an element of the public transport service and are, accordingly, permitted to use with-flow bus lanes.  I have no proposals to extend further the types of vehicles permitted to use bus lanes.

Comprehensive information with regard to the visa application process is available on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (www.inis.gov.ie).The provision of a multiple entry visa is available to applicants in certain circumstances.  It is not the general practice of the Visa Office to issue multiple journey visas unless a compliant travel history to Ireland in the recent past has been shown.  That being said it is open to an applicant to seek a multiple entry visa in circumstances where there is no previous travel history to the State.  Essentially the onus rests with the applicant to establish to the satisfaction of the Visa Officer as to why a multiple entry visa is warranted.

A non EEA national who wishes to reside in the State on the basis of their marriage to an Irish national must make an application for permission to remain in the State. There is presently no legislative basis for this process pending the implementation of the revised Immigration Bill.There are currently two routes in which a non EEA national can apply for temporary permission to reside in the State on the basis of marriage to an Irish national.1. If they are a non visa required national who has entered the State legally within the last 90 days or if they are a visa required national and they are within the period of permission to remain granted to them on arrival in the State (except short stay ‘c' visas) or if they have current permission to remain in the State on an alternative basis both the applicant and their Irish national spouse should attend at their local Garda National Immigration Bureau Registration Office with the following documentation: original marriage certificate; original passport; Irish spouse's original passport and birth certificate; and evidence of their joint address.2. If they do not have current permission to remain in the State a written application must be made to the following address:  Spouse of Irish National Unit, Immigration Services Section, Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, 1st Floor, 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2.The following original documentation should be included with their application; details of their immigration history in this State; their current legal status; original marriage certificate detailed information regarding their relationship history and the context in which their marriage took place; evidence of their current address of their joint habitual residence; original passport and birth certificate; Irish spouse's original passport and birth certificate; divorce papers from applicant (if applicable); other supporting documentation — photographs; and accommodation details: Rent Book, Joint Tenancy Agreement/Proof of Home Ownership, Utility Bills, Financial Statements, letter from Community Welfare Officer/Social Worker or Tax Credit form from the Revenue Commissioners.Information detailing the requirements for such applications can be found on the INIS website — www.inis.gov.ie — by selecting Immigration and then Spouse of an Irish National.

This target group is the clear policy priority.  Phasing the expansion of vetting is necessary to prevent an unmanageable surge in vetting application numbers. This expansion will continue on a phased basis until vetting is provided for all personnel working in a full-time, part-time and/or voluntary capacity with children and/or vulnerable adults.In this context, any organisation seeking the services of the GCVU should contact it with a view to registering with it.

The scheme provides for compensation for the family of a deceased member where death resulted from malicious injury. It also provides a mechanism for a member to apply to my Department for authorisation for cases of malicious injury of a non-minor nature to be assessed by the High Court and  provides for compensation to a member for a malicious injury of a minor nature where the duty being performed involved special risk.There has been a shared view for some time that the existing scheme needs to be replaced with a more efficient process. The scheme, whereby all cases must go to the High Court, is liable to delays and high legal costs, and lacks facilities to settle claims in an efficient manner consistent with recent developments in processing personal injury claims.The State Claims Agency recently submitted proposals for an alternative scheme.  My Department is currently considering these with Garda management and in consultation with the Garda associations.   The objective of the proposals is to establish a more cost effective compensation scheme which will deal with compensation claims for malicious injuries in a timely and efficient manner and to the satisfaction of all interested parties. It is my intention, on the conclusion of these discussions, to bring forward proposals for implementing legislative measures.

I am now advised by the Garda authorities that as on June 10 Garda National Drugs Unit records show that a total of 48 head shops are now operating nationwide. Information in relation to their location by Garda Division is set out in the table below.I am assured that this situation is being closely monitored by the Commissioner, his senior management team, and the Detective Chief Superintendent of the Garda National Drugs Unit.In addition, the Deputy will be aware of my legislative proposals in relation to outlawing the sale of psychotropic substances.

It is the case that there has been a consistent increase in the total prisoner population over recent years.  This situation is particularly apparent over the past 12 months during which time the total number in custody has increased by 345.  This represents a rise of approximately 9%  in the numbers in custody.The Irish Prison Service has been engaged in an extensive programme of investment in prisons infrastructure which has involved both the modernisation of the existing estate and the provision of extra prison spaces.  Since 1997 in excess of 1,720 new prison spaces have come on stream in the prison system.  These include the new prisons in Castlerea, the Midlands, Cloverhill, the Dóchas Centre and new accommodation in Limerick, Portlaoise and Castlerea prisons and at the open centres in Shelton Abbey and Loughan House.Current projects will see a further 200 prison spaces provided in the short term by means of a new block in Wheatfield. In addition, we hope to proceed in late 2010 with a new accommodation block in the Portlaoise/Midlands prisons complex which will provide 300 prison spaces in the medium term. Also In the medium term, work is due to commence on converting an administrative building on the Dóchas site into a new accommodation block.  This will provide 30 rooms with sufficient area to double up, if required, and is due to be completed by September/October 2010.The Deputy will also be aware of the Government's commitment to developing a new prison campus at Thornton Hall, County Dublin. The new prison facility will have approximately 1,400 cells on a 130 acre site. The new prison facility will have operational flexibility to accommodate up to 2,200 in a range of security settings.The development is now proceeding on a phased basis with phase one comprising essential enabling works required for the development including the construction of the dedicated access road, perimeter wall and off-site services. Tenders for the construction of the access road were published in March of this year and tenders for the construction of the perimeter wall will be published in September.Phase 2 will include the development of the main prison campus. The detailed appraisal is underway in accordance with Department of Finance Capital Expenditure Guidelines and the new business case is at an advanced stage of preparation.

The average processing time from application to decision is now at 26 months.  More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale.  Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that further processing of the application is ongoing and the file will be submitted to me for a decision in due course.The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks. There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.

The average processing time from application to decision is now at 26 months.  More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale.  However, I understand that the person concerned is a refugee.  In accordance with the Government's obligations under the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, every effort is made to ensure that applications from persons with refugee status are dealt with as quickly as possible.The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks.  There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.

The person in question did not subsequently renew their permission to reside in the State on that basis prior to its expiry date.  This permission has now lapsed.The INIS informs me that no application for a Stamp 4 registration has been received to date from the person concerned on the basis of being married to an Irish national.I am advised that the person concerned can make an application for residency in writing on the basis of marriage to an Irish national to the Spouse of Irish National Unit, Immigration Services Section, Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2.Information detailing the requirements for such applications can be found on the INIS website — www.inis.gov.ie — by selecting Immigration and then Spouse of an Irish National.

On the basis of her parentage of an Irish born child, she was granted permission to remain in the State in May 2001.  This permission to remain in the State has been extended to 2011.The second applicant referred to by the Deputy arrived in the State on 2 March 2007 on foot of a C-Visit Visa for a short term visit and was granted permission to remain in the State until 1 June 2007.  On 23 May 2007, the applicant applied for an extension to his permission to remain in the State.  This application was refused on 30 May 2007 and upheld on appeal on 1 August 2007.  Subsequently, following the consideration of the case under Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement, a Deportation Order was signed in respect of the second applicant concerned on 20 August, 2009.The applicants concerned initiated Judicial Review Proceedings in the High Court on 15 September, 2009 challenging the decision to make a Deportation Order.  As these proceedings are ongoing, the matter is sub judice and it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this case at this time.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	1006	I propose to take Questions Nos. 346 and 349 together.The detection and investigation of criminal offences concerning child pornography is a matter for An Garda Síochána. I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Unit operating within the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation has responsibility for tackling this form of crime.  The Office for Internet Safety (OIS) is an Executive Office within my Department and has responsibility for promoting internet safety, particularly for children and young people.  The Office has a role in considering measures to address illegal and harmful content on the internet, including child pornography.  The OIS is advised by an Internet Safety Advisory Council, comprised of key stakeholders in the statutory, industry and community sectors.The internet is a worldwide phenomenon with no borders and no single organisation controlling it.  There is, however, an existing  self-regulatory framework for internet service providers (ISPs) in Ireland which actively encourages the adoption of best practice procedures aimed at limiting the proliferation of illegal child pornography content online.  Members of the public may report such material to the Internet Service Providers' Association of Ireland (ISPAI)'s www.hotline.ie service.  If the material is hosted here and deemed to be illegal, ISPAI members are obliged to remove such materials.  If the material is hosted in another jurisdiction, it is notified to the internet hotline in that jurisdiction and/or to relevant law enforcement agencies for follow up, with the aim of having illegal content taken down.In a number of EU Member States (the UK, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands), a system of internet blocking/filtering has been introduced on a voluntary basis, whereby a "blocklist" of sites containing child pornography is made available by the police or other competent authorities, and is utilised by individual Internet Service Providers to prevent access to such content. A number of other Member States (Germany, France) have introduced or are considering the introduction of legislation requiring ISPs to block access to websites containing child pornography.  It is generally acknowledged that all such internet blocking or filtering systems are not foolproof and can be circumvented in certain circumstances. However, such filtering systems are understood to be useful in preventing internet users from inadvertently encountering such illegal content.At present all of the mobile phone operators in Ireland, under a voluntary agreement brokered by the European Commission with the GSM Alliance Europe (association representing European Mobile Phone Operators), implement a form of filtering on their mobile internet service, which prevents access to websites which have been identified as containing child pornography content.This issue of the possible utilisation of blocking/filtering methodologies to prevent access to identified web pages containing child pornography is being considered further by the Office for Internet Safety with advice from the Internet Safety Advisory Council.  In undertaking research in this area, the Office for Internet Safety has had discussions with a variety of relevant interests in relation to the possibility of introducing internet filtering, specifically in respect of illegal child pornography content, in Ireland.  However, I should make it clear that no decisions have been arrived at on this issue of internet filtering/blocking at national level.  Any proposals for introducing such a system would need, at the very least, to be submitted to Government for consideration.  The introduction of any such system, particularly if on a mandatory basis, may require the introduction of primary legislation.However, a draft proposal for a Directive on combating the sexual abuse, sexual exploitation of children and child pornography was published recently by the European Commission.  The draft Directive contains a proposal to require Member States to implement some form of blocking system in relation to websites containing child pornography.  Ireland's participation in the adoption and implementation of this measure is subject to Government and Oireachtas approval.

All releases are subject to conditions, which in the vast majority of cases include a requirement that the individual report on a regular basis to his or her Garda station.  Any offender who breaches his or her conditions may be arrested and returned to prison immediately by An Garda Síochána.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	1008	I wish to advise the Deputy that neither my Department nor An Garda Síochána have any function in relation to the regulation of legal transactions in gold. Furthermore, the informal purchase of gold is not specifically regulated in criminal legislation.I am informed by the Garda Authorities that they are not aware of the involvement of any organised criminal group, in the sale or disposal of gold in the manner outlined at this time.  However, should An Garda Síochána become aware of such incidents they will be subject to investigation and on completion a file would be submitted to the Law Officers for consideration as to what charges, if any should be preferred.An Garda Síochána enforce the provisions of the criminal law in respect of theft and robbery, including theft and robbery of jewellery and precious metals.  While the informal purchase of gold is not specifically regulated, the circumstances under which gold is being bought or sold may indicate the commission of certain offences, for example the handling of stolen property and or the possession of stolen property, which are offences under sections 17 and 18 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001 respectively.  If members of the public have suspicions that goods being sold or traded may have been stolen, the correct action is for these suspicions to be referred to An Garda Síochána for investigation.

Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that further processing of both applications is ongoing and the files will be submitted to me for a decision in due course.The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks.  There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	1013	I was very concerned to hear of the death in unexplained circumstances on 2 June in the Democratic Republic of the Congo of Mr Floribert Chebeya Bahizire, executive director of the organisation "La Voix des Sans Voix" (Voice of the Voiceless). The discovery two days later of the body of Mr Fidele Bazana Edadi, Mr Chebeya's colleague and driver, was reason for further concern. Mr Chebeya was a leading defender of human rights, who had worked for years on promoting human rights and democracy in the DRC. Mr. Chebeya had been arrested, detained and threatened by security forces numerous times over the past two decades on account of his advocacy work.Mr Chebeya was last heard from on the evening of June 1, when he indicated that he and Mr Bazana were en route to a meeting with the Inspector General of the Congolese National Police, who had reportedly summoned him. His body was found tied up in the back seat of his car on a road to the west of Kinshasa the following day. The European Union, the United States and the United Nations immediately called for an impartial and transparent inquiry into the matter. The same day, the Government of the DRC launched an official inquiry and subsequently announced the suspension of several police officers, including the chief of police.Ireland also raised our concerns over the deaths at the Human Rights Council in Geneva on 8 June, echoing the call that the investigation be impartial and transparent. We have subsequently heard that the Government of the DRC has agreed in principle to the offer from the Dutch Government of a team of forensic experts to assist in determining the cause of the deaths. While this particular incident has not been discussed at the level of the Council of Ministers, the European Union remains very concerned about the killings of other human rights defenders in the DRC in recent years. Congolese human rights groups remain particularly vulnerable to harassment, arbitrary arrest and detention, and other abuses by security forces. Human rights and the cause of human rights defenders occupy a very important place in Ireland's foreign policy. We will continue to work with our partners in the EU, and the wider international community, to support the work of the individuals who put their lives at risk in defence of others, in the DRC and elsewhere.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	1014	Ireland and its E.U. partners have been seriously concerned about human rights violations in Iran for many years. In the past year, these concerns have been greatly increased by Iran's large-scale actions to repress dissent. These measures include executions, arrests and actions against free speech, such as closing newspapers, blocking websites and arresting contributors to websites of Iranian human rights organisations. Iran's rate of executions has risen in the past year and the Iranian authorities appear to be using the death penalty as a method of discouraging further dissent.I took the opportunity to raise the issue of human rights in Iran with Foreign Minister Mottaki in Dublin last week. During our meeting, I outlined Ireland and the EU's serious concerns about human rights in Iran, particularly the extensive use of the death penalty in Iran, and referred to the apparently imminent executions of a further group of detainees. I also took the opportunity to raise a number of specific human rights cases with Foreign Minister Mottaki, including the ongoing trial and imprisonment of the seven detained Baha'i community leaders. I have raised human rights issues with Minister Mottaki on many previous occasions. Ireland will continue to take suitable opportunities to raise Iranian human rights issues in our bilateral contacts, at EU level, at the UN General Assembly and in the UN Human Rights Council.The Deputy has also raised the situation in Camp Ashraf in Iraq which is home to over three thousand members of the People's Mujahedin of Iran (PMOI), an Iranian opposition group that established itself in Iraq in 1986 at the invitation of Saddam Hussein. The Government does not regard the PMOI/NCRI as representative of any substantial body of opinion in Iran, and has no dealings with it. I would further add that the mass public protests demanding reform in Iran in the past year are not connected with the NCRI.I have outlined my views on the situation in Camp Ashraf in Iraq, specifically in a written response given on 21 October 2009. This is a separate matter, not connected with human rights issues in Iran. I have made clear that it is incumbent upon the Iraqi authorities to ensure the safety and well-being of those Iranian exiles still living in Camp Ashraf and to prevent the recurrence of violence such as that which took place in July 2009. It is also critical that there must be no question of a forcible return to Iran of the residents of the Camp. The Iraqi Government has stated so far that they have no intention of doing this.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	1015	I am very much aware of the difficulties confronting undocumented Irish citizens in the United States and the distress which both they and their families in the US and Ireland experience arising from their situation. I would urge anybody who might be tempted in the current economic climate to follow in the footsteps of the undocumented to take account of the plight in which they now find themselves.Finding a solution for our undocumented citizens in the United States continues to be an important priority for this Government. We are also committed to enhancing our bilateral migration arrangements with the US through the establishment of a reciprocal two year renewable visa scheme, known as the E3 visa, and the further development of the recently agreed working holiday programme.Over the last 12 months my Department, and the Embassy in Washington in particular, has worked proactively with the US Administration and Congressional leaders to achieve positive progress on this important issue. The status of the undocumented can only be changed by virtue of legislation passed by both Houses of Congress in the US — it is not merely a matter of bilateral engagement between the two Governments.During our St Patrick's Day visit Washington, the Taoiseach and I took the opportunity to discuss immigration reform and the plight of the undocumented Irish in our meetings with President Obama, Secretary of State Clinton and leading members of Congress. As part of his St Patrick's Day address, President Obama offered an assurance that his own commitment to comprehensive immigration reform remains unwavering.President Obama has since reiterated this commitment to immigration reform, and has welcomed what he has described as the "strong proposal" for reform presented at the end of April by senior Democratic Senators Harry Reid, Charles Schumer, and Robert Menendez.The Democratic Senators' outline legislative proposal draws on the draft framework for action on immigration published in March by Senator Lindsay Graham and Senator Charles Schumer. This bipartisan proposal included provision for a path towards legalisation for the undocumented, including the Irish, provided they first admit to having violated US laws, undertake the repayment of taxes and perform community service.This outline legislation also specifically mentions an E-3 visa arrangement for Irish citizens. Although the proposal is only the first step in a long process, the inclusion of an Irish E3 scheme at this initial stage is an important achievement for the Government and the Irish community.While I am encouraged by these developments and also by the efforts which continue to be made on Capitol Hill to resolve this issue, very considerable political challenges remain, particularly in an election year.The Government will continue to maintain very close contact with the US Administration and Congress, as well as with Irish community advocates, to address this issue in the period ahead. Through the Emigrant Support Programme, we have provided $285,000 to the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, since 2006, to assist with their lobbying efforts. In 2009, we also provided $10,000 to the Chicago Celts for Immigration Reform.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	1016	Colombia has witnessed the longest period of upheaval of any country in Latin America — over 50 years in all. The Colombian people have endured relentless suffering, reflected in the more than two million persons who have been internally displaced over the past number of years, a number second only to that of Sudan. The degree of lawlessness that arises from the absence of peace presents a major challenge to any government. The effects of terrorism and narco-trafficking have blighted the lives of many innocent people. The indictment of a large number of senators for association with the FARC, ELN and AUC illustrates the extent of the problems facing the Government.Compared with the situation ten years ago, Colombia today has become a safer place to live. Colombians' belief in the prospects for a peaceful future and the impressive recent social and economic development reflected in the strong inward investment flows reinforce the impression that the country is slowly emerging from a grim past. There is no single solution for promoting peace in Colombia. The various social and economic elements underlying the conflict have to be tackled simultaneously. Our approach, and that of the European Union, is to assist and influence the Colombian Government in a manner that results in economic and social development while progressively improving human rights standards.The Government of Colombia has repeatedly stated its determination to bring an end to violence within the framework of the Justice and Peace Law, passed in 2005, which provides an overall legal framework for the demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration of illegal armed groups into Colombian society. The Irish Government has given both moral and financial support to the implementation of the Justice and Peace Law. In addition, in May of this year, funding of €100,000 was approved for a victim support project being organised by the Organisation of American States in three regions of Colombia. This project will train victims to allow them to participate effectively in the judicial process and to access reparation; create awareness among local authorities so as to assist in the reintegration of victims in their communities and establish confidence-building measures between communities and local authorities.The Government will continue to monitor the situation in Colombia through our Embassy in Mexico City, which is accredited to Colombia, as well as in cooperation with our EU partners with resident diplomatic missions in that country. We are fully supportive of efforts to bring a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Colombia, and will continue to support the Government of Colombia in its search for a negotiated solution to the internal armed conflict. In conjunction with our EU partners, the Irish government will continue to examine how we may, as appropriate, contribute to the peace process in Colombia.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	1017	Together with its EU partners, Ireland attaches considerable importance to achieving stability in the Western Balkans. A significant factor in building this is the EU perspective of the countries in the region. The June 2003 European Council in Thessalonika agreed that the future of the countries of the Western Balkans was in the EU.The European Union's Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) process provides the framework for cooperation on economic, political and legal matters aimed at bringing the Western Balkan countries towards EU standards and principles in order to meet EU accession requirements.The General Affairs Council (GAC) of 7/8 December 2009 considered the Commission's comprehensive report of 14 October 2009 on progress made in Serbia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as Kosovo. The Council reaffirmed its full support for the European perspective of these Western Balkan countries, which remains essential for stability and reconciliation in the region. The Council stated that, by making solid progress in economic and political reform and by fulfilling the necessary conditions and requirements, the remaining potential candidates in the Western Balkans should achieve candidate status, according to their own merits.Cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) is a precondition for all the States of the region in their Stabilisation and Association Agreements with the EU. Having considered the Chief Prosecutor's report on Serbia's cooperation with the Tribunal, the December Council decided by consensus to implement the Interim Agreement with Serbia, which covers the trade aspects of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA). The Council further agreed to turn to the issue of ratification of the SAA in six months' time.Serbia has made some significant conciliatory gestures recently and this deserves acknowledgement. Notable amongst these was the declaration by the Serbian Parliament in March condemning the Srebrenica massacre. Relations between Serbia and Bosnia Herzegovina have also improved of late, with the assistance of Turkey as facilitator. In February, Bosnia appointed an Ambassador to Serbia for the first time in three years. Serbia is very important in terms of encouraging constructive reform in Bosnia and Herzegovina and elsewhere in the broader region.The Foreign Affairs Council of 14 June heard a further assessment on Serbia's cooperation with the ICTY. Ministers agreed to submit the Stabilisation and Association Agreement to their national parliaments for ratification. The Council underlined that full cooperation with the ICTY remains a central element of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement process.Ireland will continue to monitor developments on this issue. Together with our EU partners we remain committed to influencing positively the situation in the Western Balkans. We will do everything possible to ensure lasting stability in the countries of the region.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	1018	Since 2007, the Government has allocated over €2.6 billion in funding under Vote 29 (International Cooperation) of the Department of Foreign Affairs. The Department, through Irish Aid, administers the Government's aid programme, which has a clear focus on the reduction of poverty and hunger, especially in the poorest countries of sub-Saharan Africa.In addition to the programme budgets in Ireland's nine priority countries, where we have a commitment to long term strategic assistance, Irish Aid channels funding through a range of partners. These include multilateral organisations, development Non-governmental Organisations (NGOs) and missionaries. Funding for NGOs represents over 20% of expenditure under Vote 29 annually and it is administered through a number of schemes which cover long term development work, development education and emergency and recovery. A large number of applications for funding is received by Irish Aid, on an ongoing basis, from civil society organisations and individuals.In view of the number of applications received under the different headings over the past three years, I propose to write to the Deputy providing as much detail as is possible for the years 2007, 2008 and 2009. The information for 2010 is not yet available. I will also provide the Deputy with copies of the Irish Aid Annual Reports for 2007 and 2008, which contain detail on the number and type of successful applications for those years. The Annual Report for 2009 will be published in the coming months.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	1019	Ireland's strategy to deal with disability in international development is guided by the White Paper on Irish Aid which recognises the inter-relationship between poverty and disability. Disabled people are more vulnerable to poverty and its effects and poor people are more at risk of becoming disabled through, for example, unsafe living environments; undernutrition; lack of access to immunisation; exposure to landmines; poor road safety; contracting communicable diseases and inadequate treatment when infected and through unsafe birthing services that disable both mothers and newborns that survive.Ireland's development cooperation programme mainstreams disability and embraces the World Health Organisation's concept of disability as a complex phenomenon, which requires action across a diverse range of activities in order that disability is effectively prevented and to ensure that disabled people are not excluded or exploited. Also we work to ensure, where possible, that services are provided to assist disabled people to deal with their particular disabilities and the limitations associated with these.Since 2007, Ireland's investment of over €100 million each year in health, HIV and communicable diseases, focussing on the world's poorest countries, is a substantial contribution to prevention of disability by making essential first-line services, vaccines and commodities available. Further, by providing these peripheral primary services, disabled people have better access to care.Ireland's support to basic education in developing countries emphasises access by disabled and marginalised people and through support for better governance in its Programme Countries, we advocate for stronger voice and representation by marginalised and excluded groups, including disabled people and those caring for the disabled.Ireland also provides support to programmes that directly assist disabled people and their carers to deal with disabilities and its consequences. This is mainly delivered as support to Non-government Organisations through the Civil Society Fund. Support for disability work amounted to 6.4% of this fund in 2007, 7.9% in 2008 and 7.4% in 2009. Furthermore, Ireland supports Concern, Goal, Trócaire, Christian Aid and Self Help Africa, all of which undertake health and human rights work that benefits disabled people and this work accounts for approximately 30% of their budgets.Additionally, Irish Aid has a major programme and partnership with the International Labour Organisation which focuses on assisting people with disability and advocating on legislation for disability in Africa. This programme also focuses on assisting people with disability to gain employment and set up their own businesses. There is also a particular emphasis on disabled women. This programme has gained an enviable international reputation and is a flagship programme of its kind.As a mainstreamed issue, it is not possible to present a specific amount of spending on disability as a percentage of overall Irish Aid funding. However I am arranging to have a list of discrete disability projects and programmes for 2009 sent to the Deputy. The full list for 2007 and 2008 are outlined in the Annual Reports for those years which have been placed in the Dáil Library.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	1021	I propose to take Questions Nos. 364 and 373 together.As part of the ongoing programme of value for money and policy reviews being carried out on my Department's programmes and schemes, an evaluation is currently underway on Leveraged Expenditure under both the CLÁR and RAPID Programmes. I expect that this study will be completed by the end of this year.In addition, a review of the Rural Social Scheme was put in train by the then Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. When the proposed transfer of functions to the Department of Social Protection takes place in relation to the Rural Social Scheme, it will be a matter for that Department to complete the review and, accordingly, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment as to when the work might be completed.

Officials in my Department are currently evaluating the Scheme and the organisations currently being supported are being consulted as part of the review process. On the basis of the findings of the review, I will consider the options available to me regarding the future of the Scheme. All organisations involved in the Scheme, including the one referred to by the Deputy, are being consulted as part of the review process.As the Deputy is aware, Departments are currently preparing their initial estimates for 2011.  While at this stage I cannot give a commitment to any individual organisation, I will be endeavouring to make the best possible use of the resources available.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	1024	As the Deputy is aware, the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme and the Community Development Programme were my Department's two main social inclusion/community development programmes. These came to an end on 31 December last and have been superseded by a new integrated programme, the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP). A key difference between the new LCDP and its predecessor programmes is the fact that, when fully implemented, it will be delivered nationally on an integrated basis by a reduced number of companies.It is important to note that, despite what is stated by some community development projects (CDPs) and by others, integration does not mean closure of a CDP or the cessation of CDP activities in any given area. As has been stated previously, any worthwhile community development activity or service delivered under the CDP can continue to be delivered under the new LCDP and by the same staff who currently do this work.  Of course, CDPs may opt out of the LCDP integration process and decide to go it alone. In such cases, my Department will be supportive in relation to the retention of any assets acquired with programme funding and may also be in a position to provide for some limited funding for a transition period, subject to certain conditions.My Department has set out a model involving full integration of CDPs with local development companies (LDCs), but has made it clear that other options can be considered and that it is not a question of ‘one size fits all'.  The only option not acceptable is one that seeks to preserve the status quo: some models proposed by CDPs and other parties in the period since the launch of the LCDP have had to be rejected on that basis. However, my Department has been able to respond positively to a number of other alternative models put forward by both LDCs and CDPs. While agreement has not yet been fully finalised in these cases, I am satisfied that the real possibility for agreement exists. Additional proposals from other CDPs and LDCs are also being considered positively but are less developed at this stage.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to respond positively to all constructive proposals that it receives and that my officials will continue to be available to meet with the boards of projects.My overall aim is to ensure that, notwithstanding the difficult budgetary position, disadvantaged communities will benefit from a more focused programme and better integrated actions. As previously indicated, my primary concern in this most difficult economic climate is to make every effort to ensure the front-line services provided by or supported through my Department, especially those focused on the needs of the most disadvantaged communities, are protected and to minimise overheads and ancillary costs.I am aware that some CDPs have a range of concerns about assets, the impact on local service delivery, local buy-in and accountability. However, I am confident that all of those issues can be addressed in the implementation process previously outlined by my Department and now under way. In this regard, an information session for stakeholders was held by Pobal, on my Department's behalf, on 10 June last.

This amount represents 55% of total eligible expenditure claimed, of which 45%, or €6,059,685.63, was provided by the Exchequer on a co-financing basis.  There are no funding requests currently outstanding. The next request for payment is scheduled for submission to the European Commission in July 2010.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	1027	My Department is responsible for the delivery of Axes 3 & 4 of the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 (RDP), for which overall funding of the order of €425m is available. The RDP allocation of €40m for 2010 represents an increase of approximately 120% on expenditure in 2009.The Deputy will appreciate that it is imperative, particularly in the current economic climate, that the RDP maximises the funding available for the programme on the ground, in order to ensure the improvement of the quality of life in rural areas and the diversification of the rural economy. In this regard, my Department is working very closely with individual local action groups to ensure the efficient and effective delivery of the programme. I am confident that groups will continue to serve their local communities by ensuring that all available funding is spent so as to maximise the impact of the programme in their areas.The table below details the funding delivered from my Department to date in 2010 to each Integrated Development Partnership under the RDP.  The Deputy should note that, in addition to the expenditure outlined in the table, a further €40 million approximately is committed to ongoing projects. It is anticipated that a significant number of these projects will be completed and draw down their funding during 2010.Integrated Development PartnershipFunding delivered to date 2010€Avondhu/Blackwater Partnership Limited226,223.46Ballyhoura Development Limited517,730.31Carlow County Development Partnership Limited167,475.11Cavan/Monaghan Area Partnership Limited203,462.76Clare Local Development Company Limited389,155.64Comhar na nOileán Teoranta122,535.65Donegal Local Development Company Limited326,304.37Fingal LEADER Partnership177,605.52FORUM Connemara131,616.20Galway Rural Development Company Limited211,647.19Inishowen Development Partnership108,670.52I.R.D.

The title of my Department has also changed to the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs with effect from 2 June 2010.  In relation to the issue of costs arising, it is not possible at this stage to quantify the amount in question. I can confirm, however, to the Deputy that it is my intention that stationery currently held by my Department will be used to the greatest extent feasible.  I have also directed my officials to ensure that any costs arising due to the name change of my Department are kept to a minimum and are met from within existing resources.

Where a death is referred to a coroner, section 41 of the Act provides that the coroner shall give the appropriate registrar a certificate containing the required particulars of the death concerned and that registrar shall register the death based on the information contained in the certificate.The particulars required to register a death are set out in Part 5 of the First Schedule to the Act. The Schedule sets out the maximum information that may be contained in an entry in relation to a death and, on occasion, there may be particulars that are simply not known or available to the qualified informant or to a coroner.  In cases where a death has been registered without one or more of the required particulars, it is open to any interested party, who has information relating to any omission from an entry, to apply to the Registrar General to complete the entry, pursuant to an enquiry conducted under the provisions of section 65 of the Act.

The Commission on Taxation has recommended a further widening of the PRSI base so that unearned income such as investment income, rental income and share based remuneration should be subject to PRSI.In regard to unearned income at present, self employed contributors pay PRSI on rental income at PRSI class S.  In addition, while employed contributors are not generally subject to PRSI on rental income, there is a liability where the individual concerned also has trade, professional or partnership income.  In these cases the individual is required to pay PRSI as a self employed contributor on rental income. On this basis a significant amount of rental income is already subject to PRSI.  Reckonable income in relation to a self-employed contributor is defined in section 2, as amended, of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 2005.

The scheme covers courses of education from second level to Higher Diploma level in any discipline [level 8 in the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ)] and to a Graduate Diploma in Education (Primary and Secondary Teaching; level 9 in NFQ) which add significantly to a person's employability.  Other postgraduate qualifications such as a Master's (level 9) or Doctoral degrees (level 10) are not included.A small number of cases have arisen where a college has granted an exemption from the requirement to hold a primary degree and has admitted a person to a Master's course on the basis of relevant life experience.  In the context of the ongoing review of the operation of the scheme, it was decided to extend entitlement to back to education allowance in these instances on an exceptional basis.The potential for further changes in certain areas was identified by my predecessor to the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs.  These concerned duration, access to post-graduate courses, appropriateness of courses and progression.  The final shape and scope of such changes are currently under consideration.  The nature and structure of the scheme will continue to be monitored in the context of the objectives of the scheme and changes in the economic climate.

The Department's relationship is with the tenant who makes the application for rent supplement and, in general, the payment is made to the tenant. Legislation does, however, provide for the making of a rent supplement payment to another person (e.g. a relative, a landlord or landlord's agent) on behalf of the tenant.  This type of arrangement can be put in place at the tenant's request, subject to the consent of the Community Welfare Officer.  The arrangement can be revoked at the tenant's request or withdrawn by the Community Welfare Officer.  Some twenty per cent of rent supplement payments are paid to a person other than the recipient.Where a Community Welfare Officer becomes aware that a person receiving rent supplement is not using that supplement for the purpose for which it is intended, payment of the supplement is suspended and the matter investigated. Any overpayment of rent supplement incurred in circumstances of this kind may be recoverable from the tenant. Where a landlord has a grievance in relation to the non-payment of rent by a tenant, s/he may apply to the Private Residential Tenancies Board to have the dispute resolved through the Board's dispute resolution process.

Payment of a non-contributory pension, which is a means tested pension, is not normally paid to people who reside outside the State. However for those living in Northern Ireland who were in receipt of a State pension (non-contributory) immediately before moving, the pension can continue to be paid for up to five years or until a similar payment from the relevant authority is being paid.  Voluntary contributions are PRSI contributions that can be paid if an individual is between the age of 16 and 66 and is no longer covered by compulsory PRSI by way of insurable employment, self-employment or credited contributions.In order to be admitted as a voluntary contributor, an individual must: have at least 260 weeks PRSI paid under compulsory PRSI in either employment or self-employment; apply within 12 months after the end of the contribution year during which  compulsory PRSI was last paid or a credited contribution was last awarded; and agree to pay voluntary contributions from the start of the contribution week in which compulsory PRSI was last paid or a credited contribution was last awarded.Under EU legislation it not possible for a person to be subject to the social insurance systems of two or more member states at the same time.  This means that an individual cannot pay voluntary contributions in Ireland at the same time as they are in insurable employment, self-employment, receiving credited contributions or paying voluntary contributions in another EU member state.  The rate of voluntary contributions payable is always determined by the last rate of PRSI contribution paid by a person.

The current budgetary position necessitated the changes made to social welfare benefits, including treatment benefits, in Budget 2010. From 1st January 2010, treatments available under the optical and dental elements of the scheme are limited to the free examination.  There has been no change to the medical appliances element of the scheme.  Over 2 million PRSI contributors are eligible for the free dental and optical examination and medical appliance benefit in 2010.Current trends in 2010 indicate that by year end up to 300,000 people will opt to avail of the free dental examination, and a further 150,000 will receive a free optical examination.  The annual free dental examination has been retained in order to encourage people to continue attending for checkups and help address the concerns expressed about the general dental health of the public.  Regular dental examination can detect health issues and inform patients of any urgent dental treatment they may require.Some 210,000 customers who had applied for approval to commence treatment prior to 31st December, either directly to the Department or through their practitioners, will receive the full range of dental and optical treatments available under the schemes prior to 1st January 2010.  There is also evidence that increased competition in the market is having an effect on price. Shortly after the announcement of the changes to the scheme, for example, one major dental chain announced a price cut of 30%, and the Irish Dental Association subsequently announced that its members would either freeze or reduce their prices.  Developments such as these are to be welcomed as they will make treatment more affordable for all consumers.

Any referral of a complaint to the LRC is a matter for the individual concerned.Members of the ANS have recourse to a Redress of Wrongs Process under Section 19 of Defence Force Regulation A14, which allows a complaint to be dealt with up to the level of the Director of the Medical Corps. Upon completion of this process if the member is not satisfied with the outcome they are entitled to avail of the full range of industrial relations machinery which is available to employees generally.A member of the ANS did lodge a formal complaint dated 25th May 2009 with the military authorities under the provisions of Redress of Wrongs Process under Section 19 of Defence Force Regulation A14. Representations were received on behalf of the individual from the Industrial Relations Officer of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) as part of this process. The Acting Director of the Medical Corps issued her ruling on the Redress of Wrong complaint directly to the complainant on 7 May 2010. The specific correspondence referred to by the Deputy related to the complainant's anticipated return to work.

The advice of the local fire authority may be sought in regard to fire safety.Section 40 of the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended, provides that it is an offence for a person to cut, grub, burn or otherwise destroy, during the period from 1 March to 31 August, any vegetation growing on any land not then cultivated or, during the same period, to cut, grub, burn or otherwise destroy any vegetation growing in any hedge or ditch. There are a number of derogation provisions in the legislation which allow work to be carried out in the normal course of agriculture or forestry, but do not extend to burning.In addition under Section 39 of the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended, it is an offence for a person to burn vegetation growing within one mile of a wood or plantation which is not the property of such a person, at any time of the year, without firstly giving notice in writing to an Garda Síochána and the owner/occupier of the wood or plantation.Under the Habitats Regulations 1997 as amended and the Wildlife Acts, the burning of areas of vegetation in bogland designated for conservation as Special Areas of Conservation, Natural Heritage Areas, or Special Protection Areas, is a Notifiable Activity which may not be carried out except with the express consent of the Minister.

A further 10% has been provided by the local authorities concerned.It is a matter for each local authority, in the first instance, to ensure that monitoring and evaluation arrangements are in place to ensure accountability for expenditure of funds on homeless services, both in terms of value for money and effectiveness of the services provided.  As part of the Homelessness Action Plan process, relevant housing authorities have been urged, where necessary, to carry out a comprehensive review of services in their areas.  The major review of services already carried out in Dublin has, I understand, encompassed services provided by the organisation concerned.I understand that the Revenue Commissioners have granted charitable tax exemptions to over 7,500 organisations in Ireland, and that Revenue require that the financial statements of any such organisation with an annual income of over €100,000 must be audited. Also, depending on the legal structure adopted by a charity, they may be subject to other audit requirements. For example, an incorporated charity will be subject to audit requirements under company law.Furthermore, I understand that when the Charities Act 2009 is fully commenced, the accounts of charities will be subject to either independent examination or audit, depending on whether their annual gross income or total expenditure is above or below a threshold to be prescribed in regulations by the Minister for Community, Equality, and Gaeltacht Affairs.Under my Department's Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS), which is administered by the local authorities, grants of up to 100% of the approved cost are available for the provision, by approved housing bodies, of accommodation to meet the needs of older people, persons with a physical or intellectual disability, homeless persons and other groups with specific categories of housing need. My Department's involvement with the CAS relates primarily to the provision of funds for individual projects. The detailed administration of the scheme, including the appraisal of new applications, the management of the planning and procurement stages of projects and the certification that projects comply with the terms and conditions of the funding schemes, are the responsibility of the relevant local authority. In the past three years, funding of €23.6 million was provided to the organisation concerned in respect of some 156 units of accommodation delivered under the CAS.My Department also provides financial assistance towards the administrative and general expenses of certain bodies which provide information, research or representative services in the area of housing. Over the period 2007 to 2009, funding of €270,000 was provided in this regard to the organisation concerned. Eligibility for assistance is contingent on the provision of audited financial statements by the bodies concerned.Information regarding expenditure on foreign travel by staff of the organisation referred to in the question is not available in my Department.

In the longer-term, initially to 2020 but ultimately to 2050, significant structural change will be required across all sectors of the economy and society as a whole to achieve an effective transition to a low-carbon future.The renewed Programme for Government 2009 affirms the commitment to a target of 3% annual average reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. This commitment is reflected in the Framework for the Climate Change Bill 2010 which I published in December 2009. The Bill will, on enactment, provide a statutory basis for the core national priority of major and continued reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the context of transition.  Work on drafting the Heads of the Bill is an advanced stage and, following Government consideration, I intend to announce further details shortly.

A pilot exercise has been carried out in one local authority area to inform the process.It is a matter for developers to ensure that all appropriate steps are taken to secure a site on which development is ongoing or where the conditions of a planning permission have yet to be fully met.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	1092	Prior to the commencement of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) a detailed mapping exercise was carried out to help determine those areas that would be included in the scheme and those which, by virtue of being already substantially served by existing broadband suppliers, could not be included.EU State Aid and competition rules govern how states can intervene in areas where there are existing service providers operating.  Accordingly, the NBS is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.  That mapping exercise found that a number of broadband suppliers were already active in the area referred to in the Deputy's Question and consequently the locality was excluded from the Scheme.  Details of broadband services available in each county can be found on ComReg's website at www.callcosts.ie
It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  However, despite Government and private investment in broadband, I am aware that there continues to be a small percentage of premises throughout the country that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  My Department is currently considering the design and implementation of a scheme which would use this funding to address the issue of basic broadband availability to un-served rural premises outside of the NBS areas.  This work will include the identification of premises not capable of receiving broadband.  It is hoped to commence this scheme in late 2010 and have it completed by 2012.  As the scheme is only at the design stage, there is no application process at this juncture.  Information in relation to acceptance of applications and the process of qualification under the scheme will be made available in due course when the scheme is launched.

ESB also plans to install up to 30 fast charge points across Ireland by the end of 2011, with nine expected to be set up by the end of this year.  While it is a matter for the ESB to determine where the infrastructure will be provided the fact that it is a nationwide process will ensure that all relevant areas are included as the scheme progresses.My Department, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and ESB Networks are also discussing the electric vehicle infrastructure network build out programme.  The potential emergence of other parties with an interest in providing infrastructure is an issue for consideration in that context.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	1094	ESB is statutorily charged with undertaking the production and generation of electricity by means of hydraulic power derived from the waters of certain rivers in Ireland.Production of energy is, and will continue to be, the primary function for ESB hydro schemes.  However, managing the water levels on rivers at the hydroelectric schemes is an intrinsic part of ESB's responsibilities.  It has always been the case that in the event of flooding, the main priority becomes the management of the waters rather than production of energy.  The levels of water and the power to change those levels are defined in the relevant legislation.  ESB's hydro schemes and dams conform to international standards and practices and there are very stringent procedures in place to cover situations where flooding occurs.ESB's own Regulations provide for operating procedures for the dams in relation to normal operation, flood conditions, dam safety, levels and low flow conditions.  These Regulations are revised and updated regularly based on operating experience.The relevant legislation in this regard is:Shannon Electricity Act 1925, Electricity Supply Act 1927, Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act, 1934, Liffey Reservoir Act 1936, Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act 1945, River Erne Hydro-Electric Scheme Approval Order No. 86 of 1945, River Liffey (Leixlip) Hydro-Electric Scheme Approval Order No.154 of 1945, River Lee Hydro-Electric Scheme Approval Order No. 321 of 1949, Erne Drainage and Development Act 1950.

This tariff is offered on a commercial basis and it is open to other supply companies to enter this market.  Further details of the ESB micro generation scheme are available at www.esb.ie/esbnetworks.Uptake to date has been mainly in the wind category with 31 in the solar photovoltaic and 1 in the hydro category.  While there have been about 400 additional enquiries in relation to the scheme, it is clear that there will be limited enough overall take up.  It is equally clear to me that further steps are needed to stimulate interest in and take up of microgeneration.Late last year the Commission for Energy Regulation wrote to all the other electricity supply companies inviting them to introduce microgeneration schemes similar to that of ESB but there has been no response to date.  In line with my objective to increase deployment of microgeneration technologies, my Department is working closely with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), to build on the experience gained from the field trials undertaken by SEAI and to assess the options for increased market deployment.  Technical and safety standards are being developed and options for possible new support measures are being explored.  The existing ESB scheme is focused very much on domestic scale technologies with an 11 kv size limit.  I have asked my Department to examine a range of larger technologies which would be appropriate for deployment at farm, small business and community level.  The work will be completed as soon as possible and I will then consider what further steps should be taken.

Broadband services are provided by private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e. over telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, fibre and satellite.  In cases of market failure the Government will intervene, where it is appropriate and possible to do so.Prior to the commencement of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) a detailed mapping exercise was carried out to help determine those areas that would be included in the scheme and those which, by virtue of being already substantially served by existing broadband suppliers, were to be excluded.  EU State Aid and competition rules govern how states can intervene in areas where there are existing service providers operating.  Accordingly, the NBS is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.Precise details of the electoral divisions throughout the State that are to be included in the National Broadband Scheme can be viewed on my Department's website www.dcenr.ie  Details of the telecommunications service providers operating in county Kildare can be found at www.callcosts.ie on ComReg’s website.It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  However, despite Government and private investment in broadband, I am aware that there continues to be a small percentage of premises throughout the country that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding and granted State Aid approval for rural broadband initiatives.  My Department is currently progressing the design and implementation of a scheme which would be available to un-served rural premises outside of the NBS areas.  This work will include the identification of premises not capable of receiving broadband.  It is hoped to commence this scheme in late 2010 and have it completed by 2012.  As the scheme is only at the design stage, there is no application process at this juncture.  Information in relation to acceptance of applications and the process of qualification under the scheme will be made available in due course when the scheme is launched.

An Order has been made under the Act which designates the 1 July 2010 as the establishment day for the purposes of the Act and therefore the day on which Inland Fisheries Ireland will come into operation.From the outset I have maintained that the Board of Inland Fisheries Ireland should be small and contain a strong focus relevant to its business and to the general issue of good corporate governance.  The Act provides that potential appointees to the Board must have had experience of or have shown capacity in one or more of a number of areas.  These areas include, inter alia, recreational fisheries, commercial fishing, business or commercial affairs and environmental or biodiversity matters.  The Bill does not restrict potential appointees to a particular area of expertise.During the passage of the Bill through the Oireachtas I announced details of a number of nominations to the Board of Inland Fisheries Ireland.  I can confirm that of those proposed to be appointed, there are individuals with experience of or who have shown capacity in recreational fisheries.  The formal appointments to the Board will not be made until 1 July 2010.

No. 557 of 2009), the River Feale, including the waters of the Galey and Brick, has a total allowable catch of 4,652 and the allocation of the quota between the commercial and recreational sectors is made by the CEO of the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board on the advice of the local Fishery District Committee.The commercial (draft net) season on the Feale traditionally commenced on 12 May and ended on 31 July.  On foot of a request received from the CEO of the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board, I provided for an adjustment of the season to 1 June 2010 to 20 August 2010 under the Salmon and Trout Conservation (Draft Nets and Snap Nets) Bye-law No. 872, 2010.  Regardless of the adjustments provided to the draft net season on the Feale, the harvest of salmon by any means is restricted to its Total Allowable Catch of 4,652 for 2010.

These regulations require that animals which die on-farm must generally be disposed of through approved knackeries and rendering plants.While my Department's contribution to the Fallen Animals Scheme in general ceased with effect from 14th April 2009, I have continued to provide financial support for the collection of certain fallen animals, in particular bovines over 48 months of age, for sampling, as required under the ongoing national TSE surveillance programme. The cost of collection and rendering for animals not covered by the new scheme became a matter for negotiation between the individual collectors/rendering plants and their customers.My Department is continuing, within the boundaries of legal requirements, to make every effort to facilitate measures to maximise flexibility and enable reduction of costs in the rendering/collection system. This includes allowing cross border trade, permitting direct delivery by farmers to authorised plants and encouraging indigenous use of meat and bone meal (MBM) for energy purposes. Approval conditions have recently been drawn up to facilitate the collection of fallen animals direct from farms by approved rendering plants, including arrangements to provide for TSE testing of these animals where required. Discussions are also ongoing between my Department and farmer and hunt representatives, to consider the feasibility of extending the network of plants authorised to act as knackeries. These measures are designed to help sustain competition in this sector and encourage fair pricing.  There are currently 40 knackeries approved by my Department, a list of which is available on the Department's website.  In light of the foregoing there are adequate alternative fallen animal collection services available to farmers in the area concerned should this particular service cease.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	1116	2008 and 2009 were difficult years in terms of farm incomes.  The National Farm Survey 2009 reports a decline of 30% in family farm income following a fall of approximately 14% in 2008. In 2009, the decline in income was mainly a result of a decline in output prices, particularly in the dairy sector, while in 2008 the decline was mainly a result of rising input costs.   Market support measures taken at EU level, which I had pressed strongly for, assisted in stabilising dairy prices in 2009, albeit initially at very low levels.  Since then prices have recovered significantly.The level of public support for the agri-food sector remains very substantial, with direct payments, which amounted to approximately €2 billion on aggregate, accounting for 143% of average family farm income in 2009.  The high proportion of direct payments being used to cover production costs indicates the importance of managing costs as efficiently as possible.  It is also important to take account of likely volatility when making production decisions.  Of the €2 billion spent on direct payments to farmers in 2009, €1.3 billion was spent on the Single Payment Scheme, €338 million under REPS and €223 billion on less favoured areas. This is a very substantial level of public support which will be largely maintained in 2010.It should also be borne in mind that a large proportion of farm households have income from other sources be it employment, pensions, social assistance or other income.  For farm households that find themselves in income difficulties, the Farm Assist Scheme, which is administered by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, is a specially targeted measure that is available to assist them.

As provided under EU Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1857/2006 on State Aid rules, the maximum aid payable to growers must not exceed 80% and 90% in less favoured areas. I have decided to apply the 80% level of assistance across the country.In addition, a further provision of the same Regulation requires that aid offered must be reduced by 50% with effect from 1 January 2010, unless farmers have taken out crop insurance. Therefore, for the vast majority of cases under the Frost Damage Scheme, a 40% aid level will apply.  Furthermore, as the level of claims submitted to my Department under the Scheme is so substantial, I have been obliged to apply a sliding scale reduction to the payments. The rate of the sliding scale is in the process of being finalised.  Payments will issue shortly to those growers whose claims have been fully processed and approved for payment.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	1122	It is one of the primary requirements of the EU Regulations governing the Single Payment Scheme that in order for a farmer to receive full payment under the Scheme it is necessary that an eligible hectare of land be declared by the applicant for each payment entitlement held.  A 2008 Single Payment Scheme application was received from the person named on 15th May 2008 declaring 22.74 hectares of eligible land, which was a reduction on the amount of eligible land declared on the 2005, 2006 & 2007 Single Payment Scheme applications. Under the provisions of the Scheme, payment in 2008 was based on the amount of eligible land declared by the person named.  The person named applied to consolidate his entitlements in 2009 in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 795/2004. This application was successful and the applicant received payment on the new higher value consolidated entitlements for this scheme year based on the eligible land declared.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	1123	I recently introduced changes to the TB testing rules for cattle going direct to slaughter. Previously, where animals that had not been tested within the previous 12 months were presented for slaughter, they were returned to the holding which was then usually restricted. As a result of the revised arrangement, such cattle will now be accepted by slaughter plants.However, I must emphasise that allowing the animals not tested within the previous 12 months to be accepted for slaughter does not mean that there has been a change to the requirement that each herd, comprising all the animals therein, must be tested within each 12 month period. Therefore, in order to ensure that herdowners comply with the annual testing requirements and to protect herds which trade with keepers that have allowed animals to go out of test, my decision to permit out of test animals to be slaughtered also provided for measures to be taken by the District Veterinary Offices in respect of the herds which send out of test cattle to slaughter. These measures include trade restriction, where appropriate, depending on the proportion of the herd that is out of test, whether the herd itself has been tested within the previous 12 months and the length of time an animal is out of test in a herd.With regard to exceptions to the new arrangements, there may be instances where a District Veterinary Office refuses permission to a herdkeeper to send out of test animals to slaughter. An example of this would be where a holding is restricted for both inward and outward movement, including to slaughter, where the herdkeeper has refused to test his herd within 12 months. Sending out of test animals to slaughter without Department permission in such instances would constitute a breach of the TB legislation and could result in prosecution.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	1124	To ensure individuals continue to utilise the skills gained from training, education or previous employment the Government introduced the Work Placement Programme. Under this programme individuals can gain valuable work experience for periods of up to nine months, thereby ensuring that they use the skills they have developed and they maintain close links with the labour market. The Work Placement Programme is available to individuals of all skill levels including graduates and participants may retain their social welfare entitlements subject to the normal social welfare rules applying.The Community Employment Scheme is an employment and training programme, which helps long-term unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to work routine. The programme enables individuals to use and enhance both their technical and personal skills, which can then be used in the workplace. In the last Budget, the Government increased the number of Community Employment places by 500, bringing the total number of places on the scheme to 23,300.There is also a range of part-time and full-time further and higher education programmes being provided by universities, Institutes of Technology, Vocational Education Committees and FÁS which enable participants to upskill and reskill to help them succeed in a knowledge based economy.  The increase in demand for education opportunities can clearly be seen in the significant increase in the number of Back to Education Allowance recipients, up to over 18,000, many of whom are participating in further and higher education programmes.In addition to these measures, the Government have introduced the Employer Jobs (PRSI) Incentive Scheme. Under this scheme where an employer creates a new job and takes on a person who has been unemployed for 6 months or more, the employer will be fully exempted from the liability to pay PRSI for the first year of that employment.  The Government will continue to do all in its power to create the environment for new job opportunities and provide the necessary supports and assistance to enable those who are unemployed utilise and develop their skills, which will improve their chances of securing a job in the future.

Where qualifications are awarded outside of the State and are not  automatically recognised by the Teaching Council, applicants are required to undergo an assessment of their qualifications to determine if they meet the Council's registration requirements.Teachers who are registered in Northern Ireland are eligible for registration with the Teaching Council in this State. However, there are distinct differences in the forms of registration granted by the respective Teaching Councils in that the registration granted by the Teaching Council in Ireland is specific to the educational sector and to the curricular subjects at post-primary level. The assessment of qualifications carried out by the Teaching Council in Ireland allows the Council to ensure that the registration granted corresponds to the qualifications of the teacher.My Department understands that the Teaching Council intends to meet with the General Teaching Council for Northern Ireland to further discuss the area of cross-border recognition of qualifications.

The Early Start unit in Kilmore West Dublin 5 is a full unit which runs two sessions daily and can enrol up to 30 children on each session.   For the 2010/2011 school year, the Early Start programme was underscribed with fewer than 30 children enrolled.   The programme was undersubscribed by over 50% and was no longer considered viable as a full unit.  The Early Start programme, will however, continue to operate as a half unit for the 2010/2011 school year and will have more than enough places for the number of children who are enrolled in the programme.Full Early Start Units are staffed by two teachers and two childcare workers.  As the Early Start Unit in Kilmore West is no longer viable as a full unit, a redundancy issue has arisen for one of the two childcare workers.  The redundancy and pension entitlement for childcare workers will be in line with the terms and conditions of employment for childcare workers in Early Start  units in schools.

These persons will continue to meet the qualifications requirements for registration with the Teaching Council. A provision to this effect has been included in each of the Teaching Council's 2009 Registration Regulations.However, all such teachers now seeking registration under 31(5) of the Teaching Council Act, 2001 must meet the Evidence of Character (including Garda Vetting) and Proof of Identity requirements that have been set by the Council.

The SESS facilitates a partnership approach involving support teams of practising teachers, Education Centres, the Inspectorate, the National Educational Psychological Service, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the National Council for Special  Education, Third Level Colleges, Health Board Personnel, Teacher Unions and other relevant bodies and services.The Deputy will also be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENO) for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants  to schools to support students with autism. The SENO will also consider applications from schools to establish special classes for students with autism.Another function of the NCSE is to disseminate to schools and parents, and such other persons as the NCSE considers appropriate, information relating to best practice concerning the education of children with special educational needs.All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.The establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years. In excess of 390 classes have now been approved  around the country, including over 40 at post-primary level.

This study has been conducted using data from the Central Statistics Office, the General Register Office and the Department of Social Protection with reference to recent schools' enrolment data. The study indicates that the requirement for additional primary provision in the coming years is likely to be greatest in more than 40 identified locations across the country based on significant changes to the demographics of those areas. The Galway City Catchment area (which includes Claregalway) is  included in these initial identified areas.Forward Planning Section is in the process of carrying out detailed analysis and reports for each of these locations in order to identify the school accommodation requirements for each area up to and including the school year 2014/2015. Given the increase in the birth rate in recent years the initial focus of this analysis is on primary school accommodation requirements and this will be followed by a more detailed analysis of post-primary accommodation requirements.  A Report on primary needs has been completed for the Galway City Catchment area (which includes Claregalway). When the required reports have been completed for all the initial identified areas Forward Planning Section will continue to work on preparing reports on a priority basis for the remainder of the country. Overall school accommodation requirements in Claregalway, including the case for the provision of a new post-primary school, will be analysed as part of this process.In addition to this detailed analysis of accommodation needs currently being carried out by Forward Planning Section, the Department is also currently examining a number of broad policy issues regarding the establishment of new post-primary schools. As part of this, consideration is being given to the setting up of a new framework in relation to the establishment of new second level schools and their patronage.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-06-15 00:00:00	Prelude	1143	The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS, was managed by the Educational Research Centre on behalf of the Department of Education & Science and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's Regional Offices and the Inspectorate. The ERC's overall approach was guided by the definition of educational disadvantage set out in the Education Act (1998), as: "...the impediments to education arising from social or economic disadvantage which prevent students from deriving appropriate benefit from education in schools".The identification process was devised by the ERC and had regard to and employed the existing and most appropriate data sources available.While the variables selected are, either individually or taken together, reasonable indicators of social disadvantage, it is when they present in high concentrations that they best predict educational disadvantage. This is commonly referred to as the ‘social context'.The evidence from research, which underpinned the 2005 identification process, underlines the relevance of the social context of disadvantage. The research strongly supports the view that educational disadvantage will occur, to the extent that supplementary supports will be necessary, in schools and school communities where socio economic disadvantage is most concentrated.The majority of Irish schools will include among their enrolments a number of children who exhibit one or a number of ‘disadvantage' characteristics. In most cases the school will be equipped to meet the individual needs of these children from within existing resources. Evidence has shown that disadvantage associated with poverty and social exclusion assumes a multiplier effect where the levels are highly concentrated in schools.DEIS supports and measures are designed to address the needs of schools who require significant additional resources to supplement and support the mainstream teachers where the enrolment consists of a high percentage of children from disadvantaged backgrounds.  This approach is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General which are set out in his report on Primary Disadvantage of 2006, which recommended that the Department focus its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.The finding that up to 50% of children in disadvantaged areas do not attend local DEIS primary schools was made in the ESRI Report ‘Investing in Education: Combating Educational Disadvantage' published in May 2009. The finding is a simple finding of fact and is not in dispute. The finding however does not lend itself to the conclusion that such children are further disadvantaged by not attending DEIS schools. In fact the ESRI report contained a range of views on this point including the view that schools with low levels of disadvantage have the capacity within universal supports to address the needs of disadvantaged students. It is important to note that only some 22% of schools (primary and post primary) are included in DEIS. The fact that 50% of disadvantaged students are enrolled in 22% of schools and a further 50% of disadvantaged students are dispersed throughout the remaining 78% of schools is a strong indication that DEIS is targeting the schools most in need of support.

A number of studies have noted that the project is effective in addressing the literacy needs of students in schools with the highest concentration of disadvantage in particular it has been noted that reading standards, student concentration and behaviour had improved.Library staff, like other public servants in the Education Sector, other than teachers and SNAs, are subject to the public sector recruitment moratorium.Exemptions from the moratorium are, in the context of the public finances, a matter for serious deliberation. However, I am pleased to say, that having regard to the factors discussed above, it has been decided to retain the library staff for the coming school year.

However, officials in my Department have looked into this matter and I note that the PSI has agreed to extend accreditation of this course to November of this year.I would also point out that the college in question was recently the subject of an Institutional Review carried out by HETAC, and the report published following this review made recommendations on this issue. Firstly, it was recommended that the college follow up on the process of renewing PSI accreditation for its programme expeditiously in order to clarify the position for students and other stakeholders. In addition, it was recommended that the college's marketing documentation and website make clear that continued accreditation is subject to confirmation by PSI.  I understand that the college is addressing these issues.The CAO is a private (not-for-profit) company and receives no State funding. The higher education institutions have delegated to the CAO the task of processing centrally applications for admission to their first year undergraduate courses. Neither my Department nor the Higher Education Authority has any role to play in relation to the operation of the CAO.

The Commission operates a scheme of Reasonable Accommodations in the certificate examinations. Applications for such accommodations are submitted by schools on behalf of their students.A range of accommodations are provided to enable students with special needs to access the Certificate examinations. For example enlarged print, Braille translation, modified questions, use of a scribe, a reader, a personal assistant, a tape recorder or word processor, may be allowed depending on needs. Ten minutes extra time per scheduled hour of each question paper may be allowed where the candidate needs the help of a scribe or would otherwise be unable to make adequate use of the mechanical aids provided for recording the answers or is visually impaired*.The scheme was introduced following the report of an expert advisory group, and the introduction enabled opportunities to be provided for exemptions where a candidate was not in a position to demonstrate achievement in a core area of assessment. At the time, the Advisory Group examined the issue generally of extra time for students, but considered that the amount of time needed could vary substantially by disability category and that there was a fundamental difficulty in developing a system which would facilitate equitable access but not confer an unfair advantage in any case. The Group therefore recommended that the time element of the examination should be made less critical, and that an additional 15-20 minutes should be available for all students in certain examinations. This has been implemented since 2000 by extending the core timetable for  Irish, English, History and Geography examinations since 2000. The extra time entitlement  for students at * above is offset  by this timetabled element.

This co-ordination occurs through a network of 89 Special Education Needs Organiser (SENO) posts, including 12 Senior SENO positions based in over 40 NCSE offices throughout the State.SENOs are employed by the NCSE. The NCSE is also responsible for the deployment of SENOs.  I understand that there has been a SENO vacancy in the area referred to by the Deputy, arising from a resignation in August 2009. The NCSE has advised my Department that it arranges for appropriate cover in circumstances where SENO vacancies arise.  The NCSE has also advised my Department that it has recruited an additional SENO and is currently in the process of assigning a member of staff to fill the vacant post in question.The Deputy is aware that Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 provides for the independent assessment of health needs of persons arising from a disability and also, where appropriate, the education services to be provided. The Act sets out the role of the NCSE in this regard.  In June 2007, Part 2 of the Act was commenced for children less than 5 years of age.  The NCSE processes requests for assistance for such children following receipt of applications submitted by Health Service Executive (HSE) Assessment Officers.  The Deputy may wish to contact my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children or the HSE directly in relation to the reference to children awaiting assessments in the details provided with his question.
