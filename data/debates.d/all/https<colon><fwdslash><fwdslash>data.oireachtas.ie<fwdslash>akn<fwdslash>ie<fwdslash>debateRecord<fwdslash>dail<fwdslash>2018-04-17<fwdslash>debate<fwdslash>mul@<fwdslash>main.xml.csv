#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	0	I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that there is real and deep concern about the alleged data breach at Independent News & Media, INM, which has been well reported in recent weeks. We agree that having an independent and free media is essential to the operation of a parliamentary democracy. We should all hold dear the protection of journalistic sources, editorial independence, the independence of journalists and their freedom from undue interference. Recent events serve as a wake-up call for the Oireachtas to consider legislation to deal with these issues on several fronts. Much work has been done in that regard by interested parties, not least the former Chief Justice, Mr. John Murray, whose very comprehensive report on the protection by the State of journalistic sources was published last year but has not been acted on. He says this protection should apply generally because it is essential to democracy. The United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization, UNESCO, also produced a comprehensive report two years ago on the desirability of, and necessity for, a national law to be established to deal with these issues.It was very much on the button in terms of what has transpired over the past two weeks. It states we should have specific national legislation for source protection, with its legal foundation being the right to freedom of expression, including press freedom and privacy. It states such legislation should recognise that source protection should extend to all acts of journalism and across all platforms, services and media, including digital data and metadata. It affirms that state and corporate actors, including third-party intermediaries who capture journalistic data, must treat those data confidentially, and that the law should shield acts of journalism from targeted surveillance, data retention and the hand-over of material connected to confidential sources. It recommends that arbitrary, unauthorised and wilful violations of confidentiality of sources by third-party actors should be criminalised.
In addition, we have the media plurality monitor in league with the European Commission and others. It identifies very high risks in terms of ownership, transparency of ownership, and editorial autonomy. Will the Government consider legislation across the three strands I have identified? Will the Taoiseach reaffirm his position to the House? Yesterday an actor of the State, the Director of Corporate Enforcement, essentially received correspondence stating he may be personally held liable in respect of certain things done in the line of his duty. It is very important that the message go out from the Oireachtas and Government that any actor of the State is indemnified and will not lose out in any way for conducting his or her duty on behalf of the taxpayer and the State. It is very important that this affirmation be given in respect of the director of the ODCE today.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	1	I thank the Deputy for raising this important question. To answer it, given recent revelations we will have to consider legislation in this area to protect sources. I am not aware of any legislation being drafted currently by the Government and I have not seen any by the Opposition in the form of Private Members' Bills in the past two years, but perhaps the time has come for the Government to dust down the reports and give consideration to legislation in this area. Having independent news and media is a cornerstone of our democracy. It is, after all, the Fourth Estate. Journalists must be free to pursue stories that they want to pursue. Their sources should be protected and free from any unjust interference, external or internal. We need a plurality of voices in the media. We need to ensure these voices are not drowned out or silenced. We also need diversity in ownership. I commend journalists who have worked to report on this story, including journalists in Independent News & Media, who have not allowed their independence to be compromised. The reported data breaches represent a very significant threat to the freedom of our press but the way in which the media have responded to this threat to date should reassure us that our press will not be silenced. Obviously, any alleged breach affecting personal data is a matter of concern, whether it relates to journalists or public citizens. It is important to say that although this is now a matter before the courts, we need to respect that and bear it in mind in our contributions. The Deputy has done so. The ODCE, a Government office at the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, has now made an application to the High Court under section 748 of the Companies Act 2014 to appoint inspectors to investigate the affairs of Independent News & Media. This is now an enforcement matter for the ODCE. Section 949(3) of the Companies Act provides that the Director of Corporate Enforcement shall be independent in the performance of his statutory functions. The case commenced yesterday. In terms of indemnity, it is absolutely the case that any public servant who acts properly and in accordance with his mandate and does not breach any laws or ethical principles is indemnified by the State.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	2	I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. Former Chief Justice Murray published a comprehensive report about a year ago. I am not aware that any action has been taken by the line Minister on foot of that report, which deals with the issue of protecting journalistic sources. Second, according to some criteria, the media freedom monitor of the Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom identifies Ireland as very high risk in terms of editorial autonomy, ownership and transparency around ownership, mainly due to the lack of any upward threshold in terms of ownership.That requires review and consideration by the Oireachtas in general. Legislation relating to the protection of journalistic sources is imminent. Given what has happened, we cannot hang around too long in that regard because this is fundamental to our democracy. I welcome the Taoiseach's comments on the director of the ODCE.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	9	The news of the data breach at INM is deeply alarming. Hundreds of thousands of emails may have been compromised. Nineteen individuals were singled out for data interrogation in October 2014 and, allegedly, it involved a hired firm conducting a trawl of electronic records of journalists and others at the company. They included investigative journalists and lawyers who had worked on the Moriarty tribunal. This data interrogation represents an attack on the privacy and safety of journalists and their sources. It undermines fundamentals of how members of the press go about their work in the public interest. We know also that a former chairperson of INM ordered the data interrogation, but we do not know his reasons for so doing. We do not know why the 19 individuals I cited were specifically targeted and certainly do not know why the bill for the data interrogation was paid by Blaydon Limited, a company based on the Isle of Man. The ODCE, as the Taoiseach said, wants the courts to appoint inspectors to go into INM to conduct a full and proper investigation, which is correct and understandable. However, yesterday it emerged that Mr. Denis O'Brien was seeking a judicial review of the ODCE's request to appoint such inspectors by accusing it of leaking information on the data breach. The ODCE has been investigating the story for a whole year without any leak, but as soon as the affidavit arrived at INM premises there were numerous leaks. INM even reported on details of the affidavit. It appears that an attempt is being made to silence the ODCE. There is no doubt that the office is up against it because of a lack of resources and support on the Taoiseach's watch and that of previous Governments. Currently, 35 staff and seven gardaí are assigned to the office. That gives a clear insight into the State's attitude to white collar crime and corporate enforcement. Companies should fear the ODCE and the consequences of data breaches or any other unethical action. The office should be properly resourced and empowered to ensure white-collar crime is not only prosecuted but deterred. This jurisdiction has gained a reputation as being the Wild West when it comes to tax avoidance and the prevalence of white collar crime. If we are to shake this reputation, we need to take a stand here and now. The Taoiseach cannot stand by and allow the ODCE to be disrupted or silenced. He has a responsibility to support its work. Does the office have his full support? How does he plan to demonstrate that support in terms of the provision of adequate resources and staffing?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	10	I thank the Deputy. I do not know the answers to the questions she raises either, which is why it is important that we allow the director and the ODCE to do their work. The matter is before the courts.Anyone has the right to challenge a decision in the courts if that person has a locus standi. With regard to resources, 36 staff are in place in the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, and seven gardaí are also assigned. Reforms have taken place since 2012, which have included the recruitment of additional staff, particularly those with specific skills and expertise. This means the ODCE is well resourced to tackle the increasingly complex breaches of company law. Over recent years, nine professional staff have been recruited to the office to enhance its capability. These include a digital forensic specialist, two enforcement portfolio managers and six forensic accountants. Furthermore, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation is engaging with the Public Appointments Service, PAS, to fill through open competition two more positions for forensic accountants and two more for enforcement lawyers. While recruitment is ongoing, the ODCE, in common with many other State agencies, faces difficulty with recruiting high-quality professional staff. I am advised that, at present, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has no requests for additional staff other than those I have mentioned. The director has the full support of the Government. As part of our white-collar crime package, which I published with the former Tánaiste, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, a few months ago, it is our policy to develop the ODCE, take it out of its current role as an office within a Department, make it a stand-alone statutory body in its own right and make it a national corporate enforcement bureau. That is a policy published by the Government last October or November. Legislation to do that is being developed.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	11	The view of many people is that powerful politicians in and out of government in the State have stood off and even courted very powerful interests within the media. I think the Taoiseach will agree with me that that is a very dangerous perception, never mind the reality of it. I agree with him that the ODCE needs to be assisted in doing its work and I challenge the Taoiseach to put his money where his mouth is. I will grant that he did better than Deputy Micheál Martin when, in 2005, 2006 and 2007, as the line Minister, he, in a studious way, ignored the calls for an increase in the number of staff for the office. The Taoiseach now tells us that there are 36 staff and the Garda complement. Contrast that with 350 welfare inspectors. Of course, we need welfare inspectors. When one looks at those figures, it tells a tale of where the balance of consideration is. In 2018, the Taoiseach allocated a budget of €5 million to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement. He also allocated €5 million to his unit for spin.

The ODCE has a staff complement of 36 and, in addition to that, there are seven gardaí. Four positions are being recruited for. There is no request for further staff in addition to those four who are being recruited. As part of the white-collar crime package, which the former Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, and I published alongside the Minister, Deputy Ross, and others in October, we set out clearly how we intend to strengthen the role of this office, turn it into a stand-alone agency, make it separate from a Department, which would be most appropriate, and develop it into a bureau of investigation for white-collar crime. In that package is legislation we put forward relating to corruption. We have a good package in place to tackle white-collar crime and we intend to see it through.
#MichaelLowry	unknown-#MichaelLowry-party	unknown-#MichaelLowry-dob	unknown-#MichaelLowry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	17	I am sorry to trouble the Taoiseach with mundane and practical matters but some city representatives and those from urban centres would not recognise or realise the huge problem we have with rural and county roads. An elected representative living in rural Ireland meets people every other day describing the shocking, appalling and atrocious conditions of these roads. People living on these roads at present are frustrated, angry and resentful because their local road network is in tatters.This is a massive political issue. The Government does not need research, surveys or focus groups to establish the extent of the problem but, rather, should just ask county councillors in Tipperary and elsewhere who are currently embarrassed and ashamed to meet people living on such roads. People using such roads in north, mid, south and west Tipperary are incensed and furious at the neglect and abandonment of some rural roads. Council engineers and elected representatives feel helpless and hopeless because of the lack of adequate funding. There have been several weather events such as Storms Ophelia, Eleanor and Brian and unprecedented levels of rainfall, snow and frost. The Government did an excellent job in briefing the public on such events and the message it conveyed was competent and capable in terms of getting precautionary measures across to the public. However, the follow up has been less than impressive. It was inevitable that such weather events would make an impact and have consequences such as the alarming deterioration of our roads. The more that deterioration is ignored, the worse it gets. The CEO and executive of Tipperary County Council last week met with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and informed him that, having conducted an evaluation and assessment, they require an additional €197 million to resolve the problems of 3,000 km of rural roads. If one looks at the allocations, the national allocation for 2008, ten years ago, was €608 million. The allocation for this year, 2018, is €417 million, a drop of €200 million. Seven years ago, Tipperary was allocated €45 million for its roads. This year, it will receive €23.3 million, less than half that amount. An urgent, coherent and orchestrated response by the Government is needed. It is not sufficient to say there has been an increase in allocation. It is abundantly clear that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport will not be able to provide the necessary funds. An extraordinary response is required and that must be funded.

I was in Limerick, Galway, Deputy Lowry's own county of Tipperary, Laois, Meath, Kildare and north County Dublin. The Deputy is correct that the issue of the condition of local and regional roads has been raised with me by citizens everywhere I go and that many such roads are in very bad condition: there are many potholes and ruts and many vehicles are being damaged. That is due to a combination of underinvestment in our roads during the dark years of the recession - the lost decade during which we did not have the money to invest in our public infrastructure - and also the very bad weather that we have experienced in recent times. The total regional and local road budget for this year is €417 million, a very considerable increase of €90 million on last year. I did some metaphorical digging in the past day or two------

The reason I have been given for it not being spent is that local authorities have not been able to get out on the roads to repair them because of the bad weather. Now that the weather is getting warmer and the sun is starting to come out, I expect local authorities to begin work immediately on repairing our local and regional roads and to spend the €417 million that has been allocated to them this year for that purpose. The Government is considering an additional allocation on foot of the storm events and we have asked each local authority to come forward with a costing in that regard. Some have done so and others have not but before we make that additional allocation I would like local authorities to spend the €417 million - €90 million more than last year - that they have been allocated. I understand the weather has been bad and they have not been able to get crews out but the weather is now improving, long evenings are coming and I expect local authorities to get out there, do that work and spend that money.
#MichaelLowry	unknown-#MichaelLowry-party	unknown-#MichaelLowry-dob	unknown-#MichaelLowry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	21	With respect, the problem is they do not have the resources to do the work. Our roads have become virtually undriveable. They are not fit for purpose. They are hazardous. They are dangerous. In fact, they are obstacle courses. The situation is impacting on school buses, dairy collection services, An Post deliveries, bin collection and ambulance services. I am aware of a case last week where a sick elderly person had to be brought out by tractor through a lane to meet the ambulance at the top of the road. That is how bad our roads are. All elected representatives are getting savaged at meetings in rural areas. We have to turn up and explain the unexplainable. It is just impossible. We have a general election on the horizon and this issue must be addressed. If Fine Gael and the Government are serious about re-election they must address the lack of funding for rural roads because after the first week of the campaign half of the canvassers will be in bed because they will not want to face the hostility of the people living down rural roads and lanes.

The Deputy will be aware the local improvement scheme for laneways was reintroduced last year and the allocation for Tipperary is €625,000. That is up from €237,000 for last year. There are increases under all of those headings for Tipperary. It is also important to bear in mind that central government grants are not supposed to cover the full cost of roads. Local authorities are supposed to supplement that funding with their own resources from commercial rates and the local property tax.

As I said, €417 million is available for local and regional roads this year and I understand only a fraction of that has been spent. I understand why that is, namely, because of the bad weather, but we want local authorities to get out there now in the good weather and with the longer evenings to spend the €417 million improving and restoring our regional and local roads. In the meantime the Government will work on additional funding following the storms.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	28	I have two media questions for the Taoiseach. I listened here to the sweet words that were blown up to our friends in the Press Gallery about the importance of the media and how it is central to our democracy. We heard a lot of that in recent weeks. I agree with the Taoiseach. It is interesting today to note that we have the head of global policy in Facebook coming before an Oireachtas committee to answer questions about Cambridge Analytica and the effect of some of the new media companies on the democratic system. I think Facebook is more of a publisher than a platform. The evidence of that in this country is that Facebook and Google are taking in more than €300 million in advertising revenue that previously went, by and large, to Irish media companies. It is the same with Netflix. Figures out today show that its revenue is growing by 20% a year. Spotify's revenue is growing by 30% per year. Sky is taking €500 million in profit out of the country and Irish media are on their knees. I looked to find what the Taoiseach has said and done about the situation. The first thing he did was to get rid of the digital Minister from his Department. I looked at the Facebook page of the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Breen. I learnt a lot about County Clare, a county I love, but I learnt next to nothing about what he had to say in the past year about the digital issues of our time. I sought to find out what the Taoiseach had to say when he went to see Facebook. He was in the beautiful roof garden in the Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park. The Taoiseach said his main purpose was to assure Facebook that the pro-business, pro-enterprise, pro-trade policies that have been pursued in the past would continue to be followed into the future. He could not have been clearer that we would be pro-business. There was not a word about good regulation and high standards, and there has not been a word from the Taoiseach about his thoughts on the matter since we heard about Cambridge Analytica. That is important, given the importance of those companies to us. They are important to my city. Thousands of jobs are involved. We have to get them and we will hold onto them when we have high standards. The world is seeking to invest in places that are not just pro-business, pro-trade and "whatever we can do for you", but have ethics, values and standards. My first question to the Taoiseach is what questions I should put on his behalf to the head of global policy at Facebook with regard to Cambridge Analytica. Is there anything the Taoiseach wants to say to the company following what we have discovered in the past two to three weeks? My second question is how the Taoiseach is going to fund Irish media if all the money is going to Facebook, Google, Sky and others.I asked the Taoiseach this question a few weeks ago in the context of promised legislation, but he had no answer to it. He just said there was a Bill coming. The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, came into the Dáil on the last sitting day before the Easter recess and made a speech in which he effectively said that the Government was doing nothing in funding Irish media. The Government will not take on board the recommendations of the Oireachtas committee which set out how we could raise a pot of between €60 million and €70 million per year that would go to Irish television, radio, music, content creators, film and drama producers. My third question is: what does the Government intend to do? All of the pious talk about the need for legislation to protect sources is fine, but, first and foremost, we need to make sure the companies survive. How is the Government going to fund Irish media if it is not going to accept the Oireachtas committee's recommendations in that regard?

He was, of course, Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources for four and a half years. He had responsibility for this area for four and a half years when he served in office with Fianna Fáil during that disastrous Government which led the country to bankruptcy, never mind individual enterprises. Rather than concentrating on what the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Breen, and I say or do not say, perhaps he might account for his own lack of action during the four and a half years during which he held that office.

He is intelligent enough to develop his own questions. In terms of legislation and regulations, he should be aware that the Government is bringing through legislation on data protection. The GDPR legislation is far reaching and deals very much with privacy and data protection issues. It is real action by the Government and real legislation of the kind that was not brought forward when the Deputy held office for four and a half years. On funding media organisations, as the Deputy knows, there is some State funding for media organisations through television licence fee income which, in the main, goes to RTÉ and also to the broadcasting fund. Beyond that, media organisations are private businesses, independent of the Government, and funded by their customers.

I am proud of my time in government. I am proud that I travelled all over the world to get some of those businesses to come to this country. I am proud that I stood as a Minister against the Department of Justice and Equality that wanted to do all sorts of things with regard to data retention. We had an ethical principle and a vision of where the digital revolution was going, but it is deeply despairing that in the past seven years, for which Fine Gael is accountable, it seems to have disappeared out the door. It is because we need these digital industries, which I support because we need the digital revolution to do a whole load of things, that I want high standards.  The Taoiseach did not answer my second question. He spoke about private businesses and their rights, but RTÉ is not a private company; it is a public company. With all other radio stations, it needs support. We need to increase the broadcasting fund, extend it to the print media and allow people to bid for that funding. The Taoiseach has failed to answer the question on so many occasions. His Government is going to do nothing as Irish media wilt on the vine and all of the business goes to international multimedia companies. That is an insult to the media in this country and a threat to our democracy. The Government needs to fund media if we are to have a proper institution to protect our democracy.

Obviously, in his mind it is okay to cast aspersions, but it is totally indefensible or unacceptable for me to dare to respond or cast them back. That is the double standards one so often gets from the Green Party. It does not just disagree with you; it is also better than you. That is fundamental to its attitude to others and politics.

The report recommends a different way to collect the television licence fee which would require people who do not have a television to pay a television licence fee. We must bear in mind that when we talk about public funding, we are talking about taxpayers' money. We have to consider whether people want to spend more money in funding media organisations or whether they would prefer the money to be spent on other things like education, health care or disability services.

This means there should be no border if it is to be fully optimal. I do not want to get into the bigger matters, such as UK Ministers disagreeing with certain interpretations. The British Government has advertised for 18 customs officers for the Border recently, and that does not augur well for the kind of outcome that everybody has signed up to or at least verbally committed to. I would appreciate it if the Taoiseach could give any update on the Government's response to that and where we are in progressing the matter.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	76	Yesterday, the National Women's Council of Ireland raised very serious concerns in response to a report demonstrating that An Garda Síochána had been overstating the number of sexual offences reported by 26% in 2003 and by 6% overall for the 14 years up to 2016. The National Women's Council of Ireland described the system-wide shortfall of data collection and analysis by State services which interact with victims of domestic and sexual violence as "at crisis point". I put it to the Taoiseach that his Government is simply not delivering on the ambitious policies, legislation and resources necessary to tackle head-on the prevalence of domestic and sexual violence in Ireland. Has the Sexual Abuse and Violence in Ireland, SAVI, 2 scoping group submitted a report to the justice Minister? Will the commissioned report include a review of domestic and sexual violence-related data collection and the analysis by State agencies, information technology infrastructure and cross-agency data management? Will the Government act on the recommendation of Women's Aid to introduce a "no contact until contact is safe" rule for access arrangements in the case of domestic violence?

I am aware of its content and I am also aware of the seriousness of these issues in the context of a recent court case in particular North of the Border and out of the jurisdiction.I appeal again to this House at the start of this term to facilitate the passage of important legislation in the area of justice. I refer specifically to the Domestic Violence Bill. I expect that to be passed, with the co-operation of the House, within three or four weeks. That will deal with some of the issues raised by Deputy Mary Lou McDonald. There are, of course, other issues and that is why over the Easter break I announced a review will be undertaken by my Department in consultation with stakeholders, in particular women's groups, which I intend meeting over the next few days. I will deal with a number of specific questions at 5 p.m. and I would be happy to update the House at any time on the package of measures I intend to review.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	81	I understand the Cabinet approved legislative proposals today to strengthen the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB. There are thousands of students outside this building protesting at rent hikes in Dublin City University, DCU. The latest rent increases by private student accommodation providers will see DCU students paying over €10,000 for a nine month period. That is an extortionate amount of money for students and their families trying to avail of an opportunity for education. The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, trumpeted the fact that the targets for student accommodation are being met. That is of little use if it is unaffordable. As the Taoiseach knows, at present student accommodation units are exempt from the rent pressure zone, RPZ, regulations. They are also beyond the scope of the RTB as they are deemed to be under licence rather than leased under the scheme. When will we see the long overdue residential tenancies (amendment) Bill? When will it be in the House? Will the Government introduce amendments to ensure that student accommodation comes within the full scope of the regulations already in place?

It is not necessarily the case that student accommodation does not come under the RPZ measures. However, meetings have been held between my Department, the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills with special responsibility for higher education, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, and the students concerned over the last two weeks to see if this particular accommodation falls within rent pressure zones regulations. I brought the heads of the residential tenancies Bill to Cabinet today. It is priority legislation. We are working with the Attorney General's office on it at the moment. I hope it will have speedy passage through the House once it is published. If it is necessary during the passage of the legislation to consider an amendment in relation to student accommodation, then that can be considered at that time.

The Clondalkin intercultural centre did something similar. Unfortunately both now face closure due to a lack of €80,000 in funding from the Department of Justice and Equality. How does that tally with the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government, for example, under Culture 2025, on the need to break down barriers in areas of social inclusion and disadvantage and how culture is enriched by greater cultural diversity? Will this cut be reversed so these services can be maintained?

This is her ninth week waiting for a bed in a special adolescent unit in Cork or anywhere. There are up to six cases like this, I believe, in South Tipperary General Hospital, not only blocking the beds but failing desperately. In early January, she was admitted to the paediatric ward and in early February was admitted again. She has been there ever since and has been on 24-hour watch for the past nine weeks. The long wait is taking its toll on her and, indeed, her family.Nine weeks is a long time for a 14 year old, as the Taoiseach knows, especially when she is receiving little treatment to help her cope or understand her deep and profound sense of despair. The three-day programme that she attends gives her a little help but she needs individual targeted treatment. Her family life is hugely affected. The mother has to sleep in the hospital with her as does the father sometimes, and the other children must be attended to as well. This is a crisis in Clonmel and Tipperary, where we do not have a single mental health bed.

Given that those measures were essentially debated in this House under a Bill from the Social Democrats last January and that there was cross-party support for the measures, I take it there will not be any delay in bringing forward this legislation and getting it through the Houses. Will the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, give a commitment that this will happen in advance of the summer recess? Second, I wish to raise the issue in respect of section 50 student accommodation. The Minister says that is being examined currently.

#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	96	I thank the Deputy for the question. The work we are doing currently on to rent sector and people who are renting is something I flagged last autumn in terms of a change management programme to make our rental market more mature. This is the first tranche of legislation but there is a second tranche to follow this year that will update on the first tranche of work. Similar legislation and ideas were put to the House earlier this year. There should not be any controversy in bringing these measures forward. They are positive for tenants and landlords, the vast majority of whom are good landlords and do a good job for their tenants. The pace at which it proceeds though the House is not in my hands but in the hand of the Business Committee and the Oireachtas. I hope we can proceed with it as quickly as possible. If we can get it enacted before the summer I believe it would be important. Again, it depends on the House. I responded to Deputy Howlin's question on student accommodation earlier. I mentioned that we are in the middle of an engagement on those issues currently. On the basis of what comes back from that engagement we will then proceed to an amendment if that is necessary, but it is not clear yet whether it is.

Since last autumn a serious fodder crisis has been developing in this country. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister were far too slow to react in a meaningful way. The only way to explain this is to say they were asleep at the wheel. This has led to animal deaths being recorded at double what is normal for this time of year. Only for the co-operatives importing fodder, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine would never have woken up. Glanbia has promised a €50 payment for each tonne of animal feed purchased during April. Will this be extended by the Department to all farmers and every co-operative as well as backdated to January for farmers who can show receipts for fodder they purchased? This would in some way ease the major financial burden that farmers are under at this time.

The ground has gone so wet now. I heard the Taoiseach saying that the weather was picking up. The Taoiseach may be involved in some way in the weather forecasting and maybe he knows more than I do, but the fact is that if it dried today it would take two to three weeks before land would dry so that a farmer could leave cattle out.Cattle are hungry. Cows are hungry. Lambs are perishing. Farmers' minds are being tested to the limit. Will the Taoiseach and his Government subsidise meals and rations and give farmers some sort of subsidy? As Deputy Michael Collins said, this has been going on since last fall. By November, farmers had used half their fodder.

That is the problem. Some 15% of green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, payments are due to be paid to farmers from the middle of May onwards. I ask that those payments be brought forward and paid now. That would amount to €500 or €600 for most farmers, which is not a great deal of money. I understand there are regulations and that inspections are meant to take place before that happens but they can be set aside in the current emergency circumstances. It is a simple thing that can be done now to relieve this situation and get a cheque in the post to farmers by the end of this week. I implore the Taoiseach to make that happen.

He will be aware that in my constituency in Limerick, we have one of the largest geographical Garda districts in the country, namely, the Bruff Garda district. For years, we have been experiencing the appointment of a superintendent to oversee the Garda district and that person not staying in the role very long and moving on to a Garda district in another part of the country. What we have been experiencing is a revolving door scenario. The position has remained vacant for a long period of time and when we inquired as to the reason, we were told it was to do with the employment control framework. Last week, we were told finally that a person had been appointed to the position in a permanent capacity only to be told in recent days that this person will not now take up the position, which again has left the community flummoxed. It is one of the biggest districts in the country. It has many policing challenges.This has affected morale among gardaí and the area's communities are worried about not having a permanent officer appointed who would stay there for a good number of years and get to know them, as opposed to it being treated as a staging post for other appointments. Will the Minister see to the need to appoint someone to the area on a permanent basis?

The independent Policing Authority also has responsibility in the process. I do not have a personal or ministerial role in the appointment of superintendents to Limerick or any other part of the country. Nevertheless, I will be happy to convey the Deputy's concern to the acting Garda Commissioner.
#JamesBrowne	unknown-#JamesBrowne-party	unknown-#JamesBrowne-dob	unknown-#JamesBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	127	I refer to page 65 of the programme for Government and the matter of mental health, in particular eating disorders and the number of vulnerable children and adults being sent by the HSE to the United Kingdom for treatment. It was recently reported in the Irish Examiner that the President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Peter Kelly, had stated he believed the numbers, particularly of severe eating disorder cases, were such that it would be much cheaper to provide the necessary facilities in Ireland, rather than sending them to the United Kingdom. The General Solicitor for Minors and Wards of Court, Ms Patricia Hickey, stated the situation concerning treatment transfers was not feasible and that it was unfair to rend the people in question from their families. There are only three beds available in the country to treat eating disorders, but none of them is for children. Anorexia nervosa has the highest mortality rate of any mental health issue. When does the Taoiseach propose to provide the necessary treatment in Ireland for these vulnerable children and adults?

What I do know, though, is that sometimes we have to send people abroad to treat rare conditions or for specialised treatment. It is not a matter of money. It is very expensive to send people abroad for treatment, but we do it because sometimes specialised treatment can only be provided in specialised centres in areas with a population of 10 million, 20 million, 30 million, 40 million or 50 million. I cannot say to the Deputy for sure whether it would be viable or possible to have the treatments provided in this country, a country of 4 million or 5 million, but I will certainly mention it to the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, and get back to the Deputy with a more detailed reply.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	129	According to the section on health in the programme for Government, the Government will work with the Oireachtas to sustain annual increases in health budgets so as to improve services to the public. The Government's decision, through the HSE, to not automatically award medical cards to all cancer patients has caused much devastation among people who are already under pressure. For example, persons recovering from cancer can have large chemist bills. Their chemists have been kind enough to tell them not to worry about them for the time being, but they know that they must be paid. I will not prolong this and will only ask the Taoiseach a simple question. Why did the Government make this decision? Can the Taoiseach give people any hope, particularly cancer patients, that they will receive a medical card? It was my belief this would happen, but it has fallen by the wayside.

Like every other Deputy, I deal with a number of clients who are cancer patients. They have applied for a medical card because they have cancer. I have dealt with cases of people who, despite having applied online, have still not achieved a result. They have been diagnosed with serious cancers. There are different types. On behalf of the families who are under enormous stress having been told that their loved ones have cancer, I plead with the Taoiseach to consider this matter and have the medical card applications dealt with immediately.

There was a practice introduced by the previous Government. The then Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, and I introduced what we called the spring economic statement. Last year, it became the summer economic statement. When will the spring or summer economic statement be published and when will the amount of fiscal space available for October's budget be known? The objective was we would have a clear indication of the fiscal space available at this time of the year so we could have a proper debate. It is doubly the case when we have an Oireachtas committee that is supposed to scope out the options for Government and democratise the Government process. Is that still to be the case? I understand from reading the Sunday Independent, the Government plans to change its budgetary stance and move away from tax cuts towards funding what is described as working family social PRSI benefits such as childcare, parental leave and so on. Is that true? Will we have press releases determining these matters or will we have a debate on options within the Oireachtas as we envisaged? A new schools capital programme was published last week to deal with schools in population-pressure zones which caused great consternation to schools that have been waiting many years for very significant refurbishment and replacement schools. Will there be an additional capital plan to deal with that?
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	139	Other speakers have mentioned the real distress and pressure the ongoing fodder crisis is causing. Farmers are paying at least double the normal cost of feed which is an unbearable pressure for them. It is a scandalous situation. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine met in emergency session last week but the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, has yet to outline any comprehensive plan to deal with the fodder shortage. That needs to happen urgently. Unfortunately, he was not in the Chamber today. The Minister said last week that he was prepared to talk to banks about credit for farmers and was prepared to pay for the transport of silage from one end of the State to the other. He also said he would not issue vouchers for feed concentrate to alleviate the very real animal welfare problems. Teagasc advised subsidy of, and access to, these meal concentrates. My colleague, Deputy Martin Kenny, asked that the Minister start paying the 15% outstanding green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, payments. That is a very sensible suggestion. Will the Minister do that? He should pay the farmers now because the need is real and acute. His prime responsibility is to Irish farmers who are in crisis, not to the EU rules. The transport subsidy scheme has been a failure and has merely resulted in the price of fodder rising and in spreading the shortage. Had the Minister spent the same amount of money on vouchers for meal as he spent on the transport subsidy and as advised by Teagasc we would not be in the situation we are now in. The Taoiseach did not respond to the earlier questions on this subject. I await his response and hope it will be more positive than that from the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Doyle.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	140	It seems to me that the most elementary function of a government in order to have a functioning economy is that its citizens can exist in that economy at the most basic level. Students from Dublin City University, DCU, gathered outside Leinster House today because they have been asked to suffer an increase in rent from €4,500 per year to €8,700. For many that means they will leave education. An open letter was written today by a student nurse who is leaving nursing studies because after paying for her accommodation and her bills she has €4 a week left to live on. Even somebody on average industrial earnings is paying 70% of their income to meet average rents, which are now between €1,800 and €2,000 in Dublin city. Does the Taoiseach recognise that if students, people on low income, nurses and a vast number of our citizens cannot put a roof over their heads we have a serious economic problem? Does he recognise how serious the problem is? Talking about limiting rent increases to 4% against that background is worse than useless, a futile exercise in closing the stable door after the horse has bolted. Does he not need serious emergency measures to bring the cost of accommodation down to a level where people can exist?
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	141	For the past month or three weeks there has been enormous pressure on agriculture. People say there have been 12 dry days since 23 July 2017 resulting in a crisis. The agriculture industry is fantastic. Yesterday, my constituency colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, announced the reopening of the Chinese market. Many people, officials, Ministers and successive Governments have worked extremely hard for a long time to get everything right but none more so than the farmers, the primary producers, who have adhered to the highest possible regulations in the way they conduct their business. The majority of farmers are excellent at what they do and produce a top quality product. We must make sure we have sustainable agriculture. Yesterday, at a Dairygold meeting, a farmer told me that the former Minister in the Department, Deputy Coveney, had said six or seven years ago that there were exciting prospects for agriculture. There was nothing exciting about it yesterday when 2 inches of rain were falling. Herds face health challenges and farmers and their families are under real pressure. The weather pattern is that when autumn is very wet there will be a late spring, although this is not scientific. The Department has to have a unit to prepare for this type of crisis. It is only five years since the last one. There was one in 1985-86 and in 1998-99. The crisis needs to be considered holistically and not just in an immediate way.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	142	Has the economy committee in the Department of Finance undertaken any work on the impact of quantitative easing on economic performance? What is the likely impact of the unravelling of the quantitative easing over time on interest rates and our economy? I think there are issues bubbling in the background that have not been properly interrogated, notwithstanding other medium-term risks. I share Deputy Howlin's concerns about schools. There seems to be a woeful lack of planning in the announcement of schools. Many schools announced four or five years ago in my constituency and around the country are on split sites or in prefabs. There is no planning and they are in crisis because they have no accommodation or very poor accommodation. It baffles me that those schools, which have heard the type of announcements we heard last week, have not been prioritised although many of them are in dire straits, because there is a lack of follow through. The Government has a tendency to fail to act on a problem until it becomes a crisis. That tendency is manifested in housing, health and the fodder crisis. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine said a couple of weeks ago that there is no issue with fodder and it is a simple matter of transporting it around the country. A week later the co-operatives imported fodder from Britain. Something that could have been dealt with much earlier was allowed to become a crisis causing much stress and strain to the farming community.

I am looking forward to it. It is going to be a good weekend. Notwithstanding speculation in newspapers, the Government's overall budget policy remains unchanged. It is to be prudent first of all and to continue to reduce the deficit. We still have a deficit so we will continue to reduce it and also the debt. While our debt has come down, it is still very high. Our national debt works out at roughly €45,000 per person. That is a consequence of the financial crisis and the lost decade, which Members will have heard me speak about before. When we entered the financial crisis, the debt per head in Ireland was approximately €15,000. Although we are in a good position, with the economy being strong, with the fall in the deficit and in unemployment and with incomes rising, and with all such trends going in the right direction, the country is still dealing with many legacy issues, not least the enormous debt placed on the heads of people. It now stands at €45,000 per head. As well as reducing the deficit, we need to reduce the debt. The most important thing is that the Government will be prudent in the decisions it makes on budgets. We will not adopt the policy of the past – the if-I-have-it-I'll-spend-it procyclical economic policy. I encourage Opposition parties not to go back to that philosophy in their demands in the run-up to the budget. After that, it will be matter of investing on a two-to-one basis in favour of investment and public spending. I refer to spending on infrastructure and public services. It will also be a matter of finding some space for tax reductions, particularly focusing on middle-income earners and the fact that people on very modest incomes pay income tax at the highest marginal rate. The average person working full-time in Ireland earns €46,000 per year. If he gets a pay rise, does a bit of overtime or gets an increment or promotion, he finds more than half of it is taken away in income tax and PRSI. We would like to raise the threshold further and allow more people to keep more of their hard-earned money. With regard to the fiscal space, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, prefers not to speak of that and instead prefers to talk about the fiscal stance, which takes into account issues wider than the question of how much money is available to allocate. I refer to the deficit, for example. We would all agree that no matter what the fiscal space is, we should not have a higher deficit next year. The economy is going well. When the economy is going well, one should try to reduce and eliminate the deficit so there will be some headroom should the economy slow down. No matter what the fiscal space is, we should still try to reduce or eliminate the deficit. We should still be trying to reduce the debt. That is why we have put forward the concept of the rainy-day fund, or of setting aside some money for a downturn in the economy, if it occurs.

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	153	In terms of what is available to allocate in the budget, it is important to state most of what may appear as so-called fiscal space is already allocated. We have already announced that capital expenditure will increase by €1.5 billion next year. That means extra money for housing and health care, such as the children's hospital. The cost of that really falls into next year. There is to be further investment in transport. This is good expenditure but it is already committed. Also to be considered is the impact of increased public sector pay. There is a further pay increase for public servants in October. The full-year cost of that next year has to be borne in mind. This is good spending. It is extra money for teachers, nurses and gardaí but it does mean the money has to be taken out of the budget for next year. Also, there is the full-year cost of the increases in social welfare for jobseekers, lone parents, the disabled, carers and other groups who have seen a welfare increase in the past few weeks. The full-year cost of that has to come out of the allocation for next year also. Also to be considered are the demographic effects of an ageing population. There is to be an extra €200 million for pensions, and there is to be an additional health care cost. Taking into account the full-year cost of measures already announced and committed to, including the costs of demographics, pensions and health care, the figure amounts to well over €2.5 billion already. When one looks at the figures in that way, one sees that what is left to be allocated for new measures in the budget is quite small. With regard to the capital plan for education, we are building more schools and providing more school places than ever before. In fact, we doubled the number of additional school places provided since 2010. Some 9,000 new school places were created in 2010. In 2017, we provided 18,000 additional school places. The capital budget of the Department of Education and Skills has increased by 56% since 2012. That is a major increase. It had been slashed by 40% between 2007 and 2010. Prefabs are only ever a temporary solution. There are quite a few classes in prefabs in St. Mochta's in Clonsilla, which is in my constituency, but that is because a whole new school is being built. The children are in the prefab while the school is being rebuilt. Back in 2008, at the height of the so-called Celtic tiger, when there were many fewer children in school, there were 2,000 prefabs. Now, after a big-----

That contrasts significantly with the position in 2008, when there were more children in prefabs but fewer children in school. At that time, there was a much worse situation than currently. With regard to the capital allocation for education, that is outlined in Project Ireland 2040. Some €8.4 billion has been provided for investment in school buildings. That is up from €4.9 billion in the previous ten years. In the last ten years, just under €5 billion was allocated for school buildings. That increases to €8.4 billion for the next ten years. That includes the prefab replacement scheme, commencing in 2019; the deep refurbishment of existing buildings; the modernisation of science and PE facilities, which is very important now that PE has become a subject for the leaving certificate; and also investment in digital technologies in schools.

Cabinet committee B last met on 26 March and while the date of its next meeting has not yet been scheduled, it is likely to meet next month. The committee covers the areas of social policy and public service reform, including education, children, social inclusion, Irish, arts and culture, and continued improvements to and reform of public services.  Through the work of Cabinet committee B, the Government is keen to ensure policies and services not only protect the most vulnerable in society but also provide opportunities equally for all citizens to learn, work and prosper, irrespective of gender, race or social status. The Cabinet committee aims to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of commitments in A Programme for a Partnership Government and provide the opportunity to shape proposals on issues such as equality, disability and disadvantage, which require input from multiple Departments. Recent measures advanced include ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with a Disability, which will come into effect on Thursday; gender equality measures; and implementation of structures and funding to support the North East Inner City Initiative, which seeks to bring a transformational change to an area that has struggled with deprivation for many generations. Budget 2018 measures included an increase of €5 across all welfare and pension payments. Working family payment thresholds increased by €10 per week for low-income working families, and the national minimum wage was increased to €9.95 per hour. A social impact assessment of budget 2018 conducted by the ESRI confirmed that these measures are effective in ensuring everyone is benefiting from the recovery. It also finds a similar progressive pattern in budget 2017 measures, with the biggest gains going to those on the lowest incomes.

I will just focus on the issue of pensions reform because I know the Government published a roadmap on it recently. The Oireachtas has been waiting since last year for Government amendments to the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill to deal with issues that affect defined-benefit pension schemes, in particular. The Taoiseach will be aware that there are ongoing and growing numbers of disputes over pensions provision. He will know the controversy over the CIÉ pension scheme. There is a certain irony in that the staff of Irish Life, the largest pensions provider in the State, went on strike last week because their own defined-benefit scheme is to be suspended as and from June. When will the legislative provisions to deal with these matters be advanced?The Bill is in limbo since last year. Will the budget include provisions for auto-enrolment in pension schemes in order that robust provision can be made for people's pensions into the future? The Taoiseach will recall that we, in government, substantially changed the public pension scheme to make it affordable into the future. We need to have general provision throughout the economy for pensions into the future. Will there be a State contribution alongside contributions by employers and employees to ensure robust payments are set aside to provide properly for ageing citizens?

I would like to return to the issue of housing and homelessness, which was raised in the previous batch of questions, because I think we can agree that those without a roof over their heads - individuals and families in homelessness - are among the most vulnerable. I understand the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government is bringing forward a new set of proposals. He believes they will tackle issues for tenants in the private rented sector and I hope he is right. The proposals include a rent register and an increase in the minimum notice period. We will support anything that is credible, progressive and has a prospect of working. We have been saying for a long time that tougher sanctions are needed for landlords using illegal notices to quit and for breaches of the rent pressure zone, RPZ, legislation. We welcome the fact that the proposed legislation will make it a criminal offence for landlords to increase rents in RPZs above the 4% cap, but this must also apply to letting agents, online rental platforms and to student accommodation. We have to make sure that new sanctions are enforced. I would like to raise one glaring omission from the legislation, which is the Focus Ireland amendment. This would prevent buy-to-let landlords who benefited from tax breaks from seeking vacant possession if they seek to sell their property. We need to restrict the criteria for issuing notices to quit. Landlords can use them when a family member needs the property. This clause should be removed from the Residential Tenancies Acts. The proposed Bill is set to be first substantive piece brought forward by the Minister since assuming office almost a year ago. When will it be published? Will the Taoiseach confirm that it will include some of the measures I have described? Most important, contrary to his position in 2016 when Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil voted down the sensible and proportionate Focus Ireland amendment, will he ensure that the amendment is inserted in the legislation because it is necessary and it would be a tiny step in the right direction?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	159	The Taoiseach did not answer my final question about the unaffordability of rent and accommodation and, therefore, I will try again. DCU students were protesting outside Leinster House earlier. They are being asked to swallow a 30% rent increase, bringing their rent up to almost €9,000 annually. This is because student accommodation was not covered by the Government's inadequate rent cap legislation. Will the Taoiseach do something for the DCU students and other students who will be unable to continue their studies if they are asked to swallow these rent increases? Does he accept that a 4% rent cap is ineffective? Even the imposition of criminal sanction in the legislation mooted earlier by the Minister would be a futile, half-baked exercise in closing the door after the horse has bolted because the problem is rents are unaffordable. Will the Taoiseach please address this point? There is no point limiting average rents of between €1,800 and €2,000 in Dublin to a 4% annual increase. Rents need to be reduced to affordable levels. These average rents equate to 70% of the income of the average worker. That is not sustainable or payable. I mentioned the young student nurse who wrote an open letter to the Minister for Health about how nurses are going home at the end of the week in tears because they only have between €4 and €6 left in their pocket after they have paid their rent. I ask in all sincerity what the Taoiseach will do about that. If all the Government is promising is to limit unaffordable rents to 4% annual increase, that is a complete waste of time.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	160	I have just been thumbing through an article by Tony Connelly of RTÉ regarding our economic growth figures. Apple iPhone exports account for 25% of our growth according to an IMF estimate. Earlier I asked the Taoiseach about quantitative easing and low interest rates. There is a great deal to be unearthed yet from our economic data in the context of a discussion on the economy. With regard to social policy and public services, the public, unfortunately, does not have confidence in a range of public services, with housing and health being the top two. The rental issue is, as has just been articulated, putting enormous pressure on people on a number of fronts such as young people who move to cities for work and so on. A significant proportion of their income goes on rent and they are left with little disposable income. The lack of security of tenure for many families has led to the homelessness crisis and continues to compound that. Fundamentally, there is a lack of supply. The Department of Finance conducted an analysis of the lack of action two years ago in the context of incentivising supply. That is needed. The rental market is contracting in some regards despite all the talk. The number of units available now is lower than two or three years ago and, therefore, we have a critical issue on the supply side that needs to be dealt with. With regard to the health sector, we need honest budgeting and transparency at the core of what it will take to make sure people do not have to wait inordinate times to access basic treatment, surgery and consultants. The figures, unfortunately, have not improved by any significant yardstick.

I will begin with Deputy Howlin's questions on the roadmap to pensions reform that has been agreed and published by Government. I am committed to this. I started this work as Minister for Social Protection and I am keen to drive it through to completion if I have the opportunity to continue in my current office. We have run into some difficulty getting it right when it comes to further protections for defined benefit, DB, schemes. We still intend to have the legislation processed before the summer recess but we want to protect members and former members of DB schemes in such a way that this does not put companies out of business. Legislation that would put the entire deficit on the shoulders of the employer could put companies out of business in many cases and, as a consequence, cause people to lose their jobs and their pensions. In other cases, and this would apply to semi-State companies, in particular, while it might not put a company out of business, the legislation would make the company's debt so high that it would be unable to invest anymore. That would have a serious impact on the public good because large State-owned enterprises need to be able to borrow to invest in infrastructure and if they cannot do so because the pension scheme deficit has to be put on their balance sheet, that would create huge problems for society. Whatever we do, we have to get it right. We are not quite in the position that we have that right but we are still working on it. We anticipate having a social welfare and pensions Bill enacted before the summer recess. Auto-enrolment will commence in 2021 and it will be very much targeted at the private sector.Nearly everyone in the public sector has a pension, a reasonably good pension in most cases, and pays into the fund. Two thirds of those in the private sector have no pension provision, other than the State pension. That is an enormous inequality with which we need to deal. We are setting the date at 2021 because we need time to prepare. First, we need to put the legislation and systems in place. We also want to give employers, employees and their unions notice that this will happen. If employers or employees are required to pay into a pension scheme fund, that will impact on business plans and wage demands. We want to give people good notice. As part of our renewed and deepened engagement with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, and IBEC, we are working very closely with them on these proposals because we want to do it on a tripartite basis, with the Government working with employers and unions to get it right. It will not work without support from IBEC and ICTU. We are very keen to have them on board. It is intended that there will be a State contribution roughly similar to what is available under the current tax relief system. Roughly one third of whatever contribution an individual makes would be the State's contribution. We intend to publish a straw man proposal - a rough outline - in June as to how this will work and allow people to comment on it. Giving people in the private sector decent pensions is one of the really big changes we could make. Two thirds of them have no pension provision beyond the State pension. If we can do this, we will have done a good service for them when they retire. It will not make a huge difference for those who are now in their 50s or 60s, but it will make a huge difference for persons who are now in their 20s, 30s and 40s. It is a big long-term change and reform with which I want the Government to be associated.

I travelled to Berlin on 20 March for a bilateral meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel as part of my strategic engagement with our European partners. We discussed preparations for the March European Council, including Brexit, trade, Economic and Monetary Union, EMU, and the tax challenges of digitalisation. I also took the opportunity to congratulate the Chancellor on her recent re-election for the fourth time.  On Brexit, we welcomed the previous day's agreement between the task force and the United Kingdom that a backstop for the Irish Border, agreed to in December, would have to be legally operative in the withdrawal agreement, to apply unless and until an alternative solution was agreed to. I took the opportunity to thank the Chancellor for her ongoing support and solidarity for our unique concerns arising from Brexit, especially the need to protect the Good Friday Agreement and ensure there would no be hard border on the island of Ireland.  I updated the Chancellor on my meeting with President Trump in Washington the previous week. As representatives of countries that both support free and fair trade, we shared concerns about the President's approach to steel and aluminium tariffs and looked forward to clarification on the exemption process for the European Union, which was forthcoming later that week.  On Economic and Monetary Union, we agreed on the importance of ongoing work by Finance Ministers, with a view to decisions in June in areas where agreement was strongest such as completing banking union and further developing the European Stability Mechanism.  On the tax challenges of digitalisation, we agreed that all companies, including large digital platforms, should pay their fair share of tax based on where value was created, not simply where a transaction happened. We will continue to engage actively with ongoing work at both Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, and EU level. I highlighted my concern that unilateral EU action had the potential to damage EU competitiveness and disadvantage smaller member states and also that it might result in a retaliatory response from the United States. We did not have a broader discussion about corporate tax rates, which are clearly a matter of national competence. Ireland's 12.5% rate is long-standing Government policy and remains the centrepiece of our competitive tax offering. The Chancellor and I agreed more generally that Europe must adopt a positive approach to digitalisation and that our approach should not be insular. That means a digital Single Market that is open, competitive and innovation-friendly, with high levels of protection for personal privacy and the free flow of non-personal data. Our exchanges also covered bilateral relations, which are excellent. I look forward to the further strengthening of this relationship in the period ahead as we tackle the urgent demands of Brexit and play our part in shaping the European Union's response to new challenges and opportunities. This work will be guided by the comprehensive review of relations between Ireland and Germany that was published by the Tánaiste last Thursday. It is entitled, Ireland and Germany, A Wider and Deeper Footprint.  I also met the Mayor of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel, on Easter Sunday for a brief courtesy call. As well as discussing the mayor's programme in Ireland, we discussed Brexit and political and economic developments in Ireland and the United States. After that, he attended the Leinster game in the Aviva Stadium as my guest. Forthcoming visits include a speaking engagement in the university in Leuven on 26 April; the EU-Western Balkans Summit in Sofia, Bulgaria, on 17 May; and the European Council in Brussels on 28 and 29 June. A number of other visits are also envisaged. They will be announced once they are confirmed.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	172	With the United Kingdom leaving the European Union, the Franco-German axis is becoming more central in determining the future of the European Union, the dynamics of which will change. It is welcome that the Taoiseach travelled to Berlin last month to meet the Chancellor. German support for the Irish position of avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland will be very important coming up to the June summit and perhaps the October summit too. I hope it is firmly in place. I know from my experience that Germans are very interested in the peace process and want to see it maintained. I hope the Taoiseach impressed on the Chancellor the important role small nation states have to play in the evolution of the European Union. He has stated we are willing to pay more into the EU budget post-2020, which is reasonable. His meeting took place against the background of a Commission proposal for a digital tax and the ongoing push for a consolidated corporate tax base and the harmonisation of corporation tax generally. There are also discussions on the reform of the eurozone and its governance. I know that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, has allied Ireland with northern EU states in that regard. Did the Taoiseach impress on the Chancellor the tax rules and rates for individual member states and that there was to be no weakening of tax sovereignty as far as individual nation states were concerned? If he did, what was the Chancellor's reaction?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	173	Yesterday the Government issued its latest Brexit briefing, which is startling since it seems to be already out of date. The bulletin points to the schedule of meetings in Ireland agreed to for the negotiations. What it does not state is that the schedule is already well behind. The most crucial meetings intended at co-ordinator level were delayed and are no longer due to be separated from other negotiations. I do not know whether the Taoiseach discussed that matter with the Chancellor. The bulletin also talks about the key issues being decided in June, but yesterday the Tánaiste admitted that there had been no substantive progress and said everything might fall apart. I know that conflicts with the Taoiseach's position and that he does not see a problem with everything being delayed until October. However, the Tánaiste has a different view. Will the Taoiseach tell me why the co-ordinators' meeting was delayed and if he was consulted about the move away from the agreed schedule of meetings? Will he explain if he agreed that the meetings would no longer be focused solely on Ireland but could be linked with a meeting on the overall final status negotiations? I am sure he will accept that this flies in the face of an earlier claim that negotiations on the backstop had been decoupled from negotiations on the final status of UK-EU relations.

Does the Taoiseach ever raise questions with it about its policy of providing pretty much uncritical support for Israel, particularly given what has happened? Before the Easter break, I warned the Taoiseach in this House that innocent, unarmed protestors would be shot by Israeli snipers. That was two days before it happened and the Taoiseach did not answer the question. I asked him to speak up if people were killed, but the European Union has remained silent. Unarmed protestors marched to vindicate international law. The right to return is part of international law, as confirmed by United Nations resolutions. Some 34 unarmed Palestinians were shot for trying to assert their rights under international law.No Israeli diplomats were expelled and there was no threat of sanctions or discussion of military strikes or other measures. Does the Taoiseach think he should speak up to the leaders of other European Union countries, Germany in particular, who do not like to criticise Israel, and tell them this is not acceptable and that Europe should take action and sanction Israel for this murderous activity?

The Taoiseach has in the past agreed with me that we must have a better structure for debate on Brexit issues. I want my party to be supportive of the Government position because it is in our national interest that, by and large, the House be united in terms of its thinking on and approach to this issue. Although I do not wish to be discordant, I am a little concerned that there seems to be a divergence of views coming from the Government. At the weekend, I heard the Taoiseach's view which gives comfort to those in the United Kingdom who are positing the position that it will be all right, we can have a normal relationship after Brexit and everything will be fine. Some in Britain are campaigning for the final settlement to be put to a vote. That is in our national interest and I hope that all Members will work to that end. The Tánaiste, Deputy Coveney, has stated that if we do not see substantive progress on the alternative to a backstop by June, then we will not see it by October. However, the Taoiseach has stated that it will be grand if we do not see it until October. We must have much clearer, sharper and more joined up messaging. I would like the opportunity for us to debate these issues in the House such that we can all be on message and be clearer in the message we are giving to the United Kingdom authorities in particular.

Several recommendations contained in the Ombudsman's report have not yet been complied with by the Minister and his Department. What is being done in respect of those recommendations and when will those outstanding be implemented?
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	188	I am fully committed to honouring the commitments of the previous Government, of which I was a member, in respect of the Magdalen redress scheme.  As the House is aware, a total of €25.9 million in lump sums has been paid to 691 applicants under the Magdalen laundries restorative justice scheme.  In addition, qualifying applicants receive additional benefits under the scheme, including an enhanced medical card from the HSE and top-up pension payments from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. Last November, the Ombudsman published a report which was critical in certain respects of the administration of the scheme by my Department.  The Ombudsman made four recommendations, namely, that women who worked in the laundries but were resident in adjoining industrial schools or training centres should be considered under the scheme; cases under the scheme where there has been a dispute over length of stay in an institution should be reviewed; assistance should be given to women who lack capacity to accept compensation; and central guidance should be developed in respect of any future restorative justice or redress schemes. The recommendation to consider residents of adjoining institutions raises some issues which will be addressed by an interdepartmental group as part of the process of implementation and I will be consulting with the Ombudsman as I take this process forward.  Last week, the Taoiseach and I, together with our officials, met the Ombudsman to discuss the recommendations in his report.  The meeting was positive and constructive. Today I brought a memorandum to Government to update my Cabinet colleagues on the recommendations and the steps I am taking to implement them as quickly as possible, including a review of cases where there has been a dispute over length of stay and the provision of assistance to applicants who lack capacity.  There will also be a focused and time-limited assessment of the modalities involved in applying the scheme to residents of adjoining institutions and of any related issues.  I intend to return to the Government with final proposals on implementation. I will be working with the Ombudsman on the implementation of each of his recommendations and will be very happy to keep the Deputy and the House updated on progress on these issues.
#JimOCallaghan	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-party	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-dob	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	189	I welcome that the Minister met the Ombudsman last week. However, it is important that we recall that the report of the Ombudsman was produced and published five months ago. When he produced his report, he provided in it evidence of significant maladministration within the Department in terms of the operation of the scheme. The Ombudsman came to that conclusion having conducted an investigation after 27 women complained about the fact that they had been denied redress. He considered their complaints and those of others. It is important to note that there are several issues currently outstanding with which the Minister must deal. Firstly, the Department has not yet complied with the recommendation of the Ombudsman that women who worked in Magdalen laundries as children but were registered on the rolls of other children's institutions should be allowed into the scheme. That matter must be dealt with. Secondly, the Minister raised the issue of the women who are deemed to lack the capacity to administer their financial affairs. Those women need assistance from the State and an advocacy service to act on their behalf. Thirdly, we must recognise that the Minister's Department has not yet complied with the recommendation to bring in an independent reviewer to reassess the applications of women given payments which reflect less than the time they stated they had spent in the laundries.

The principal recommendation is that my Department should, with a view towards admitting them to the scheme, fully reconsider the applications of women who worked in one of the listed laundries but were officially recorded as having been admitted to a training centre or industrial school located in, attached to or on the grounds of one of the laundries. Deputy O'Callaghan will accept that that raises a series of issues as to the scope, purpose and administration of the scheme and in terms of how we might best move matters forward. The Ombudsman's recommendation refers to applications already received relating to a training or an industrial school located in the same grounds as one of the 12 named institutions. However, it could not be restricted to existing applicants and would, therefore, at a minimum, extend the scheme to other institutions.

The State owes them an obligation. The scheme brought forward by the previous Government should be applied in a generous way. It is regrettable that that has not been done to date. I hope that the Minister's recommendations will ensure a more generous application of the scheme for the women concerned. I wish to thank the Minister for the fact that he is now facilitating the women meeting. I understand that invitations to an event launched by the Lord Mayor are being sent out by the Department of Justice and Equality and I commend the Minister in that regard. However, we must fully recognise that many of these women need further support from the State and the community. The Minister must consider the fact that many have not received the full health and community care package recommended by Mr. Justice Quirke. Many of them have been very significant impacted as a result of being denied that care. I ask the Minister to bring an urgency to the matter. It is regrettable that such urgency has been lacking to date.

The first relates to benefits under the jurisdiction of the HSE in respect of health and medical care, while the second relates to benefits within the remit of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in respect of pensions. It is important that we ensure such issues will be dealt with. I thank the Deputy for his comments on the conference for Magdalen women which is scheduled for June this year. It will be an excellent opportunity for those women who wish and are able to attend to meet others and participate fully in the events which will form part of what is an interesting conference programme. I recently met the group that is closely involved in organising the event. I have committed to providing funding towards the cost, while officials of my Department are working closely with the women involved in order to ensure it will be a memorable and positive event.

While some of it relates to a case taken outside this jurisdiction, it is still a fact that the number of cases brought in this jurisdiction from complaint to criminal conviction is very low, at in or around 8%, and that there are deficiencies and problems in how cases are tried. I wrote to the Minister and the justice committee on 29 March to propose that a review be carried out of the manner in which rape cases and sexual offences were tried. The Minister proposed a related initiative. I ask him to outline that proposal in greater detail.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	194	The deeply personal nature of a sexual offence impacts greatly on the victim. The prosecution of such offences must be dealt with in a sensitive manner, with respect for the rights of the accused person and the complainant. Although in a different jurisdiction with a distinct set of court procedures, the recent case in Northern Ireland has, rightly, brought out into the open conversations on consent and the way sexual offences are dealt with in the courts. I am aware that there have been reports this week on discrepancies in statistics for sexual assaults. I know that An Garda Síochána is working with the Central Statistics Office, CSO, and the Policing Authority to ensure the issues related to crime statistics will be resolved as a matter of urgency. Much work has already been done to protect complainants in sexual offence cases from any additional trauma arising from the criminal process. There are many existing provisions aimed at supporting the complainant in sexual offence proceedings, including restrictions on public attendance at the trial and press reporting. Complainants are entitled to legal advice and representation through the Legal Aid Board in certain limited circumstances. An Garda Síochána has introduced measures to ensure complainants will be dealt with sensitively in investigations into sexual offences. Appropriately trained staff have been placed in divisional protective services offices to investigate these difficult crimes. Three of these offices have been established and at least four more will be established this year, with work in hand to expand the network to cover all Garda divisions by the end of next year. The enactment of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2017 last year was a significant development of the law on sexual offences, putting in place a statutory definition of consent to a sexual act. The Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017 also has enhanced protections for victims of crime, including victims of sexual offences. While these developments have been extremely positive, I believe it is timely to take a broader look at the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences to identify any scope for further practical or legislative steps to support victims of sexual offences, while fully respecting the rights of the accused. As I have announced, I am drawing up proposals for such a review which will, of course, involve consultation with relevant stakeholders and take account of other proposals which have been made in this area such as the recent report by an inter-agency group headed by Rape Crisis Network of Ireland on vulnerable witnesses. I am working to finalise the terms of reference of this review shortly. I will be happy to keep the House updated on these matters.

We must ensure it will be a report that delivers. The number of complaints that proceed to a conviction is about 8%, which is extremely low. The recent revelations on the overstating of the number of sexual offences reported are also very concerning. They were overstated by 26% in 2003 and 6% overall for the 14 years to 2016, which, unfortunately, underlines the fact that there are still issues arising in the management of data by An Garda Síochána. What I want to hear from the Minister is when he intends the report to be completed and what actions he intends to take on foot of it because we need to see the recommendations proceed into legislation once the review has been completed.

I have arranged meetings in the coming days with many of the stakeholders involved, with particular reference to women's groups which have been advocating change for some time. I also intend to meet representatives of the legal profession who encounter the matter of evidence within the courts on a day-to-day basis. I acknowledge that legislation has recently been enacted in this House, with particular reference to the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act and the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act of 2017. I am really keen to enact two other pieces of legislation at the earliest opportunity, one of which is the Domestic Violence Bill, on which I have worked with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton. I believe it can be enacted in its entirety in this House within a few weeks. There is also the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) (Amendment) Bill 2018, the main purpose of which is to provide for presumptive minimum sentences for repeat sexual offenders. I will shortly bring to the Cabinet the general scheme of a sex offenders (amendment) Bill which will propose a number of amendments to the Sex Offenders Act 2001. In addition, I intend to continue my ongoing discussions with An Garda Síochána in order to resolve difficulties with or remove confusion about the current mode or method of compiling Garda statistics in such a way that it will be transparent and inspire confidence.

In addition to the review, other actions can be taken before it is completed, given that legislation is passing through the House. Women's Aid has proposed that there be a "no contact until contact is safe" rule arrangement. The Domestic Violence Bill would be an appropriate location for such a measure. If an amendment is brought forward in that regard, will the Government consider supporting it? In recent years there has been some controversy and criticism of the inconsistency in sentencing for sexual offences. I am meeting the Minister this week to discuss the Judicial Council Bill and the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill and I hope he will consider sentencing guidelines in the context of the Judicial Council Bill. That would be appropriate and proper.

That Bill is before the House and, like a considerable number of pieces of legislation in the justice area. I am anxious to ensure the full co-operation of the House in order that such important legislative measures can be placed in the Statute Book before we rise for the summer recess. I take on board what the Deputy said about the Women's Aid report. I was not present this morning as I was attending the Cabinet meeting, but my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, has discussed some very important and sensitive issues that were raised at the meeting. In the context of my deliberations, I am keen to reach out to advocacy groups in order to ensure we can have the best possible supports for women, girls and victims. I intend to do this. I also acknowledge the facilities in place for victims in courts throughout the land. I refer to the multimillion euro Courts Service budget for courthouses, the most recent of which was opened in Waterford.The standard courtroom facility will now have victim support rooms and suites for vulnerable witnesses. I am keen to ensure that the court is no longer a place of intimidation or discomfort or a strange place, particularly for victims of sexual and domestic offences.

We also have proposed amendments to legislation in this area going through the House at present. At the same time we have a situation whereby Garda statistics in respect of breath testing cannot be relied on by policymakers or the public. In the context of recent criticism by the Road Safety Authority, RSA, of the number of personnel allocated to the Garda traffic corps, what is the Minister going to do to ensure that the traffic corps reaches the numbers that are needed to protect people in this country?
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	201	I should say at the outset that the distribution of Garda personnel, including the allocation of gardaí to roads policing duties, is exclusively the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner. I have been informed by the Commissioner that the strength of the Garda traffic corps stood at 635 on 28 February 2018, the most recent date for which figures are to hand. In addition, I understand that there is one chief superintendent and two superintendents attached to the Dublin metropolitan region traffic corps and a superintendent and traffic inspector attached to each of the five regions. However, the Deputy will appreciate that road traffic legislation is enforced as part of the day-to-day duties of all members of An Garda Síochána as well as through targeted enforcement operations. The current modernisation and renewal programme for An Garda Síochána places a strong emphasis on the role of the traffic corps being expanded to include crime prevention and detection on the roads through the establishment of divisional roads policing units. The policing plan for 2018 contains concrete measurable initiatives to keep our roads safe to protect lives and reduce serious injuries, including strengthening the numbers assigned to roads policing by 10% year on year. I am pleased to say that the Government has ensured that funding is in place to support the implementation of these initiatives. This year 800 trainees will graduate from the Garda College in Templemore, 200 of whom attested last month. Taking account of projected retirements, this will see Garda numbers increase to 14,000 by the end of 2018. In this context, I understand that the Garda Commissioner intends to assign in the region of 150 additional gardaí on an incremental basis to roads policing duties this year to support better outcomes in road traffic enforcement and crime prevention. I am informed by the Commissioner that regional competitions for assignment to roads policing duties commenced last year and that 136 gardaí and 13 sergeants have been successful in these competitions. As of last Friday, I understand that an additional ten sergeants and 71 gardaí have been assigned to roads policing units nationwide. The Commissioner expects to make further assignments in the near future.
#JimOCallaghan	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-party	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-dob	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	202	While I am fully aware that the allocation of resources is a matter for the Garda Commissioner, the Minister for Justice and Equality has a responsibility to ensure effective road safety in this country. I tabled this question because at the beginning of February this year The Irish Times reported that the chief executive of the Road Safety Authority had written to the acting Garda Commissioner to express concern over the failure by the force to meet its own commitment to a 10% increase in the strength of the traffic corps by 31 December 2017. That is not merely a matter of the allocation of resources. A commitment was given by An Garda Síochána that there would be a certain percentage of gardaí allocated to road safety, but that has not happened. This failure is a matter of severe concern to the chief executive of the RSA and should also be a matter of significant concern to the Minister. I note that a commitment was made to increase the strength of the traffic corps by 10% by the end of 2017 and by 10% in the following year, 2018, but that has not happened. The statement in respect of this by a spokesperson for the RSA is noteworthy in that it says it is of serious concern that the commitment in the Garda policing plan for 2017 to increase resources incrementally for roads policing units by 10% across all regions by the end of 2017 "has not been delivered". We need to work on this.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	203	An Garda Síochána undertakes a programme of high visibility road safety and enforcement operations which are carried out in partnership with other State agencies. I acknowledge the work of the RSA in this regard. By working together with the RSA and other agencies, An Garda Síochána will continue to confront dangerous road user behaviour through public presence, legislative enforcement and education in a partnership manner. Road safety is a shared responsibility and one which the Government takes very seriously. Ireland's current road safety strategy, 2013 to 2020, aims to place Ireland consistently on the list of the safest countries in the EU and beyond. To achieve this, we continue to work together in partnership with all of the relevant stakeholders. I attend meetings of the ministerial committee on road safety along with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the RSA, An Garda Síochána, the Attorney General and other agencies. This committee, which met six times last year to oversee the implementation of the road safety strategy, provides a forum for high level discussion of road safety issues. The committee is due to meet again in the coming weeks. The policing plan commits An Garda Síochána to implementing the roads policing plan for 2018 in line with the national roads strategy, working in partnership with the RSA.

That is a statistic that we must take extremely seriously. We must try to resolve this problem, and the method by which we can seek to deter people from driving with alcohol in their system is to conduct a large number of breath tests on our roads. That is something that was recognised in the Crowe Horwath report which recommended that An Garda Síochána should be seeking to test 20% of the driving population annually. That is the only way to deter such behaviour. We need to ensure that more resources are allocated to the traffic corps, but since 2009 there has been a significant decline in the strength of the traffic corps in the Dublin metropolitan region. In 2009, a total of 156 members of An Garda Síochána were allocated to the traffic corps in that region, but by 2017 this had fallen to 105. That is a significant decline for which the Minister bears a responsibility.

This major investment will allow An Garda Síochána to deploy the latest cutting-edge technologies in the fight against crime and will facilitate progress on important reforms. It will also ensure that road safety issues are dealt with in the manner expected. The capital plan has seen an investment of €46 million in the Garda fleet to ensure that An Garda Síochána has a modern, effective and fit for purpose fleet. This is in addition to the investment of almost €30 million in the period from 2013 to 2015. In total, over the period from 2013 to the end of 2017, almost €44 million has been invested in the fleet, with some 2,000 Garda vehicles coming on stream in that period. The national development plan provides for continued funding in these areas. While I accept that there is no room for complacency, 2017 represented the lowest number of road traffic fatalities on record, at 159. I am sure that the Deputy will agree that it is imperative that the positive momentum across road traffic enforcement and road safety initiatives is harnessed towards further annual reductions in fatalities and I am assured the plans to increase the numbers assigned to the traffic corps will support that.

#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	207	It may assist the House to recall that the O'Higgins Commission of Investigation was established to examine allegations relating to the Cavan-Monaghan division of An Garda Síochána, particularly allegations of serious Garda failures in the investigation of criminal offences.  The commission also examined the action taken by the Department of Justice and Equality on foot of certain complaints made to the then Minister. I have been assured that officials in the Department provided full information and co-operated fully with the commission.  I have been assured that there was extensive and full disclosure of documents on foot of detailed discovery orders made by the commission. A number of officials gave evidence before the commission.  I am advised that at no stage did Mr. Justice O'Higgins express the view that the Department had not fully co-operated with the commission. The judge acknowledged in his report the co-operation the commission had received from all persons. The commission's key finding in this respect was that the initial complaint made to the then Minister in 2009 was dealt with appropriately. No criticism arises in that regard. Furthermore, the commission found that reports to the Department from the confidential recipient were taken seriously and addressed promptly.  With regard to a complaint against the Garda Commissioner, it concludes that a request to the Commissioner for a report was entirely reasonable and appropriate. It also concludes that the decision that no further steps were warranted at the time by the Minister, or by officials, took account of all relevant factors and was appropriate. These findings suggest that the Department provided full information to the commission and co-operated fully with it. The second part of the Deputy's question relates to a review that was carried out by a former High Court judge, Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill. Mr. Justice O'Neill was asked to review allegations contained in two protected disclosures that had been sent to then Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, and to advise her on the most appropriate way to deal with them.  I am informed that my Department provided the said protected disclosure letters to Mr. Justice O'Neill and responded to all requests for assistance made by him.  I am further informed that in the course of his review, other correspondence received by the Department was forwarded to Mr. Justice O'Neill for his consideration. I am assured that my Department provided Mr. Justice O'Neill with all the information he required.  Arising from Mr. Justice O'Neill's preliminary review and following cross-party consultation, the Government established the Disclosures Tribunal, which is currently examining these and other matters.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	208	I thank the Minister for his answer. My questions arise from the public information we now know. In light of the Minister's answer, I ask him to email everyone in the Department of Justice and Equality to ask them if they believe all information was provided, in particular to Mr. Justice O'Neill. The Minister mentioned in his reply that "other correspondence" was provided. I want to make sure that was comprehensive. In light of what is coming out of the tribunal, I am not sure how credible it is to suggest that all the information was provided. If all the information was provided from the Department of Justice and Equality, which led on the setting of the terms of reference for the Charleton inquiry through this House, surely that Department would have been fully at the centre of that inquiry. I call on the Minister to ask his officials to state comprehensively whether all information - not just "other" information - was provided, particularly to Mr. Justice O'Neill. I remind the House that Mr. Justice O'Neill's report did the groundwork and was the basis for the tribunal that is now sitting.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	209	As the Deputy is aware, the Department of Justice and Equality made extensive disclosure and discovery to the Disclosures Tribunal. It is now a matter for the tribunal to determine. I remind the Deputy of our previous debate on this issue. He will be aware that Mr. Michael Collins, SC, has conducted an external review of the Department's discovery of documents to the Disclosures Tribunal.  Mr. Collins identified certain shortcomings, particularly arising from the filing of electronic communications. These shortcomings are being addressed.  It is important to note that Mr. Collins found that there was no attempt by the Department to conceal information from the tribunal in any way. He found that my predecessor and departmental officials acted in good faith at all times and believed they were acting reasonably in the manner in which they conducted searches for documentation.  He concluded that in his view, there was no evidence of failure by the Department to comply with disclosure orders. He acknowledged that this is properly a matter for the tribunal itself ultimately to determine.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	210	I ask the Minister again to give this House an assurance by asking the officials in his Department to state comprehensively whether all information, and not just "other" information, was provided. There is a limit to how many times I can ask the Minister to do this. He can choose to do it. He does not have to do it. We can ask questions. It seems to me that it is nonsense to suggest that the terms of reference for the tribunal, which we agreed in this House, would have been the same if the information which has come into the public domain had been provided to Mr. Justice O'Neill. There would have been a whole module on the Department of Justice and Equality. The Minister has said that the Department gave full disclosure to the tribunal. I remind him that it did so last December after I had spent months asking numerous questions which we will not go back into. It was only then that this information was produced by these officials and others. I do not think it is credible for the Minister to say here that he is 100% certain that everything was given to Mr. Justice O'Neill. I believe that if the information which has come into the public domain had been given to Mr. Justice O'Neill, his report would have been different and the basis on which the current tribunal is sitting would be different. In such circumstances, there would be a whole module relating to the Department of Justice and Equality. I would not have had to drag all this information out of the Department and into the public domain. There would be new witnesses and new information would be provided to the Department. I do not want to end up going down another road whereby we have to ask numerous questions to get information. Will the Minister ask the officials what I have called on him to ask them? By doing this, he will cover himself as well.

While I am concerned, I am also confident that the Department of Justice and Equality has taken important lessons from its experiences over the past year. The new measures that are actively being put in place by the Department are aimed at ensuring an oversight of any kind cannot happen in the future. These plans were referred to and endorsed by Mr. Michael Collins SC in his report, which was published last month. I listened to Deputy Kelly when he spoke on certain aspects of that report. These new measures include the use of specialist IT consultants where needed for discovery and the establishment of a separate unit to interact with tribunals and commissions. Mr. Collins's report points to the absence of a systematic system for filing emails in the Department. This is under review. A review of parliamentary questions relating to Sergeant Maurice McCabe was undertaken by the Department and published in January. A search of approximately 30 million emails, which was undertaken by an external IT company, ultimately resulted in the identification of 79 additional documents of potential relevance, many of which related to the drafting of a single statement. The review also noted that the search provides an appropriate degree of confidence that the Department of Justice and Equality has identified and supplied all material of potential relevance to the Disclosures Tribunal. The Department is engaging constructively with the effectiveness and renewal group, which has been asked to take account of this review and its findings in its ongoing work.

It is extremely important for the Government to be fully committed to this. Just as criminals use technology to advance their criminality, law-abiding people and the State's law enforcement agencies should use technology to ensure criminals are caught when they carry out their criminality. What is being done? How much money is being spent on CCTV? I ask the Minister to update the House on the Government's proposals.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	214	As the Deputy has evidenced, A Programme for a Partnership Government commits to supporting investment in CCTV systems at key locations along the road network and in urban centres.  Progress is being made with this commitment in a number of ways. In pursuance of this commitment, a community-based CCTV grant aid scheme was launched by the Department of Justice and Equality in April 2017 to help groups to set up community-based CCTV systems in their local areas. Under this scheme, which is being administered by the Department, eligible community groups can apply for grant aid of up to 60% of the total capital cost of a proposed CCTV system, up to a maximum grant of €40,000.It is intended that the scheme will run for three years from April 2017 with funding of €1 million being made available each year. To date, four applications under the scheme have been approved, with approved funding totalling almost €120,000 and schemes to be established in Counties Wexford and Wicklow. A further four applications are under active consideration and another three applications have been returned to the applicants concerned to enable them to provide the information necessary to qualify for grant aid. That scheme supplements the existing network of CCTV systems in operation in the State. I understand there are approximately 35 Garda CCTV schemes in operation throughout the State, comprising in excess of 500 cameras. In addition, there are approximately 45 community-based CCTV schemes in operation encompassing over 360 cameras to which An Garda Síochána have access, supported under the previous grant aid scheme funded by my Department. As a condition of the scheme, there is a requirement for prior support of the relevant local authority, which must act as data controller. This is a long-standing statutory requirement, set out in the Garda Síochána (CCTV) Order 2006. Full details of the grant aid package, including guidelines, application forms, code of practice and other relevant documentation, are all available to download from my Department's website, www.justice.ie. Guidance is available to help local groups in both rural and urban areas to apply for this important funding and I am keen to ensure that groups take full advantage of the availability of this funding.

Very large crowds attend those meetings and they are not turning up to see me. They are attending because of significant concern among communities both rural and urban in respect of crime. An issue consistently raised at these meetings is the necessity to have more CCTV cameras in the vicinity as they act as a deterrent. We can see in certain communities where CCTV cameras are used that they deter criminal activity. Unfortunately, the scheme introduced by the Government is extremely laborious and complicated; it makes it very difficult for local communities to apply for it. For example, it requires the local authority to be the data controller in light of the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, which we will discuss later today. It also requires proof that the design of the CCTV system is acceptable to local residents in terms of location of equipment and privacy rights. It also requires proof that the applicant can provide the necessary funds to sustain the project for a five-year period. I note the Minister indicates there are approximately 35 Garda CCTV schemes in operation but we need more and the Minister needs to make it easier to apply for them.

The statutory parameters governing CCTV, including the longstanding statutory requirement for the local authority to act as data controller, is something I am anxious to ensure that applicants are familiar with. In this regard I assure the House that there has been extensive consultation with stakeholders, including the County and City Management Association, the Local Government Management Agency, Irish Rural Link and individual community groups interested in the schemes. I have, however, asked officials to look at options to publicise better the availability of the scheme. As I stated, support and guidance is available to help interested groups apply for the funding. I strongly encourage any interested groups to contact my Department for assistance. I am pleased to say a dedicated email address is available for this purpose, communitycctv@justice.ie.

One way by which they would be given greater confidence in local communities would be if the Government played a more proactive role in seeking to roll out a CCTV scheme for rural areas. We know many crimes committed in rural areas are by gangs using the motorways, coming to rural locations and attacking certain areas and leaving immediately afterwards on the motorway system. We need to ensure that people doing that type of criminal activity recognise that there is a threat that they will be apprehended by being spotted on a CCTV system. In order for this to work effectively, we need to have this run by An Garda Síochána. I know it is well intentioned for local communities to try to put a scheme together but it is extremely difficult for local people in communities to find the wherewithal to fill out the application form and come with part-funding for these schemes. We need to see this for what it is; it is an opportunity for An Garda Síochána and the State to defend communities against criminal activity and it should be rolled out on a more active basis by the Government.

I can confirm that services under the Garda safety camera contract commenced last May and provide an annual minimum of 90,000 hours of monitoring and surveying vehicle speed across over 1,000 designated safety camera zones. It should be noted that expansion of the use of technologies, including CCTV and automatic number plate recognition, is included under the Garda Commissioner's modernisation and renewal programme. The intention in this regard is to utilise modern technology to identify key criminal and terrorist targets and to enhance community safety. These developments are underpinned by significant Government investment, with €205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT, as well as approximately €46 million to provide An Garda Síochána with additional high-powered vehicles to ensure that gardaí can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent, detect and tackle crime in communities.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	219	I understand the reason for the suspension of the transfer of sentenced persons, which is due to the High Court and Supreme Court judgments of the past few years, but I do not understand the reason for such a prolonged delay in resolving the matter. I appreciate that this is complex and legislative or administrative changes may be necessary. The problem is now several years old and both the prisoners and their families do not see an end in sight right now. Will the Minister please provide an update on his attempts to resolve the matter?
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	220	I recently published the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Annual Report 2017 on my Department's website and laid the report before the Houses of the Oireachtas. This report outlines Ireland's operation of the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Acts during 2017. In July 2016 the Supreme Court dismissed the State's appeal in the case of O'Farrell, McDonald, Rafferty v. The Governor of Portlaoise Prison. The case concerned an appeal taken by the State against a judgment of the High Court ordering the release of the three named prisoners who had been transferred to Ireland from the UK under the provisions of the Transfer of Sentenced Prisoners Acts 1995 to 1997. The judgment is detailed and has complex implications for the process of transferring prisoners from other states, and in particular the UK, to Ireland. As of 11 April 2018 there are 29 applications on hold following the Supreme Court judgment and 23 of these applications are from the UK. The principal issue in the judgment is the significantly different sentencing systems that operate in the UK and in this State. In particular, the judgment raises the issue of how best to adapt and administer under Irish law a foreign sentence that contains features not found in Irish sentences. This is important, as it is not possible to operate a prisoner transfer system where there is uncertainty on the part of either the transferring or receiving State as to the length of sentence to be served by the prisoner concerned. The complex legal and administrative implications of this judgment are being examined by my Department in consultation with the Attorney General's office. Detailed legal advice has been received and an amendment of the Transfer of Sentenced Prisoners Acts will be required. Work is under way on drafting that amendment and I will bring a proposal to the Government as soon as possible. In the meantime I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that all the applicants and officials in the appropriate sentencing states have been informed of the situation.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	221	As I understand it, if a prisoner applied for repatriation before July 2016, the prisoner should have received a letter from the Irish Prison Service advising of the current situation and indicating that the application is on hold. However, if a prisoner applied for repatriation after July 2016, no processing of the application has taken place. The Minister can correct me if I am wrong about that. Given the substantial backlog in applications, will the Minister confirm if there has been a complete suspension of any and all activities in the processing of these applications? A family has been in contact with me which has a son in prison in Australia. That family is seriously upset and frustrated but they made a very sensible proposal.It is that, while we are waiting for the legislation to be amended, all necessary steps in respect of paperwork and other tasks to facilitate transfers should continue to be processed as far as possible. This would speed up the transfer of prisoners when the suspension is eventually lifted as many administrative and other tasks that can be done in the meantime will be completed and fully up to date. It would also let the prisoners and their families know they are not being abandoned and there is some hope.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	222	There are 29 applications on hold from applicants wishing to transfer to Ireland to serve the remainder of their sentences within this jurisdiction. These applications include 17 from the UK, four from Northern Ireland, two from Australia, which I think is one of the two of interest to the Deputy, one from France, two from Scotland and three from Spain. On the basis of legal advice received, let me assure the Deputy that we are examining those applications made by prisoners in countries other than the United Kingdom. Sentences imposed there may not require adaption. This examination is ongoing. I understand it includes the specific case referred to by Deputy Wallace. The examination will be completed as soon as possible and I would be happy to engage bilaterally with the Deputy on the case he referred to.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	223	I thank the Minister and will make contact with him. The Department previously indicated that the necessary legislative changes would be considered in the context of the European Union framework decision 2008/909/JHA which governs the transfer of prisoners between EU member states. The heads of a Bill to transpose the framework decision has been approved since 2013 but has not been brought before the Dáil. Is there progress on this? We agree this is a human rights issue. The argument for encouraging the transfer of sentenced persons has a strong basis in international human rights law. One of the main reason for the transfer of prisoners is to prevent others from being punished for someone else's crime, namely the parents. As can be imagined, if a person is in jail in Australia it is incredibly harsh on the parents. They can never see their child, irrespective of what he or she has done. The person is serving time in prison for what he or she has done but the parents should not be punished as well. I am glad of the Minister's point about making contact and I look forward to doing that.

I refer to how we manage our prisoners here and those transferred back or into this jurisdiction in accordance with Irish law. The policy of the convention, which is based on humanitarian considerations, is to overcome difficulties that might be posed for prisoners serving sentences in foreign jurisdictions. I refer to such difficulties as the absence of contact with relatives and differences in language and culture that may apply from time to time. In this respect, it has long been established Government policy that, whenever possible, prisoners should be permitted to serve their sentences close to their families. I ask the Deputy to appreciate that there are some complex legal and administrative issues here which arose on the decision of the courts. We are working through them and I would be happy to keep the House informed on progress on this issue.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	225	I should state at the outset that the distribution of Garda personnel, including the allocation of newly attested gardaí, is exclusively the statutory responsibility of the Garda Commissioner. Notwithstanding the Commissioner's responsibility, I have provided for the record, in tabular form, the detailed information requested by the Deputy. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that, as of the 28 February 2018, the latest date for which figures are available, the strength of the Mayo division was 328. When appropriate, the work of local gardaí is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the armed support units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. I assure the House that the Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime. To make this a reality for everybody, the Government has in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, including 15,000 Garda members.  Real, tangible progress has been made towards this goal. Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of last year, a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. The Deputy will be aware that in 2010 a previous Government closed the Garda College and imposed a moratorium - the measures imposed at that time had a negative impact on garda numbers across all divisions and the legacy of these decisions continues to have consequences for policing. When it had brought about an early exit from the bailout and stabilised the public finances in September 2014, the then Government responded and the college in Templemore has since reopened and just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda Síochána and are performing mainstream duties nationwide, 19 of whom have been assigned to the Mayo division.Probationer Garda Allocations 2015 – 2018*

#LisaChambers	unknown-#LisaChambers-party	unknown-#LisaChambers-dob	unknown-#LisaChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	226	We know that the Minister's Government likes to hark back to 2010 and even further back. However, we need to deal with 2018 and current Government commitments. If the Minister says he has increased the Garda numbers in Mayo up to 328, that means an increase on last year of a grand total of 12 extra gardaí for the entire county. Last year, the figure for the traffic corps in Mayo was 11. To put that into perspective, in 2010 it was 27. Even if we take all of the brand new shiny 12 gardaí that the Minister has managed to give County Mayo this year and put them all into the traffic corps, we would still only be at 23. If we went back eight years we had 27. We are not actually getting to grips with the deficit in Garda numbers in Mayo. I appreciate that much of the focus of this Government appears to be more on the urban centres but rural crime, whether the Minister likes to accept it or not, is a massive issue. It is frightening people. They do not feel that they are properly protected because they know they do not have adequate numbers of gardaí. Will the Minister confirm how many gardaí went into the traffic corps and is he satisfied that an increase of 12 gardaí for a county the size of Mayo is sufficient to provide the policing that he has just articulated?
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	227	I have the figures in front of me for the division Garda numbers for December 2009 to now. There are more gardaí now in County Mayo than there were in 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010 and in 2009. I can go back further if the Deputy wishes. However, I am pleased that funding has been provided to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce. This year a further 800 new Garda recruits will enter the Garda College. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during this year and 200 of these attested last month. Taking account of projected retirements, Garda numbers are on track to reach a total of 14,000 by the end of this year. The focus on investment in personnel is critical. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of gardaí. Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities, enhance Garda visibility within our communities and enable the Commissioner to provide additional resources across every division, including the Mayo division as new Garda recruits come onstream.
#LisaChambers	unknown-#LisaChambers-party	unknown-#LisaChambers-dob	unknown-#LisaChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	228	I have the figures provided by the Minister's Department in front of me as well. While we have an increase this year, my point is that it is 12. That is minuscule. The figure was on a downwards trajectory from 2011 to 2016. The increase is really only bringing us back up to 2008 levels. My point is that we need to police our country and enforce our laws.We also have a second challenge born of the controversies with An Garda Síochána in recent years. We need to rebuild confidence. Let us consider the strength of the traffic corps. At the end of last year we had 11 members of the traffic corps in County Mayo. Even if we directed all 12 of the new gardaí assigned to Mayo, which is unlikely to happen, we would still only be at 23, which is below the 2010 level by four. There was a commitment that the traffic corps numbers would increase by 10% by the end of last year, but that did not happen. The numbers were meant to increase by a further 10% this year. Will the Minister tell the House whether that will happen? It is important that justice is seen to be done and that we enforce our laws. However, I do not believe the Minister or his Department are doing enough to rebuild the confidence that has been lost in An Garda Síochána because of the numerous controversies that have shaken the force in recent years. County Mayo deserves the same level of commitment as other parts of the country.

As Minister for Justice and Equality I have no direct role in this matter. If I had, I imagine Deputy O'Callaghan and others would have something to say about it that might not be too complimentary. I am assured that Garda management keeps the distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities, including road traffic issues, to ensure optimum use is made of these resources. I assure the House that the Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country to maintain the strength of community engagement and provide reassurance to citizens. Members will be aware that the increase in Garda numbers last year represented the first significant increase since numbers stared falling in 2009, and that is good to see. It is great that we have been able to drive this level of recruitment. It has seen the number of gardaí assigned to the Mayo division increase by 30 as of 28 February last, the latest date for which figures are readily available, as compared with the end of 2014. Undoubtedly, the investment in resources and the ongoing recruitment process will support Garda activities and enable the Commissioner to provide additional resources to County Mayo in response to the Deputy's submissions.

What steps does the Minister believe can be taken to encourage victims of sexual assault and rape to make complaints if they have been the victims of those criminal acts? I imagine we can agree that one of the significant policy issues or problems that needs to be addressed is that significant numbers of victims are deterred from making official complaints when they have been the victims of crime. What steps does the Minister believe should be taken to deal with that?
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	231	As the Deputy will be aware, the Government has given significant consideration to law on sexual offences in recent years, including with regard to the needs of the complainant. The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 provides for a statutory definition of consent and other measures that give protections to complainants during court proceedings. I intend to bring forward further legislation this year, including the criminal law (sexual offences) (amendment) Bill 2018, the general scheme of which has been published. The Bill will deal with sentencing for sexual offenders. Further legislation will strengthen post-release supervision of sex offenders. Other provisions serve to protect complainants in sexual offence cases from any additional trauma arising from the criminal process, including restrictions on public attendance at hearings and on press reporting. An Garda Síochána has begun a programme of establishing divisional protective services offices with specially trained staff to investigate these difficult crimes. The recently enacted Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017 has significantly enhanced protections for victims of crime, including victims of sexual offences. The Deputy will also be aware that complainants in sexual offence cases can access legal advice in certain limited circumstances. This is given effect through the Legal Aid Board, which provides a legal advice service free of charge to complainants in prosecutions for certain rape and sexual assault cases. A person seeking this service is not required to undergo a means test or to make any financial contribution. A legal aid service is also provided in certain rape and sexual offences cases where the complainant's prior sexual experience has been raised by the defence in the course of the trial. In these instances the Legal Aid Board will appoint a solicitor and a barrister to represent the complainant where the issue of previous sexual history is being raised. This service is also available without a means test. In this context, I am examining the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences as a whole to identify any scope for further practical or legislative steps that would support victims of sexual offences while fully respecting the rights of the accused.
#JimOCallaghan	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-party	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-dob	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	232	We need to try to identify why so many victims of sexual assault and rape do not report the crime. Part of the reason is that in many instances they know the perpetrators, but it is unquestionably the case as well that another part of the reason is that they are deterred by the process. Part of the reason they are deterred by the process is that they think it is an alien process and one under which they will be challenged. This can mean issues in respect of their personal lives may be unnecessarily exposed. We need to do something to create greater legislative support for people who are victims of crime and who are deterred from making a complaint in respect of sexual assault or rape. One method by which we could do this is to ensure that any individual who makes a complaint to An Garda Síochána in respect of sexual assault or rape would be given legal advice immediately by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. This legal advice could include advice on the process involved for such an individual. Many people are unaware that victims will have to give statements, other relevant witnesses will have to give statements, disclosure will have to be made to the person accused if there is to be a prosecution, and that subsequently there will be a trial at which the victim will have to give evidence and be cross-examined. We need to recognise that the lack of knowledge and awareness on the part of victims in respect of this matter is acting as a deterrent. We need to encourage them.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	233	I am open to hearing from the Deputy about any submissions, observations or draft legislation. I know he has introduced some legislation in this area. I welcome that and I give my commitment to Deputy O'Callaghan, Deputy Ó Laoghaire and other Deputies that I am keen to listen and engage to ensure we can have the best possible legal system to deal with these deeply sensitive and personal issues. The Government recently approved the drafting of the criminal law (sexual offences) (amendment) Bill following publication of the general scheme earlier this year. The main purpose is to provide for presumptive minimum sentences for repeat sexual offenders. The Bill also contains provisions relating to the crime of incest. I will shortly bring to Cabinet the general scheme of a sex offenders (amendment) Bill. The scheme proposes several amendments to the Sex Offenders Act 2001 following a review of the management of offenders under that Act. The scheme includes several amendments to notification requirements on the sex offenders register under the 2001 Act as well as provisions for electronic monitoring of sex offenders and court powers to prohibit a sex offender from working with children. The important thing is to ensure that our courts system is no longer a cold and distant place for complainants or victims of crime.
#JimOCallaghan	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-party	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-dob	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	234	The Minister is correct in saying that Fianna Fáil will be introducing legislation seeking to give effect to what I outlined earlier, that is to say, providing legal aid to a victim of sexual assault or rape at an early stage at the time he or she makes the complaint. We should bear in mind that the accused gets legal aid from the time the complaint is made. There should be a similar structure of to provide support to victims of such crimes. We believe it is important that they be provided with legal aid at an early stage as well as legal representation in certain limited circumstances. We should recognise, however, that no matter what changes we make to our legal system, there will always be a difficulty when we have two conflicting accounts of what occurred on a particular occasion. If one person states that there was consent and another person states that there was not consent, we will always have a difficulty unless we have extraneous evidence corroborating one side or the other. No matter what system we have, it will always be difficult to determine where fault lies or if fault arises when we have two conflicting accounts in respect of consent. In any event, that should not deter us from trying to come up with new measures that will provide support to victims so that they can make a complaint in the knowledge of what will happen. No one could complain if we had a fair and supportive system that allowed a complainant to make a complaint and that allowed the process of justice then to take its course.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	235	While the Deputy spoke of the matter of consent and the definition of it, and the legal position surrounding consent or the absence thereof, I want to refer to the recently passed Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act which introduced, for the first time, a statutory definition of consent to a sexual act. It states that a person does not consent to a sexual act if they allow the act to take place due to the application of force, or the threat of the use of such force. It also states that a person cannot consent if they are unconscious, asleep or intoxicated from alcohol use or any other substance. It further states that a person does not give consent if they are mistaken as to the nature or purpose of the act. I agree with what Deputy O'Callaghan said. We can look at that further. At the request of the Attorney General, the Law Reform Commission has undertaken to examine and make further recommendations on the issue of a reasonableness test for an honest belief of consent. In the context of the review that I recently announced, I intend to meet Rape Crisis Network Ireland and other representative groups in the next few days. The legal protections for complainants will form part of that review, which will include consultation with relevant stakeholders and take account of proposals made in this area such as the recent Rape Crisis Network Ireland convened interagency group report on vulnerable witnesses. The terms of reference of this review are currently being finalised. I would be happy to keep the House informed. I acknowledge the contributions of Deputies Ó Laoghaire and O'Callaghan and others in this area, and I would be happy to commit to working with them.

It was a shocking case. Garda Tony Golden was a very popular community garda. I would like to hear the Minister's response to the need for a public inquiry into this incident.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	237	Garda Tony Golden lost his life in October 2015 serving his community. His death on that day has robbed the Golden family of a dearly loved husband, father, brother and son. A young woman suffered serious injuries as a result of the events of that day and she has also endured a great deal. It is important that we are sensitive to those who suffered so greatly as a result of the dreadful events in Omeath. As the Deputy is aware, in late 2017 I received a report from the Garda Commissioner in regard to the review by the Garda authorities of the events surrounding the fatal shooting of Garda Golden. Conscious of the gravity of the matter and concerns expressed publicly by local public representatives, I decided in the public interest to publish the Garda report by laying it before the Houses. Following consultation with the Attorney General and the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, the report was subject to a number of minor but necessary redactions for legal, data protection and security reasons. I would emphasise that the key and clear finding of the review was that the actions of Garda Tony Golden were beyond reproach.  He was an exemplary member of An Garda Síochána. While the report highlights, inter alia, that two incidents of domestic violence were not recorded in accordance with the relevant policy and procedures, the report indicates it does not appear that the classification of the incidents was a causative factor in these tragic events in the night of the shootings. The House should note that certain allegations in respect of the tragic events at Omeath are the subject of two investigations by GSOC and that these investigations are ongoing.  GSOC, as the Deputy will appreciate, carries out its work independently and it is essential that it should be allowed to do so without hindrance. Since these dreadful events, I am informed that An Garda Síochána has taken necessary actions in a number of areas, especially in supporting vulnerable victims of crime, particularly where incidents of criminality occur in a domestic setting. I note also that the Policing Authority continues to monitor the work of An Garda Síochána on the classification of crime.

Notwithstanding that, significant matters of public interest are raised by the report and the events in Omeath in 2015. The report acknowledges, in particular, that the two incidents of domestic violence were not recorded properly by the Garda and that the report should have been taken at the first Garda station to which they presented. It also acknowledges that Craven Mackin's record of involvement with weapons and explosives was not disseminated to the general Garda membership in County Louth or noted on the system despite the special detective unit having knowledge that Craven Mackin was a dangerous individual. This failure meant that Garda Golden was not informed of Craven Mackin's history of violence and possession of weapons. I want to hear the Minister's response as to why that would have been the case, whether he is satisfied that was an appropriate way for the special detective unit to act and whether Garda Golden and his colleagues should surely have had the information that Craven Mackin was a dangerous individual while dealing with that case.

I know there has been comment on the decisions made in respect of the charging of an individual with certain offences but it is important to make the point that the decision in respect of prosecution of offences are matters for the Director of Public Prosecutions who is fully independent, in accordance with the law, in the discharge of these functions. Such independence, being the cornerstone of our criminal justice system, has served the State well and it should be respected. It would not be fair of me at this stage to comment on certain allegations that have been made and allegations that are before the independent Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission in any event.
#DonnchadhOLaoghaire	unknown-#DonnchadhOLaoghaire-party	unknown-#DonnchadhOLaoghaire-dob	unknown-#DonnchadhOLaoghaire-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	240	The Minister spoke of allegations but what I quoted are statements of fact outlined in the Garda's report. The Minister has repeatedly made reference to GSOC. It is stating very clearly that it does not have the resources or the capability to reach this. That is not a satisfactory answer for the family or with respect to the matters of public interest. This is clearly an issue that needs to be dealt with. I believe it requires a public inquiry. The review report states that a comprehensive investigation file was forwarded to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions on 10 May 2017. However, the Minister responded to Deputy Adams in December last, six or seven months after that, that the criminal investigation by the Garda Síochána was still ongoing. Therefore, why was the family not informed of this development in May 2017 and why, when the matter was raised with the Minister, was Deputy Adams not told that the investigation had concluded? Clearly, it had concluded six or seven months in advance of that. I would like an answer to that question. How did it happen that either the Minister was not informed or did not put the correct information on the record and why was the family not informed in an appropriate way? It is clear that if GSOC is not capable resource-wise, or otherwise, of dealing with this matter, surely there is a need for a public inquiry.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	241	I have two issues with that. First, regarding Deputy Adams, I met him on this issue. I kept him fully informed. I do not have the date of the meeting with him but I was keen at all times to keep the Deputy, as the local representative, fully apprised of the position. Second, regarding GSOC, I agree with Deputy Ó Laoghaire that there is a strong case for GSOC's staffing and resources to be increased. It is not in anybody's interest that there is any perception that GSOC cannot fulfil its statutory mandate for want of resources. I will continue to do everything in my power to ensure that GSOC has the appropriate level of resources it requires. I received a proposal from GSOC on 19 February. GSOC's business case envisages both short-term and medium-term staffing demands with a longer-term business case dependent on changing legislation. The business case seeks a total of 37 extra staff in the short to medium term. Some 24 of the additional staff would be for the investigations-operation side of the organisation, with the remaining 13 being administrative. That business case is currently being examined and will be the subject of further discussion with GSOC and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. It is important to note and recognise that GSOC's budget was boosted by €1 million to allow it to engage external staff to carry out an investigation into certain allegations.

Notwithstanding that responsibility, I have provided in tabular form the detailed information requested by the Deputy. I am informed by the acting Garda Commissioner that, as of 28 February, the latest date for which figures are available, the strength of the Cork north division was 326. When appropriate, the work of local gardaí is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the armed support units, the National Economic Crime Bureau and the National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. The Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance for citizens and deter crime. To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, including 15,000 members of An Garda Síochána. Real, tangible progress has been made towards this goal. Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017, a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. The Deputy will be aware that in 2010 a previous Government closed the Garda College in Templemore and imposed a moratorium. These measures had a negative impact on Garda numbers across all divisions and the legacy of these decisions continues to have consequences for policing. When it had brought about an early exit from the bailout and stabilised the public finances, the then Government reopened the college in September 2014. Just under 1,800 recruits have since attested as members of An Garda Síochána and are performing mainstream duties nationwide, 20 of whom have been assigned to the Cork north division.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce. This year a further 800 new recruits will enter the Garda College. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, 200 of whom attested last month. Furthermore, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of 2018. This focus on investment in personnel is critical. We are rebuilding the organisation and providing the acting Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of gardaí. Undoubtedly, the ongoing recruitment process will support all Garda activities, enhance visibility within communities and enable the acting Commissioner to provide additional resources across every Garda division, including the Cork north division, as new Garda recruits continue to come on stream.Probationer Garda Allocations 2015 – 2018*

I do not want to go down that route but to ask a sincere question of the Minister. There were a number of reconfigurations of the Garda division covering the Kanturk, Mallow and Macroom areas from 2012 to 2014. A commitment was given at the time that the position would be reviewed and that numbers would be increased over time. The issue is that Kanturk Garda station which was the mainstay for the Duhallow region was closed and part of the staff were transferred to Macroom and Mallow. Some of the Kanturk area to within a mile or two of Kanturk Garda station is now being covered from Macroom. While the gardaí operating from there are very fine and doing a great job with limited resources, I asked the Minister how many new recruits were deployed to north Cork. If he wants to go down the political route, we can do so, but I am asking him in good faith to outline the plans for the Garda division and whether it is likely Kanturk Garda barracks will be reopened on a full-time basis following what happened between 2012 and 2014.

We are on the run-in. As I have raised questions about this matter many times before, I will not go into all of the detail. Will the Minister update the House on the position regarding the provision of CCTV systems? It was agreed between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in the programme for Government that CCTV cameras would be erected at all motorway junctions. As I have not received a satisfactory answer to this question before, I will ask it again. Can it be done? Will a timescale be set? Gangs are travelling from the main cities to rural Ireland via motorways in order to rob people and are on the motorway again within ten, 20 or 30 minutes. The only way to stop them is via the use of CCTV cameras. When will they be erected? What will the cost be and will it be done before the next general election? Community policing is also important. I keep emphasising that every Garda station should have a community liaison officer. As people trust community liaison officers, the more we have, the better. I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to ask my questions.

Last year I announced an annual sum of €1 million for three years which would be ringfenced for community CCTV system grants. The number of applications to date is lower than I wished for.I ask all Deputies, including Deputy Aylward, to spread the word that these grants are available. Support and guidance is also available to help interested groups apply for the funding. I strongly encourage interested groups to contact my Department for assistance. We have set up a dedicated email address for this purpose, which is communitycctv@justice.ie. Bearing in mind that all applications approved to date have been from local authorities, any local authorities that have not yet applied may also find it useful to consider consulting their counterparts in other areas. I am not sure if I have an application from Kilkenny but I have an application approved for the adjoining county of Wexford. I am anxious to ensure - I see three rural Deputies in the House - that we provide the appropriate level of information to community groups to allow them to make the application. Grant aid and assistance in my Department will be up to €40,000 per application.

It is being used day and night throughout the country, including in Kilkenny. It is assisting in the prevention and detection of crime. Garda cars, particularly new ones, are being fitted with this device which will allow them to recognise automatically the number of a car in the area.

I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that as of 28 February 2018, the latest date for which figures are available, the strength of the Wicklow division was 306. When appropriate, the work of local gardaí is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the armed support units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. I assure the House the Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime. To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, including 15,000 Garda members. I assure Deputy Casey the recruitment of Garda Síochána is continuing apace. Just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda Síochána and are performing mainstream duties nationwide. Of these, 31 have been assigned to the Wicklow division. While it is an issue for the Garda Commissioner, Deputy Casey will be pleased to hear the allocation of gardaí in the Bray and Wicklow stations is on the up. I am sure that with further gardaí coming out of Templemore later this year, the acting Commissioner, in his wisdom, will look at Wicklow as he does other areas in the country.
#PatCasey	unknown-#PatCasey-party	unknown-#PatCasey-dob	unknown-#PatCasey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	257	I thank the Minister for his reply. I sincerely hope the Commissioner looks at Wicklow because Wicklow has seen a continual decline in Garda numbers since 2009. In 2009, there were 360, which reduced to 355, 339, 334, 328 and all the way down to 299 in 2017. Last year, the number of inspectors decreased from nine to five. The number in our traffic corps has reduced from 30 to 16. The number of our community gardaí has reduced from 23 to 13. The number of Garda reservists has gone from 41 down to 20. This is unfair. The Commissioner has to look at it. We are all aware of rural crime. The Minister mentioned it. My colleague has mentioned before, as I have, the importance of CCTV to detect crimes concerning those coming off the motorways from Dublin. The last time I spoke to the Minister in the Chamber I mentioned CCTV for Arklow and I thank him for ensuring that funding has come through for Arklow. The town team is working its way through that process. I thank the Minister for that. We have seen a continual decline in Garda numbers for nearly ten years in Wicklow and we need to address it moving forward.

In my reply I stated the Ombudsman's recommendations referred to applications already received from a training or industrial school located in the same grounds as one of the 12 named institutions. However, it could not be restricted to existing applicants so at a minimum it would extend the scheme to at least another eight institutions. I wish to clarify that the implementation of the Ombudsman's recommendation with regard to eligibility for the redress scheme will be considered by an interdepartmental group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach which will be established in the coming days. The terms of reference will be agreed in consultation with the Ombudsman. I do not wish to pre-empt that process but I will keep the House updated.

I am glad the Minister is here to take the issue. The Minister will no doubt be aware of the shock, disappointment and anger expressed by pupils, staff, parents and the entire community in Croom in Limerick following the news that Sammon contracting group, which it has been reported submitted the lowest tender for the construction of the long-awaited new secondary school building, has been place into examinership. The decision of the High Court to appoint an examiner has thrown the process into a state of flux. The Minister will be aware that the process of building a new secondary school in Croom has been dogged by many disappointments, much controversy and a huge amount of delay. It has been going on since the early 2000s. We have had issues with site suitability, the size of the school and with planning permission which had to be obtained on at least three occasions having been allowed to lapse. It had to go to An Bord Pleanála. We have also had issues with the access road. There was finally some light beginning to appear at the end of the tunnel and there was a little bit of hope it might pass through the tender stage and a contractor would be appointed. I inquired about the status from the local education and training board, the Limerick and Clare ETB, which is the patron, and we were promised construction would commence well before now. We are where we are. It would be worthwhile for the Minister to take the opportunity, if it ever presents itself, to visit the facility which operates as a secondary school. My colleague, Deputy Neville, who is present in the Chamber, knows all too well that it is substandard, which is to put it mildly. The pupils and staff have to operate in prefabricated buildings, many of which are years old and so substandard it beggars belief that they would meet any safety standards or pass any inspection.My purpose in raising this matter is to keep the pressure on the Minister and the Department to bring a positive note to the mood surrounding it because the community in Croom and the community the school serves are very worried. Some feel it will never go ahead. The Minister needs to knock that on the head and make clear that he is determined to see this project through and ensure that the new school building, which was promised 16 or 17 years ago, will be delivered. In time the Department of Education and Skills will see this as a case study in how not to build a new school. Can the Minister give us the update on the tender process today? Has the Sammon Group formally withdrawn from the tender process, which is the stated desire of everybody involved, including the education and training board, ETB? Can he update us on any discussions he or the Department has had with the Sammon Group or the building unit? What will be the timeline for delivery of the new school building?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23774	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	265	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter which I know is of concern to many Deputies. He is right that there has been a difficult development process for this project. The original decision was devolved to the ETB to run the project. A service level agreement was put in place. A planning application was submitted and granted in April 2014 but that was appealed to An Bord Pleanála by a third party and the board overturned the grant of planning permission. I do not know the background to that but planning difficulties are not unknown in project development. Following further consultation a new application was lodged and planning permission was received in January 2017. Limerick County Council approached the ETB to ask it to consider an alternative access route to the school site. As part of the planning permission granted, access to the school site was to be achieved by upgrading an existing road. The alternative route proposed by the local authority involved the development of a new road off a distributor road, which would open up contiguous lands for development. As the Department had no difficulty in principle with the local authority's proposal it mandated the ETB to make a capped offer of a capital contribution to the cost of the new road, equivalent to what it would cost to upgrade the existing road in accordance with the planning permission granted. Following some period of consideration of the offer by the local authority and correspondence between it and the ETB, the Department's offer was accepted. To facilitate access to the school from the proposed new road the design team had to make some adjustments to the layout of the new school site to place the entrance at a different point in the site. The ETB and its design team submitted a stage 2B submission for the project incorporating the requisite design changes to the Department towards the end of last year. A stage 2B submission provides a detailed cost plan for the project prior to going to tender. The Department approved this and the project went to tender. When the tender process was completed the ETB filed a tender report with the Department as required and this is being evaluated. Once this evaluation has been completed the project will be allowed to proceed to the award of a contract and construction. I expect that it should happen within the coming weeks. The contract duration will be 17 months. The tender process is confidential and I am not at liberty, nor is the ETB, to talk about those who have succeeded or not in their tender application. The Department appreciates that the school is anxious to see the project getting to site as soon as possible, particularly after the difficult passage through the planning stages. The construction stage is fast approaching and I look forward to the Department's being able to give the go-ahead for that shortly.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	266	The Minister mentioned the access road, which we are well aware of, but that is no longer an issue. The problem now is that it has been reported quite widely that the company which is lowest in the tender process and was about to be given the contract has been placed in examinership. It is being said that the next step will be to ask that company to remove itself from the process to allow the Department and the ETB to engage with whoever is next in line in the tender process. This is the crux of the matter. We have to get over this hurdle as quickly as possible. The media reports on the appointment of a contractor to the Sammon Group stated that other parties offered support to the Sammon Group as part of the examinership proposal to the High Court. Suffice to say that is going on at one level while at ground level we have to deal with the reality that pupils have to try to learn, and teachers and managers have to try to operate, in exceptionally sub-standard conditions. Will the Minister state that he realises how long this has dragged on and commit to prioritising it within the Department's building unit in Tullamore? It has dragged on for too long on many levels. On behalf of the community and the parents' association of Coláiste Chiaráin I invite the Minister to visit the school when he is next in the area. It will make a lasting impression on him to see the conditions the pupils and staff have to work in. 
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23774	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	267	I understand what the Deputy is saying and I have indicated in my reply that this is regarded as a priority project. We recognise the difficulties, such as the planning appeal, the lay out of the road and so on. Equally, the Deputy will understand that I cannot compromise a tender process. This is a commercially confidential process and there are very strict procedures for the award of public contracts, how those who are successful and those who are not should be notified as the process goes forward, and bidders can challenge a tender outcome before a contract is signed. I have to be aware of that. In the event that any company in an examinership is a bidder in this project that would be taken into account under the legal procedures that apply. The matter of who is involved, who is successful and what procedures will occur is commercially confidential and I have to respect that confidentiality. The Deputy would appreciate the concern that some disruption to the tender process would be the cause of further delay. He would be the first to point the finger at the failure to respect the terms of a tender. I regret that is all I can say to the Deputy at this point but I understand that it is a priority for the school community, and I understand the frustration it has suffered.

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	269	I welcome the opportunity to address this matter directly with the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath. The paralysis in Abbeyleix hospital is very serious. In 2011 there was a plan to close the hospital. A court case involving two of its elderly residents and a mass campaign locally were instrumental in stopping the closure, or putting the brakes on it. The hospital has changed from being mainly a long-stay hospital to a respite care hospital used as a step-down facility for patients from acute units such as that in Portlaoise. That is no bad thing; it is actually good. However, the hospital badly needs investment. It badly needs to be extended and renovated. Nothing has been done to it in the almost seven years since the closure was stopped. Not a shovel of concrete has been mixed and not a piece of timber has been cut. There is a large site, of which the existing building occupies only a small part. The hospital is centrally located in the town of Abbeyleix which is close to the centre of County Laois and in an ideal position to be utilised. As it is on HSE-owned land, there is no requirement to buy or lease land. There is very little development to be undertaken because the area is very well serviced with infrastructure. The land is ideal for the putting in place of a new or extended facility. Population growth in Laois is faster than in any other county.Percentage wise, it is even faster than in County Kildare which is close to the commuter belt. The population of County Laois is mushrooming, according to the latest census, and we must cater for this. In addition, we are all living longer; therefore, the number of elderly people in the county is increasing. There is a huge need for nursing home places. Private nursing homes will take low dependency patients but high dependency patients cannot be catered for in many of them. That is where the Abbeyleix unit comes in. It has always been available with an excellent staff to cater for high dependency patients whose care is costly and who need many supports and services. With the nursing home services, it also provides excellent day care services.  I have a pain in my head listening to all of the talk about primary care provision in the past 15 years. Abbeyleix hospital provides an opportunity to expand the primary care services in the town by adding chiropody, physiotherapy and GP services and so on, in which there is huge interest in the area. Seven years on, there is no plan. I met HSE officials, accompanied by representatives of the friends of the hospital committee, twice after Christmas, but there was no plan, design or cash because the upgrade had not been included in the capital plan. Promises have been made, but they have been recurring in the past seven years. The Minister of State will understand that even people like me who are optimistic by nature have become sceptical. We need to move the process on because it cannot be allowed to drag on at a snail's pace. The current capacity of the unit is 20 beds, but that needs to be increased. I am anxious to hear the Minister of State's response.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	270	I apologise for the delay.  I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue which relates to Abbeyleix hospital. The overarching policy of the Government is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible. That is what older people clearly want and only those in genuine need of residential care should go down that route. The HSE is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services, including those in facilities such as Abbeyleix hospital. Abbeyleix community nursing unit is registered with HIQA to provide care for 20 residents. It comprises 17 short-stay and three long-stay beds. All bedrooms are on the ground floor. In addition, a day service is provided for between 20 and 22 people from Monday to Thursday. The HSE is committed to the long-term future of the Abbeyleix facility which will continue to operate as a community hospital for the area. In that context, a meeting took place in January this year between the HSE and the friends of Abbeyleix hospital committee. At the meeting it was agreed that plans for the future development of services at Abbeyleix would be progressed in conjunction with local community interests. The HSE gave a commitment to the establishment of a project group in quarter 1 of 2018, representative of all stakeholders, to plan for future services at Abbeyleix community nursing unit. The project group has been established and its first meeting is scheduled to take place on 4 May. The HSE will also continue to meet the friends of Abbeyleix hospital committee. While the community nursing unit is not accepting long-stay residents, it is providing respite care services in County Laois and the extended area, in addition to day care, rehabilitation and meals on wheels services. The HSE's plan for the long-term future of Abbeyleix community nursing unit is to develop a sustainable model of service which will see the unit operate as a community hospital, providing short-stay beds for step-up and step-down from Portlaoise acute hospital, as well as respite and transitional care beds for the area. Short-term beds contribute to the provision of an integrated model of care for older people, enabling them to return home following a period of hospital care, thus avoiding admission to acute hospital, or postponing admission to long-stay nursing home care. Both the HSE and I recognise that Abbeyleix community nursing unit is vital for the provision of community-based services that help people to stay in their homes and communities and that assist those who require admission to be discharged as early as possible from acute care back to their home environment.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	271	I thank the Minister of State for his reply. It is welcome that the project group has been established because we were told at the meeting I attended earlier this year that it would happen in quarter 1. This was reiterated in replies to parliamentary questions I had tabled. It is also welcome that the first meeting of the group will be held on 4 May. Which interests are represented on it? Are there people with technical expertise in the Department on it?  The community nursing unit is registered with HIQA and has a capacity of 20 patients. It had higher capacity in years gone by, but standards have changed and a huge upgrade is needed. However, there is also a need for additional places because people from the town and surrounding areas are in nursing homes in County Tipperary. The Minister of State referred to step-up and step-down facilities for those receiving acute treatment and the need for respite care. The respite care service provided by the unit is very much valued by the local community and much sought after. I receive many representations on it. Why can it not have more long-stay beds?  There is also the issue of ensuring the unit has enough staff to keep it operational. When something is being run on a 24/7 basis, a critical mass of patients is needed to maximise use of the staff and facilities. A total of 20 residents will not result in that happening. I, therefore, urge the Minister of State to think big and aim to have a capacity of 45 or 50 beds. The friends of the hospital committee has raised a lot of money. It should not have had to do this, but it did anyway during the years and it is still active in that regard. When is it anticipated that the project group will produce a plan? When will the plan be put out to tender? When will it get into the all-important capital programme to make sure there will be euro and cent in place? We need a plan, a timeline and funding. That is what the people of County Laois want to hear about because this has been an issue for a long time. It is welcome that we prevented the closure of the unit. I also welcome the Government's commitment to it, but we want the project group to bring forward its plan with a timeline and funding in place.

I accept that public residential care units such as that in Abbeyleix hospital are an essential part of healthcare infrastructure. Demand for services is increasing as the population ages. The Deputy raised questions about technical expertise in the Department, the capacity of the unit and a target of 45 residents and more localised care services in the context of people receiving care in County Tipperary. He also mentioned the plan and a tender and timelines for them. I give a commitment that I will go back to the Minister and revert to the Deputy with the answers to these questions. There is a need to develop hospital avoidance and early discharge facilities, particularly for the increasing elderly population. That is why the HSE is focused on developing a range of community services to best serve the people of Abbeyleix and surrounding areas. Such services can play a significant role in supporting older adults who are discharged from hospital with ongoing, non-acute care needs and preventing admission to hospital. I will get back to the Deputy when I contact the Minister about the issues he raised.

I do not know who these people think they are that they can appoint themselves as judge, jury and executioner.They demand that international law is upheld by others but seem to have no problem with ignoring it themselves. The auspices given that this was to enforce the prohibition of the use of chemical weapons is a joke when we know that the system to deal with this was outlined in the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention. International investigators were en route to Syria, due to land there within hours when these so-called world powers decided to strike without any lawful basis. Can the Minister imagine what would have happened in a similar situation? We all know that the US, UK and Israel have used, for example, depleted uranium and white phosphorous. What would have happened if the Russians or Chinese decided to bomb Maryland or Porton Down in the UK without a proper, independent investigation? It is ludicrous. These are the same powers that lied about Iraq and Libya. These are very dangerous times. We, as an independent country, should firmly stand up and argue for diplomatic solutions and an end to war, not its continuation. We do not know whether chemical weapons were used at all. If they were, it is abhorrent. Unlike others, we condemn the use of all weaponry, not just chemical weaponry. We do not know if they were used and if they were used, we do not know by whom. The people who were charged with carrying out the investigation have not got there yet. The Minister may have read today's article in the British Independent by Robert Fisk, hardly a radical, who was in Douma yesterday. He spoke to some of the doctors who were present who put forward the idea that what happened there was not a gas attack at all but hypoxia caused by bombing that was taking place, dust clouds, wind, and people being withheld from oxygen underground, causing the symptoms that were displayed. The Minister can read the article. It is incredibly illustrative. Robert Fisk is hardly a radical and is on the ground in Douma, talking to people today and yesterday, including survivors of that incident. We have to be very careful in this situation and we should be taking a lead on it. It is somewhat ironic when one considers that ISIS has used chemical weapons provided by Saudi Arabia on multiple locations in Iraq and Syria and that no action was taken. These powers could not care less that the Saudi dictator who supplied the weaponry in Yemen is slaughtering innocent women and children. No action has been taken there relating to gas or the killing of civilians. We cannot choose our battles. We have to stand up for the upholding of international law for everybody and we should make a stand on this.

I have no doubt about the brutalities it has committed and is capable of committing. The idea that US, UK and French missiles and a massive dose of hypocrisy and double standards from those powers will assist in the humanitarian disaster in Syria is stomach-churning. For Government representatives to talk about the attacks being understandable is shocking. Let me refer to the double standards we are talking about. In 2009, Israel rained down chemical weapons, white phosphorous, in the full view of day, on the UN school in Gaza and on densely populated areas. A report was done by Human Rights Watch afterwards called Rain of Fire: Israel's Unlawful Use of White Phosphorus in Gaza. This was well-documented and proven. The shells were found all around the place. They were chemical weapons. Guess where they were produced? Louisiana in the United States. Were there sanctions? No. Were there expulsions of diplomats? No. Were there threats of military action by these politicians who told us, in the context of bombing Syria, that they could not sleep with the thought of the use of chemical weapons? They were able to sleep very soundly when Israel rained down chemical weapons on the people of Gaza. Incredibly, the Israelis said at the weekend that it was absolutely right to take military action to uphold international law but in the last few weeks, 36 unarmed Palestinians were killed who were marching to assert their rights under international laws to return to their homes as confirmed by UN resolutions. Sanctions? No. Military action? No. Expulsions? No. This sort of rank hypocrisy is corrosive of politics and is responsible for the mess in the Middle East. There is cynical interference of big powers, whether Russia, Donald Trump, Theresa May or Emmanuel Macron, trying to shore up their collapsing popularity by diverting people's attention with a war abroad and furthering the interests of imperial powers in that region, to gain influence on the back of the suffering of the Syrian people. We have to speak out against this sickening hypocrisy and have nothing to do with this murderous assault by Trump and his gang of allies.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	276	Over 100 missiles rained down on Syria from the US, France and Britain. Our Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade says he can understand why the airstrikes were launched. Instead of understanding the actions of Donald Trump, Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron, does the Minister not think we should have had condemnation of this military action which ratchets up tension across the world and brings us closer to a new world war? We know that neutrality has never been a reality in this State but it has rarely been so blatantly flouted repeatedly by our Government. It is only weeks since we had the expulsion of diplomats on the say-so of unpublished British intelligence. It is only months since the Government signed Ireland up for the European military alliance, permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, and now it is giving implicit support to western imperialist intervention in the Middle East. Does the Government not agree that the use of Shannon Airport and the support that represents for US military action abroad has to be ended by the US military? Can the Minister even give a commitment that Shannon will not be used for the US military either going to or coming from Syria? We know what the pretext of the attack was: an abhorrent chemical attack in eastern Ghouta which has been blamed on Assad. Is Assad capable of such an act? Absolutely. That corrupt regime has defended itself through rivers of innocent people's blood repeatedly. No evidence has been presented. We are expected just to accept what has been put forward. The question that has to be asked is why it would launch a chemical attack now, giving a reason for western imperialism to intervene. Everybody should remember that it is just over 15 years since the dodgy dossier about weapons of mass destruction was used to justify going to war in Iraq. The disaster is there, right across the region, for everybody to see and yet we are expected to believe them again. The use of it as a pretext for another imperialist intervention, regardless of who is responsible, should be rejected. I echo the points about the utter hypocrisy of these people, including Trump, May and Macron, all of whom recently rolled out the red carpet for the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, the architect in chief of the carnage and deliberate starvation in Yemen, where a child dies every ten minutes. They all celebrated the re-election of el-Sisi in Egypt and they gave a free pass to Israeli snipers gunning down unarmed Palestinians in Gaza. Imperialist intervention is a disaster. It has been a disaster, including both Russian and western imperialism. Instead, we need to build an international anti-war movement like we did 15 years ago to say hands off Syria, to stop the escalation of tension worldwide, to have no more airstrikes and to demand the withdrawal of all foreign forces.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	277	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for picking the subject. International law, under the UN Charter, makes clear two exceptions to the general prohibition of war. The first is the use of force by a state against another, the self-defence clause as defined by Article 51. The second permits certain military interventions when authorised by the UN Security Council under chapter 7 of the Charter. Until the US, France or the UK have been attacked or the UN Security Council acts, Article 51 in chapter 7 of the UN Charter makes the US, UK or French airstrikes in Syria illegal under international law. Will the Minister consider condemning the breach of international law in this situation?The current situation in Syria is mad and very hard to fix. However, the line that has been spun by much of the media as to what has happened there is very disturbing. More than anyone else, the Saudis, with the help of the Israelis, have escalated the war out of all proportion. Two and a half years ago, it looked like a group of fundamentalist jihadists was going to take over Syria with the backing of the Saudis and US support. We must not forget that the United States has put over $1 billion into training the opposition to the Assad regime in Syria. The so-called acceptable opposition is made up of groups such as al-Nusra, al-Qaeda and Ahrar al-Sham. They are mad people. No one likes Russia or Iran bombing anyone but if a country were to invade Mexico, would the United States stand by and allow the forces of a hostile country to operate along its border? It is rational that Russia did not want a crowd of mad fundamentalist jihadists on its border, controlling Syria. It would be mad to have allowed that. It is unfortunate that that means war. What is the United Nations doing about it? If the United States got Saudi Arabia to call off its dogs of war - the so-called rebels or opposition, who the Syrians call terrorists, being made up primarily of Saudi Arabian and Chechnyan nationals - the Russians and the Iranians would pull out. The primary aim of the EU should be to stop the bombing and the supply and infiltration of weapons into the region - the place is awash with weapons on both sides - and avoid any escalation of the conflict. The EU could play a positive role. It should change position and advocate for an end to all military activity in Syria.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	278	The EU is doing exactly that: it is advocating for an end to all military activity in Syria because no lasting solution in Syria will be delivered through military means alone. The apparent chemical attack in the city of Douma in Syria on 7 April was horrifying, even by the standards of the Syrian conflict to date. It was distressing to see images of children choking to death, their lives cut short by a conflict they did not understand and in which they were not involved. Whole families were wiped out in basements in which they had sought shelter from bombs falling overhead. I remember seeing very similar images when I visited Halabja, as I said when Deputy Wallace and others asked questions on this matter previously. There, I spoke to families who witnessed similar incidents in 1988. I wish to make several matters clear before I deal with the military intervention. Ireland condemns the use of chemical weapons by anyone, anywhere and in any circumstances. I wish to take this opportunity to reiterate my unreserved condemnation of this callous act perpetrated on civilians, particularly women and children. As has been mentioned, on 14 April the United States, France and the United Kingdom launched a series of strikes on a number of facilities which have been linked to the Syrian Government’s use of chemical weapons. From what we were told yesterday, notice was given to ensure that there were no civilian casualties. The stated objective of the strikes was to ensure that chemical attacks such as that in Douma do not reoccur. When a chemical attack as horrific as that occurs and in the absence of the UN Security Council being able to take action because of the repeated use of a veto, I can understand why the military strikes happened, as I have stated. That is not the same as an implicit endorsement of or support for that action. Last week I was asked about military strikes in advance of their happening but when they were being discussed. I urged caution and very clearly stated that I did not see how further military activity in Syria would improve an already very difficult situation. Yesterday, at the Foreign Affairs Council, I continued to urge caution and asked that the focus be on political solutions. Anyone who reads the entirety of the resolution that was agreed will see that there is a short reference to military strikes but all its emphasis is on humanitarian support, accountability in Syria and legal mechanisms to deliver that, inspections, a more comprehensive UN response and a conference on Syria to be held next week in Brussels, at which Ireland will make a further significant financial contribution towards supporting the millions of refugees who need international assistance. I discussed the situation in Syria with my EU colleagues at the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council. We condemned in the strongest possible terms the use of chemical weapons in Syria and stressed the need to ensure full legal accountability for those responsible for such crimes. Our focus should remain on the horrors inflicted by the Assad regime on its own people. We also reiterated our support for the UN-led political negotiations to end the conflict and recognised the urgent need to reinvigorate the political track.

It supports the international, impartial and independent mechanism established by the UN General Assembly, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic established by the Human Rights Council, and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and its fact-finding mission in Syria and joint investigation mission with the UN. We regret that Russia has used its veto at the UN Security Council to prevent a proper international investigation into the use of chemical weapons in Syria. The situation in Syria is appalling and the suffering of the Syrian people must be addressed in a far more comprehensive manner than has been done to date. As I stated, the EU will host a donor conference for Syria next week, as it did last year. The EU, including its member states, is the largest single donor to the effort to support the Syrian people. Since 2012, Ireland has contributed over €95 million, including €25 million in 2017 alone, to the humanitarian effort in response to the conflict in Syria and will again make a significant contribution next week. Our approach is UN-led but, as I stated yesterday, I understand why some countries decided to move ahead while the UN Security Council is paralysed to respond to human rights abuses such as this because of the inappropriate use of a veto. Those countries have published the legal justification for their actions and that justification will be tested, as it ought to be. Ireland has not supported military action in this case. We continue to focus on civilians and their protection and the use of multinational mechanisms, in particular through the UN and, to a certain extent, the EU, to try to find lasting solutions that focus on an absence of future military intervention.

However, his points about the UN being paralysed do not add up. The rules are there for a reason. An inverted scenario would be the US and the UK using depleted uranium, for example, in the Middle East, the UN proposing action against them and Britain vetoing said action, followed by Russia bombing Portadown in the UK. Does the Tánaiste think that a bombing such as that would happen without him batting an eyelid and saying we cannot support it because the UN is paralysed?It is utter nonsense. There is a legal process by which these attacks could be investigated but it was precisely in advance of that independent investigation laid out by law that those three countries struck. They are the ones, if one likes, who are belligerent in this matter and we should be doing a lot more to argue a neutral line.

Quite frankly, the Tánaiste is not applying uniform or consistent standards when it comes to the behaviour of the big powers who dominate and who are currently paralysing the UN Security Council. What is good for the goose is good for the gander. People like Macron, May or Trump, with Israel cheering them on, said we must uphold international law and the prohibition on chemical weapons. Despite this, although the Tánaiste and I know that those same powers have used chemical weapons, nobody said a bloody word when they did it in Gaza. There were no sanctions or expulsions and nobody said it would be understandable if Hamas lobbed a few rockets back in retaliation. I bet the Tánaiste would not say that. There are double standards and that is what is fuelling the conflict that is tearing the Middle East apart.

He made a clear, unreserved condemnation of the particularly callous attack on civilians using chemical weapons. I agree with the Tánaiste in that regard and I join him in making that unreserved condemnation, no matter who did it, but will he also make a condemnation of military strikes by the United States, Britain and France in Syria? He will not. I also join the Tánaiste in rightly criticising Russia over its use of the veto on the UN Security Council, but will he criticise the United States for using its veto on the UN Security Council to veto condemnation of the gunning down of unarmed Palestinians by the Israeli defence forces in Gaza? I bet he will not, precisely because he has double standards and all of that points to implicit, tacit support for western imperialism. The Tánaiste is on that side as opposed to the other side, even though he might not have an army at his disposal.

He said Ireland has not supported military action but he did not condemn it. The Tánaiste said he condemns the use of chemical weapons, but that is before he can get proof on whether they were used or who used them. He is just taking their word for it. It suits the agenda. It is nuts. How do we know what is going on? The White Helmets were one of the first groups to tell us about it. The White Helmets, the Syrian campaign and the Syrian American Medical Society, who control a lot of the flow of information coming out of Syria for media, are PR companies that are funded by the Americans and the Brits. That is the truth. One could not believe the time of day from them. I heard someone say last week that the media makes the war and the war makes the media. The media have played an incredibly poor role in all of this. God help us. Things are not going to get better. The Tánaiste has said the European Union is working for peace. It has to work a lot harder. The Government cannot say boo to the Americans or stand up to them.

We voted for a motion that was very critical of the United States on the Jerusalem issue, despite being asked not to. My record is pretty clear in that regard. I do not think some of the comparisons are relevant. As far as I am concerned, it is a warped idea that one would equate condemnation of the use of chemical weapons on women and children with the need to condemn airstrikes on buildings where notice was given to make sure that no civilians were killed or injured.

We are trying to put chemical weapons out of use permanently. The reason for targeted strikes was to act as a very clear deterrent to make sure that we do not see repeated use of chemical weapons on civilian populations and targets in Syria, which is a country that has already been ripped apart by war, yet now we are seeing repeated use of chemical weapons there. In the absence of the UN Security Council being able to respond comprehensively, I said that response was understandable. I did not say I supported it, but I can understand the motivation behind it. That is all I said yesterday. I listened to the French and British Prime Ministers outline in detail why they took part in that action. I responded by saying I felt the focus should not be on military strikes but should be on diplomatic and political solutions, which is what the European Union has been pushing for and supporting the UN on for some time. That is where Ireland can be relevant and focused. We have no role or capacity in terms of military strikes. After they had taken place, it would not have achieved anything for me to have been strongly critical. Instead, I want to focus on the positive agenda that the European Union and the United Nations are working together to try to achieve, which is the implementation of ceasefires that have been signed up to but are being ignored. We will continue to focus on trying to create positive outcomes that can bring about an absence of the kind of continuing military activity and misery we are seeing across Syria.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	305	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." I am very pleased to have the opportunity to commence Second Stage of the Data Protection Bill 2018 in this House. I look forward to hearing the contributions of Members and obtaining the broad support of the House for the contents of this most important legislation. I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Bill was amended during its passage through Seanad Éireann. A number of new provisions have been added to it and I will draw attention to them in due course. The explanatory memorandum, which accompanies the Bill, has been updated to reflect the amendments from the Seanad. The primary purpose of the Bill is to give further effect to the general data protection regulation, GDPR, to transpose the accompanying law enforcement directive into national law and to establish the data protection commission to replace the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner. The GDPR enters into effect on 25 May next and the directive must be transposed into national law by then. I am hopeful that with the support of the House, this Bill will be signed into law and enter into force in May next, alongside the GDPR. I am confident that the GDPR and this legislation will serve to make our data protection laws fit for purpose in the digital age. The updated data protection rules entering into force next month will affect all of us in one way or another. It will affect each of us as individuals, because it will increase our control over the manner in which, and the purposes for which, our personal data are used.It will affect businesses, whether large, medium or small, because it will require them to review and update the manner in which they collect, use or store the personal data of their customers and clients or any other individual whose personal data they retain. The same applies to Departments and all public bodies. The simple fact is that data protection law has not kept pace with the many technological advances and new business models such as social media and cloud computing that have emerged in recent years. Our current law, based on the European Union’s 1995 data protection directive, predates mass Internet usage, hand held devices, apps and games, social networking and data analytics, all of which involve the collection and processing of our personal data, often for purposes that are opaque and largely unknown to us. The basic data protection principles set out in the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 will remain largely unchanged following the entry into force of the GDPR. However, GDPR rules will strengthen our control over our own personal data and the purposes for which it may be used. Increased transparency is essential for increased control. In the future, information must be provided for users in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible format, using clear and plain language. It will no longer be acceptable for service providers to direct users to opaque terms and conditions written in legal jargon. The obligations placed on companies and public sector bodies that collect, use and store personal data are set to increase but will do so in a measured and proportionate manner. The compliance burden will increase for some but it will be proportionate to risks for the rights and freedoms of individuals arising from any accidental or unlawful loss or disclosure of, or access to, their personal data. This will inevitably pose a greater challenge for those bodies, whether in the public or private sectors, that specialise in data processing and for those handling, for example, customers’ financial data or patients' sensitive health data. While large companies have been gearing up for entry into force of the GDPR for some time, it is likely that the SME sector and micro enterprises will continue to require assistance and support during the coming period of adjustment. Awareness raising activities have been under way for the last year and a half involving conferences, seminars and workshops and those activities will continue. Practical guidance is also vital and I strongly recommend the Data Protection Commissioner’s web page, gdprandyou.ie, which contains a wealth of useful information and practical guidance for both business and individuals. High data protection standards are not anti-business and will not reduce competitiveness. The harmonised rules set out in the GDPR and the Data Protection Bill will ensure that the same data protection safeguards will operate across the European Union. This will provide a level playing field for businesses, especially those involved in the cross-border provision of goods and services. Enhanced data protection standards will also be beneficial to the increasing numbers who avail of the Government’s online services. Public and private enforcement of data protection law is set to increase. In future the data protection commission will have stronger supervision and enforcement powers as well as a broader range of sanctions at its disposal, including the imposition of administrative fines. The scope for compensation claims arising from infringements of data protection rules will also increase, resulting in higher levels of private enforcement activity. The Government is committed to achieving the full potential of the digital economy and its capacity to promote innovation, create jobs and boost economic activity in the State. We already host many of the world’s leading digital companies here and they provide their services well beyond our shores. That number will increase in the future. The GDPR together with this legislation will ensure that the data processing involved in the provision of these services will meet the highest data protection standard. The establishment of the data protection commission will ensure effective supervision and enforcement of these high standards.  Following protracted negotiations, the GDPR was agreed in early 2016 and will, as I mentioned, enter into force across the European Union on 25 May next. An accompanying directive, which establishes data protection standards for the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences and the execution of criminal penalties also requires transposition by May of this year. Both the GDPR and the directive have a legal basis in Article 16 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and they provide for significant enhancements to current data protection rules based on the 1995 data protection directive. Both instruments generally provide for higher standards of data protection for individuals and impose increased obligations on bodies in the public and private sectors that process personal data. They also increase the range of possible sanctions for infringements of these standards and obligations. The GDPR seeks to provide for a uniform interpretation and application of data protection standards across the European Union, thereby providing a level playing field for all those doing business in the EU digital market. The European data protection board, a new entity that will replace the current advisory committee and made up of representatives of the data protection authorities of all member states, will play an important role in that respect.  At the heart of both the GDPR and the directive is a risk based approach to data protection. This means that each individual controller and processor is required to put appropriate technical and organisational measures in place in order to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that their processing of personal data complies with the new data protection standards. I remind the House that the terms "controller" and "processor” are not esoteric concepts. Those of us involved, for example, in the handling of constituents' requests and representations are data controllers and any operator of an off-site storage facility for files containing personal data is a processor. I will return to the point about the work of elected members later in my remarks. For the purposes of assessing the nature, level and likelihood of risks for the rights and freedoms of individuals, controllers and processors must have regard to the nature, scope, context and purposes of their data processing activities. In certain cases, this will in future require the carrying out of a data protection impact assessment in order to take steps to mitigate such risks. Where mitigation measures are not feasible, prior consultation with the data protection commission will be mandatory. The GDPR and the directive both place greatly increased emphasis on the transparency of processing, the responsibility of the controller and processor for compliance with data protection standards and the need for appropriate security standards in order to protect against data breaches such as unauthorised or unlawful processing and accidental loss, destruction or damage.  The GDPR and the directive also impose an obligation on all public authorities and bodies, as well as some private sector bodies, to designate a data protection officer with responsibility to oversee data processing operations and to report data breaches to the data protection authority. The GDPR also limits the grounds for lawful processing of personal data by public authorities and bodies. For example, depending on the circumstances, an individual’s consent to the processing of his or her personal data may not provide a reliable basis for such processing by a public authority. The so-called legitimate interest ground in Article 6.1(f) of the GDPR will no longer be available to public authorities when acting in their public capacity. Both the GDPR and the directive provide for increased supervision and enforcement of data protection standards by the data protection authorities of member states, including the future data protection commission. The GDPR provides for the possible imposition of substantial administrative fines of €10 million or €20 million or 2% or 4% of total worldwide annual turnover in the preceding financial year. I will return to the fines issue shortly. The liability of controllers and processors will also be broadened to include non-material damage such as distress. In future an individual who has suffered material or non-material damage because of a breach of his or her data protection rights under the GDPR or this legislation will have the right to seek compensation in the courts.  The key purposes of the Bill are to give further effect to the GDPR in the areas in which member state flexibility is permitted to transpose the directive into national law; to establish the data protection commission as the State’s data protection authority with the means to supervise and enforce the enhanced protection standards enshrined in the GDPR and directive in an efficient and effective manner; and to enact consequential amendments to various Acts that contain cross-references to the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003. The Data Protection Bill 2018, which is both lengthy and complex in nature, comprises numerous parts. Part 1, sections 1 to 8, inclusive, contains a number of standard provisions, including citation, commencement and definitions. Part 2, sections 9 to 27, inclusive, establishes a data protection commission to replace the Data Protection Commissioner as the State’s data protection authority. Its primary task will be to act as the supervisory authority for the purposes of the GDPR and the directive. Part 3, sections 28 to 58, inclusive, gives further effect to the GDPR in a number of areas, mainly affecting the public sector, in which the regulation gives member states a margin of flexibility.In certain cases, this involves the creation of a regulation-making power that will permit the making of more detailed regulations. Part 4, comprising sections 56 to 65, inclusive, contains a number of provisions that are consequential on replacement of the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner with the data protection commission. Part 5 transposes the provisions of the law enforcement directive into national law. Part 6 contains provisions dealing with the enforcement of the obligations and rights set out in the GDPR and the directive by the data protection commission. Part 7 contains a number of miscellaneous provisions, mainly concerning the application of data protection rules to the courts and a number of related legal matters. Part 8 contains a limited number of consequential amendments to a number of Acts. I intend to table a substantial amendment to Part 8 on Committee Stage to incorporate the necessary adjustments to a large number of Acts of the Oireachtas that contain cross-references to the Data Protection Act 1988. As regards substance, the updated explanatory memorandum that accompanies the Bill contains much detail. For that reason, I do not intend to delve into the provisions of the Bill in great detail. However, I want to take this opportunity to highlight a number of issues and to refer to Part 5, which transposes the law enforcement directive into national law. Sections 7 and 8 of the Bill contain provisions concerning the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003. While Article 2.2(a) of the GDPR provides that its provisions do not apply to the processing of personal data in the course of an activity falling outside the scope of EU law, there has been considerable uncertainty about the scope of that exclusion in light of evolving Court of Justice case law. A detailed analysis of relevant Court of Justice case law by the Office of the Attorney General has concluded that this exclusion is essentially limited in practice to data processing in the context of national security, defence and the international relations of the State. While national security and defence lie outside the scope of EU law, the Council of Europe's 1981 data protection convention - Convention 108 - contains provisions that apply to data processing for these purposes. The GDPR contains a consistency mechanism, or so-called one-stop shop, which is intended to streamline the handling of data protection infringements and complaints across the European Union. For this purpose, it employs the concept of a lead supervisory authority of a member state. This means that complaints will be investigated by the data protection authority of that member state, irrespective of the member state of origin of the complaint. Before arriving at a final decision in cross-border cases, the lead authority must submit a draft decision to other data protection authorities that have an interest in the case and must have regard to any objections received from them. In order to underline and further enhance the independence of the commission as required by the GDPR and by Court of Justice case law, the commissioner will be the Accounting Officer of a separate financial Vote. This is covered in sections 25 and 165. I would like move on to the child-related provisions of the Bill. Article 8 specifies a digital age of consent of 16 years but allows member states to lower it but not below 13. In late 2016, my Department launched a consultation process and invited submissions from interested parties on the digital age of consent to apply in this jurisdiction under article 8. The Government Data Forum, which brings together legal and data protection experts, business representatives, sociologists, psychologists and education specialists, also carried out a consultation process. A majority of respondents recommended that the digital age of consent should be set at 13 years and the Government approved such an age limit in June of last year. When the Special Rapporteur on Child Protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, appeared before the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality during the pre-legislative phase of this process, he also recommended that the digital age of consent should be set at 13 years. This is the background to the Government's decision to specify 13 years as the digital age of consent in section 30 of the Bill before the House. Arising from the sincere and strongly-held concerns that were expressed during its discussions on this matter, the Seanad accepted my proposal for a review clause. This clause, which is provided for in section 30(3) of the Bill, means that the operation of this provision must be reviewed not later than three years after its coming into operation. I want to refer to Article 6.1(f) and to Article 12, which imposes high standards of transparency on controllers. Article 17 relates to the right to erasure. Article 40 makes general provision for codes of conduct. Article 57 requires data protection authorities to promote public awareness and understanding. Arising from the discussion in the Seanad, I proposed the inclusion of section 31 of the Bill as it now stands. Another new section, section 32, makes specific provision for an enhanced right to be forgotten in the case of children. Before I conclude what I have to say on the protection of children, I express my support for the joint committee's recommendation for consultations with children in relation to data protection measures. Article 57 of the GDPR requires data protection authorities, such as the proposed data protection commission, to promote public awareness and understanding of the risks, rules, safeguards and rights in regard to data processing. Article 23 makes provision for possible restrictions on controller obligations. The need to apply restrictions will arise from time to time. Section 57 of the Bill provides for proportionate restrictions in order to safeguard a range of important objectives of general public interest - for example, to avoid obstruction of any official or legal inquiry, investigation or process. I have referred to article 57 of the GDPR. Article 83 provides for the imposition of administrative fines for infringements. To ensure fair and equitable trading conditions, section 139 of the Bill provides that administrative fines may be imposed on public bodies that are acting as "undertakings" by providing goods or services for gain in competition with private bodies. This will ensure fair competition. In Chapter 2, section 68 contains provisions outlining the general principles of data protection. Chapter 3 outlines the obligations on controllers when acting within the scope of Part 5. Chapter 4 specifies the data protection rights of individuals, including rights in respect of automated decision-making in sections 87 to 90, inclusive. Part 6 of the Bill contains detailed provisions relating to the supervision and enforcement of the GDPR and the data protection standards set out in Part 5. I want to mention the important report that was drawn up on foot of the pre-legislative process. I thank the committee and other stakeholders for their work in that regard. Before I conclude, I need to mention a specific amendment that I intend to introduce on Committee Stage. Deputies will be aware that concerns have been raised that the GDPR and the Bill before the House may have an adverse impact on the ability of elected representatives, including Members of this House, to make representations on behalf of their constituents and carry out other aspects of their work as elected representatives. I intend to bring forward a Committee Stage amendment to ensure there is an appropriate legal basis for, inter alia, the processing of personal data for the purposes of dealing with constituents' representations and requests from members of the public, interest groups and stakeholders, which is the essence of our work as public representatives. This amendment is being finalised at present. I intend to circulate it at the earliest opportunity and obviously in advance of Committee Stage. As I mentioned, this is a complex and lengthy Bill. I acknowledge the positive and constructive engagement on it that took place in the Seanad. That it is lengthy or complex, or both, should not blind us to the central purpose of the Bill, which is to promote and facilitate the exercise of our right as individuals to the protection of our personal data and to increase our control over it and the uses to which it may be put. Article 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights provides simply that "everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her". The GDPR and this Bill seek to make that a reality. In acknowledging the constructive debate in Seanad Éireann, and in showing that I am open to engaging in debate, I hope to set the scene for a similar type of engagement here. Many of the parties represented in this House were successful in working to ensure the legislation I am introducing is fit for purpose. I hope we can advance it on Second Stage in the next couple of days before moving on to Committee and Report Stages with a view to having it enacted well in advance of the due date of 25 May next.

As the Minister mentioned, the purpose of the legislation is twofold: first, to give effect to the general data protection regulation, GDPR; and second, to transpose into Irish law the accompanying directive in respect of law enforcement governing the area of data protection. Like the Minister, I am conscious that the regulation itself comes into force on 25 May next. We will seek to facilitate the Government in respect of its commitment to try to get the legislation enacted by the end of May. However, I think we need to be aware that this vital legislation, which will affect the rights of citizens throughout this country, should not be rushed. It is important that we get it right, as opposed to simply enacting it as quickly as possible in order to get this done by the end of May. Before looking at a number of specific provisions in the Bill, I will refer to the developments in data protection that have taken place in the past 30 years. Legislation dealing with data protection was first introduced in this country in 1988. I do not know if anybody present was in this Chamber back in 1988, but if he or she was when the data protection Bill of that year was being discussed, I doubt anyone could have envisaged the developments that would take place in data protection in the subsequent 30 years. We must recognise that the debate on this legislation takes place against the background of an extraordinary technological revolution that has taken place in the world in the past 20 years, in particular. I am talking about the development of the Internet and the establishment of data and large technology companies that have been able to develop enormous powers through the accumulation, collation and use of personal data of individuals. This is something we never envisaged prior to the creation of the Internet and the revolution that took place in data technology in the past 20 years. It is important to note that there have been many beneficial developments as a result of the technological revolution. We have seen great developments in access to information and through this revolution people have been able to access information that they have never been able to access before. Accessing that information has become much more democratised since very many people can use the Internet and search engines. There have been benefits in providing people with the opportunity to become more aware of their culture and past; that is a great benefit generated by the technological revolution. Another great development and benefit for society is in communication. Many years ago when people left Ireland, they did so with the certainty that they would probably never be able to communicate with the individuals they were leaving behind in any meaningful or regular way. That has now gone as a result of the excellent developments that have taken place in technological and Internet communications. There have been very many benefits as a result of the technological revolution, but there have also been very many negative consequences. I will give a couple of examples. No society has been exposed to pornography more than this one. Young people have never previously grown up with the promotion of pornography being so general and broad on the Internet. It must necessarily have an impact on their sexual development and perception of sexuality in general. We do not yet know what the consequences will be, but it is something we must watch carefully. We need to assist young people who are being exposed to matters such as this that previous generations were never exposed to. Another very negative consequence of the technological revolution is its facilitation and enablement of child abuse on an international basis as never encountered before. A third negative consequence is what is generally referred to as "fake news", with false information being given out and accepted by individuals as being true. The issue on which I want to concentrate in this contribution is the damage being done in another important area of public life by the technological revolution. I am talking about the damage done by it to individualism. This is not a political philosophy; it is more of a social outlook or personal philosophy. Individualism is generally about individual people being able to make decisions for themselves based on their own intellectual capacity and life experiences. There is great benefit in a society having widespread individualism. It encourages the exchange of ideas and asks people not to get involved in "groupthink" which can be prevalent in certain societies. It adds to the intellectual life of a nation, when individuals can think differently for themselves, and promotes an exchange of ideas. It enables individuals to be honest with themselves about the generation of personal views, as opposed to the formulation of views based on what others think. Unfortunately, I am sure many others and I believe the technological revolution that has taken place in the past 20 years and, in particular, the accumulation of data from individuals have damaged the principle and practice of individualism. Part of the reason large technology companies have so much information on individuals is they naïvely give away much information on themselves. There is also a purpose behind large technology companies or corporate entities wanting to accumulate data of individuals. They do it because they want to categorise individuals into groups and commodify them. They want to make it easier to sell these groups to advertisers or people who believe such groups would be of interest to a particular market for a product they wish to sell. We must be very conscious of the fact that this process of accumulating data of individuals and commodifying them into groups is having a very damaging effect on individualism. It is something we need to recognise and discourage. We need to constantly tell young and old people that they should formulate their own views and opinions based on their own intellectual assessments, rather than being told to do it or being malleable or impressionable while following a crowd. Unfortunately, many people now make up their minds not only on political issues but sometimes even on personal choices based on how they see the group to which they have affiliated acting. That should not be the case. It was always the case in Ireland and around the world that people could have a variety of views, but, unfortunately, we are now seeing homogenous views among society's groups. This is being used in a political context and around the world people's political views are sometimes formed because they believe the group to which they see themselves aligned in a data process has been identified as voting for or against some topic. Individuals naïvely see themselves as being in favour of that topic. Throughout history people have been impressionable and malleable, but, unfortunately, the technological revolution that has taken place with data makes that malleability even more apparent. It is one of the major concerns I have about the entire practice of data accumulation and the commodification of data by individuals. I am sorry. I did not realise I had gone on so long giving what was probably a boring lecture for everybody.

It is welcome that the Minister has identified that something will be done for Members of this House and other elected representatives. Looking at the equivalent British legislation, we can see that they are going through a similar process with their Bill. Some regulations have been included in it, not for the purpose of exempting politicians but recognising the very unique role politicians play in society. If we do not stand up for the status of what we do, as politicians, we may as well give up being Members of the House. We are not doing this to benefit ourselves but rather for the benefit of democracy. It is important to recognise that we can have all of the data protection laws in the world in place, but there will be a huge responsibility placed on the data protection commission. Fortunately, we have very many large technological companies in the country. Notwithstanding my views about the threat posed to individualism, it is welcome that employment is provided by these large groups. We need to recognise that the data protection commission will have a major job to do as a result of the passing of the Bill and the extra responsibilities that will rest with the office. I am also pleased to hear the Minister say he has looked at the recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality. Much work was done on that committee on pre-legislative scrutiny. We produced a number of recommendations. One point that concerned me during the pre-legislative scrutiny, and this may provoke a wry smile from some people here, is that the law in respect of data protection will become a lawyer's holiday. The last thing we want is to have a situation where people can have their data infringed to a minor extent but a team of lawyers will advance a data protection claim which will result in not an enormous award of damages to the person whose data has been breached but it will be accompanied by correspondingly large legal bills. I also support the finding of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality recommending that fines be administered to public bodies in breach of new data protection legislation. If fines are not imposed on public bodies, there is no real sanction. The argument is that it is just a fine going from one public body to another. However, in that case, no sanctions would ever be imposed on a public body. We need to have a sanction in place. It is not so much the actual payment of the fine that is significant, but the fact that the fine has been imposed, recognising the wrongdoing on the part of the public body. I welcome that there is an entitlement to seek compensation. In general, the courts to date have awarded small amount of damages in respect of data protection breaches. Obviously, there may be cases where large damages should be awarded. In general, however, I think the damages awarded should be moderate. That echoes the concern I have about the fact that we have to careful not to generate it into an industry where people can take class actions for breaches of data protection and the awarded damages will be minimal but the costs will be significant. I have gone on for long enough. I and Fianna Fáil will be co-operating with the Minister and the rest of the House in trying to ensure this is enacted. We will probably be tabling our own amendments on Committee Stage and I look forward to listening to the other contributors to the debate.
#JamesLawless	unknown-#JamesLawless-party	unknown-#JamesLawless-dob	unknown-#JamesLawless-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	311	To follow on from Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's comments, I welcome the Data Protection Bill implementing the GDPR. I will reflect on the origins of data protection in general for a moment. Deputy Jim O'Callaghan spoke of the rights of the individual. It is important to note that data protection is not a technological aspect but a human rights issue. Data protection has its origins in the many august institutions founded post the Second World War, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, UNCHR, and the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR, later on. It emanated from concerns about promoting peace and international co-operation and ensuring that the events of the Second World War would never happen again. The state does not need to know someone's religious preferences, sexual orientation or other sensitive information about an individual which could be exploited in horrendous ways or indeed for purposes slightly less malign but with many other malevolent possibilities. Data protection legislation and theory has advanced from those early fundamental concepts into the Internet age, through the age of the PC and into the age of social media. Indeed, we had the Data Protection Commissioner, Ms Helen Dixon, and representatives from Facebook, before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment this afternoon talking about the Online Advertising and Social Media (Transparency) Bill 2017. They also spoke about these issues which remain relevant today. I welcome the GDPR and this Bill coming before the House. However, I think the fundamental concepts in the previous legislation, the five or six general principles, were fairly sound. By being principle-based, they were easier to follow and implement because we had things like no more than is necessary, collect for the purpose consented to, and no more than for that purpose, etc. Those broad principles served us well. The GDPR is complex legislation. It has been thought through in detail in Europe and now here. However, it is fair to acknowledge the European Union, in particular as a driver of this, has been the gold standard in data protection and indeed the right to privacy in these areas to date. Ireland is the home to much of Europe's data. As many multinational corporations are based in Ireland, that means we are the data centre for European operations. That in turn means that essentially most of the world's data that is not in the United States is controlled, managed and regulated out of Dublin. In a sense this is a good thing and a great opportunity as Deputy Jim O'Callaghan said. I refer to foreign direct investment, employment and technological advancement. Being in proximity to that for our students and graduates is a fantastic thing and long may it continue. However, it places strains on our regulatory officers, and the Data Protection Commissioner in particular. In the committee this afternoon I asked her a question I will now put to the Minister and flag it to the House in general. We saw a situation in the United Kingdom where the Information Commissioner's Office had to face the unedifying spectacle of appearing on national television announcing the seeking of a warrant to raid the Cambridge Analytica offices. The warrant was, I think, eventually procured a week later. Generally in matters of criminal investigation or evidence gathering, it is not a great start to give a week's notice to the office about to be raided. It is not the way it is done. I hope the powers and resources are available to the Data Protection Commissioner for the likes of dawn raid scenarios or any other scenarios of enforcement as may arise. If they are not there, it is something we need to look at and incorporate into either this Bill or elsewhere because regulation is only effective with enforcement. We have seen that in a number of sectors to date and this is no different. On the Bill coming before us, we have heard it is important that fines are included. I am glad that public bodies are no longer exempt. That did not really make sense because the State is one of the largest controllers and processors of information overall. Why should it be exempt? That would seem to give carte blanche to ignore the rules and I am glad that has been addressed in the Seanad. The impact on the small firms sector has been a source of concern. Many are worried about the legislation because they understand it is onerous and complicated. With good faith and the best will, they want to implement it but they are concerned they may not be able to. I hope there is a degree of proportionality in respect of the introduction and early enforcement of that as firms do get up to speed. It is important they be given some degree of understanding and support to get there. Having said that, I think firms should not look at it as an entirely negative issue. It is an opportunity for firms to differentiate themselves and it could become a marketing strategy that a firm was GDPR compliant and the first in its sector to be so. They could turn it from a shield into a sword and become a positive. It is unfortunate we are debating the legislation in the Dáil for the first time with five weeks to D-Day. It is less than five weeks. I think it is four and a half weeks now. Going back to the SME sector, I am aware of many firms in my constituency, and I am sure around the country, desperately trying to get up to speed and put in place training, regulation and audit regimes. I spoke to some recently and I said we would be amending it; therefore, the fact that the Bill is still a work in progress and small firms are desperately trying to get up to speed is far from ideal. I am not sure why it is only now, with four and half weeks to go, that we are getting to debate it in the Dáil. I know it has been through the Seanad in the past two weeks, but even at that, the debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas started six or seven weeks out from the due date. We knew this was coming for a couple of years. I understand the Minister flagged that there was consultation with the committee and perhaps wider consultation. However, it seems that in this House we have ended up with two parallel systems. One is where the Government issues Bills which undergo deep and wide consultation, apparently, but much of it is unknown to us in the Houses of the Oireachtas and much of it is done privately behind the scenes in the Departments. The other is where Private Members' Bills are introduced and then the Government criticises them for being introduced too quickly, but there is no other option. We look forward to Committee and Report Stages being the place to thrash them out and indeed the scrutiny phase. On one hand the Government criticises Opposition Deputies for introducing Private Members' Bills and doing so, as it describes it, rapidly, whereas in actual fact it is only the normal process. On the other hand, if the Government delays introduction of a Bill to the Oireachtas until four and a half weeks before it is due to become law at European level, there is a difficulty with that. There is much more I could say but I will conclude because we are out of time. However, I do want to flag that I will be studying the Bill along with Deputy O'Callaghan and my colleagues and I am sure we will be bringing amendments forward on the next Stage. I look forward to further engagement and discussion on the legislation.

Beimid ag obair leis go pointe áirithe. Tá roinnt amhrais orainn faoi chuid mhaith den Bhille. Déanfaimid iarracht déileáil leis na deacrachtaí sin trí leasuithe a mholadh ar Chéim an Choiste. This is significant, complex and lengthy legislation. From our point of view there are still many concerns. The Bill was improved on several fronts in the Seanad. However, we still have significant concerns in respect of the legislation and if these concerns are not addressed we may not support the Bill at the final vote. We acknowledge the need to complete this work by 25 May but we have serious reservations relating to ministerial exemptions, potential inconsistencies with the general data protection regulation and several other areas. As has been outlined, the Bill partially emanates from the general data protection regulation. The European Parliament, the European Council and European Commission have attempted to strengthen and unify data protection for all individuals in the European Union through the regulation. The GDPR is essentially a minimum standard expected of each member state on the threshold and rights afforded to citizens of member states and the data protection of individuals within those states. More important, it supersedes domestic law. We supported the GDPR in the European Parliament. The principles behind it are good. Where we divert from the GDPR is where the Bill runs into trouble. As I have stated, this legislation has direct effect but some elements require legislation. Some elements allow for a margin of appreciation or discretion in how jurisdictions apply the provisions, such as digital age of consent. The Bill is far longer than it needs to be. Deputy James Lawless made a point in reference to small and medium-sized enterprises and how the Bill could be amended in the context of the challenges they face. However, the reality is that the GDPR will be the GDPR and it will have supremacy. It will be European law and, therefore, it will be Irish law. We should seek to ensure that where there are allowances left to member states, we make decisions on them. Too much of this Bill attempts to adjust, make exceptions to or amend the principles and provisions of the GDPR. Ireland is not fully in compliance with EU data retention law currently as of the Tele2 Sverige and Watson case. Essentially, we have been in breach of EU law since 2016. There is a need for the protection of data protection officers from the interference of a data controller who aims to suppress a release of information on the basis that despite its release being in the public interest it is not in the interest of the data controller for a variety of reasons. We can imagine an employer or someone in a public body who may have an interest in the data protection officer not doing his or her job properly. The lack of protections or avenues for addressing these concerns represents an oversight. This flaw was raised in the Seanad. Nevertheless, it is something that can be provided for. The Minister has informed us that the general law covers this, but it would be beneficial and necessary for specific protections and procedures to be explicitly stated and put in place in that context. The manner of the drafting of this Bill is not ideal or clear. After the passing of the Bill there will be need to consult three Acts, the data protection regulation and any other relevant European instruments in order to be aware of the legal position. It would be far clearer, better and more comprehensible for the provisions of the Data Protection Acts 1998 to 2003 to be consolidated into this Bill and for those Acts to be repealed. Deputy O'Callaghan has identified the potential for significant confusion and litigation. While such a move is no longer feasible at this stage before the coming into force of the GDPR, the Minister should consider consolidating data protection legislation as soon as possible. One important change made in the Seanad was proposed by my Sinn Féin colleagues. The amendment required transparency and required the Data Protection Commissioner to conduct an impact assessment where the Minister of the day decides to involve public interest to bypass consent. The basis of the amendment was that the ministerial exceptions in this legislation are too broad. That was the reason we put in place the safeguard. We remain concerned but we believe the amendment must be retained as a safeguard. It is welcome that the Minister has accepted that public bodies should be open to being fined. That is welcome and important. This was a flaw with the original Bill but it is welcome that the Minister has taken the point on board. It is important there is an incentive for compliance, including for public bodies. It is welcome that this has been taken on board. The concern was shared by many. The Seanad held a comprehensive debate on this Bill. I commend Senators on their work, including my colleague, Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile, and Senator Alice-Mary Higgins, who made a significant contribution across a wide range of amendments. Despite their best efforts I still have misgivings. In general, our concerns relate to the far-reaching exemptions and discretion. We are also concerned that the protection for data protection officers from the interference of a data controller who aims to suppress the release of information is inadequate - I addressed this point earlier. There is potential for a lack of legislative clarity due to the potential contradictions between this legislation and the GDPR. I am concerned about section 45, which I believe may not be fully in compliance with Article 9 of the GDPR. Article 9(1) states: "Processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation shall be prohibited." The expression "shall be prohibited" is the key phrase. I understand there are exemptions under Article 9(2)(g) of the GDPR. However, my party believes that the relevant section in the Bill does not fit the definition of the exemptions outlined in the GDPR. I do not believe, therefore, that the Bill is in compliance with Article 9. This is the basis for our significant concerns. Aside from being contrary to the GDPR, and by extension, European law, the Bill is ambiguous in a number of aspects and there may be several unintended loopholes. This could lead to an infringement of rights in the context of data protection for citizens. Such loopholes would leave us in a situation whereby Ireland could become a target for those who deal in micro-targeting and data harvesting due to inadequate regulation and oversight. My interpretation is that the amendment to section 45 proposed on Report Stage in the Seanad fell short of what was required. It was an improvement but, as I read it, the provision would allow a political party, organisation or data company of whatever kind to come to Ireland with the intention of compiling voter data or data on citizens for the purposes of an election or electoral purposes elsewhere. This would be contrary to Article 9. Perhaps the Bill deals to some extent with data collected in this State for use in the State but I do not believe the extraterritorial issues have been adequately dealt with. The data breach relating to Cambridge Analytica has been discussed at great length. Deputy Jim O'Callaghan articulated well the advantages of modern information technology, as well as the dangers. Even where it is legal, I imagine many would have reservations and misgivings about the scale of data gathering that occurs and the analysis and management of it.I do not believe the legislation properly manages the prevention of the collection of data of those under the age of 18 years. We should consider a ban on the micro-targeting of those under the age of 18 years, as well as banning their psychometric profiling. I have concerns about section 36. I do not believe it is in compliance with the general data protection regulation, GDPR. It should be the same as it. As with this and many of the other provisions, the GDPR, when it takes effect, will not only be European law but also Irish law. It is an unusual European instrument in that it will largely have a direct effect, but it does allow some flexibility. I do not know why the Department and the Minister have taken the approach of trying to spell out everything where it is not necessary to do so. Likewise, while section 38 has been improved by the introduction of the proportionality test, I am concerned that it is not necessarily in compliance with the Bara judgment. As with many provisions in the section, the Department has adopted an approach of providing that something shall be lawful, with some exceptions, whereas the GDPR takes the approach of providing that something "shall be prohibited", with some exceptions. That does matter and it is those differences and forms of language that will be examined by the courts in making decisions in cases in which there may be contradictions. Inserting section 38 appears to be the way the Department intends to legislate for the public services card. I believe it knows - it has all but admitted it, as have other Departments - that the legal basis for demanding the public services card in exchange for services from the Government is effectively non-existent. The Government is attempting, in what I believe is a cynical way, to shoehorn in this provision. It is a very serious matter. If there is to be a requirement to have a public services card and for the gathering of that kind of data in the management of public services, it should be the focus of a separate debate. This is a general provision which is attempting to provide legislative cover where it was not provided previously without adequate safeguards, at the very least to require people to produce a public services card.  The public interest is referred to as the safeguard for numerous exemptions provided for in the Bill. There are more than 20 exceptions from the GDPR generally where the public interest is referred to, but the public interest is not properly defined or specified in the Bill. It is much more specific in Article 9.2(g) of the GDPR which states the interferences with the public interest should "...respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject". Given that the Minister has taken the approach of trying to put as much as possible into the legislation, which is questionable, it is unusual that some of the less specific points relate to the safeguards which have not made it into the legislation. I am also concerned that electoral activities under sections 45, 55 and 56 are not properly defined. There is surely potentially ample room for challenge and query and for legal cases to be taken on the basis of a lack of clarity and a contradiction with the GDPR. Another gap in the Bill is that it does not include the provision in Article 81 that not-for-profit groups can bring actions on behalf of data subjects. The regulation envisages a form of multi-party action akin to a class action, but that is not provided for in the Bill. Our Multi-Party Actions Bill has passed pre-legislative scrutiny stage. I hope it can proceed to Committee Stage at an early date and that the Minister can provide a money message to ensure it can be enacted as soon as possible. It is relevant not only from a data protection point of view but also to a number of other areas. I referred to electoral activities. Clearly, there is a need for a greater definition and greater clarity as to what is involved. There is certainly the potential for disagreement on what electoral activity involves. The Minister made reference to amendments that he was likely to bring forward on the operations of Deputies in their offices. Their work in their constituency offices regularly involves making representations or inquiries on behalf of constituents. It is unfortunate that people often believe the only way they can get satisfaction with respect to matters concerning public services is to go to a Deputy, whereas, by right, they should be able to seek out and achieve answers on such matters themselves, but that is another matter. I do not believe there is anything in the GDPR that prevents this from happening. I will carefully examine the amendments when they are brought forward as it is a role that needs to be carefully protected. My understanding of the GDPR is that where such representations are likely to be made, it requires full and informed consent and good records to be kept. There is nothing in it that prevents anyone from making representations. I will examine the amendments, but I do not believe the GDPR in any way prevents it from happening. If the Minister believes it does, that should be stated. I made a point about incentives and fines. Recital 149 of the GDPR allows member states to penalise companies that break data protection law with a clawback of the profits obtained through misbehaviour. That would mean that those acting outside the law, intentionally or otherwise, would be deterred from taking an action that could see them profit financially, even in an illegal way. That is something the Government should consider. It is not something that has been considered up to now. It is one of the areas in which the EU institutions have allowed flexibility. I do not believe the Minister has addressed it thus far in this debate, the debate in the Seanad or elsewhere. It would be a significant deterrent to companies to misbehave. The examples are all around us. We heard at a joint committee this week that the potential for the misuse and exploitation of data was very clear. The Government should consider this. We will bring forward amendments in that regard. If companies are going to exploit, undermine and abuse data and profit from them, why should they, when caught, not be penalised for it through a clawback of their profits? It is eminently logical and sensible and right. I have a concern about this legislation in the context of Brexit. When the United Kingdom becomes a third country after Brexit, for the purposes of legal certainty in the GDPR, the European Union and its institutions will require an adequacy decision from the United Kingdom. The Government has stated thus far that it is confident that will be achieved and not present difficulties. However, Jan Philipp Albrecht, the European Parliament's rapporteur for the GDPR, has expressed doubts about whether the United Kingdom could obtain adequacy, as he has said there would be fewer safeguards for intelligence services in the United Kingdom than in the United States. That is a matter of enormous seriousness, given the Border, the great concern in this State about Brexit across a wide range of areas and the fact that there are a number of areas in which data may need to be transferred between various authorities in the North and the South with the usual safeguards. However, if the United Kingdom cannot obtain an adequacy statement, that will present very significant problems for this State. Will the Minister provide greater clarity on this issue, on whether there will be an adequacy statement and whether it will be achieved immediately? We need to inquire of the European Parliament's rapporteur to a greater extent why he believes there may be difficulties in that regard. It is extremely serious and an implication of Brexit that has not been properly explored up to now, either here or in London.  We will approach this legislation on the basis of critical engagement. We will support positive amendments. However, we are very concerned about the level of ministerial exceptions, the inconsistencies with the GDPR and the potential for a lack of legal clarity.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16568	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	313	The first issue I wish to raise relates to the complexity of the data protection code. In Ireland we have chosen to retain most of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003, although we will in the future apply them only to cases involving national security, defence or international relations. For every other case, we will have the new EU data protection regulation which has 173 recitals and 99 articles. We will also have this implementing Bill which has 165 sections and three Schedules. The Bill and the regulation will have to be read side by side. Data protection compliance is as pervasive an issue in modern society as tax compliance and the code is becoming as complex, attracting its own cohort of professional advisers who are needed to explain all of it to those of us who must comply with it. The rules do not just apply to the Mark Zuckerbergs and Denis O'Briens of this world. The reality is that every one of us who has even a basic mobile phone that stores names and numbers is a data controller in the eyes of the law. Years ago the code was extended to apply to manual as well as electronic records. The rules will not apply to what are called "purely personal or household activities", but if someone has any name or number on his or her phone that he or she no longer needs for personal or household activities, strictly this law will apply to that person and he or she will be in breach of it. I wonder how many citizens are aware of this. An example of the complexity are the rules relating to children. First, there is the so-called digital age of consent. This is the age at which a child has the capacity to consent to the processing of personal data by the provider of an "information society service". The regulation deals with personal data, data that identify or are about an individual person and include names, addresses, dates of birth and anything that a person shares on social media such his or her preferences, status updates and, in many cases, private conversations over messaging apps, among other elements. A key issue in the GDPR involves the notion of profiling. Profiling is essentially about using algorithms, data analytics and artificial intelligence to predict what a person might like, what his or her fears might be, what his or her biases might be, what advertisements he or she would like to see and to what messages he or she would respond well. While this all sounds of little consequence, recent scandals such as those involving Cambridge Analytica show that profiling is an extremely powerful tool and can be used to undermine democracy and manipulate ordinary citizens. The tools used to profile users are complex computer algorithms that use machine learning, data analytics and artificial intelligence. A major question in the context of data protection is whether the typical user of any online platform on which one shares data actually has a good enough understanding of how these algorithms work and what the consequences of sharing data that are fed to them might be. Before proceeding, I acknowledge the work of people like Professor Barry O'Sullivan, to whom I have deferred on this matter as a guide on its technical elements. Professor O'Sullivan, who is a professor of computer science at University College Cork, highlighted to me that an important point to remember was that the Internet was designed as a democratic environment in which all users were treated and regarded equally. As a consequence, no special allowance is made for children online, but they do deserve special attention. There has been considerable debate in the Houses on the digital age of consent. It is Professor O'Sullivan's contention, as an expert in the field, that the digital age of consent is not about when children can go online, use devices, etc.; rather, it only relates to situations where the processing of the personal data of a child is performed. The Bill sets the Irish digital age of consent at the lowest possible age - 13 years - but do we believe a child of 13 is able to understand the power of algorithmic profiling? Do we believe children understand how their actions online influence the adverts that they see or the content suggested to them? The answer is surely not. Of course, one can easily make this argument against 16 year olds also, but we should err on the side of caution and set the digital age of consent at the upper end of the allowed age band, that being, 16 years. Doing so would keep Ireland in line with Germany, the Netherlands, France and others that have best-in-the-class approaches to protecting children online. A digital age of consent lower than 16 years is out of line with the age of consent for other matters, for instance, giving consent for health procedures. It is important that parents have the power to give consent for young children, which a digital age of consent of 16 years would provide. Parents need to be in a position to parent their children, not to be excluded in this instance at the age of 13 years. Advocates for a digital age of consent of 13 years might argue that children have a right to a voice online and a right to participation. No one is arguing against this. However, the digital age of consent only applies when their personal data are being gathered and processed. The argument should be about providing children under the digital age of consent with platforms that do not exploit their personal data as a condition of their use. This is particularly important for vulnerable younger children who should not have to rely on parental consent. The issue in this instance becomes the provision of safe places online that protect their anonymity and platforms that do not profile them on the basis of personal data. Relying on commercial platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and others to provide such safe places or to attempt to use them as such puts vulnerable children at risk. Such risks can arise from the unintentional breach of their anonymity, their targeting through advertising and marketing campaigns based on their interactions online and the potential exposure to individuals online who might not have their best interests at heart. Many special interest groups and children's rights representatives have argued for a digital age of consent of 13 years. Some of the arguments include the question of how we should support children whose parents are, for example, abusive and, therefore, cannot be relied on to give consent; the need for a child in care to have access to his or her birth family, other family members and friends where it is not clear who has the power of parental consent; and those children who need access to support and preventive services. It is important to stress that it is dangerous to rely on social media platforms to provide a mechanism for vulnerable or at-risk children to network with like-minded children. First, the existence of these children on such platforms is often easy to discover by a parent. For example, if the child and the parent use phones to access Facebook and each has the mobile number of the other on his or her phone, Facebook can recommend each of them as a possible friend to the other. In other words, the anonymity of the child is not protected, as has been argued on social media sites. Second, the closed groups might themselves be dangerous since predatory individuals might lurk in them to befriend vulnerable children.The solution that must be provided to support the children of abusive parents is not standard social media companies but platforms that are safe and that do not process personal data, which would make them exempt from the digital age of consent. Who has parental responsibility for the child is something that should be clarified in the Data Protection Bill 2018. For example, such consent could be given by the person or entity that has guardianship of the child. This is something the Bill needs to include and that can easily be solved.  We have to acknowledge the complexity of the world in which children live. In this party we take the view that we should err on the side of caution and that the most appropriate digital age of consent is 16 years. The regulation defines an information society service as a service normally provided for remuneration at a distance by electronic means and at the individual request of a recipient of the service. It includes services that are not directly remunerated by those who receive them, if they represent an economic activity. Google search, as an obvious example, falls within the definition of an information society service. The Government has decided to set at 13 years the age at which a child can consent to the processing of his or her personal data in connection with an offer from an information society service. I note that a Seanad amendment provides for a review of this age limit after three years. However, the Bill contains provisions relating to codes of conduct for the protection of children who, for this purpose, are all persons under 18 years of age. We will have 13 year olds with the capacity to sign away their personal data, even though for the next five years of their lives they will be the subject of special protective codes because in the eyes of the law they are still children. It is a contradiction in terms.  On top of this, we have to incorporate the common law rules relating to children and contracts. As I see it, these rules have not been displaced or amended by the Bill. Article 8 of the regulation specifically states its provisions "shall not affect the general contract law of Member States such as the rules on the validity, formation or effect of a contract in relation to a child". What is the position on this apparent contradiction? The digital age of consent is not about a child’s general capacity to enter into a contract; it is solely about his or her capacity to consent to the processing of personal data. It does not affect the general law of Ireland on the validity or effect of a contract with a child or so it states. As I said, under Irish common law, an individual does not have full capacity to make a contract until he or she is 18 years of age. There is an exception for the sale to a minor of what the law calls "necessaries". If these common law rules are left in place and unamended, it seems that the outcome will be that a minor will have the capacity at 13 years to consent to the processing of his or her personal data but may not have capacity to enter the substantive contract in question on the grounds that it is not a contract for a "necessary". Whether the contract is for a necessary entirely depends on a court’s views on the contract in question and, in particular, the goods or services in question and the minor’s need for them. If that is so, in such a case the contract will be unenforceable against the minor such that, for example, any debt accruing will not be recoverable. My point is not so much about whether these are good or bad rules. My question is whether it is an improvement to have two sets of rules that can conflict with each other and which cease to apply at different ages. That is the nub of what I am saying.  I will speak briefly about electoral activities. Following the Cambridge Analytica saga, the mass manipulation of personal data banks for electoral and referendum purposes has attracted a great deal of interest and comment. The Minister responded in the Seanad with amendments to section 45. The section now provides that, as an exception to a general prohibition, the processing of personal data revealing political opinions is lawful where it is carried out in the course of electoral activities in the State by a political party or candidate or a referendum commission. I wonder if this tightly drafted exception has missed the point. As I understand it, Cambridge Analytica is not accused of processing personal data that revealed political opinions. It is accused of amassing data from Internet usage that enables it to compile a crude psychological profile of an individual in order to assist an advertiser in deciding how to shape a political message that would specially appeal to that individual, a custom designed message that would not be seen by the broad mass of voters. If that is correct, I do not see how section 45 would apply to these activities at all. The section, as amended, does seem broad enough to cover political canvassing and the marking of the register, but, as the Minister seemed to admit in the Seanad, it is not a form of exemption envisaged by the regulation. In other words, there does not seem to be a specific provision of the regulation that enables the Oireachtas to carve out an exception enabling the processing of political opinions for electoral purposes. The best the Minister can point to is Recital (56) which states "Where in the course of electoral activities, the operation of the democratic system in a Member State requires that political parties compile personal data on people's political opinions" and so forth. I note that the Minister has said he intends to bring forward an amendment. I do not know if it will speak specifically to that issue. I am hopeful it will. We are putting him on notice that it is our intention to speak to this issue further on Committee Stage.  We in this House and the Upper House, councillors and every elected representative in the country are not always electioneering. We aim to always be ready for an election. In the interim, we act as a citizens advice bureau and social workers, legal advisers, advocates and facilitators. We explain and, to some extent, humanise the bureaucracy of the State on behalf of our constituents. This daily routine of our lives has nothing to do with section 45. It is not electoral activity and does not involve processing data on political opinions, but in this process we compile varied and detailed files which, of their nature, are full of personal information, much of which is very sensitive. When elections are held, we contact the people in question and remind them of all the occasions on which we engaged with them in the preceding years. There is nothing underhand about this. It would be astonishing if we did not do it, but is it legal to do so?  Sections 55 and 56 of the Bill seem to have been designed to override the general provisions of Article 21 of the regulation. That article gives an individual the right to object to the processing of his or her personal data. The two sections of the Bill state this right does not apply to direct mailing or data processing carried out in the course of electoral activities. I am entirely unclear on whether this covers direct mailing during an election from a database compiled outside election time and which is compiled from constituency clinic cases. There is a need for clarity in that regard because it goes to the heart of what we do. If no clarity is provided, we are in an existential crisis. If, for example, we are obliged under the general rules not to retain constituent data for longer than is necessary to deal with a clinic case, how would we have the wherewithal to generate any direct mailing list at election time? I can well appreciate that the law should apply to our activities and the information we amass and keep, but I cannot help wondering, having regard to our own activities, how well we and, by extension, the rest of the country will, in practice, comply with the detail of the rules we are about to make.

As he or she accumulates that profit, he or she gains more and more power over society. When the first critiques of the pernicious logic of commodification and profit at the heart of how capitalism operates were developed by people like Marx, they talked about the commodification of raw materials, goods and services and the profits accumulated by the owners of these resources, factories, small businesses, landholdings and so on. Even 200 years ago Marx understood the logic was relentless, that the process of commodification would reach into every single aspect of human existence and the natural world and that slowly but surely everything would be commodified and made subject to the cash nexus. In fairness to Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, perhaps slightly surprisingly, he alluded to this and was absolutely right. That is where we have got to with the digital or information technology revolution. I do not think even Marx could have understood just how far-reaching the process would be in commodifying every aspect of our existence, down to genetics, with the genetic profiling of individuals, categories of people and so on. The digital revolution has facilitated the process of commodification to an absolutely extraordinary degree. The beneficiaries of the technological process, the owners of the information or the technology that amasses and controls that information on us accumulate levels of wealth parallel to their accumulation of enormous stores of information on us as human beings and individuals and now dominate the economy and the globe like colossi. It could not have been envisaged 200 years ago when capitalist development got under way that a few companies such as Facebook, Google and Apple would absolutely dominate these sectors and control a vast amount of information on us, as we see in the issue being discussed in the courts related to Mr. Denis O’Brien, the richest individual in the country. His extraordinary control of the media, another source of information on our society, beggars belief and deserves another debate on its own merits because one wealthy individual who seems to be fêted constantly by Taoisigh and prominent political figures can control the Irish Independent, Sunday Independent, Sunday World, The Herald, half of the Daily Star, The Kerryman, the Drogheda Independent, the Wicklow People, the Wexford People, the Waterford People, 98FM in Dublin, Newstalk, Today FM, Spin, Spin South West and the list goes on. Now there is an allegation that Mr. Denis O'Brien was using his control over Independent News & Media, an enormous corporation, to access the data of the journalists working for it.

I am not even offering an opinion on what the outcome of the case in the courts should be. I am simply stating what anyone can read on RTÉ's website, that the matter is being looked at and that there is an allegation which was written about widely in the newspapers at the weekend that Mr. Denis O'Brien and his representative in that company inappropriately accessed journalists' information and their sources, possibly including barristers and so on who were involved in the Moriarty tribunal, possibly including politicians and other sources. That matter is being investigated. Whether he is guilty will be adjudicated on by the courts. I am simply pointing out that that level of control and wealth gives people that access. Will the legislation we are bringing forward to protect data, in this case emails, if people are found guilty of the very serious charges levelled against Mr. Denis O'Brien, result in the police being sent for or will there be administrative sanctions? That is important because there is a parallel system of justice when it comes to these matters. It works in financial areas where, if someone is found guilty of engaging in white collar crime, the Central Bank imposes administrative sanctions and the person concerned is then immune from criminal sanctions. Will this legislation ensure people who are found guilty will be jailed, if, for example, as in this case, the courts adjudicate that there was illegal access of journalists' data? Will the police be sent in or will there be administrative sanctions? I want people who turn out to be guilty of committing that kind of crime, not just in this case but any case, to go to jail. They are doing exactly the same as someone who breaks into a house and burgles it. It should be treated as a criminal offence. There should not be two laws, whereby there are administrative sanctions for the corporate or financial sector or the owners of big digital corporations who have a lot of information on us and inappropriately allow our emails to be given to others, without our permission. They should be jailed. There should be dawn raids to arrest them. They should be subject to the same criminal sanctions as those guilty of common or garden criminal actions or theft. I would like to see legislation that would ensure that would happen.

I am moving this motion, along with my Fianna Fáil colleagues, and we hope for widespread support, which I am confident we will get across the House. Unfortunately, this is not the first time Fianna Fáil Deputies have come together in recent months to move a motion asking the Government to recognise a very real fodder crisis and respond appropriately to it. This matter has also been raised with the Government on numerous occasions by the farming organisations, including the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers association, ICSA, the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association, INHFA, and Macra na Feirme. I welcome the many farmers who are present in the Visitors Gallery tonight. There is a strong delegation from the IFA along with its president, Mr. Joe Healy. The IFA, along with the other organisations, has emphasised for many months the problem that was coming down the tracks. Unfortunately, the Government has at all stages ignored the warnings and walked headlong into a crisis for which it is unacceptably unprepared. Our motion outlines some immediate actions that are required to assist farmers who are experiencing tremendous hardship as a result of the shortage of fodder. We want a meal voucher scheme to be put in place. A hardship fund should be available for those who cannot afford to buy fodder over the coming weeks. We are also seeking a low-interest loan, to be put in place immediately, to help tide farmers over what has been an exceptionally long winter, and a long year before that. We are also seeking that there be understanding regarding the administration of farm inspections. There should be a hold put on them for the coming weeks. GLAS and sheep welfare scheme payments should be expedited and fully paid. We are seeking to ensure that a structure and standing committee will be put in place to ensure this problem does not recur. It is the second time in five years that we have experienced a fodder crisis. Unfortunately, despite there having been one in the recent past, the Government has been totally unprepared. Its response has been entirely woeful. It has left the farming community without the type of leadership it expects from a Government, including the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. We now need, although it is too late in the day, a proper response from the Government in this regard. The initial fodder scheme that was put in place to transport fodder from the south to the north and west has been shown to be completely wrong-headed. At the time, the Minister ignored the demands for a meal voucher scheme. He had not made the contingency plans to import fodder. He had to make it up on the go. We now need the Government to respond appropriately. Over the course of the debate tonight, my colleagues and the other Deputies in the House will outline what is required in this regard. I hope that the Government will at long last understand the role it needs to play and respond in a way that shows understanding of the plight of farmers across the country.

We raised this issue in November and again in January and we had a Topical Issue matter two weeks ago. We told the Minister about the impending crisis coming down the tracks but the Government refused to take action. Unfortunately, a couple of fine days will not rectify this problem. Huge losses have been, and continue to be, incurred. The production of milk in the first ten days of April is down 9% to 10%. There will be ongoing fertility problems in the dairy sector. The constituents of milk are down. The beef sector is incurring considerable extra costs. No spring crops have been sown, and tillage farmers have to decide whether it will be economical, even if the weather does pick up, to sow the crops. Knackeries are reporting significant extra casualties. There are ongoing costs. The Government has to recognise that there will be ongoing losses in addition to the bills. The battle is already on to ensure enough fodder for 2018 and 2019. In the vast majority of cases, fertiliser has not yet been spread for first-cut silage. As Deputy McConalogue has said, advance payments are welcome and will help with cashflow but more needs to be done. A low-cost loan is essential. When the joint Oireachtas committee met last Wednesday, the Minister's response was totally inadequate. He said the banks will look after this and look after credit for farmers. The Minister needs to look after credit for farmers, and he needs to ensure those who need it most get it, at a low cost. I suggest that the Minister remove VAT on silage-wrap plastic for 2018 and on silage harvesting because it is essential that all fodder that can be garnered in the summer of 2018 be garnered to avoid similar circumstances next autumn and winter. The Minister needs to take action now. He has failed to take adequate action up to now. Farmers need financial help. They are under huge pressure, both financially and mentally. They need to see action from the Government now.

They are being put to the pin of their collars as a result of the scarcity of fodder and continuing poor weather. We want to take the pressure off farmers by temporarily calling a halt to all cross-compliance inspections on farms, in addition to Bord Bia farm audits. That is important because there is enough stress, both mental and financial, on farmers without them having to worry about visits by inspectors at this important time. The approach I advocate will take some of the pressure off farmers and allow them to focus on their priority, which is looking after their animals. Additionally, it will help to reduce the mental stress experienced by many farmers. The motion calls for the establishment of a hardship fund to help small and medium-sized farms, the introduction of a meal voucher scheme for farmers affected, and the making available of low-cost credit for farmers swiftly to help pay for the cost of sourcing fodder and concentrates. Our motion also calls on the Government to immediately make outstanding 2017 balancing payments for the GLAS and sheep welfare scheme to ease the cashflow difficulties farmers are facing. The low-cost loan scheme for farmers announced last October also needs to be opened. The delay on GLAS payments rumbles on year after year. These delays are not exclusive to GLAS and are persistent in TAMS and other schemes. I cannot begin to explain to the Minister the frustration among farmers over the consistent delays in direct payments year after year. It is also frustrating for public representatives like ourselves. I have written to the Oireachtas liaison unit twice and have tabled two parliamentary questions on behalf of a farmer from Castlebanny, Mullinavat, in my area. All I get back is a standard general response, with no specific information on the timeframe for payments. This has been going on since November 2017. We need to do something rapidly. We need to help out the farmers.Farmers helped out the country on numerous occasions in the recession and during the bad weather lately. Now it is up to the Minister. He has failed them miserably so far. We brought this to his attention over the past few months but he took no action. Only a fortnight ago, he realised there was a problem. We are asking him to do something about it and it is now up to him.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	328	I agree wholeheartedly with the different proposals put forward by my colleagues. We discussed the fodder shortage as one of the last items of business on Holy Thursday evening and we all hoped at that stage that at least the weather would improve. Travelling through my own constituency of Cavan-Monaghan last night, there was torrential rain, once again putting back the possibility of growth and being able to let cattle out. Fianna Fáil and all the farm organisations have outlined specific measures that need to be implemented without further delay. The IFA in its statement this evening, as well as Lorcan McCabe of the ICMSA and the ICSA, have all put forward reasonable proposals that should be acted on and implemented, and they are outlined in our motion. I understand substantial quantities of fodder are coming in from Northern Ireland. The transport subsidy is not available for the transport of that fodder and I understand substantial offers of fodder are still available north of the Border. It is wrong that co-operatives sourcing product outside our jurisdiction are not entitled to the subsidy for transporting it to where it is needed. I have been told about this by people working in the co-operatives and they are well-informed members of the farming community. I ask the Minister to address that issue. There are huge pressures on the farming community. These measures, which would have negligible expenditure consequences, are essential and I appeal to the Minister to consider them. Some of us flagged the difficulties that emerged this winter due to cattle having to be housed so early last July and August. Many farmers in my own part of the country were unable to make a second cut and there was an obvious fodder shortage.

Since before the House resumed following the summer recess, Deputy McConalogue has been putting up his hand. He indicated that was a problem and there was an inevitability to the crisis we are now in but, unfortunately, the Minister was like somebody using a satnav. He just listened to the voices in the Department but he forgot to look at the signposts for road works and he ended up in the ditch. There are farmers starving themselves now to keep their herds fed. We do not need the usual departmental approach of making something simple impossible, bureaucratic, unworkable and prohibitive but we need officials to do simple things simply. A meal voucher should be made available not just through the co-operative movement but through all independent providers and suppliers of meal to give farmers the supports they need. Payments should be front-loaded to those who need them and cognisance should be taken of the fact that many smallholdings even in good weather are on the bread line without a fodder crisis. They are in an emergency and we need somebody who is hands on, proactive and prepared to listen to those on the ground. We need action and we have been saying this since last September. This issue has been highlighted frequently. On 11 October 2017, I recall participating in a debate on Ocean FM with one of the Minister's party members who said I was crazy and there was no such thing as a fodder crisis. He said it was a myth and there was no issue. However, we are now in an emergency because the Minister did not listen. It is time to act.

The difficult weather conditions have caused havoc throughout the country and, in particular, in my own county of Wexford. Recent high volumes of rainfall, widespread flooding and a lack of grass growth due to the cold temperatures have compounded existing fodder shortages. Livestock have had to be kept indoors for much longer than usual, feed is gone, growth is non-existent and hope is at a premium. Every farmer is physically and mentally exhausted and many have gone beyond breaking point. The situation is intolerable. The Minister played Russian roulette with the hope that the weather would pick up. He was well warned about the crisis and he failed to prepare and act, which was reckless. Will he show leadership and immediately establish a hardship fund to help farmers? Will he introduce a meal voucher scheme for those affected? Will he swiftly make available low-cost credit for farmers? Will he ensure that all balancing payments outstanding from 2017 are paid as soon as possible?

As we can see based on those who have contributed so far, the crisis is widespread. I am disappointed that the press is not present to cover this national issue, which affects every community. If we take every funding line in the Department's budget, there are farmers waiting for money. Other farmers have won appeals and reviews over the past eight to ten weeks but no money has been released yet. I appeal to the Minister to go through his budget line by line and if money can be released to farmers in any way, shape or form, that should happen. Farmers are short of money now as well. I spoke to an elderly man last night who said that a wet summer or a wet fall is always followed by a bad spring and he named every year that has happened since the 1940s. Departmental staff should track that annually. It is almost five years to the day since we had our most recent debate on a fodder crisis. The mental health of farmers is also an issue. Collectively, as a House, we have to acknowledge this. Farmers are grappling with decisions they have made over the past five years, particularly since quotas were abolished. They increased the size of their herds and their borrowing capacity and so forth. They are in a stressful place as are their spouses and children. We need to acknowledge that there is a crisis and we need to encourage them to come forward and talk about it. When the previous Minister, Deputy Coveney, opened the new Dairygold plant, he referred to the bright future and the glorious opportunities that were available. It was pouring out of the heavens yesterday evening and one farmer said to me that there are glorious opportunities now. We need a sustainable agriculture industry going forward. It is a vital industry, which is keeping many rural communities alive. We need to make sure expansion is sustainable and that we are not back in the House in five months or five years talking about problems. There is a fodder crisis, which needs to be addressed. Whatever funding is available within the Department should be released post haste.

I support my colleagues' acknowledgement of the fodder crisis. Last night would have put a mental strain on any farmer. In my own backyard, there was an initial booking of 50 pens of cattle in Fermoy mart for today's trade. Only half the lots turned up, and although they sold at a reasonable price, those farmers were not in a position to bring them home again if they had not sold because they had no fodder for them. That is why those lots turned up. At our last meeting I highlighted another crisis. More needs to be done regarding port facilities. Lorries are being sent in large numbers but importers are not in a position to bring in enough concentrates such as corn gluten and that is creating a fierce shortage of meal on the ground. More needs to be done to help our ports to speed up this process. Three or four months ago, the Minister said he did not need to act because there was no crisis but if he had acted, money would not have to be wasted.Some farmers may have had the foresight to carry stock, silage and hay in their barns for the last three or four years and are now using it up. It is of as good a quality as what they saved last year. I am trying to tell the Minister that the money would not have gone to waste if he had brought in the stuff a couple of months ago, or especially going forward, with concerns about climate change. I ask the Minister to take action. Some action is necessary. I welcome his initiatives regarding greening for the tillage sector. I am delighted to see he reacted instantaneously there because the tillage sector is vital to the country's economy. As Deputy Creed said, he put money into capital investment in the dairy sector. We need to have the working capital in place as well.

Both the Minister, Deputy Creed, and I have worked through our Department and with Teagasc, co-operatives, farming organisations and farmers themselves to find ways to help the farming community deal with this very challenging time. In response to the problems experienced in the west and north west in late autumn and winter, the Minister, Deputy Creed, and I took the following steps to ensure the availability of fodder. Teagasc was asked to prioritise direct support to farmers by providing fodder budgeting and nutritional advice throughout the winter. The payment of farm supports to assist farmers with cashflow was prioritised and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has paid out over €1.6 billion to Irish farmers under Pillar I and Pillar II and will continue to make residual payments. The Minister, Deputy Creed, convened a fodder group chaired by Teagasc and consisting of all the key stakeholders to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the issue. A targeted fodder transport support measure, with an allocation of €500,000 was introduced by the Department on 29 January, providing assistance to livestock farmers in the west and north west. Throughout this challenging time, the Department's animal welfare helpline has been continuously available to offer assistance to any farmer experiencing animal welfare issues. The continuation of unseasonably cold weather throughout March delayed the onset of spring, inhibited grass growth and resulted in livestock having to be housed for longer than usual. As a result, the fodder problem became more widespread and extended to the more heavily stocked regions in the south and east. In response, Department officials arranged meetings with Teagasc and industry representatives to identify what further action might be taken. The decision was taken at ministerial level to extend the fodder transport measure to all counties and to introduce a fodder import support measure with an allocation of €1.5 million to ensure that sufficient fodder was available to all farmers. This measure, which is being operated through the co-operatives and other approved importers, is supporting the importation of approximately 20,000 tonnes of fodder into the country and will be kept under review until the current crisis is over. In addition, the Road Safety Authority of Ireland has agreed to greater flexibility for road hauliers engaged in the transport of fodder and feed. The green low-carbon agri-environment, GLAS, traditional hay meadow grazing date has been extended to 1 May 2018. The closing date for nitrates derogation applications has been extended to 30 April. Balancing payments under certain Pillar II schemes, including the sheep welfare scheme, will issue in the coming weeks, followed by GLAS in mid-May. The animal welfare helpline continues to be available to farmers in need. The Minister, Deputy Creed, recently met with the CEOs of the main banks. In what has been an evolving challenge, firstly due to an early winter period in the west and north west but more recently as a result of delayed turn-out of livestock to grazing lands across the country, we have responded in a targeted and appropriate way ensuring access to fodder for all farmers in need. Notwithstanding this, Teagasc is being asked to prioritise fodder conservation for future winters in its farm advisory campaigns to ensure there are adequate stocks for next winter. I am confident that the actions outlined above will ensure that farmers will be able to successfully plan more effectively for winters such as the one we have just witnessed.
#PatrickDeering	unknown-#PatrickDeering-party	unknown-#PatrickDeering-dob	unknown-#PatrickDeering-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	345	I thank the Minister of State for the opportunity to speak on this matter. There is no doubt that this has been a difficult and harrowing winter and spring until now. Every farmer in the country has experienced difficulties and nobody has been exempt from that issue. It is unfortunate that, to a certain extent, some political parties tend to play politics with this issue. Playing politics with this issue will not put one bale of hay, straw or silage into the yard of a farmer. That is an important point. Remember how this issue became bigger than what it was. There was a scarcity of fodder in the west and north west earlier in the year but it became a bigger issue in the earlier part of April when the weather turned bad and those farmers in the east, south east and south who had been supplying the west became concerned that they would not have enough fodder and stopped supplying it. Fortunately or unfortunately, there is still fodder in some parts of the country that has not been exposed at this stage. The farmers in the south became concerned that they would not have enough for themselves. I am aware of farmers who supplied other farmers in the west of Ireland in February and are now trying to source feed for themselves. That is when it became a big issue. There is a short-term issue, a medium-term issue and a long-term issue. The short-term issue is the availability of fodder. That issue has been addressed with the importation of fodder from England and Spain. That fodder will be available for as long as it is required. The medium-term issue is the cashflow difficulties that may arise as a result of the extra cost that has been incurred by farmers over the last period. It is important that the co-operatives step up to the plate. I acknowledge the dairy co-operatives which did not reduce the milk price in the last number of days. Some co-operatives decided to introduce a subsidy for meal going forward. Going forward, they have to be able to deal in a sympathetic way with farmers. The banks have an important part to play in this too. The long-term issue is the most important point. We have to have an honest discussion with ourselves about where we are. Do we have too many cattle in the country? We have to have a detailed review of Food Wise 2025, an industry-led initiative introduced a couple of years ago with which we will increase our exports to €19 billion, which is obviously a very ambitious target. We will have to review those targets and see if they are achievable going forward. A previous speaker mentioned sustainability going forward. It is a key issue. We have to put structures in place to ensure that mistakes from the past are addressed. Last week, as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I convened a meeting at the request of a number of members to review the situation. As a result of that meeting, we decided we would put a structure in place going forward whereby we would invite stakeholders involved, whether the banks or Teagasc, which I believe has an important part to play. In the past, Teagasc became a form-filling exercise. We need to get those people out on the ground, advising, encouraging and dealing with farmers, and showing them how to put structures in place to be able to manage their farms for the future. They will know how much fodder they will require going forward for the coming year. It is a long-term plan that needs to be put in place and Teagasc has an important part to play. There is a point in the Fianna Fáil motion about the hardship fund. The Fianna Fáil press release states that €1.5 million will address this issue. If €1.5 million will address this issue, I have huge concerns about it. Approximately 120,000 farmers applied for the single farm payment in the last year. They all looked for some money out of that €1.5 million. That is approximately €12 per farmer. Is that fair? Approximately 18,000 availed of the scheme in 2013, which would equate to €83 per farmer. Do we want to give farmers a measly amount of €83-----

The Minister has shown that he is prepared to change when change is needed and that was clearly demonstrated by the fodder transport scheme. He was not afraid to do that. As regards the money being put behind this problem, fodder is coming into the country and work is being done. Low-cost credit schemes are available and the Minister is working hard on the issue.

#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	375	I will be sharing time with my two colleagues. We will be supporting the motion put forward by Fianna Fáil in regard to the fodder crisis. The crisis has been going on for a very long time. In October of last year, I first raised with the Minister that a fodder crisis was looming in the north west. The Minister had at that time a very bland attitude to the matter and insisted that there was no crisis, there was plenty of fodder in the country and, although some farmers may be short, they could get fodder from their neighbours. That was true in some cases. However, 12 months before that, as I am sure the Minister will remember, I raised with him the possibility of a crisis in the winter of 2016-17 when I could see that farmers in the north west were very short of fodder. The farmers were lucky that year that there was a middling spring and they got through it. The essence of this is that farmers depend on the weather, as we know. I earlier joked with the Minister in the canteen that it was not his fault that the grass did not grow. However, the crisis is the fault of the Minister and the Government as they did not make provision for the possibility of its occurring. That is the issue which we raise here. The Minister last week said at a meeting of the joint committee that it would not have been appropriate to import fodder a couple of months ago. No one asked for fodder to be imported a couple of months ago. Teagasc officials were going around the country to address farmers. I was at a meeting with the IFA in Drumshanbo in County Leitrim last November at which a representative of Teagasc advised farmers to feed more concentrates in order to spread out and stretch out what silage they had. That was the consistent message it gave. Approximately two months later, just after Christmas, Teagasc told us that farmers were approaching a crisis and had no money to buy more concentrates and that something would have to happen very quickly. There should have been some connection between the advice that Teagasc was giving and the action the Minister was taking but there was not. Rather than taking the advice of Teagasc and stepping in to assist with the provision of concentrates, the Minister, against expert advice, provided a scheme to move fodder from other parts of the country. That is an important point. At all stages, the Minister told and showed me that donedeal.ie was the answer; that there was plenty of fodder for sale on that site. We all know that one may decide to purchase something on donedeal.ie and make the phone call to arrange to buy it. When one goes to look at the item, what one is supposed to get and what is actually there are two different things. Often, it is not there when one goes to collect it. That was a very strange way of dealing with this crisis. Another point continuously raised was that any farmer who was in a serious crisis such that he or she could not feed his or her animals, should contact the Department and the Department would step in. I know of farmers who reached that crisis point and went to the Department. The Department told the farmers it would feed the cattle for a couple of weeks until it got a test and then it would sell them. It was telling the farmers that their crisis would be ended very quickly. The Department was not going to help farmers through the crisis into the future but, rather, would ship the cattle off to the mart. That was not a solution. The issue of where we go with this was earlier mentioned by Deputy Deering in terms of Food Wise 2025 and the intensification of farming. Much of the crisis relates to that intensification and the reality that, particularly in the south and east of the country where there is better land, more and more people are going into dairy and there is more and more stock. We are running into a problem which is putting pressure on the entire system. We must reconsider that approach. Food Wise 2025 must be examined because we must accept that sometimes we need to consider changing the model that we use in different places. That must happen reasonably quickly. I concur with and support much of the motion. However, Sinn Féin has tabled an amendment which aims to solve this issue into the future. Last autumn, I and other Members stated that the crisis was due to saturated land, because of which farmers could not get a second cut of silage. Farmers in parts of the country, such as the south, who were used to getting a third cut, were definitely going to miss out on that. In my part of the country, most farmers could not get a second cut of silage. Those who did, got it in October and it was useless in terms of quality because the land was so wet. The land is so wet in many parts of the country because there has been no effort through the years to provide any assistance to farmers for a land drainage or reclamation programme. It has been many years since any action was taken in that regard. There is now an opportunity to do something about that. That would help to ensure that the land is a bit drier to get out slurry and fertiliser and get the grass to grow a little earlier in the spring. We have tabled our amendment, which I hope will be supported by Fianna Fáil and all others in the House, in order to have a scheme put in place which will help farmers to drain land when needed. The poor return farmers get for their produce is one of the problems at the heart of this crisis. When a crisis comes, the farmer is short not alone of fodder, but also money. Suckler and sheep farmers in the north west find it very difficult to make ends meet even without a crisis such as this. Someone once told me that the definition of poverty is not that one is in the Horn of Africa and does not have enough to eat but that one cannot cope with a crisis when it comes. That is the case for many farmers in this situation. That must be recognised and there must be an understanding that there must be an emphasis on ensuring that farmers can get a fair price for their produce, which is not currently the case. One point raised in the motion concerns the payment of the various schemes. The GLAS scheme is due to be paid in the middle of May. However, in the context of the current crisis there is no reason the 15% payment due to farmers, which amounts to approximately €500 or €600 for most, cannot be sped up, paid immediately and farmers sent a cheque this week. Somebody in the Department will say that would breach an EU regulation. The time has come to breach such regulations and look for forgiveness later rather than permission now. It is time to send that money out to farmers so that they can have a chance to relieve the situation.  This problem developed because of the weather. However, there was no foresight on the part of the Minister or the senior people in the Department in terms of doing something about it. The advice from the farm organisations, Teagasc and the people on the ground was that the situation was dire and action needed to be taken. However, no action was taken. To talk about importing fodder when the dairy co-ops had already started to do so was too little, too late. It was a mark of the Government's failure on this issue. It should own up to that situation and admit it cocked up but state that it will put provisions in place to ensure the same will not happen again, and that it will do something now by sending the GLAS money to farmers and putting in place a scheme for the provision of a meal voucher not just this year, but every year. There must be a contingency plan for this situation and an overview of where Food Wise 2025 is going and where it will leave us.We must stand back from the situation, recognise there is overstocking in some cases and re-examine where it is going. I will hand over to my colleagues.

We are trying to come up with constructive ways to address the crisis. We have been through all of this before in 2013. Those who were Members of the House then will well remember the crisis that evolved at that time and the lack of preparation by the Government, the Department and associated agencies. One would assume we would have learnt something from that experience but, unfortunately, what has evolved over the past four or five months has shown we have learnt nothing. The Government has learnt absolutely nothing. It was told well in advance what would happen. At the end of October and the beginning of November 2017, I sat in this Chamber next to Deputy Martin Kenny as he raised the issue of an imminent fodder crisis, in particular in the north west, and how it would affect the small, weak family farm. Who gives a God damn about the small family farm? The Government certainly does not but we do. I come from a small family farm and am proud of it. It is part of my roots. My party and I represent the small family farms, the backbone of this country, who have been blackguarded and neglected by the policies of successive Governments that did not give a God damn about whether they survived. It suits them that they are gone off the face of the earth. That is what is happening now as well. Who has been hit hardest? It is not the big farmers as they have adequate fodder, it is the small and medium-sized family farm. They are the ones that have been hit and that have been hurt most. I would not mind but we knew about it. We were told about it in this House and we argued about it. The Minister relied on his report from Teagasc. We came back to the issue in January and it was the same situation. People who were able to put their cattle out last week have now put them back in again because of the weather in recent days. Again, the areas that have been hit hardest include the west and the north west and the small family farms have been hit hardest. What can we learn from it here today? As true as day follows night, no first cut of silage will happen until mid to late June, which means farmers will be down a cut of silage. They are already down a cut of silage from last year because cattle were in from October. Heavy cattle have experienced problems with their hooves and there have been problems getting feed for them. Small farmers had to sell off their cattle at a loss because they did not have the feed to sustain them. The Minister can gloss it up any way he likes but the God damn policy of the Government towards the weak, small and medium-sized family farm is non-existent. There is no policy whatsoever to help them. The Minister can say he allocated €1.5 million towards import transportation costs but what has that done for farmers? They are paying between €40 and €50 for a bale of silage if they can afford it. Farmers are borrowing money in order to buy feed. They have been blackguarded and neglected by successive Governments. I hope the weather will help the farmers in some way because they are wasting their time if they are depending on the Government to help them.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	377	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion. We have a national crisis that was flagged way back. We had a very bad autumn which resulted in a very bad harvest and the signs were there that the situation would be difficult unless there was an early spring, which did not come and still has not come. The west and the north west were mentioned but today, 17 April, cattle are still in sheds in counties Laois and Offaly that in normal times would have been out a month to six weeks ago. The cost and availability of feed is causing problems for farmers. I support the amendment to the motion, which calls for a land drainage scheme. Deputy Martin Kenny has spoken about County Leitrim and other counties in that area but in the midlands, accessibility issues also arise due to the torrential rain we have had and there is waterlogged land that could be alleviated were a drainage scheme put in place. Reference has been made to fast-forwarding the outstanding 15% of the GLAS payment. That is a positive suggestion the Minister might take on board. We all want to see a vibrant and strong agriculture sector, as set out in Food Wise 2025 and Food Harvest 2020. We on this side of the House support that. As a Deputy in a rural constituency I support it but we need to have a reality check. A lot of farmers in my area depend on three cuts of silage, which did not happen last year. Farmers are increasing stocking rates and they have been encouraged to borrow money to increase their herds. Some herds, in particular in the dairy sector, have doubled and quadrupled. The problem is that when something like this happens, the pressure mounts on the system. It is fine if everything is going well and there are three cuts of silage or two very good cuts, which did not happen last year, but the system breaks down when a situation like this happens. Last year there was a late harvest and a bad autumn and now there is a late spring so it is a double whammy. Stocking levels must be examined. We are facing the importation of very costly feed. One must ask whether we should be growing more fodder beet. Should Teagasc, the farming organisations and the Department be encouraging farmers to grow more fodder beet? It is a good crop and one that will grow in a fairly wet climate, which we have seen in recent years. We must also examine other ways to generate income in the longer term. The Minister must consider the sugar beet industry again. It will not alleviate the crisis now - only money will solve that and short-term measures such as those outlined here tonight - but in the longer term we need to look at diversification. The sugar beet industry was wiped off the face of the earth in this country. It had benefitted small and medium farmers in the midlands in particular, in that the beet factory provided a cheque in the month of January or February that kept people afloat until the spring. It also took the pressure off land and helped to improve the soil. The industry was wiped away by a previous Government. I urge the Minister to look at the issue in the longer term but he must introduce measures immediately to address the situation as farmers are under serious pressure at the moment. This is a national crisis.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	378	I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this important debate pertaining to the fodder crisis in the Dáil this evening. I do so on behalf of the Labour Party. My party leader, Deputy Howlin, is present, as well as Deputy Sherlock. We broadly support the motion but with some caveats. We are fully cognisant of and familiar with the crucial role agriculture plays throughout the economy in terms of employment, quality food production, food processing, exports and the significant role played by farmers in protecting our greatest natural resource, namely, the land, flora and fauna, wildlife and the environment across the country. It is in that context that the fodder crisis came as a huge dampener and has had a severe and significant impact both in terms of animal husbandry and welfare and on the health and welfare of individual farmers and families. This has arisen from the huge strain generated as farmers watch their barns and silage pits empty to the back walls, without a bale of stray straw or a forkful of silage available, which is not just important in terms of keeping the animals from regressing but are vital ingredients in the digestive process of ruminants. It is against that background that in early April I called, on behalf of my party, for the Government to provide a subsidy for farmers struggling as a result of the current fodder crisis to enable them to purchase alternative feedstuffs or import fodder or roughage for their livestock. At the agriculture committee last week, I publicly supported the introduction of a meal subsidy voucher, as my Labour Party colleagues and I considered this to be the most practical, focused and targeted way of rendering immediate assistance to identified farmers in significant difficulty. It also was the simplest system to administer. It need not be widespread and could be devoted to many small farmers who have been hardest hit across the country in specific geographical locations. There are affected pockets right across the country but significant numbers arise in the western corridor, the north west and latterly in the south east. I spoke to Deputy Howlin's people in Wexford last Friday on the programme. If one has 30 suckler cows or 30 to 40 dairy cows a measurable, definitive amount of meal of between 4 kg to 5 kg a day, which would supplement and deal with a deficiency of fodder, over a 30-day period is 150 kg per animal and the cost is clearly identified and measured for 30 to 40 animals. It would not constitute a runaway train. I also believe that the transport subsidy should not be circumscribed by bureaucratic rules and regulations and the subsidy should be available to enable fodder to be sourced from wherever it is procured and delivered to the target farmers who require it. As I said at the committee also, I do not subscribe or participate in debate pertaining to the lack of fodder in a political way. It is not the hour or time for political grandstanding or sound bites. It is naive in the extreme to start apportioning political blame. All stakeholders must respond.The Minister and the Government are clearly important but Teagasc, co-operatives, agricultural merchants, financial institutions, major processors and farmers themselves also have a significant role to play. The farmer is the farm manager. My brother is in farming. One has to be down on the farm to understand. I would not live with him. He is down there every day and is up at 4 a.m. to help with calving. These are the people we are talking about. Let us stop pontificating for the sake of garnering public notice. That will not create one extra bag of meal or another bale of straw, silage or hay for hard-pressed farmers. It behoves each of us, as representatives of the people, to adopt constructive policies and to make suggestions to address the significant situation that now prevails across the country. The problem has clearly been accentuated by the unseasonably cold snap in March and a number of significant adverse weather events, including snow, frost, flooding and hurricanes. All of our citizens have suffered to varying degrees but agriculture took the biggest hit. The combination of a number of factors has led to the development of a perfect storm. We have low soil temperatures, which means that no grass growth can take place. We have also had depressed air temperatures. Land is waterlogged or flooded to such an extent that neither man nor beast can get out on it. There was a reduction in fodder harvesting last autumn. Third cuts of silage and hay which were regular features were not achieved in 2017 and in some parts of the country a second cut was not even achieved.  A further factor which is not related to weather conditions, and about which people do not like to speak, is the abolition of milk quotas. I spoke about it at the time and sent out a warning at the agriculture committee, but nobody wanted to listen. This has resulted in a significant increase in cow numbers. There has been a 300,000 increase since 2015 which necessitates a significant increase in forage and concentrates. Some of the increase in cow numbers arose when long-term tillage farmers took advantage of the quota abolition to get out of what was and continues to be a loss-making operation, particularly grain production. Those farmers have made the transition to fully fledged dairy farmers through significant capital investment. As a result, we must now factor into the equation the important loss of that tillage land which produced grain, rapeseed, beet and, most importantly, straw. The loss of that land has resulted in significant losses in terms of feed inputs for animals, the effects of which are now being felt.  Let us have a real and honest debate about this and about how we arrived at this position. The situation in which we find ourselves can be resolved in the short term but if we do not put in place appropriate plans and preparations, we are at nothing. Let us be clear - this situation is going to continue in the winters of 2019, 2020, 2021 and beyond and must be addressed from a long-term perspective. Farmers in the south east are expecting to have their cattle out on grass in early to mid-February while those in the midlands expect to have their cattle out by St. Patrick's Day. Stocking rates are an issue as is sustainability across the sectors. This must be considered or the ostrich syndrome will win out and we will have learned nothing.  We had a similar situation four or five years ago, in 2013. I recently looked at the study carried out by Dr. Stephen Flood who outlined the significant future impacts of climate change on Irish agriculture. I believe that study was launched by the former Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney. In planning for a sustainable agriculture industry going forward, we will have to ensure that climate projections are factored into any long-term plans. We cannot continue to thatch the roof on the day of the storm. The inevitable conclusion is that winters of seven rather than five and a half months long should be budgeted for henceforth. It is hard to achieve that new target when silage pits remain the same size and the land area available for forage decreases. Significant changes in our climate magnify the risk that we will have winters that are significantly wetter, with significant increases in rainfall. This will have to be taken into account in the context of fodder saving practices and the frequency of such saving. Fodder budgeting must be accurate from now on and participation in the Teagasc PastureBase Ireland programme can assist in this regard. This must be promulgated and advanced. We know that a mature cow or bullock eats approximately one tonne of silage per month so instead of five tonnes being the normal requirement, current projections indicate that up to seven tonnes per animal would be more appropriate. We now have more than 7.3 million beef and dairy cattle in the country.  We need effective early warning systems to be put in place by Teagasc so that feed reserves and grass on farms are assessed as part of the farm management system in order to prevent the recurrence of this problem, especially on its current scale. While we clearly have a significant comparative advantage derived from producing milk and beef on a grass-based system, which is the most efficient way of doing so, we must caution against overdoing it or trying to maximise the achievement of efficiencies of production from grass at the expense of adequate forage conservation for indoor feeding over the winter period. The two are not compatible. The impact of not being able to access grazing means the loss of up to €250 per day in terms of profitability. Every week that this continues will have a severe impact on the bottom line. Animal fertility can also be affected and there is a clear risk of increased mortality in this situation. The advancement of a low-cost credit scheme for farmers would be of enormous help, as would immediate payment to the 4,000 farmers who are still awaiting their GLAS payments and the remaining outstanding 50% due to the other qualifying farmers. A targeted meal voucher subsidy scheme would also help. We need to cool the ardour of the farm inspection regime and, in particular, the Bord Bia farm audits. It would not be a national catastrophe if they were deferred for two months or so. The Minister has made representations to the European Commission which is fully aware of the significant difficulties we have experienced as an island nation in the Atlantic. The Commission should be willing to give us assistance in achieving our objectives. We in the Labour Party would not object to a permanent hardship fund for farmers, provided it incorporated or made available funding for other sectors of our economy which have also suffered as a result of the adverse weather conditions. As the Labour Party spokesperson on agriculture and fisheries but also on community and rural affairs, it behoves me to advocate for many small shops, businesses and enterprises which also make valuable contributions in terms of economic activity, entrepreneurship, innovation and employment in our economy, particularly the rural economy. Nobody shouts on their behalf if they experience a difficulty arising from climatic events but they have also suffered. This evening, I am going to change that on behalf of the Labour Party. If there is a permanent hardship fund for farmers to cover what we hope will be occasional or rare events, the same must be provided to other sectors. Not doing so would constitute invidious discrimination and would be a kick in the teeth for those hard working people who populate towns and villages across this country. I want to see them included in any hardship scheme because that is the policy of the Labour Party.

I will start by talking about the radio programme that is broadcast early on a Saturday morning that looks at country life and talks to farmers, which I like. Recently, the programme makers went all over Ireland talking to farmers about the fodder crisis and the honesty of the farmers involved was quite impressive. Many of them were saying that they were being stretched beyond their capacity. The message I got from the ordinary families who were interviewed was that family farmers are struggling with what sounded like horrific day to day realities. They spoke about pulling dead animals off their farms. Farmers and their wives were literally crying because their animals were dying in front of them from starvation. I remember one woman describing the howls of hungry animals. That must be a terribly painful experience to go through, no matter how callous one might be. I do not believe that the farmers of this country, particularly those with small and medium-sized farms, are in any way callous. They spoke honestly about the fact that there is a problem in this country and that farmers are being consistently driven beyond their capability not just by the Department, the Government and policy from this House, but also by their own representative organisations and media such as the Farmers Journal telling them that now is the time to grow their herds and so forth. As we have heard tonight from people who are more familiar with rural Ireland than me, the small and medium-sized farmer does not gain. Larry Goodman, who we bailed out in the past and who has just won most of the big contract with China this week, will do very nicely, but the small and medium-sized farmer is struggling to meet the capacity targets to which they are being stretched and there is a real problem with that. In June 2017, there were 7.3 million cattle here, an increase of 10% in cattle over two years of age, 3% in cattle under two years of age and 2.5% in dairy cows. By anybody's estimation in a country of this size, that is over-production in the middle of climate change and this is where my global point comes in. I am a member, along with Deputy Stanley and others, of the Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment. On the one hand, we agonise in a big way about climate change and how we are going to reduce our emissions while on the other, the policy of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is to get everybody to breed more cattle, export more cattle and do major deals with other countries. The Ceann Comhairle will remember when Ibrahim Halawa was still in prison in Egypt that I complained bitterly that this Government seemed to be able to do cattle export deals on an enormous scale with Egypt and Saudi Arabia but did not seem to be able to deal with the continued incarceration of one of its own citizens in Egypt.When the Minister announced this week that additional markets are to be opened up, he said "the world is literally our oyster in terms of" cattle exports. He suggested that this could be the tip of the iceberg. He has been quoted all over the media. We all woke up on Monday morning to hear that the Minister, Deputy Creed, has made the great discovery that we can push beef on people in the most populated country in the world who have never eaten beef before. Equally, it seems that we can push beef on people in the Middle East who usually live off sheep and goats. We have not begun to think globally about what crazy levels of food production, as a result of recent changes, are doing to the health of the population of the planet and, most importantly, to climate change. I would like to quote from a document I found on the Internet in which the president of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, had some interesting things to say:Knackeries are flat out collecting dead animals, which shows just how bad things are. If the Minister is in any doubt, he should talk to the people who are at the coalface... it is equally the case that even where there is fodder, the long winter and atrocious weather is also leading to increased levels of animal disease such as pneumonia.He added that it is time to stop the relentless focus at all costs on increased production and higher stocking rates, suggesting that "we are witnessing those consequences now and, with two crises in the last five years, the trend is bound to continue". He referred to the "glorification" of rapid dairy expansion and said:As soon as you get bad weather the wheels come off. There is a knock-on impact on all other farmers as the big operators then have to panic buy large quantities of feed at any cost... There can be no doubt this crisis is having an animal welfare impact and farmers no longer want to hear about a transport subsidy that hasn't worked, they need subsidies to buy feed now.It is obvious that the Minister sat on this crisis for long enough. He responded to it late. This is why he is getting such a huge reaction to it. I will finish on the question of climate change. In October 2013, after the last big fodder crisis, a researcher, Dr. Stephen Flood, warned that the severe future impacts of climate change on Irish agriculture would see a repeat of this type of crisis. When climate-fuelled extreme weather conditions, from hurricanes to major flooding episodes and unseasonal cold snaps, batter Ireland with monotonous regularity, they hit the agriculture sector hardest. The de facto position of Ireland's major farming group appears to be one of outright denial of the dangerous reality of climate change. When Fianna Fáil Deputies introduced this motion earlier this evening, they started by saying "we cannot blame the Minister [or the Government] for the weather". I disagree. While we cannot blame the Minister directly for the weather on a daily basis, we can blame the Minister and the Government for keeping their eyes and ears shut to the reality of climate change while pushing our policies in an opposite direction.

When he speaks about emission fines, he means that we are producing too many cows. Cows produce carbon emissions. They fart a lot and the methane destroys the atmosphere. We need to take note of that. We must start thinking globally about what sort of food and agriculture policies are needed to amend this situation not just to deal with climate change, but also to deal with the daily reality faced by small and medium-sized farmers in this country, as described by the ICMSA. The people we need to assist tonight are not the big guys who are being looked after by the Minister and his Government colleagues, but the small farmers who are being crucified by the fodder crisis, climate change and the reality of having to deal with policies that do not serve them well.

I think everybody in the north west and along the west coast recognises that the fodder crisis has been around for a while. The Government has been responding to it. The Government's response to the motion before the House seemed to suggest that the response to the fodder crisis in the north west made the fodder crisis in the rest of the country worse. That does not make any sense, given that the Government was surely in a position to start trialling the problem and seeing what was actually happening. It should have been in a position to deal with and learn from the problems in the north west. It is clear that the Government has not learned what needs to be done. That is the big problem we face at the moment. There are immediate solutions that need to be put in place. All the farming organisations, including the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association and the Irish Farmers Association, have pointed out that a meal voucher scheme and a transport subsidy scheme are needed immediately. A delay in farm inspections needs to happen straightaway so that farmers can concentrate on this crisis and deal with it. If there is a problem with delaying farm inspections, the Minister needs to tell us about it clearly so that we know where the actual problem lies. If it lies within the EU, we can direct our voices towards Europe to get some leeway or credit from there that will allow delays to be provided for. It is clear from the contributions to this debate that there is a bigger problem. I was a member of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine when it debated the removal of milk quotas. Everyone spoke about it as if it was fantastic and great. Having extra milk quotas and extra cattle was supposed to be the best thing that could ever happen. The very day the milk quotas were removed, everyone adopted a mood of doom and gloom. They said it was a disaster because there were far too many cattle. It was the exact opposite. It was amazing. As I do not come from a farming background and I do not have a hand or a foot in the farming business, I am not fully sure what is involved. I am a member of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine and I see what is happening. I listened to what was said when milk quotas were abolished. It was amazing. It was just like the turn of a hat. There are problems across the board in agriculture in this country. The fodder crisis which is being experienced across the country seems to have been caused by having too many cattle that need to be fed. It is great that a number of Deputies have recognised that climate change is having an impact on us now. It is vitally important for the future that we look at what we can do to address climate change. It is only by dealing with it that we can put long-term measures in place to ensure this crisis does not recur every single year. As a previous speaker said, our climate will continue to change. We are going to have longer periods in which cattle need to be housed and farmers are going to have to cope with that. There will be teething problems as we get used to that in the time ahead. We have to do that now. The conversation needs to start right away if we are to make sure everyone is ready for it and can benefit into the future.
#MichaelFitzmaurice	unknown-#MichaelFitzmaurice-party	unknown-#MichaelFitzmaurice-dob	unknown-#MichaelFitzmaurice-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	392	I commend Fianna Fáil on the motion. I heard a previous speaker saying that everyone supports small and medium-sized enterprises. Anyone who understands rural Ireland knows the reality is that members of the farming community keep many such enterprises alive in small towns by buying bags of meal and going into hardware shops. If we do not make sure we look after small farmers and family farms, we will be in trouble. The serious problem that exists at present has quite rightly been pointed out. We know that bales are coming in at the moment, but that will not solve everything. The fodder shortage is accompanied by a worsening money shortage. We need to acknowledge that as a result of the pressure that is on farmers around the country at the moment, there are serious mental health problems within the farming community. We need solutions. When the snow came to the east of the country a few months ago, everyone was told to put on their heating in the knowledge that an extra week's fuel allowance would rightly be paid. A few weeks ago, the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, announced extra money for the forestry sector. Even though one in seven people works in the agriculture sector, which exports produce worth €1.1 billion each month, we seem to have glue in our shoes. We are stuck to the ground. This is a time when we need to show leadership and hope.I can tell the Minister that I spoke to a farmer on my way here this morning who has 20 cows, with seven of them going to the factory in the morning. That farmer's bull is to be sold, and when we see such signs, it means we will be down in numbers down the road. We need to give these people hope. There is a fear out there among farmers around inspections. Whatever the European Union or anybody else says, the Minister should make a decision to suspend inspections now until at least 1 June. It would take that bit of fear from farmers. I acknowledge the GLAS section of the Department, as I knew two farmers desperate for their payments, and the section helped immensely. Helping two farmers is no good and we must help whatever is out there in all the different sectors, especially in the sheep sector. One run was done in sheep welfare in December and we are hearing it will be May before the next one is done. That should go out to farmers. Whatever grants are held up, we need to ensure the job gets done. We need to realise that the time we will see enough grass is three weeks away. Places are getting green but grass must grow. Cattle are still in sheds and farmers must either buy meal or, if the farmer lets out animals, fertiliser must be bought. Money is tight. The Minister could press a button for 120,000 or 130,000 farmers and give them even €1,000 each. We voted on a budget here and there is money in the kitty for agriculture, whether it is spent now or later. I am not saying the Minister should fork this out and never get it back. He should bring it forward so as to get farmers over the current hump. For a few days things were looking up a bit but last night put the tin hat on it again for another week. Cattle, sheep and whatever else must stay in. These farmers are struggling, day in and day out. Down the road there will also be a problem with the tillage sector as there has been damn all ploughing done. It will knock on at the other end. If the crops are not sown early, the farmer must rely on good weather again in September. We must ensure that sector will be covered as well. We are all hearing of the money that will be in the budget next October. I have heard people saying we should tell farmers to cut back, and there is no point in saying some people will not have to cut back. We are relying on an economy where one in seven people works in the agriculture sector, either directly or indirectly. Do we want to see a situation where the family farm, which is rapidly disappearing, will be eliminated? Will the Government get its dream that the west of Ireland will be planted because it is more marginal land? Will we face the fact that the family farm that keeps the local small and medium enterprises going deserves to be supported? We need €25 million to bring it to what it was before. We have heard about pay restoration but €50 million has been cut from the sector. In fairness to the Minister, he followed the programme for Government and brought back the first €25 million. There is another €25 million to be brought back. The suckler cow industry is disappearing by the day. I said this at Christmas but the Department denied it. The facts show the number of calves born. If we want to build an economy and keep that side of it going, we must provide the hope that farmers want now. They will go out and do the work but they need a few pounds in the kitty. They need a vision of where they are going, hope and leadership. They need the Minister to announce the €200 grant for the suckler cow. Otherwise, we will end up with all the calves from the south in the dairy herds coming up and there will be a drop in numbers. I ask the Minister to seriously consider what I ask of him.

I thank them for making their presence known tonight because this is such an important subject. I will not stand here and blame the Minister for the weather but he has been slow to react. It is a fact and I am sorry to have to say that to a neighbour from across the border. There are actions he must take. For example, there are people waiting for GLAS payments and it is a disgrace that they have not been paid. The Minister knows this. I compliment the people in his Department who have done much for me and the people I represent. I acknowledge that. Farmers are being treated unfairly and there is real hardship out there. The Minister has a chance to help. I was glad to hear a colleague speak the truth about the suckler herd, as not many people have done so tonight. That herd is under threat and there is a need for drastic assistance because it is not currently financially sensible to keep a cow for a year and get a calf from her. It does not pay. Unless the Minister and his Department wake up to that we will see the suckler herd under threat. The Minister knows that like everything, it is like a cog in a machine. We need the suckler men to be there for the future of farming in this country. I ask the Minister to please help as his help and that of the Department is needed.

Any politician worth his or her salt would have known at Christmas that a crisis of major proportions was on the way. I watched trailers of silage going through west Cork several times daily. I made it my business at the time to speak with farmers, both milkers and suckler farmers, and they all told me the same story that they were in serious trouble. My colleagues and I raised the matter on the floor of the Dáil but we were told there was no crisis. The Minister was sound asleep at the wheel, and this has cost farmers, their families and Irish agriculture dearly. I wrote to the Minister on 11 January about the crisis we experienced at that time. I outlined four actions that needed to be taken and if only some had been completed at the time, we would not be in such a deep crisis as we are now. First, I asked that a fodder transport subsidy be put in place to assist the movement of fodder for affected farmers. Second, I asked that livestock meal vouchers be made available immediately. Third, I asked for an aid package for farmers to help purchase fodder at the time to help them deal with the crisis. Fourth, I asked the Minister and the Department to co-ordinate with the Health Service Executive on a support system for farmers who might have been experiencing psychological stress because of their financial position. My calls, which came from farmers on the ground from all over the political spectrum, were ignored. After weeks of pressure, a transport subsidy was put forward but not in west or north Cork, where cattle were dying on farms. I urge the Minister to introduce a meal voucher scheme and backdate it for farmers who have receipts back to January. I ask him to see if a farm payment can be brought forward to help farmers in the midst of crisis. I also welcome Mr. Cornie Buckley and the several members of the IFA in the Gallery. They have been to the forefront in trying to resolve this crisis.

They would not be here except that farmers are in trouble. We all knew it, along with the Minister, last November. In early November many farmers had used half their feed. It is no good telling us we could not know what would happen when half their feed had been used at that time. We all knew what was going to happen. We must stop going backwards. I thank Deputy McConalogue for bringing forward this very important motion, which contains very laudable elements. I will not get around in a minute and a half to all of them. I ask the Minister to provide a subsidy for farmers in order to provide meal. I ask the Minister to pay farmers all the grants they are owed. Many of these are not being paid at all and farmers are being fined for different things. They are struggling and their minds are gone. I ask the Minister to pay farmers in real trouble in advance so as to ensure they can continue in farming. This is a crisis and their backs are to the wall. The Minister and the Government must do something about this. The Minister gave back €106 million to the Exchequer in 2016 and over €70 million last year. The Minister should not give back a penny this year and give it instead to the farmers out there in Kerry and west Cork. There is only a distance of 20 miles between us. The Minister knows those farmers are in trouble and he should do something about it. I am asking the Minister again about this. He should not forget those farmers as he is the Minister now.

The Minister should be proactive and behave in an anticipatory fashion in future. He should set up a national farm emergency group that would include the Minister, Teagasc, Met Éireann and the major farming organisations and co-operatives in order to anticipate problems such as this as they come down the line.It is too late for this year but for next year and the year after, it is very important. Climate change is here to stay. Long wet winters are going to be the norm rather than the exception. We have to anticipate that there will be fodder crises. We may even have to change farming practices and look at stocking numbers and the way in which we feed cattle in the future. It is important that we act in an anticipatory fashion. From a parochial point of view, Shannon Airport is making its grasslands available for cutting. This could yield between 1,500 and 2,000 bales. The transport subsidy that is available should be allowed to be claimed through the co-ops; individual farmers should not be claiming it. There should not be an upfront payment from farmers. Shannon Airport is a community-based airport and it should be recognised for what it is about to do for the farming community. The farmers should not be required to pay upfront for the transport of the fodder. It is also important that low-interest loans, or the facility for such loans, should be made available to farmers in the context of feeding their animals. There should be a hardship fund which should be adequate and easily accessible to farmers. From a medical point of view, farmers are under huge mental stress - not only the families but the farmers themselves. This has to be recognised because farming is a cross-sectoral industry.

I welcome our friends in the Public Gallery who would love to be at home tonight - if it was a fine night - ploughing and sowing and planting seeds. That is what they are good at. When farmers are doing well, Ireland is doing well. Never mind Deputy Bríd Smith talking about cows breaking wind or whatever. I hear a lot of hot air from her, Deputy Boyd Barrett and their colleagues on many issues. If they could not get a carton of milk in the morning, they would be rioting. They do not care about rural Ireland. They are very parochial up here. I care about rural Ireland and so do other people in this House. However, those to whom I refer do not care. What happened to the Minister? Where is his moral compass gone? Fine Gael has always been known as the party of the farmers. I might put in a caveat and say that it is the party that cares about the big farmers and to the hell with the small fellows. Now, however, the Minister does not seem to care about anything. I have nothing personal against him but he was asleep at the wheel to allow €106 million to be returned to the Exchequer in 2016 and €86 million to be returned last year when people were clamouring for action. Anyone who could see beyond the end of his nose last year could see, on 20 July, that animals were brought in and the second cut of silage was not harvested. In some places, even the first cut was not brought in. The Minister of State - not the Minister - came to the House earlier to answer questions. The Taoiseach was asked questions. He knows nothing about farming and cares less. That is obvious. He passed the matter on to the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, who said it was not true that we could have anticipated this last year. Everyone knew what was happening. The place was flooded, the crops could not be harvested and some people were overstocked. A child in kindergarten would have known what was going to happen. However, the Government did not want to know and it sent back the money. Those in government cannot see the wood for the trees. The Government has many officials standing in its way, both here and in Europe. It is honouring and bowing to all of them and saying "To hell with the farmers". Deputy Harty said it - many farmers are under serious psychological stress. Farmers want to pay their suppliers. However, the banks and the contractors cannot be paid and there will be a knock-on effect if the Minister does not wake up and do something very soon. The Government's approach to this matter has been lethargic and inept in the extreme.

I agree fully with the Deputy that when farmers are doing well, this country does well. We have to protect our farming community. We support the motion from Fianna Fáil. That comes from personal reflection. At Christmas, I visited a sheep farmer in County Donegal. He is a hardworking, capable individual and he was just broken as he split open another bag of feed and realised the cost involved. He could not bring his animals up because the weather was so bad. It had rained for six months solid in County Donegal. Even earlier this month, at Easter, a farmer in the west - he is a good man - said that he was trying his best but that he could not put his cattle out because he knew they would destroy the field. He was running out of options. It is that personal tragedy that is real. We have to address this matter. The question is how we should do so. What do we do differently? What do we change? Given that this is the second time in five years we are importing grass and fodder from the UK to feed our animals, it is time to think about what is happening and what do we need to do differently. Our first premise should be that we want to protect Irish family farms. It is important for this country that we have a family farming structure. I think that is viable and we can do it. We can design a system that gives rise to the creation of family farms. That would have huge knock-on consequences, not just for rural Ireland but also for the nature of the food system. I refer to how we protect biodiversity, how we manage our water systems and how we store carbon. Deputy Bríd Smith is right - we have to think globally. We cannot just continue on and think that everything is always going to stay the same. Things change. The world is changing and Irish farming has to change with it in order to ensure its future, its success and its viability in every sense. Those farmers to whom I refer are paying out to everyone at present. They are paying out to the agrochemical companies and they are paying bank managers' salaries. The farmers in question are paying at every turn but they are not getting paid. The current system is not serving Irish family farms. They are not properly paid and, as a result, the system needs to change. This fodder crisis is a signal of that. What do we do? What would we suggest? I am of the view Irish farming is going to go green. I think that is the future.

Much of our money comes from the European Union. Many of the cheques that farmers receive originate from measures relating to the CAP. I listen to the European Commissioner, Mr. Phil Hogan, when he comes back here and says that. He would not, from a Green perspective, be my favourite person but he came back and gave a clear message at the Food Wise 2025 conference. He said that people should wake up, that farming is changing and that climate change must be taken seriously. I think we should grab that as an opportunity for Deputy Michael Healy-Rae's constituents.

We should be paying farmers in respect of four things and we should start with water management. Earlier today, we published a river management study that shows we are going wrong. We will not acknowledge our flooding problem simply by draining every river or by concentrating on drainage in general. Really clever management of the land will be required in order that water will be stored rather than allowed to run off straight into streams. We should be paying farmers for that. We should also pay for them to restore the pristine water quality that the river study published earlier today indicates is what we are losing. We need to manage and farm really cleverly so that we do not pollute our land and our water. We should not make the same mistake as New Zealand, where a mad expansion in dairy and beef farming led to water quality being destroyed. New Zealand is now reversing its engines dramatically. We should learn from its mistake.

We are having an ecological crisis. We are losing our birds, insect life and mammals. That has to stop. Farmers should be at the forefront and are the perfect people to be there in terms of looking after our natural system. They should be paid for that. We should also pay them for storing carbon. The great advantage with storing carbon, whether we do it in forests or in bogs, is that we can include a stipulation, as the Irish Natura and Hill Farmers Association has said, that the money relating to carbon stored in a tree in Kerry should stay in that county. It should not come to Dublin or anywhere else. This would be a way of using the money to which I refer to develop rural Ireland.

I hope I can bring them around to the thought that I hear from different people, including people in Fianna Fáil, the Labour Party, the socialist parties and Sinn Féin. There is an understanding. We hear it in the House and I have heard it on the radio as well. I have heard farmers saying they are over-stocking, that it is not working and that they have to change. I hear it, so let us go with it. I am including the Rural Independent Group. When it comes to forestry we should consider the idea of a wild Atlantic rain forest. I was reading Pádraic Fogarty on this topic. Climate change is uncertain and it is unclear what exactly will happen, but the best scientists reckon that we are going to have wetter winters in the north and west and possibly drier summers in the south and east. That could be difficult to manage. Our forestry needs to change. We should more towards native forestry plantations and continuous rather than clear felling cover. That approach gives high-value timber. It would create 30,000 jobs in rural Ireland and it makes for brilliant storage of carbon, which we can then use in our building industry as a further store. This is viable and this is the way the world is going. This is what CAP can pay farmers for. We should pay farmers for our high-quality food. I was so disappointed by what I heard on "Morning Ireland". One week after we had a big debate on the fodder crisis people were celebrating that we can now sell cheap meat cuts off to China. It seems we are back on the expansion path again. They say Larry Goodman is going to lead us forward into the great future for Irish agriculture. It may be great for Larry Goodman but, in my mind, not for Irish farming. Unfortunately, the Minister is shaking his head, but the problem is that Fine Gael is wedded to big production output increases. The policy worked in 2011 and 2012 when we were in the middle of the recession. Farming helped to lift us out of it. There were two or three good years with great growth and so on. Production increases were possible. The reality since then is that our soil and land can only carry so much production. What we should do is really specialise in specialising. We should stop importing so much fresh produce and start selling our good quality produce to local markets. We should stop the export of 70,000 live calves, which is the total so far this year.

Those in Brazil will have their own problems because climate change is a global issue and everyone is going to have to grapple with how to change with the natural world. For those of us on this green island, taking a green farming future is the way to go.

I wish to focus on two areas I believe the Minister needs to act on. The first relates to getting funds to farmers. The second relates to farmers' mental health and stress. Farmers need to have access to their money. The Minister should pay the outstanding 2017 payments as quickly as possible. Where there are appeals, reviews or any outstanding payments, the money needs to be released. The money is available. It is farmers' money and it is better off in their pockets. They need it now. The Minister needs to look at the possibility of advancing next year's payments. The sheep welfare scheme is based around animal welfare. What could be more fundamental to animal welfare than feeding them? The Minister needs to find a way of pushing that money towards them. If a farmer is owed money from Revenue for VAT, then Revenue needs to get that money to them as quickly as possible. It is a fundamental step. Farmers need to get access to funds as quickly as possible in order that they can buy any available feed and, as weather improves, get fertiliser out. They are already stretched on credit. We know beef and sheep farmers are not going to have a regular income. This crisis is not going to end when the weather improves. While the fodder shortage is visible, another huge darkness is lurking behind so many farmyard gates. Farm families are under tremendous pressure with hungry cattle, empty silage pits, full slurry tanks, bills mounting and the endless stress of trying to get money and trying to get animals fed. There is no need for the Minister to add to that pressure. The Minister can take some of the pressure off by recognising the pressure farmers are under and easing off on the inspections. There is no need to be hounding farmers at this stage. Instead, where the Minister can do so, he should push money towards them.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	441	I thank Deputy Butler for changing slots with me. We should all remember why we are here. We are here because Deputy McConalogue has us here. We had a motion in the House on Holy Thursday, when the House was virtually empty apart from the Minister, the Minister of State and ourselves. There was little interest in this. However, Deputy McConalogue persisted and brought the matter back before the House this evening. I am delighted the motion is before the House. This evening is not about climate change or forestry. It is about action now for farmers who are struggling throughout the country. We should forget some of the nonsense that has been spoken this evening. We need to focus on what we need to do. Several speakers have said what we need to do. We need to get the GLAS payments that are overdue paid. We need to ease off on the inspections. We need to ensure that the subsidy for transport is revisited. We need to get that done straight away. The Minister has said he has been speaking to the banks, or at least those remarks were in his press release. That needs to be done as well. Where necessary, we also need to get the short-term loans at a percentage that will be acceptable to the farming community. Let us deal with what we need to deal with this evening. We will have long days to talk about climate change and forestry, but let us try to get help to those farmers who are in the Gallery this evening as well as the farmers I represent. Let us get farmers off the hook now. We should give them a little support. By the way, I spoke to one farmer yesterday. He asked me to tell everyone to stop saying that farmers are suffering from mental health issues at the moment. He said they are not but that they are deeply stressed and concerned and that their families are concerned as well. He reckons if farmers get a little help they will be able to get over this crisis. There may be issues here or there of over-stocking but that is not the major problem. I want everyone, including the Minister and the Minister of State, to dwell on the issue now. I am referring to the emergency that must be dealt with in the coming days. If we get over that, then I have every confidence in the farming community to rally and make Irish agriculture great again if there is some improvement in the weather.
#EamonScanlon	unknown-#EamonScanlon-party	unknown-#EamonScanlon-dob	unknown-#EamonScanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	442	I first raised this last November in the Dáil. At the time the Minister said in the Dáil that the Teagasc information to hand suggested there was no national fodder shortage in the country. What was a fodder shortage has become a fodder crisis. The Minister knows that I have raised this on numerous occasions in the Dáil. There is an urgent need for swift action to be taken by Government to assist farmers in affected areas who have called for crisis fodder aid funding. We believe the best way to do that is through a meal voucher scheme. It gets the funding directly into the pockets of the farmer. A Teagasc survey of impacted areas in December 2017 showed that 85% of farmers affected by fodder shortages in the north-west region had, on average, less than half of the fodder they needed for the winter period. The warning bells were ringing at that time; there is no question about that. I come from the north west. It is the area I represent. I believe that area is the engine for producing beef cattle. That is where the suckler cows are and where the calves are produced that generate all the beef. We all welcomed the great announcement during the week of the deal that will see €100 million from China. However, I put it to the Minister that suckler cow farmers do not get support. They have been calling for a long time, through the IFA and ourselves, for a €200 suckler grant per cow to keep these people in business. Otherwise there will be no beef to export anywhere. That is the sad reality and that is where we are heading. I am not simply saying that; it is fact. Reference was made to the genomics scheme. As someone who was a butcher for 35 years I believe the scheme is downgrading the quality of our beef. Reference was made to greenhouse gases. Trying to put beef on and fatten Friesian calves will generate twice as much greenhouse gas because it is nearly impossible to get beef onto those calves. We should look after the good quality cows we have that produce the best beef in the world.

This is how grave the situation is: people made the long journey up from west Cork to be here this evening. I commend my colleagues, Deputies McConalogue and Cahill, on bringing forward the motion this evening. Again, we have proved that Fianna Fáil is the party for the farmers. All my life I have associated Fine Gael with the big farmer. However, at the moment the Minister is not looking after the big, small or middling farmer. The Minister needs to sit up and take heed.The fodder crisis in Cork South-West is now a state of emergency. My three offices have been inundated with farmers telling me of their plight. It is not good enough. It is in the Minister's hands to help them. I could talk about this issue for an hour. I feel very upset and emotional when I see grown men and women crying in my office over what they are going through at present.  As well as addressing the fodder crisis, I ask the Minister to pay the outstanding one third of the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, and sheep farm payments that are due since last Christmas. I am referring to last year's payments that still have not been paid and at least that would give farmers a little more cashflow.
#NiamhSmyth	unknown-#NiamhSmyth-party	unknown-#NiamhSmyth-dob	unknown-#NiamhSmyth-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	444	This is not the first, the second or perhaps the third time Members have stood in the Chamber to request the Minister to take action on this fodder crisis. We have a national fodder crisis that has escalated day by day causing untold stress and strain on farmers, their families and entire rural communities nationwide. The Minister has sat on his hands on this issue with his head in the sand. As he well knows, Deputies McConalogue and Cahill and I, as well as many others in this House have repeatedly requested that he act on this issue but he has failed to listen to us, which means he has failed the farmers who are at the coalface of this issue. He could have acknowledged this was a growing crisis months ago. He could have advised farmers to ration their fodder. He could have prepared a contingency plan and introduced a meal voucher scheme for the farmers affected. He could have put extra resources in place to ensure the outstanding 2017 GLAS and sheep welfare payments were made available to alleviate the financial pressures on farmers but he did not. The one scheme designed to alleviate the problem was the Government's transport subsidy scheme which has been a complete failure with only 16 applications to date. Farmers need swift action and by action I mean the putting in place of practical measures such as the provision of funding and financial assistance in terms of the meal voucher scheme. The Minister must acknowledge that the transport subsidy scheme has had the reverse effect and increased the price of fodder to four, or perhaps five, times the actual price, as was acknowledged here. We need a fodder action group to be set up. As the Minister is aware, this is the second time farmers have been affected by this issue in the past five years. We must take cognisance of that, act on it and not ignore a national crisis.

#SeanCanney	unknown-#SeanCanney-party	unknown-#SeanCanney-dob	unknown-#SeanCanney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	446	I welcome the representatives of the farmers' organisations, including those from Galway, who are in the Gallery tonight. This issue has brought together the farming representatives. We have had unprecedented weather since last August. Since race week, as they say in Galway, we have had bad weather. The weather and farming go hand in glove. I remember on our small family farm in Tuam we used to listen to Charles Mitchel reading the news at night to find out what the weather would be like the next day to make the hay or whatever. That has not changed but what has changed is the unprecedented level of rainfall and the unprecedented adverse weather we are getting right throughout the year. We have to examine how we will deal with that and how we will deal with farming. I visited a number of marts in recent weeks to talk to farmers. They have worked and co-operated together to help out one another as best they can. They have worked with the representatives of the farming organisations and the co-operatives, where possible, to make sure they help one another.  We have listened tonight to a lot of what is wrong but we also must acknowledge and give credit to the farmers and their families, and the small family farms, for the way they keep beavering away. We can keep talking about what is wrong but we have to examine how we can put this right, and put it right into the future.  I acknowledge that I have been in contact with the Department about GLAS payments a number of times in the recent weeks and they have been forthcoming and farmers are getting paid. I understand that at this stage, 98% of the payments have been made. It is not as if no payments have been made but we need to make sure that pinch points are sorted out as they arise. We must learn from this fodder crisis - I know the Minister will act on it - in the same way as when we had flooding events and put emergency plans in place. When we look at the future, we must bring together all stakeholders, including the banks, Teagasc advisers, farming organisations and the Department to find a way to ensure we prepare and are ready for these inevitable events that will happen. It is not something that we should start planning for next November. In two to three weeks' time all the stakeholders should be brought together to make sure we put a plan in place and plan for future events in a meaningful way in order that we can take some of the stress out of farming for farmers.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	447	I acknowledge that the past six months have been extremely difficult for the farming community due to ongoing adverse weather. I agree with the previous speaker in that I believe we will come through this crisis because of the collaborative effort that is being made, which is the hallmark of the industry. That collaborative effort is manifest in the difficulties individual farmers have in the context of a fodder shortage. I acknowledge the role farm organisations and individual farmers are playing, in terms of good neighbourliness, in helping to resolve this issue. Rural communities generally, the co-operative movement, which is an extension of the meitheal approach, and my Department through its offices, Teagasc etc. have all been instrumental in that collaborative endeavour which will see us out. I do not accept the premise of the motion, which serves a particular political narrative, that I have been slow to react. I do not accept that last September or October, this was a crisis we could envisage for April of this year. We have acted in the Department at all times in appropriate and measured ways as this story evolved. We had the permission to bring forward payments at the back end of last year at the maximum level. We had fodder budgeting advice from Teagasc, which always had meal as a part of it. That was the advice to stretch the fodder one had through the use of meal. We had the transport initiative at the end of January, we had an extension of that and a modification of the terminology to support imports of fodder at a later stage. Through all of that, we were in constant contact with those co-operatives, Teagasc, farm organisations etc. To be fair, we have acted appropriately in what has been a dynamic and evolving situation.  In the context of people who wish to claim they are the guardians of the family farm, I am who I am because I was raised on a family farm. It is who I am. I do not question the credentials of anybody here but I certainly do not surrender that concern to any quarter. I do not differentiate between big and small in the context of that family farming structure; they are all a part of that agricultural community. I will put my credentials upfront against any evaluation of anybody else in terms of looking after those who are most marginalised. We introduced and, by coincidence, paid through this crisis for the first time a sheep subsidy of €10 per ewe. That was not in place before. It was a commitment from this side of the House to acknowledge a sector that faced particular challenges. As for the €25 million in additional moneys, which I acknowledge will be paid later this year, to restore cuts that were imposed by others in areas of natural constraint, ANC, we have skewed that payment deliberately towards smaller farmers. I do not surrender one iota in terms of the credentials of this party, myself, or the Government in terms of trying to look after rural communities and farmers. There are issues. I take on board the point made by Deputy Martin Kenny and suggested by others. There are uncomfortable messages here in terms of climate change. Deputies Smyth and Ryan made that point. We are dealing with the visual personification of that challenge. It is uncomfortable and it is something with which we have to deal. I am committed to bringing together all of the aforementioned stakeholders in order that we can put in place the appropriate steps. Some of those will be steps in which my Department, Teagasc, the co-operatives and individual farmers will be obliged to acknowledge they all have individual roles to play. This is not a simplistic issue of saying we are over-stocked.I am disappointed that Deputy Michael Collins would stand in the elected Parliament and say that cattle were dying of hunger and starvation in west Cork.

#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	468	In the context of CAP reform, there is a debate to be had on the appropriate policy instruments that we need to put in place. Risk management is an issue. To date, this country has not availed of risk management tools that other countries see as a fundamental part of their protections. Our system does not function well. This is an area we can examine. In terms of our commitment to family farms and thanks to the previous CAP reform and the move towards equalisation, we have transferred €180 million from large to small farmers over the lifetime of the current CAP. This Government, including my predecessor, the Tánaiste, wants greater supports for smaller holdings, which form a critical part of the fabric of rural Ireland, so please do not give us lectures. I do not question anyone's commitment to family farming, but the credentials on this side of the House in terms of acknowledging the particular difficulties of smallholdings is second to none. I take the point about the difficulties that individual farmers are facing. I also take Deputy Eugene Murphy's point about not saying that people are not suffering from mental health issues. It is a stressful situation, call it whatever else one will. The fundamental message is that assistance is available. I receive regular briefings from Teagasc, including today, about the situation across the country. I have been in contact with most, if not all, of the active co-operatives. Twenty-six importers have been approved and are receiving support from my Department to import fodder. Others are making fodder available locally. Fodder is being transferred from Deputy McConalogue's own county of Donegal to Tipperary. Deputy Cahill knows that. This is the kind of collaboration that will be at the heart of the effort that will get us out of this situation. My Department has a role to play in that context and we have stepped in. I take Deputy Eamon Ryan's point that the next CAP reform will place greater obligations on us to acknowledge that we are living through climate change and will have to devise and gear payments and schemes so that our agriculture sector is sustainable. "Sustainable" means different things to different people, for example, economic, environmental and social sustainability. All of these are important, and they have been acknowledged in the context of Food Wise 2025, which we should not dismantle.

#LisaChambers	unknown-#LisaChambers-party	unknown-#LisaChambers-dob	unknown-#LisaChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	477	If the Minister believes that he has done a good job in dealing with the fodder crisis, I would hate to see what a bad job looks like. Apart from him, everyone in the Chamber will agree that we now have a crisis, one that could have been cut off at the pass and dealt with earlier, except he refused to do so. The main problem with the Government is that it likes to tie itself up in red tape. All of its schemes are difficult to access - it makes people jump through hoops to access them. It is afraid of being overly generous or giving a little bit extra. The bottom line seems to be constant penny pinching. The Government persistently ignored the warnings from Deputy McConalogue and everyone on this side of the House. We told it that this would happen, but it ignored us. There are consequences for allowing matters to reach this stage. There is strain on farmers. One farmer who rang me was crying down the phone. I am not making up this - it actually happened. He is one of many who had been pushed to breaking point and was afraid that they would not be able to feed their cattle because the fodder crisis had got so bad and the Government seemed to have its head in the stand and was pretending this was not happening. The consequences mean that such farmers are in a difficult situation. They are wondering whether they will have enough fodder for next year because of the delays that have been caused. The transport subsidy measure did not work. We told the Government the measure would not work, but it ignored us. The saving was not passed on to the farmer. In fact, the price of a bale increased. Today, I received a text message from a man from Swinford in my constituency of County Mayo. He told me he had been charged €80 for a bale. The quality of the fodder being acquired is often sub par. The meal voucher scheme would have allowed farmers to plan ahead, put in decent quality food for their cattle and stretch out the bales they had, but the Government was worried about the extra few pennies, so it waited until matters got so incredibly bad that it was backed into a corner. I do not have much time to contribute, but I can tell the Minister that the stress that he and his Department have caused is unforgivable. I wonder whether he will learn for when something like this comes around again.
#JohnBrassil	unknown-#JohnBrassil-party	unknown-#JohnBrassil-dob	unknown-#JohnBrassil-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	478	I welcome the opportunity to contribute on what is a critical issue for farmers in rural Ireland. Rather than rehash the reasonable proposals that have been tabled in the debate so far, in particular the extension of the transport subsidy scheme and the meal voucher scheme for cattle and sheep, which I support, I will focus on an equally serious issue, that of the physical and mental well-being of the farmers affected. The mental trauma of being a farmer who has to listen to his or her herd roaring with hunger but is not in a position to do anything about it is probably the worst place any farmer can be. I am reliably told that the Samaritans helpline is busy with calls from the farming community. When dealing with the practical issue of providing fodder and feed for farms, I ask the Minister to ensure that supports are put in place to help it deal with the detrimental effects on people's health, both now and into the future. Will the Minister liaise with the various farming organisations and include this important issue in the agenda? Extreme weather conditions are now an annual occurrence. Simply hoping that the weather will turn fine is not a sustainable position into the future. We can expect similar crises in 2019 and 2020, so we need to be proactive rather than reactive in our methods of addressing this unfortunate but all too common event.
#AnneRabbitte	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-party	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-dob	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	479	Ireland's fodder shortage has become a fodder crisis and national emergency, and it is past time for action. Engage meaningfully with the farming community. This is approximately the fourth time I have stood before the Minister, but I now make an impassioned plea to him to dispense with the rhetoric of the past months and take action. He should listen to what Deputies McConalogue and Cahill have proposed. I challenge the Minister, his Department and the Government to let their minds pass the Pale. They have a complete disconnect and denial of what is going on in rural Ireland. Where is the Minister's forward planning now? Where are his sense of roots and his values? He stood across the floor and told us about his family farm, but where is his value for rural Ireland, for farming, which is the backbone of our economy, and for the work of the farming families who have remained committed to Ireland? Where is his sense of compassion? Farmers are undergoing hardships that are endangering their mental and physical well-being. Does anyone care? Is Deputy Creed a Minister who cares? I hope he is. If he is, he will support what Deputies McConalogue and Cahill have proposed and introduce a hardship fund to help small and medium-sized farmers. He should also introduce a meal voucher scheme and make low-cost credit available. He should open the low-cost loan scheme, which was announced more than seven months ago. When will farmers have access to it? Do not tell me that it will be in the back end of 2018. He must ensure that GLAS balancing payments and sheep subsidy payments are made. Support our motion, Minister. Do not ignore me.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	480	The wet weather has continued unabated since last winter, leading to poor soil conditions and poor grass growth, and has prevented farmers from putting cattle out to grass in early April. The reality of the situation is as simple as that. The scheme to subsidise the cost of importing fodder was welcome. It was finally an acknowledgement by the Government that there was a crisis. However, the actual cost of buying fodder has not been addressed. The majority of farmers do not have the cashflow to pay the upfront cost of additional fodder and concentrates. From speaking with farmers, this is the nub of the issue. I am from the constituency of Waterford.I was very proud to see "Big Week on the Farm" filmed at Gillian and Neil O'Sullivan's dairy farm last week. It brought agriculture into the homes of every house in Ireland. It was fantastic. Like Deputy Chambers, I spoke to a farmer who broke down on the phone because he simply did not have the money to buy fodder. He accepted that a lot has been done to bring fodder into the country but it may as well be still in England because he cannot afford to buy it. It has been estimated that many farmers are forking out an additional €1,000 per week to keep their animals fed. A new low-interest loan scheme has to be made available to farmers affected by the fodder crisis to pay the increased costs they face. They need it now. I call on the Minister to finalise and open the low-cost loan scheme announced over seven months ago in budget 2018. The banks involved in this loan scheme must be told not to make farmers jump through unnecessary hoops when applying for these loans.  I will hand over to my colleague, Deputy McConalogue.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-04-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	481	I thank everyone for their contributions tonight and for their support of the motion. It was disappointing to see a number of Deputies from the Minister's party attack the Opposition and Fianna Fáil for coming forward with the motion instead of reflecting on the performance of the Government in dealing with the issue and trying to head it off. In the Minister's comments he indicated he does not accept it was a crisis that could be envisaged. It is unfortunate to hear that at this stage because everyone here envisaged it and warned there was a fodder shortage in certain parts of the country which could develop into a crisis. There is something wrong with the Minister's processes and the way he dealt with this if he could not envisage it and be prepared for it. A key flaw in the process was the Minister's attitude to it, his denial there was a real problem brewing and his refusal to listen to the farming organisations who repeatedly urged him to prepare for and take on board that there was a problem. The Minister's responses, where there were responses, were not appropriate at the time. The Minister belatedly introduced a transport subsidy to transport fodder from one part of the country to the other instead of listening to the advice he was given to introduce a meal voucher. The transport subsidy which the Minister introduced resulted in the areas the fodder was being taken from eventually running out of fodder. It is a tremendous failure on the Minister's behalf to have put in place a scheme that contributed to the crisis rather than responding appropriately.  Everyone has acknowledged that the Minister cannot control the weather but he needs to have a sense of what is happening on the ground and be in a position to respond to it, be prepared for it and show leadership. Unfortunately, that has been entirely absent in the Minister's and Government's response to the fodder crisis. While the Minister continues to hope for the best, the situation is now what people warned him about, in other words, the fodder crisis we now find across the country.  We are asking the Minister to fully and properly respond and assist farmers over the next couple of weeks. Our motion outlined the need for a hardship fund and a meal voucher for those who are in trouble. We are also seeking the low-interest loan scheme to be introduced immediately. I understand that during the week the Minister indicated to farming organisations that it will not be available until the end of this year. We need to see the GLAS and sheep welfare scheme payments paid immediately. There also needs to be understanding for the farming community in terms of the inspection regime over the next period of time. Farming is a very difficult pursuit. Farmers have to make a living not only to pay bills for their families and run their households but also to cover the costs of their farms and ensure, importantly, that their cattle can be fed. The Minister needs to recognise it is a very distressing time. Over the next couple of weeks he should perform his role as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and give farmers the assistance they need to get through this very difficult period. I commend the motion to the House.
