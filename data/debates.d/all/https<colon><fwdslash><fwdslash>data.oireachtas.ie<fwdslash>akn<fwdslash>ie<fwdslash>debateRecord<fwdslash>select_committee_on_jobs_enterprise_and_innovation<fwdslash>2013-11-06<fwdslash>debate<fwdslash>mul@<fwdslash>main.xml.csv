I welcome Deputy Sean Sherlock, Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, and all his officials. Before we resume our consideration of the Bill, the Minister of State wishes to respond to a number of points raised during the proceedings yesterday.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14945	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	1	I thank the Vice Chairman and committee members for allowing us to flag amendments which will be dealt with on Report Stage. As requested by members, my officials have brought copies of the ODCE's guide to directors' duties and powers. This document is available free of charge in both hard copy and on the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, website. As I mentioned yesterday, the officials from my Department will arrange another briefing session for committee members prior to Report Stage to ensure that members are fully briefed on these proposed amendments. In this context, I wish to remind members about the Companies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2013, which will be progressing through the Houses in the coming weeks. This Bill will contain provisions that are considered to be too urgent to wait for the completion of the "Big Bill". This Bill amends the Companies (Amendment) Act 1990 in relation to the jurisdiction of the courts in examinerships. It provides that companies that are deemed to be small companies by virtue of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1986 may make their application to the Circuit Court instead of the High Court. It also contains provisions concerning the making of annual returns for subsidiary undertakings. It facilitates the reporting of offences under the companies Acts to the Director of Corporate Enforcement and his or her officers. It authorises IAASA to collect a levy or levies from statutory auditors and audit firms auditing public interest entities. Finally the Bill makes provision for the Minister to provide regulations in relation to third country auditors and audit entities, who carry out audits of the annual or group accounts of a company falling within certain EU regulations. As the "small" Bill has not yet been enacted, it is not possible to give a more precise detail of its final version, although obviously the members of the committee will contribute to it when it comes before them in the next few weeks. As the goal of the Companies Bill 2012 is to consolidate all existing law, it is intended that the "small" Bill will be subsumed into it, ideally by way of Report Stage amendments. I would also like to note that I am considering introducing amendments to Part 3 on Report Stage to harmonise advertising requirements for notifying creditors of a proposed reduction in capital and also to ensure that the requirement to advertise in one daily newspaper only is applied consistently throughout the Bill.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14945	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	7	The purpose of the section is to accommodate companies which have, on or after 1 March 2002, availed of the exemption from the requirement to include "limited" or "teoranta" in their name. As matters stand, under the Bill all companies which have, on or after March 2002, availed of the exemption, pursuant to section 24(1) of the Companies Act 1963 as substituted by section 88 of the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001, from including "limited" in the name will have to reapply to the Companies Registration Office to obtain an exemption from including "DAC", designated activity company, in their name. This amendment is necessary as it will reduce the burden on such companies and they will not be required to claim the exemption a second time, a procedure which would result in filing fees and administrative overheads. The administrative burden to the Companies Registration Office will also be reduced as it will not have to reprocess these filings a second time.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14945	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	14	I move amendment No. 112:In page 778, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:
“Status of existing guarantee company, having a share capital
982. (1) This section—(a) makes provision as to the status of an existing guarantee company, having a share capital; and(b) continues in force the memorandum and articles of such a company.(2) In this section—“existing guarantee company, having a share capital” means a private company limited by guarantee, having a share capital, which—(a) was incorporated under any former enactment relating to companies (within the meaning of section 5); and(b) is in existence immediately before the commencement of this section;“mandatory provision” means a provision of any of Parts 1 to 14 (as applied by this Part) or of this Part that is not an optional provision; “optional provision” means a provision of any of Parts 1 to 14 (as applied by this Part) or of this Part that—(a) contains a statement to the effect, or is governed by provision elsewhere to the effect, that the provision applies save to the extent that the constitution provides otherwise or unless the constitution states otherwise; or(b) is otherwise of such import.(3) An existing guarantee company, having a share capital shall, on and from the commencement of this section, continue in existence and be deemed to be a DAC limited by guarantee to which this Part applies.(4) Section 983 contains provisions—(a) for enabling such a company to continue to use, for a limited period, “limited” or “teoranta” in its name despite the foregoing status that it has assumed; and(b) deeming the name of such a company, after a specified period and in default of its having changed its name in that fashion, to be altered by the replacement of—(i) “designated activity company” for “limited” at the end thereof; or(ii) “cuideachta ghníomhaíochta ainmnithe” for “teoranta” at the end thereof,as the case may be.(5) Reference, express or implied, in this Act to the date of registration of a company mentioned in a preceding subsection shall be read as a reference to the date on which the company was registered under the Joint Stock Companies Act 1862, the Companies (Consolidation) Act 1908 or the prior Companies Acts, as the case may be.(6) The memorandum and articles of an existing guarantee company, having a share capital shall—(a) save to the extent that they are inconsistent with a mandatory provision; and(b) in the case of the memorandum, subject to section 983(6),continue in force but may be altered or added to under and in accordance with the conditions under which memorandums or articles, whenever registered, are permitted by this Act to be altered or added to.(7) References in the provisions of a memorandum or articles so continued in force to any provision of the prior Companies Acts shall be read as references to the corresponding provision of this Act.(8) To the extent that an existing guarantee company, having a share capital was, immediately before the commencement of this section, governed by—(a) the regulations of Table D in the First Schedule to the Act of 1963; or(b) the regulations of any Table referred to in section 3(9)(b), (c) or (d) of the Act of 1963,it shall, after that commencement, continue to be governed by those regulations but—(i) this is save to the extent that those regulations are inconsistent with a mandatory provision;(ii) those regulations may be altered or added to under and in accordance with the conditions under which articles, whenever registered, are permitted by this Act to be altered or added to; and(iii) references in the regulations to any provision of the prior Companies Acts shall be read as references to the corresponding provision of this Act.”.I am trying to get into my own stride here. Effectively we are proposing to introduce a new amendment to chapter 3 of Part 16. The amendment provides that existing private limited guaranteed companies having share capital will convert to DACs limited by guarantee following the commencement of the relevant provisions. I am considering introducing an amendment to section 982 on Report Stage to clarify the position of DACs in respect of the prohibition on listing securities on regulated markets under volume 1.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14945	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	15	I move amendment No. 113:In page 778, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:
“Transitional provision — use of “limited” or “teoranta” by existing guarantee company, having a share capital
983. (1) In this section—“existing guarantee company, having a share capital” has the same meaning as it has in section 982;“new provisions” means the provisions of this Part (and the relevant provisions of Part 2 as applied by this Part) relating to the use of either of the required sets of words (or their abbreviations) set out in subsection (2);“transition period” means the period of 18 months beginning after the commencement of this section.(2) For the purposes of this section, each of the following is a required set of words—(a) “designated activity company”;(b) “cuideachta ghníomhaíochta ainmnithe”.(3) The reference—(a) in the preceding definition of “new provisions”; and(b) in subsection (4),to provisions relating to the use of any words includes a reference to provisions conferring an exemption from the use of those words.(4) During—(a) the transition period; or(b) if before the expiry of that period the company has changed its name to include either of the required sets of words, the period preceding the making of that change,the provisions of the prior Companies Acts relating to the use of limited or teoranta (or their abbreviations) shall apply as respects the name of an existing guarantee company, having a share capital in place of the new provisions.(5) On and from—(a) the expiry of the transition period; or(b) the company changing its name to include either of the required sets of words,whichever happens first, the new provisions shall apply as respects the name of an existing guarantee company, having a share capital.(6) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (5), on the expiry of the transition period (and the company has not changed its name before then to include either of the required sets of words), the name of an existing guarantee company, having a share capital, as set out in its memorandum, shall be deemed to be altered by the replacement of—--(a) “designated activity company” for “limited” at the end thereof; or(b) “cuideachta ghníomhaíochta ainmnithe” for “teoranta” at the end thereof,as the case may be.(7) Where the name, as set out in its memorandum, of an existing guarantee company, having a share capital is altered by virtue of subsection (6), the Registrar shall issue to the company a fresh certificate of incorporation in respect of it, being a certificate of incorporation that is altered to meet the circumstances of the case.”.

(1) Sections 348 and 349 shall not apply to a DAC if it satisfies the following conditions:(a) it has been formed for charitable purposes; and(b) it stands exempted from those sections by an order made by the relevant authority (which order the relevant authority is, by virtue of this section, empowered to make),and the exemption provided by that order may, as the relevant authority considers appropriate, be either for an indefinite or a limited period.”.This amendment proposes to allow relief for DACs formed for charitable purpose or which are exempted by an order regarding the documents to be annexed to their annual return, such as financial statements and a director's report. The current section 996(1) exempts DACs which do not "trade for the acquisition of gain by its members" from filing such documents. The amendment proposes to formalise and restrict the exemption to relate to DACs formed for charitable purpose or otherwise exempted DACs.

Section 1044 provides that "Section 96(2) shall not apply in respect of a transfer of shares in a PLC where those shares fall within a class of securities the evidencing and transfer of title to which is for the time being governed by regulations under section 1085." Thus, when this Bill becomes law, pending the introduction of any regulations by the Minister pursuant to section 1085, regulations under section 239 of the 1990 Act will remain in force. Consequently, I propose that this section be deleted.

However, there are entities that cleverly masquerade as authentic companies with a facade of ordinariness about them but there is a great deal of public knowledge that they are involved in various nefarious schemes. Does the State need additional powers or does the State feel that is a matter for the Garda? Does a section in the Bill deal with this? I missed some of yesterday's meeting and the committee may have dealt with this evil in commercial life. Is there a recognition of it? Is it quantified? Are sufficient measures and instruments in place? Some of this activity damages and undermines legitimate business activity and adds to unemployment in legitimate trading areas.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14945	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	77	Part 14 deals with stipulations relating to reckless behaviour by directors of a company and penalties are included in the Bill.There are review clauses inherent in the legislation so that the company law review group can be involved. It is a statutory body and has a mandate to monitor, review and advise the Minister about existing company law and to make recommendations about its implementation and the introduction of new legislation. I do not think that necessarily answers the Deputy's question, but aside from the criminal activities, there are specific ways of punishing dishonest or irresponsible directors of insolvent companies and of protecting the public from further wrongdoing by such persons, namely by restricting or disqualifying directors. There are specific and robust proposals in regard to criminal sanctions, the jurisdiction of the courts, the role and responsibilities of the directors or persons involved in a company. Some of this is updating pre-existing law and consolidating it. I do not know if that answers Deputy Conaghan's query.

This amendment effectively ensures continuity with current law. Amendment No. 132 is a technical amendment.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	102	I move amendment No. 146:In page 938, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:“1233. (1) An unlimited company shall disclose by the filing of a notification with the Companies Registration Office a list of all members which are limited companies, and their respective number of allocated shares.(2) Subsection (1) shall apply to all body corporate members, wheresoever registered.(3) A transfer of shares to a new body corporate member which is a limited liability company shall not take effect until the notification referred to in subsection (1) has been filed with the Companies Registration Office.(4) Failure to file the notification referred to in subsection (1) may result, on application to the Court by any interested party, to the imposition of limited liability status on the unlimited company in question.”.I am sorry I delayed proceedings. Most people assume that when dealing with an unlimited company there is no upper limit on the personal liability of the shareholders for the company's debts if the company was to become insolvent. Approximately 4,000 or 2.3% of current Irish companies are unlimited and, as a result, they escape the stricter filing and disclose requirements that private limited companies are under. The filing and disclosure requirements allow a creditor to apprise himself of a company's solvency before trading with it. However, many large corporate sources are using unlimited liability companies but seeking to limit liability by ensuring that some or all of the shareholders of the unlimited company are themselves limited liability entities.It is always open to the courts to look through the corporate charter of unlimited companies and see for themselves unlimited company members - in other words, to lift the corporate veil - but this can only be done with the expense of an application to the courts. However, as the High Court recently remarked in the Goode Concrete v. CRH case, this approach is not possible when a limited company is an offshore company. This amendment requires all private unlimited companies to notify the Companies Registration Office, CRO, of any shareholder company that might limit its liability. In this way, a creditor may check the CRO records of an unlimited company at the outset of contractual negotiations and be aware of a fact that although a company may be registered as unlimited, the company's liability may be limited. The failure of an unlimited company to notify the CRO of any limited liability shareholder could result in the imposition of limited liability status on the companies immediately, as the courts see fit, within the limits of reasonableness and proportionality. I do not know whether the Minister of State is aware of this, but at least four of the major construction companies that left in the region of €1 billion in debts behind were unlimited. People trading with them would not have been privy to their position because of their unlimited nature, and many companies are not quite as unlimited as they seem because of the loophole I have outlined. It would be a good idea for the Minister of State to take this on board.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14945	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	103	Under section 216(9)(c), every company is obliged to allow any person to inspect its members' register on the payment of a fee, which must be €10 or less. Section 216(12)(c) obliges companies to send a copy of their members' registers to any person who requests it, again for a fee of €10 or less. This register contains the names and addresses of members and the number of shares held by each member. This also applies to unlimited companies. As there is currently no requirement to report this information to the Companies Registration Office, it would be costly to set up a register both for the Companies Registration Office and for the affected companies. The ongoing cost to the CRO and affected companies of making and processing thousands of notifications would also be significant. The costs involved in delays to transfer of ownership of shares would be unacceptably high and could interfere with constitutional rights to private property. The information is already publicly available on request and the cost of creating and maintaining such a public register would be considerable, so I am not in favour of this amendment.

They got some very big surprises when trouble came around. Perhaps there are ways of accessing the information and these people were not au fait with those processes. The Minister of State has stated that this would be expensive, but just about everything is expensive today. In the interests of greater transparency, it would be a good idea.

The Deputy has cited cases in the construction sphere and I am not sure about the cost argument, given the capacity for electronic filing of information. Do we have figures on the actual cost or burden of work? There is a difficulty as large corporate entities have the capacity to hide information, no matter what is contained in this Bill. In fairness to the transparency aspect, this amendment seems to be practical.

Even currently there is a major company going through the liquidation process and there will be a knock-on effect. People might not know the full financial position of companies.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14945	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-11-06 00:00:00	Companies Bill 2012: Committee Stage (Resumed)	108	There is no problem returning to this on Report Stage for further deliberations, but we must acknowledge that unlimited companies function within the Irish infrastructure, serving many legitimate business purposes. They are a feature of company law across the European Union. Issues have been raised with regard to transparency, and perhaps we can provide more clarity in that respect for the next Stage. Just as guaranteed and public limited companies are important for certain kinds of business, unlimited companies also serve an important purpose. I am not suggesting that anybody is necessarily seeking to remove them, but to do so would be a disproportionate act which could affect Ireland's competitive advantage. I do not know if it is possible to quantify the burden of cost but we can try to do some work on it between now and the next Stage of the Bill.

There is a choice, which is fine. We are talking about unlimited companies that are not really unlimited but have the protection of limited companies. There is a cloak, and nobody knows where the company is in a financial sense. These companies may not be unlimited as they engage limited shareholdings offshore. They become limited companies, enjoying the best of both worlds.

It could be a more suitable way of addressing that issue. That is a potential resource for the committee. The matter could be addressed on Report Stage in order to provide greater clarity. The primary aim of this Bill is the consolidation of existing law and the provision of a user-friendly framework for businesses operating in Ireland. We must take into account the fundamental principle of the Bill. The issue that has been raised by a number of members could be addressed again on Report Stage.

Modification has taken place to account for the new company types under the Bill. As such, a joint company may at any time register as a CLS, DAC, CLG or unlimited company.

These provisions are taken from Part 5 of the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2005. In essence, Part 23 speaks to the EU regulations governing the very section on which the Deputy has posed the question.

Given the size of the Bill, there is likely to be a substantial delay if section 7 of the Official Languages Act is not disapplied.

This Bill will be translated into Irish as per the Official Languages Act 2003. However, we have to be practical and pragmatic. We know there are not enough translators within the system to deal with both Irish and European Union parliamentary business. The Bill will be published in Irish at some stage. We uphold the rights of those whose first language is Irish to have equal access to this legislation.They will have equal access to this Bill in their native tongue. However, we must be practical and apply a common-sense approach to how we deal with this issue. I ask the Deputy to give us some leeway.

Presumably they will be working as hard as they can. While I agree with Deputy Calleary on the need to ensure all Bills are provided in Irish, this is a substantial and very technical Bill. It is in order that we allow the amendment as long as it is enacted as soon as possible after the final Bill in English.

This Bill should have been written as Gaeilge as it was going along so that translation is not a major administrative burden. I am willing to accept the Minister of State's good faith, but every time such an amendment comes in I will object to it.

No. 137 of 1987 European Communities(Mergers and Divisions of Companies) Regulations 1987The whole Statutory Instrument”.The purpose of the amendment is to repeal the 1987 mergers regulations. Its omission from the table of revocations was an error.

The Minister will lead us but I want to be certain there will be no procedural issue. We flagged it yesterday and I want to flag it again. We need further consultation with the Minister on this and my party will bring forward amendments on Report Stage.

I acknowledge the forbearance of the committee about the introduction of new amendments on Report Stage and thank them for that. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, is scheduled to meet a group from the committee next week on the issue of the accountancy matter. I acknowledge the collegiality of the committee regarding the speed with which we have moved through this Stage of the process.

Their business-like approach has been a very effective way to deal with the Bill. I appreciate everybody's efforts in doing that. I acknowledge the significant contribution of advance briefings provided by the Department officials. It meant much to the members that many issues were addressed at an early stage so we could tease them out. It resulted in the efficient passing of the Bill through Committee Stage. It was a common-sense approach and is great to have it finished today as opposed to over the next couple of weeks. I am very conscious that further briefings will be held before Report Stage and I thank the Department for that. They are very important to facilitate members who are trying to do their work properly. The briefings are key to that. Members get answers to all their questions. I thank the team here at the top table. Much effort went into organising this over the last couple of months.
