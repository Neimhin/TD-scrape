          <p eId="para_1">I express my deepest sympathies to the family of Savita Halappanavar and her husband, Praveen, as the anniversary of her tragic death on 28 October 2012 approaches. The report published by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, into the circumstances of Ms Halappanavar's death makes difficult reading for her family and many others, especially women and those involved in the provision of front-line maternity care services.</p>
          <p eId="para_2"> Last year, the Health Service Executive in Galway gave an assurance that an implementation plan would be put in place to ensure maternity services would be monitored and failings addressed. The bigger issue, however, is maternity services at national level. For example, the HIQA report highlights deficiencies in the implementation of guidelines in the area of sepsis. Another key issue highlighted is a lack of resources which is creating significant pressure on the delivery of front-line maternity services. The issue has also been raised by the masters of the Rotunda and Holles Street maternity hospitals and other obstetricians. As I have stated in previous discussions of this issue, this is not a political point but a matter of ensuring that women have absolute confidence in our maternity services. </p>
          <p eId="para_3"> What is now required is the immediate establishment of an implementation body to assess and review the Health Service Executive's commitments to implement the plans it has outlined. More important, the HIQA report on the death of Savita Halappanavar and other matters must be implemented in full. Will the Tánaiste give a commitment to hold a full, independent review and audit of maternity services, including the staffing and resourcing of same, and to ensure that any deficiencies highlighted in such an audit will be made public as quickly as possible?</p>
          <p eId="para_4"> One area on which immediate action could be taken is front-line maternity care services, which have been shown definitively to be under significant pressure. There is a shortage of midwives, maternity hospitals are under-resourced and we have a low ratio of obstetricians to population. With 70,000 births each year in this country, we should have many more obstetricians. Will the Tánaiste give a commitment to act on the recommendations of the report? Will he also undertake to lift the embargo or moratorium on the recruitment of front-line staff for maternity services?</p>

        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_2" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade">
          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2013-10-10T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_5">I join Deputy Kelleher in expressing again my sympathy and that of the Government to Praveen Halappanavar and his family on the death last year of his wife, Savita. The report published yesterday makes difficult reading for them and everybody with an interest in maternity services. I do not believe there is a woman in the country who does not put herself in that bed on St. Monica's ward and I do not believe there is a man in the country who does not see his wife, partner or daughter in that bed or ask himself very basic questions about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_6"> I have read the HIQA report and it does what the authority was asked to do, namely, to get to the bottom of what happened in Galway and why and to establish what lessons can be learned from it. As with all such reports, this report is written in careful language. Reading through it, however, a number of things become very clear. It correctly makes the point that everybody is entitled to be safe in our hospitals and to receive the best quality of care. It notes a general lack of provision of basic fundamental care, for example, failure to follow up on blood tests, failure to recognise that Savita Halappanavar was at risk of clinical deterioration and failure to act or escalate concerns to an appropriately qualified clinician when Savita Halappanavar was showing signs of clinical deterioration, and refers to ultimate clinical accountability resting with the consultation obstetrician who was leading the case. When one reads these points, one must ask fundamental questions about whether someone was not doing his or her job or not doing it properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_7"> The recommendations refer to governance failures, stating, for example, that the "clinical governance arrangements within the Hospital failed to recognise that vital Hospital policies were not in use nor were arrangements in place to ensure the provision of basic patient care on St Monica's Ward". When one reads this statement, one must ask fundamental questions about the management and supervision of the service. When one reads about the length of time clinicians were spending at committee meetings, one must ask basic questions about how the Health Service Executive is governed and run. When one reads the recommendations addressed to the HSE and Department and Health, one must ask basic questions about how maternity services are provided. When one reads, for example, that five of the 19 maternity hospitals had not delivered on a previous report, one must ask fundamental questions about the delivery of a national maternity strategy in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_8"> This is a very good report which contains recommendations that are addressed right across the board, from the hospital ward to the desk of the Minister for Health. These recommendations will be implemented. What we must do, and what Savita Halappanavar and the women of this country are owed, is to implement the recommendations with urgency and put in place systems, supervision and co-ordination to ensure we do not have another Savita Halappanavar case and the women of this country receive the maternity care and care in pregnancy to which they are entitled. This is what the Government and Minister for Health will address. While I am open to audits, independent examinations or other measures if they help to achieve or oversee this process and ensure it is completed, let us not go down the road of having another audit or report. We have a very good report; let us get on with doing what it asks us to do by implementing its recommendations.</p>

        <speech by="#BillyKelleher" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Deputy Billy Kelleher<recordedTime time="2013-10-10T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_9">I thank the Tánaiste for his reply. Unfortunately, we had the very tragic case of Tania McCabe in Drogheda who died in 2007. At that time national guidelines were drawn up with regard to sepsis. Only five of the 19 maternity hospitals are currently implementing those guidelines as has been highlighted in this report. We then had the tragic case in Galway. While the Tánaiste talks about governance structures and local management, the report also consistently refers to the Department of Health so it is not just an issue of pointing to local managements and saying they must do better. Of course they must do better but they must also be resourced. The report is clear and definitive in pointing out that resourcing is a key issue in ensuring the safety of maternity services. While it refers to governance and accountability, the key point is that resourcing is paramount in the delivery of maternity services.</p>
          <p eId="para_10"> The Tánaiste also said that following the tragic death of Savita Halappanavar, we do not need another audit. However, we need to insist and ensure this report is implemented in full. We have had a previous report and only five of the 19 maternity hospitals implemented its recommendations. What commitment can the Tánaiste give today to ensure that at some stage in the future every recommendation in the report will be implemented in full? While it states that the HSE must implement, it also states that the Department of Health must implement. That does not exonerate political people; it puts political people directly responsible for the implementation of the report. That includes all facets, including resources.</p>

          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2013-10-10T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_13">There should be no issue of exoneration at any level regarding this issue. This is not a time for anybody to be exonerating themselves. I have been through the report which is very good and detailed, albeit using some of the guarded language that these reports use. I believe it gets to the nub of where the problems are. At every level actions need to be taken to address what is in this report and to implement its recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> As the Deputy has said, there was a previous case in 2007 and there was to be follow-up on that. The report states:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_15">The HSE reported that these recommendations were implemented at a local HSE level with regional HSE oversight. On enquiry, the Authority noted with concern that only five of the 19 maternity hospitals/units were able to provide a detailed status update on the implementation of recommendations from the Tania McCabe report.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> Referring to what happened in Galway the HIQA report states:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_17">The Hospital reported that 167 maternity and non-maternity patients in total required ICU care as a result of sepsis in 2011 and 139 patients in 2012... the Authority [HIQA] found that at the time of the investigation, the Hospital did not have a hospital-wide guideline in place for the management of sepsis in adult patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">We need to ask why that was. That issue needs to be addressed. The HIQA report also states:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_19">The Hospital had a guideline in place for the management of ‘Suspected sepsis and sepsis in obstetric care’. However, the clinical governance arrangements were not robust enough to ensure adherence to this guideline.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">What does that mean in plain language? Does it mean somebody was not implementing or enforcing those guidelines or does it mean there was an attempt to enforce them and they were not complied with? That needs to be addressed. We need to take this report in its totality. It does not spare any level of the health service, from the ward to the Minister's office. I believe it needs to be taken seriously. It needs to be answered and addressed, and its recommendations need to be fully implemented.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryLouMcDonald" eId="spk_7">
          <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2013-10-10T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_21">The Tánaiste has said the report makes for difficult reading - for nobody more than for the Halappanavar family, the family of Tania McCabe, for many other families and for any woman, particularly any woman of child-bearing age who may at some stage rely on the maternity services in the State. The Tánaiste described the report as a good report; I would describe it as a damning report. As he has acknowledged, it registers failures in the most basic elements of medical care that Savita Halappanavar had every right to expect, including, very disturbingly, an absolute failure to recognise the vast deterioration in her health. The mind boggles at that prospect.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> The criticisms, as the Tánaiste has acknowledged, are not simply restricted to St. Monica's ward. His language has been very evocative and no doubt we can all imagine the scenario for Savita Halappanavar and the turn of events for her and her husband, Praveen, over those fateful days. Of course the implications of the report go far beyond that ward. We now see a mirror held up to our maternity services, showing us clearly that the vital safeguards, and the most basic provisions in terms of good governance and good practice in our maternity services, simply are not there. The authors of the report found it impossible to provide assurances that women are receiving safe or reliable care during or after pregnancy.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> I agree with the Tánaiste in saying that questions arise from the report. There are questions around accountability in the case of the particular hospital in Galway, and in respect of local and regional HSE authorities. A question of negligence or malpractice arises. If that is not stated openly, it is certainly implicit in the report's content. Not alone are questions raised by this report, but answers are demanded. The implication of this report moves from St. Monica's ward through the HSE to the desk of the Minister for Health and then it lands fairly and squarely on the desk of the Cabinet. The questions people want answered are as follows. How will the accountability, of which the Tánaiste speaks, be delivered? We have mentioned the previous case of Tania McCabe in 2007. At that time guidelines were drawn up and we all resolved that we would have learned the lessons. Six years later those recommendations have not been implemented.</p>

          <p eId="para_25">We have another tragic turn of events and the same sort of event unfolds again. That is not accountability; that is a matter of farce - a very dangerous farce for women's health. What about the accountability and, crucially, what about the resources?</p>

          <p eId="para_27">Next Tuesday is budget day when decisions on spending will be made, including in the area of health. What comfort and reassurance can the Tánaiste give to women, who are potential users of the maternity services, that the issue of lack of resources, identified fairly and squarely by HSE spokespersons as recently as this morning, will be addressed?</p>

          <p eId="para_28">One thing here matters above any other consideration of political debate or different interests in the health service lifting chunks of this report perhaps to support or defend a case that they are making.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">Over and above any of that has to be safety for the patient and for women who are admitted to our hospitals during pregnancy. In this particular case, the report stated there were 13 possible interventions that could have been made and which did not happen in the period when Savita Halappanavar was in hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> Resources are always an issue; of course they are. However, I do not believe anyone who reads the report could say that resources were the issue in respect of all 13 of the possible interventions that could have taken place. The report in the Tania McCabe case was implemented in five out of the 19 hospitals. That raises the question of why was it implemented in those five but not fully in the others, although it appears to have been partially implemented in some of the others. That must be looked at.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> This is a collective thing. As I said earlier, what we have to do is take this report, resolve that this should never happen again and do what is necessary to make sure of that. That means implementing the recommendations in the report. For example, one of the issues raised in the report in terms of the deployment of our resources was whether we should continue to have 19 maternity hospitals or units in the country. That is an issue for all of us because, let us suppose, for example, the Minister for Health came to the House and said that he wanted to rationalise the number of maternity units or wards and have a smaller number of better equipped, better quality and better standard maternity hospitals. Let us ask ourselves in all honesty what the response to that would be.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> I put it to every Member that I believe this is a good report. The recommendations in it are very strong and they should be implemented. Responsibility for the implementation of those recommendations primarily rests with the Minister for Health, the HSE management and so on. There may also be issues of choice, general policy and the deployment of resources that will ultimately be issues for everyone in the House. When we come to address those issues, we should do so with the best interests of the patient and of women at heart.</p>

          <p eId="para_33">When "never again" is said on this occasion, it needs to mean never again. I suggest to the Tánaiste that this means that he ought to ask the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, to explain to him, the Cabinet and to those of us in the Chamber how it is that only five out of 19 maternity facilities introduced the guidelines. We want to know why that is the case and the public ought to know why that is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> The Tánaiste referred to the issue of resources. I hope the Tánaiste will not use this report or the tragic turn of events for Savita or Tania McCabe as some kind of pretext to cut back on maternity services. The Tánaiste is right. We have to make decisions about how we arrive at the safety that we all require. I agree with him entirely. However, I put it to the Tánaiste, and I know from experience, that for a heavily pregnant woman, the prospect of having to travel hundreds of kilometres to get to a maternity service or hospital would not be a helpful or a terribly safe thing for her to do.</p>

          <p eId="para_36">This morning, not only the HSE spokesperson but the masters of the maternity hospitals have been saying that they are struggling to cope with the level of births and the level of services they must provide in our maternity hospitals. We all know it and they have been saying it for a very long time.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> The report identifies failures in management and accountability, including political failures, but it also raises the question of resources. I suggest to the Tánaiste that if "never again" is really to mean never again, we need to resolve the accountability and governance issues, including the role of the Cabinet and of the Minister for Health. We must also be truthful about the resources that are required in our maternity hospitals. Anyone who visits the Rotunda, the Coombe or Holles Street can see the bedlam at play at times in those fine facilities. One is left in no doubt that there is an acute resource issue on the front line. I say as much to the Tánaiste, not to let anyone off the hook in respect of the lack of treatment and appropriate care for Savita Halappanavar - I am keen to emphasise that point - but simply to state that if we are serious about the safety of women and their babies and a quality maternity care service, we must have a resourced front line. On Tuesday, the Government will have an opportunity to ensure that is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> Will the Tánaiste be more specific about the implementation of these recommendations? Does he intend to speak or has he spoken to the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly? Will the Tánaiste ask the Minister for Health to come before the House without delay to set out his response to the report and the failure of hospitals throughout the State to implement the recommendations many years on? Will the Tánaiste give a commitment to the women of the country that he will ensure the necessary resources are at the front line, where women and their babies need them?</p>

          <p eId="para_39">We have a choice with this report. We can take it now and use it as ammunition in whatever case we want to make, whether a political case around the budget or the delivery of resources, a case in the arguments that go on within the service about whether resources should go here or there, or in arguments between one institution and another. We can use it in those ways or we can take this report, as I do, in its totality and say that actions need to be taken at every level. We should not pick one and use it simply to go there or to make this or another argument. We should take the report in its totality, take the entire set of recommendations and determine that we are going to have them implemented. As I have said, there are implications in the report for people at every level in the health service, every level of government, every level of management and every level of delivery of service in the maternity services. The report needs to be implemented in its totality.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> There are issues of resources. Of course there are; there always are. There are issues of the management and quality of the maternity services that have to be addressed. However, the report is very clear that there are also other issues. This report relates to a particular case, a particular institution, a particular service and one very tragic, awful case. There are implications in it for how the job is actually done, how the service is actually delivered in the ward and what actually happens when something goes wrong. This report is shocking in terms of what actually happened in the ward in this particular case. The report is also clear about where action needs to be taken and the paths that need to be followed in respect of taking action in the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> I do not believe it serves the health service in its totality well or the people who work in it, who deliver a high quality service and who work hard, diligently and professionally every day to ignore those aspects of the report. No aspect of this report should be ignored, including those which land at the headquarters of the HSE or the desk of the Minister for Health. They should not be ignored either.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">As I believe there must be accountability both for what happened and for the implementation of the recommendation in these reports, I suggest the health committee of the House ask the relevant people, who have questions to answer arising from this report, to appear before it. In the first instance, they should do so to address specific questions that arise from the report and over time, to address the implementation of its recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> Ireland has a public accountability system. That is how public accountability is delivered for the people who pay their taxes for the health service, those who depend on it and those who must access hospitals and who, as Deputy McDonald noted, in some cases travel long distances to get particular care in hospitals. This should be done. I do not believe this report should be let rest or let lie but there should be a resolve at every level to deal with its recommendations and implement them.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seamus Healy<recordedTime time="2013-10-10T11:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_44">The Government has cut heating supports, such as the fuel scheme and the free units of electricity, in each of the last three years. In 2011, the number of free electricity units was reduced from 2,400 to 1,800. In 2012, the period over which the fuel scheme operated was cut by six weeks and in 2013, the household benefits package, including the free units of electricity, was cut again. Even before these cuts were implemented, it is known there were more than 1,000 additional winter deaths in the Republic. Moreover, it is known the vast majority of such deaths were due to cold-related conditions and that such conditions exacerbated underlying medical conditions such as, for instance, respiratory illnesses. These facts are known on foot of professional research carried out and directed by Professor Goodman of the Dublin Institute of Technology. This research was peer reviewed and publicly funded through the Centre for Ageing Research and Development in Ireland and was launched by the Tánaiste's colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte. It is known that before the cuts introduced by the Government, heating costs were significantly cheaper. Over the past three years, gas costs have increased by 22%, 8.5% and 2% in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively, giving a total increase of 32.5%. Similarly, the cost of electricity rose by 14.8%, 5.9% and 3.5% in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively, giving a total increase of 24.2%. In addition, the cost of oil rose by 18% in 2012 alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_45"> A recent press release from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul reveals that the increase in energy bills over the past three years has cost €500 per family. This wipes out completely the value of the fuel scheme for 2013-14. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul also revealed that it now spends more than €10 million per annum to provide heating supports for needy families.</p>

          <p eId="para_49">The Government is very much aware of the increase in the costs of fuel and the pressure that is putting on households, families and elderly people. This is the reason a range of supports is in place to support people with the cost of fuel. One thing that is clear regarding fuel, energy and gas is that we in Ireland are receivers. We are receivers with regard to the cost of fossil-based fuels, including oil and gas, and are very open to the way in which the price of such commodities fluctuates on the world market. This is the reason the Government is doing two things on a strategic level. First, it is increasing the generation of renewable energy in Ireland to reduce our dependence on oil and gas and to enable the supply of electricity and energy at a lower cost. Second, the Government is addressing the retrofitting of homes in order that their energy efficiency is improved and the cost of heating them is reduced. Thus far, approximately 250,000 homes have been retrofitted. The Government is particularly concerned that the retrofit scheme would proceed for those households with low incomes. A total of €50 million has been provided to improve the insulation of 25,000 of the least energy efficient homes over a three-year period and 1,000 of these improvements have already been carried out. Additional funding has been provided to address the retrofitting of local authority-owned homes to improve their energy efficiency.</p>
          <p eId="para_50"> This issue must be considered in two ways. First, the support the Government provides for households through the fuel allowance, for example, must be maintained. In addition, the issue must be addressed at the level of the energy efficiency of the home itself. This is the reason the retrofitting of houses to get higher standards of energy efficiency and thereby reducing the cost of heating the home must be part of what must be done. Ultimately, that is the best way of doing this sustainably over a longer period.</p>

          <p eId="para_53">It is the usual performance in this Chamber and sometimes one wonders whether it is worthwhile to ask any question. The Tánaiste naturally blames the world markets for the increases in prices and while that is well and good, the Government's response to increased costs has been to cut supports to needy families by cutting the fuel allowance, the free units of electricity and the household packages. The Government has deliberately and knowingly cut heating supports. It is known that cold-related conditions mean additional winter deaths. This policy is an act of social vandalism and is a matter of life and death. Must Members wait until there are more elderly deaths before finding out what is the exact position? Will the Tánaiste answer my question now? As the Tánaiste does not know the answer, will he ask the Central Statistics Office, for instance, together with the Centre for Ageing Research and Development in Ireland, to ascertain how many deaths the Government's cuts have caused since it came to power in 2011? I again ask the Tánaiste whether the Government will reverse the huge cuts that have taken place over the past three years and for which it is responsible.</p>

There will be no Leaders' Questions, no Order of Business, no questions to a Minister and no Taoiseach's questions, which comprise normal business on a Tuesday. We understand it is an exceptional day but it is uncommon that there is no other business other than the budget next Tuesday. I suggest that the Dáil should sit earlier to accommodate some of those changes. It had been suggested prior to the Whips' meeting last night that this would be done, but then it suddenly disappeared from the schedule. I ask that we meet at 1 o'clock next Tuesday and that we have an Order of Business and Leaders' Questions.</p>

As Deputy Kelleher well knows, members of the committees are nominated by their political parties. We do that regularly here. When Fianna Fáil wants to change members of a committee, a motion is put before the House on which there is no debate. The Government and I have no objection if Deputy Kelleher wants to offer Deputy Keaveney or any member of the Opposition groups membership of that committee or of any other committee. That is a matter for the Opposition side of the House, but we reserve the right to make our nominations, as does every political party, and that is all we are seeking to do here.</p>

It has always been done by the introduction of a motion and always taken without debate.

          <p eId="para_124">-----the budget is usually introduced on a Wednesday. When previous budgets were introduced, there would be a normal morning's business, including Leaders' Questions, Question Time, etc. The budget for 2014 is being introduced on Tuesday next. It is proposed that Tuesday's business will commence at 2.30 p.m. with the statements of the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform. These will be followed by the responses of the spokespersons from the Opposition parties. We will then move to dealing with the financial resolutions. Additional time is being provided for the debate on the budget. It is also proposed that there will be a full day's debate on the budget measures on Wednesday next. The fact that the budget is being introduced in October rather than December means that there will be a longer period available for all Members to contribute to the debate on it. One of the major complaints I heard voiced in previous years was to the effect that because the budget was introduced in early December, we tended to run out of road in respect of it as Christmas approached. As already stated, there will be an extended period available this year in which the budget measures can be debated. I would have thought Members would welcome this development.</p>

          <p eId="para_231">No. No. 4 proposes that the Dáil sit at 2.30 p.m. next Tuesday. There is nothing to prevent us from sitting earlier on Tuesday to give effect to what I asked for earlier. It is very strange that in the week the Government is to propose new Standing Orders to sit earlier on a Tuesday and on an additional Friday, it would not accede to our request that the Order of Business, Leaders' Questions and questions to a Minister be taken earlier on Tuesday to give full effect to a Dáil sitting. I welcome the fact there will be additional time for the budget this year. This is not to curtail that in any way but to extend the sitting to allow for other business to be taken on Tuesday.</p>

          <p eId="para_232">I explained that in previous years, the budget was on a Wednesday and that allowed for the normal Wednesday morning business and for the budget to be taken after Question Time at 3.45 p.m. The budget will be earlier this year. The sitting will commence at 2.30 p.m. and will start with the statements from the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform followed by statements from the Opposition spokespersons on finance and public expenditure and reform. The period of time for the debate on Tuesday will be longer than has been the case in previous years. We are also providing for a full day's debate on the budget on Wednesday. Given that the budget will be in mid-October this year, there will be a much longer period of time for consideration of budget issues in its aftermath.

        <heading>Second Report of the Convention on the Constitution: Statements<recordedTime time="2013-10-10T11:40:00+01:00"/></heading>
        <speech by="#AlanShatter" as="#Minister_for_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_118">
          <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)<recordedTime time="2013-10-10T11:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_267">I am pleased to present the Government's response to recommendations of the Second Report of the Convention on the Constitution. The Government welcomes this second report. We continue to be encouraged by the engagement of the participants in the process. This was evidenced again in the most recent meeting of the convention, which took place two weeks ago and at which the question of whether to give citizens residing outside the State the right to vote in presidential elections at Irish embassies was discussed.</p>
          <p eId="para_268"> As Deputies will know, the Convention on the Constitution was previously tasked with considering and making recommendations as it sees fit on the questions of whether to amend the constitutional clause on the role of women in the home, how to encourage greater participation by women in public life and how to increase the participation of women in politics. This is the subject matter of the second report, which we are discussing this morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_269"> The establishment of the Convention on the Constitution was approved by resolution of the Houses of the Oireachtas in July 2012. The resolution establishing the convention requires the Government to provide its response to each recommendation of the convention within four months. If the Government proposes to accept the recommendation, it is required to indicate the timeframe it envisages for the holding of any related referendum. Due to the summer vacation, this is the first opportunity I have had to report on behalf of the Government to the House in relation to the report we received in May and on which a reply was due while the House was in recess.</p>
          <p eId="para_270"> The commitments in the programme for Government in respect of these two issues reflect the fact that Ireland has changed significantly since the Constitution was adopted in 1937. While women have always played a central role in the family, over 975,000 women are now also active in the labour market. Over 500,000 of these women have children and therefore have additional caring responsibilities. A further significant number of adults, both men and women, have caring responsibilities for older parents and other adult dependents.</p>
          <p eId="para_271"> We know from research that we need to encourage greater sharing of family responsibilities among the partners in the family unit. Indeed, this is a stated goal of European Union gender equality policy. EU economic policy encourages member states to take all necessary steps to increase the labour market participation of women. The female population across Europe, and indeed in Ireland, has achieved higher standards of education than their male counterparts. Ireland is to the forefront at EU level in respect of the number of female graduates. We must ensure these women have every opportunity to advance their careers, while sharing with their partners the caring role for their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_272"> The programme for Government includes specific recommendations to advance the role of women in public and political life, as well as a commitment to examine the language in the Constitution. The Government is actively implementing the national women's strategy. Although it pre­dated our tenure in office, the strategy affords a clear vision to equalise socioeconomic opportunity for women, ensure the well-being of women and engage women as equal, effective active citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> The implementation of this cross-departmental strategy, which contains more than 20 objectives and 200 actions, is overseen by my Department. We have already seen many positive developments for the betterment of the lives of women in Ireland, including the narrowing of some key gaps in gender equality, particularly in relation to employment and health care. We are also seeing better cross-departmental and cross-agency co­ordination of services to address violence against women and human trafficking.</p>
          <p eId="para_274"> I will now turn to the recommendations in the convention's second report and give the Government's response to each of them. As I have mentioned, the convention was tasked to deal with two specific issues in its deliberations. Those deliberations led to votes on two additional propositions; namely the possible incorporation of gender equality as a principle in the Constitution and the possible amendment of its text to include gender-sensitive language.</p>
          <p eId="para_275"> I will turn first to the original issue of the language on "women in the home" in our Constitution. This language has been examined critically on a number of occasions over the past 20 years, including by the Second Commission on the Status of Women in 1992, the Constitution Review Group in 1996, the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution in 2006 and the UN committee which oversees the implementation of the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women, which was adopted in 1979 and which Ireland ratified in 1985.</p>
          <p eId="para_276"> While the Convention on the Constitution did not offer an alternative text in its report, a majority of its members favoured changing the clause to make it gender-neutral and recommended that it should include references to "other carers in the home" and "to include carers beyond the home". On a continuum, a majority of participants at the convention also recommended that the State should offer a "reasonable level of support" to ensure that those to whom the newly constructed amendment should apply "shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour".</p>
          <p eId="para_277"> The Government accepts the first recommendation of the report in relation to the need to amend the language in Article 41.2 of the Constitution on the role of women in the home.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">Government is mindful that a number of wordings have been proposed previously and commits to examine the proposals and other options to find the most appropriate wording to present in a forthcoming referendum. Full account will be taken of the comments of the convention, including those on carers.</p>
          <p eId="para_279"> The inclusion of a reference by the convention to the issue of carers is the reason why it is not possible to offer a more specific timeframe for a referendum to take on board the overarching recommendation at this time. Extensive consultations will be necessary, including with Government colleagues and their officials, on the new elements and the appropriate choice of language for incorporation into the Constitution. I am establishing a task force in my Department to look at the issues, collaborating with other Departments and the Office of the Attorney General as necessary, with a view to completing the task and reporting back to Government by 31 October 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_280"> The second issue examined by the Convention on the Constitution was the encouragement of greater participation by women in public life and increasing their participation in politics. The convention report advises that the question of a constitutional provision for this purpose was narrowly defeated but that a significant majority of convention members recommended more government action in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_281"> Both the treaties of the European Union and the CEDAW convention, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, allow for temporary special measures to address deficits in gender equality. The Government accepts the recommendation of the convention that the Constitution should not be amended to address the role of women in political and public life. However, we are also aware that, despite some 40 years of equality legislation in Ireland, women are still significantly underrepresented in political life, in senior management and corporate governance roles. In all those fields, women's representational levels in Ireland are both below the EU average and the majority of other EU member states. In the published average data, which excluded Croatia, Ireland is ranked 24th out of 27 member states in relation to women's representation in the Lower House of Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_282"> On corporate boards, for which the Commission is currently proposing specific actions, we rank among the poorest in terms of female representation, at just over 8% for membership of the boards of top stock exchange companies. The EU average is close to 15% and the proposed EU target is 40% by 2020. However, we have as I mentioned a very well educated female work force. We know that women's representation on State boards is better at 34% but it has flat lined at that level for the past five or six years.</p>
          <p eId="para_283"> I remind the House that the programme for Government includes a commitment to increase the role of women in political life and in decision making. As Minister for Justice and Equality, I welcome the appointment by the Government, over the past two and a half years, of talented and skilled women to top positions, many in the area of law and justice, including our Attorney General, Máire Whelan; Chief Justice Susan Denham; the President of our District Court, Judge Rosemary Horgan; our Director of Public Prosecutions, Claire Loftus; and Deputy Garda Commissioner Noirín O'Sullivan.</p>
          <p eId="para_284"> Over the past two and a half years, 40% of appointments made to the Judiciary have been women and 60% have been men. On Wednesday next, two members of the High Court, Judges Mary Laffoy and Elizabeth Dunne, whose appointments have already been announced, will become judges of the Supreme Court. By this day week, there will have been four appointments by this Government to the Supreme Court of two men and two women, a gender balance of 50:50. It is also important to state that each appointment has been made on merit. The Government has sought to ensure that gender is not some subconscious invisible barrier which gets in the way of, or prevents, the appointment of talented and skilled women to important public positions and positions of leadership. At the time of my appointment as Minister for Justice and Equality and Minister for Defence, I believed it was important that we achieved a better gender balance in the courts. Huge progress has been made and at leadership level there is now complete gender equality in that two of our top judges, the President of the District Court and the Chief Justice, are women and two, the Presidents of the Circuit and High Court, are men.</p>
          <p eId="para_285"> A number of important initiatives have been completed or are ongoing and these will be built on throughout the life of this Government. Those include the all-party conference on women and politics hosted by my colleague, Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, on 30 January 2012. The event attracted more than 300 participants and fostered greater awareness of the issue and the challenges for political parties and the public. The conference heard from the political and administrative leaders of all the main political parties, including the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Deputies Martin and Mary Lou McDonald, together with the chairperson of the Green Party.</p>

          <from>Deputy Alan Shatter<recordedTime time="2013-10-10T11:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_287">Thank you. I was not told what the time limit was. I am happy to extend the time of the debate so that colleagues who want to contribute may do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_288"> It also heard the experiences of a number of serving politicians and words of wisdom and guidance from a number of international experts.</p>
          <p eId="para_289"> A further initiative is the amendment to the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Act in 2012 which requires political parties to include a quota of 30% women candidates at the next general election, rising to 40% at the following general election. Failure on the part of a political party to comply with this legislative provision will lead to a cut in State funding to parties. </p>
          <p eId="para_290"> Furthermore, a working group, chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is considering the matters in the context of the national women's strategy. The working group has been specifically addressing the advancement of women in leadership roles, including in politics, management, on boards and in the diplomatic and judicial systems. Its report will be completed shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_291"> A wide-ranging positive action programme will start later this year on women and leadership, which is being generously supported over two years by the European Social Fund PROGRESS initiative. The reiteration in the programme for Government that all State boards have at least 40% of each gender was backed up further in April 2011 when the Government decided that future vacancies on State boards would be advertised on the website of the relevant Department. I assure the House that the Government is fully committed to this ongoing work which, as I said, is linked to the aims in the programme for Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> I mentioned that the Convention on the Constitution voted on two further issues, which I will now comment on. The first was a recommendation, based on a majority of 62% of convention members that: "the Constitution should be amended to include an explicit provision on gender equality." Although the proposal has merit, and has links with the clauses in the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, it requires further examination. The Government has therefore asked the Department of Justice and Equality to initiate a review, in consultation with other Departments and the Office of the Attorney General as appropriate, with a view to bringing a reasoned response back to Government by 31 October 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_293"> Although there are complexities in formulating an appropriate constitutional amendment along the lines of that proposed by the Constitutional Convention, central to the convention's recommendation is the achievement of gender equality and giving equal recognition and importance to the role played by men and women in the home. While Article 41.2, in its original conception in 1937, was perceived as providing a form of constitutional protection for women, it not only failed to achieve that objective but became widely understood as exhorting women to remain in the home and discouraging them from engaging in the workforce. It was part of the philosophy that resulted in women in the public service being required to give up their employment upon marriage. The article also failed to provide any substantive benefit to women in the home or to extend to them any constitutional protections when they exclusively assumed home duties. This was starkly illustrated in a Supreme Court decision delivered in 1993 in a case entitled "In the matter of Article 26 of the Constitution and in the matter of The Matrimonial Home Bill, 1993" in which a Bill, the objective of which was to confer an automatic joint ownership interest in the family home on wives, was held to be unconstitutional as violating the property rights of husbands.</p>
          <p eId="para_294"> We are now in a new era with a greater and better understanding of the roles of both men and women within the home and in the wider community and of the equality of rights and obligations of both men and women. In drafting a new constitutional amendment it is crucial that we provide for a form of wording that reflects today's understandings in the context of today's Ireland and that it is a form of wording that has widespread public support. It also must be a form of wording that does not have unintended consequences and does not impose financial obligations on the State which would ultimately fall on taxpayers and which we cannot afford.</p>
          <p eId="para_295"> Whatever wording is ultimately adopted will apply, of course, to all citizens in the State and to all who reside in the State, to both long-standing communities and to our new communities. In this context it is appropriate to acknowledge the role being played by the new immigrant communities in the State, which include the many thousands who have joyously attended and participated in the many citizenship ceremonies held over the past two years. These communities come from many different states and embrace many different cultures and, in each of the ceremonies held, they have been encouraged to remain in touch with their own cultures while also embracing the culture of this State, its democratic values and to participate fully in their local communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">In the context of what we are discussing it is, of course, important that full participation extends to all men and women, and the road we are now travelling will be of relevance to all. It is, of course, central to the equality agenda that all men and all women have equal opportunities and the freedom to avail of those opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_297"> Including gender-inclusive language is the final issue I wish to address in the context of the Convention on the Constitution's proposals. A further issue on which the convention voted was whether the text of the Constitution should be amended to include gender-inclusive language. This motion attracted an overwhelming "Yes" vote, with 89% of the members voting to accept the proposal. The Government has considered this supplementary recommendation and notes the views of the convention and an earlier and similar view expressed by the UN CEDAW committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_298"> The Government is of the view that this proposal needs further consideration, not least because, if implemented, it may require extensive textual amendments to the Constitution. Accordingly, the Government has tasked the Department of Justice and Equality with undertaking a preliminary feasibility-scoping study before it considers the recommendation further. While the recommendations of the Convention on the Constitution are not at variance with the Government's thinking, its recommendations raise a number of complex matters which require further clarification and examination.</p>
          <p eId="para_299"> The European Union's economic policy strongly emphasises the need to increase female labour market participation further and has set an employment target of 75% for men and women across the EU by 2020. Due to our economic downturn, the Irish target is lower, but if it is to be achieved, it is essential that female labour market participation increases significantly in the coming years. The EU's gender equality policy places considerable emphasis on the sharing by men and women - fathers and mothers - of the caring responsibilities within the family, be it child care or elder care. Its policies also favour the advancement of women into decision-making roles in management and politics and on corporate and decision-making boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> To address fully the complexities of the modern economic world, we need to exploit fully the decision-making skills of both men and women. We know from an emerging body of research that collaborative decision-making - decision-making based on the collective use of male and female thinking - is the most successful decision-making. I have mentioned the work being carried out in my Department to advance this goal fully in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_301"> The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and I hosted a conference during our Presidency on the issues of women's economic engagement and work as decision-makers and on the EU's economic policy. We heard convincing arguments from the OECD, the European Commission, the European Parliament and a range of academics and senior managers of the economic case to support gender equality and the imperative to increase women's labour market participation to foster Europe's economic growth and competitiveness. We have a summary clip on our website, <i>www.genderequality.ie</i>, and will be publishing a report on the conference on the same website within a fortnight. This conference offers a clear statement of how the role of women has changed across Europe and, indeed, in Ireland. As a result, we need to ensure our Constitution adequately reflects the many roles which women play in Irish society. While we take these positive steps towards gender equality, I look forward to an Ireland of the future where these discussions will be viewed retrospectively with a sense of incredulity that they were ever necessary, the same sense of incredulity which today greets descriptions of the marriage bar which formerly required women to resign their positions in the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_302"> By way of conclusion, I thank the Convention on the Constitution for its constructive approach in its work on the issues relating to gender equality, in particular with regard to Article 41.2. I am promising to work through the wording issues and matters raised by the convention which require further detailed consideration within a year. I am very happy to hear the views of Members of this House on the specifics of how we proceed constructively in addressing these matters. In the interim, I can give the House the Government's tacit commitment to implement the key recommendation and to enhance further the role of women in our society. I conclude by thanking the Opposition for extending to me the extra time necessary to address these issues adequately.</p>

          <p eId="para_304">I am conscious that there are a number of people who will want to speak on this particularly important issue so we will try to help the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to get back on time. I thank the Minister for his response on behalf of Government. The very positive response of the Government will meet with political support from all sides of the House. The Minister has obviously given the matter very serious consideration, on which we commend him.</p>
          <p eId="para_305"> The second report of the Convention on the Constitution related to amending Article 41.2 of the Constitution relating to the role of women in the home. The convention was also charged with encouraging the greater participation of women in public life and increasing the participation of women in politics. In respect of women's participation in politics, the task given was quite a tall order.</p>
          <p eId="para_306"> I will begin by paying tribute to the continuing manner in which the convention is being organised. Tom Arnold as chairman, Art O'Leary as secretary, the panel of advisers headed by Professor David Farrell and their entire team are doing a superb job. Many of us had some doubts at the start of the convention as to whether it would be possible to maintain the level of public interest and the level of participation by members of the public and politicians in the process. However, the manner in which it has been organised and the parity of esteem which is obvious for members of the public and political representatives has ensured that, to date, the convention has been a great success. I might argue that, politically, the challenges given to the convention were much less ambitious than they might have been. Most recently, the convention has come back looking for some additional time from the Houses to consider other matters. Let us hope that the work can be continued because, even in the early stages of the convention, some additional matters have been identified by the membership that will need careful consideration. I also pay tribute to the citizen members because they have shown huge commitment to the project. It has not been easy for people to come from every corner of the country to participate in this initiative, but they have done so not just willingly but enthusiastically. That is something that needs to be commented on continually and lauded.</p>
          <p eId="para_307"> I will be forgiven for expressing my view that the direct participation of politicians in the convention process, particularly when it comes to voting on the critical issues before the convention, may not be a good thing. I am convinced that when we go to vote, we as politicians - the 33 of us - can skew the results. I suspect we get a different result, albeit that everybody is participating with goodwill and trying in many instances to leave our political baggage outside the door of the convention. Whereas the participation of politics and politicians in the process by way of an advisory panel is highly desirable and indeed essential, participation in the actual voting process, where we are among the group of 100, gives a different result than the result that would be forthcoming were the convention to be made up simply of members of the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_308"> In terms of amending Article 41.2 to recognise the role of carers, not just women in the home, we, of course, give enthusiastic support to that measure. It recognises the huge changes in society in recent years. I was struck by some of the statistics that are available in this area, such as that 55% of women are in employment. In his contribution, the Minister spoke about the efforts that have been made in recent years to encourage greater participation of women in the workforce. I see how, in many households in my constituency, it is the woman who is still at work.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">In particular, those who have a background in construction and now find themselves unemployed recognise and value the significant contribution a woman can make as breadwinner.</p>
          <p eId="para_310"> The convention also considered the importance of care giving. Some 61% of carers are women and 86% of child care is carried out by women. As men, we are humbled by those figures and we should ask ourselves whether we have a challenge and a task in regard to moving into these roles. As the father of three daughters, I regularly argue that women are more instinctively disposed towards care giving but we also have responsibilities as men. I believe we will see men taking on a bigger role in this regard in the future. It is, therefore, high time that we amend Article 41.2 of the Constitution to recognise what has happened to date and what will happen to a much greater extent in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_311"> The convention was also charged with examining the role of women in public life. The Minister referred to the role of women on the boards of semi-State companies. We should also investigate third level institutions, where women vastly outnumber men in a range of faculties where men previously dominated. Women comprise more than 80% of teaching students. Many schools around the country are actively seeking young male teachers to offer male role models to students. This is also true of other areas, such as medicine, veterinary studies, law and business. This is a positive development.</p>
          <p eId="para_312"> I have previously discussed with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and his predecessors the level of involvement of women in local government. Sadly, women occupy only a limited number of senior posts in local government even though they are heavily represented at lower levels. When it comes to roles such as director of services or county manager, we do not have the level of participation I would expect. Earlier this week I tabled a question to the Minister, Deputy Hogan, about initiatives in his Department to encourage greater participation of women at management levels. The response I received referred to the initiative he had taken to encourage greater political participation, on which I commend him, but had little meaningful to say about what is being done to ensure that women take up management positions in local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_313"> This brings me to the issue of politics. One of the most interesting issues we debated during this session of the convention was the challenge we face in this regard. Males comprise 85% of the membership of this Dáil. Only 91 women have been elected to the Dáil since the foundation of the State. There was a significant improvement between 1977 and 1992, when the ratio increased from 4% to 12%, but there has been little change since then. I am highly conscious of the fact that I am speaking as a member of an all-male 19-Member team. It is a matter of acute embarrassment to Fianna Fáil that we do not have female Deputies, although two fine women represent us in the Seanad. We have committed to actively seek out women to contest seats in the local elections and the next general election.</p>

          <p eId="para_320">The Acting Chair, Deputy Mathews, is fastidious in how he does his job.</p>
          <p eId="para_321"> Massively greater female participation in politics should be at the heart of the reform process. It will take the wisdom of Solomon to achieve that objective but even in terms of current initiatives to reform this House, we should ask ourselves the extent to which we are recognising the need to pursue family friendly policies. I am not sure whether sitting until 5 a.m. is likely to be attractive to women, notwithstanding that the mother should not have to be the one who goes home to look after the children. When we consider greater numbers of sittings or pursue a policy that is focused on more time rather than more effective use of time, are we encouraging the participation of women? Fianna Fáil has established a group that is working assiduously under Senator Power to investigate, with some success, how we can encourage more people to become involved in our organisation. So poor is our performance on this issue that far fewer women are involved in politics than should be the case. The Minister said we are 24th in Europe although I thought we were 23rd. Many would argue that if we had more women Members when times were particularly difficult, we would have made different decisions. We might have anticipated some of the problems that were coming downstream. We should consider an all-party approach to encouraging the participation of women in all our political groupings and none - I am conscious that Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan is in the Chamber. Perhaps we are seeing an increasing number of people being attracted to the Independent political way of life, but that poses a challenge to the political parties to examine what we are doing and see how we can do our business better and more effectively and attract women to get involved. The body politic and the country as a whole would benefit enormously from increased participation of women.</p>

          <p eId="para_325">I will only be approximately ten minutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_326"> The rightful position of women in Irish society is as equals in every way. The 1937 Constitution should be amended to entrench unambiguously women's equality in all aspects of life as part of a comprehensive bill or charter of rights. Constitutional recognition should also be given to the unquestionable economic and social value of unpaid domestic, agricultural and care work. This should be gender neutral, encompassing in particular care of children, the elderly and people with disabilities. It should be complemented by constitutional protections for economic and social rights in a bill or charter of rights, including the equal rights to work and to an adequate standard of living.</p>
          <p eId="para_327"> Despite the fact that the likes of Mrs. Justice Denham and others have interpreted the real function of Article 41.2 as being to recognise unpaid care work and that it can be construed as gender neutral in a modern context, for avoidance of doubt it would be preferable if this clause was removed in favour of robust and comprehensive equality guarantees for women in the context of a bill or charter of rights. Removal or amendment of the clause is not enough. Women need unambiguous constitutional guarantees to enable them to hold the State accountable under law for all violations of our equal rights, be those through actions or failures to act such as in the case of the Magdalen women, the death of Savita Halappanavar, the one in five women who experiences domestic violence and the one in four women who experiences sexual violence or other sexual abuse in her lifetime.</p>
          <p eId="para_328"> If unpaid care work is to be constitutionally recognised for its economic and social contribution to the life of the State, it should be done by way of a gender-neutral clause recognising all such work, including by men. This work should no longer be, and is no longer, the exclusive domain of women. The increasing contribution of men should be encouraged and recognised as necessary to women's equality as well as to the overall quality of Irish life.</p>
          <p eId="para_329"> This latter proposal is in keeping with the recommendations made by the Constitutional Review Group, CRG, and the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution, as well as the UN Human Rights Committee, the Irish Human Rights Commission - to bring it into line with Ireland's equality obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and with the Convention to Eliminate All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, respectively - and most of the civil society submissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_330"> The Constitution should guarantee women's equal representation and equal access to participation in public life, particularly in public leadership and management roles. As one way of implementing this guarantee, our party supports the introduction of gender quotas as a special temporary measure to accelerate the equal - at least 50% - representation of women in the Parliament, the Executive, local councils, the European Parliament, the European Commission, the Judiciary, State boards, semi-State and other statutory public bodies and any other organisation that is in receipt of public funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_331"> We support such quotas with a view to their earliest possible obsolescence as such equal representation becomes normalised and entrenched. Gender targets could be incrementally phased in, for example, starting on a 30% or 40% basis if necessary, but the ultimate goal is a 50:50 gender balance within short order.</p>
          <p eId="para_332"> One of the advices to which I have always been drawn is that an economy should serve society, not <i>vice versa</i>. I am mindful of a superb lecture that I attended given by Professor Kathleen Lynch, who champions the cause of equality. I was concerned about quotas simply papering over the cracks, in that they would not make institutions and politics amenable to women. Professor Lynch pointed out that, if we considered the care provided to our elderly, our children and people who are failed by those of us in politics, even if that was not our intent, women were at the heart of those caring situations. If we want to deliver for the elderly and, in particular, the disabled in terms of their rights, their entitlements, education and the caring issues that we somehow fail on, we need more women because they live that life and know that reality. I remember being struck during the lecture that this was why we needed quotas and to include more women as soon as possible. The meeting of such targets must be subject to strict deadlines with appropriate penalties attached.</p>
          <p eId="para_333"> Regarding constitutional measures, we can support the introduction of 50:50 gender quotas for political party nominations for all elections and ministerial appointments, as well as for judicial nominations and appointments to State and semi-State boards of management and to the boards of other statutory bodies and those in receipt of public funding. Gender quotas for elections should be met by way of a list system. However, if supported by appropriate and sufficient general constitutional guarantees of equality, equal representation and access, such quotas could also be introduced by way of ordinary legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_334"> As my party has supported affirmative action measures to achieve equal representation of Northern Nationalists, we believe that consideration should also be given to whether there should be constitutional commitments to increasing diversity and representation in public life through affirmative action measures for under-represented groups, for example, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities such as Travellers and people from Ireland's new communities. The quotas that Sinn Féin has implemented work. The highly capable women of our party are coming out of their backroom roles where they were and still are concentrated. This corroborates the strong evidence from other jurisdictions that experienced rapid increases from low bases and where women's representation is highest.</p>
          <p eId="para_335"> Claims are made regarding evidence of lower corruption where women's representation is higher. These claims are correct. If true, this could be of significant benefit to society and politics more generally. Increased women's participation in electoral contests could raise the overall quality of representation by widening the candidate pool. This could also help redress a notable problem in politics, leading to improved decision making.</p>
          <p eId="para_336"> I would also ask that the convention consider, under item No. 9, provisions to diversify political life further and to increase representation of minorities, for example, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities, such as Travellers and the new Irish. Our party has submitted a proposal to the constitutional convention, entitled "A Bill of Rights Amendment", calling for provisions to be more properly contained within a comprehensive and robust bill or charter of rights. This could be considered under the open remit of item No. 9. A bill of rights is an outstanding commitment under the Good Friday Agreement that must be honoured. Perhaps the likes of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, or the Irish Congress of Trade Unions could preside over a debate on how to clarify the rights of citizens in the Constitution for advocates and citizens instead of leaving it to Supreme Court justices to interpret.</p>
          <p eId="para_337"> I will briefly address some of the initiatives that Sinn Féin has taken to ensure gender equality within our party. Its objective is to reach 50:50 representation of women and men among our membership, leadership and elected representatives. I am proud to say that our party constitution commits us to gender quotas with respect to our internal leadership. We have a policy of incrementally increasing quotas for women candidates at all levels of public office, starting with a target of 30% and increasing to 50% as soon as practicable. To increase the immediate representation of women and the likelihood of re-election through incumbency, we have adopted a policy that all seat co-options should be to women until such time as the 50% target is met.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">In the Assembly we have adopted a practice of gender equality in ministerial appointments. We have also increased our female general membership to nearly 30% and will be adopting a plan to pursue further increases in the participation of women in Sinn Féin.</p>
          <p eId="para_339"> I welcome the outcome of the convention's deliberations on this topic. I am glad that in 2013 we are moving towards removing the archaic and outdated clauses within our Constitution. I wish the convention all the best for the remainder of its time.</p>

          <p eId="para_340">Ar an chéad dul síos, ba mhaith liom an coinbhinsún a mholadh de réir an méid oibre atá á dheanamh aige ón tús.</p>
          <p eId="para_341"> I have been critical of some of the topics chosen, or not chosen, and the length of time allocated for some topics. I still cannot understand why the Seanad question went to a referendum first and did not go to the convention. That would have been the logical, common sense approach, particularly as the convention was discussing electoral reform - a topic we had over two weekends. The convention would have been the ideal place to begin that debate. Notwithstanding all of that, the Constitutional Convention has been working well.</p>
          <p eId="para_342"> Constitutions have to decide on and reflect the values of society. Overall, our Constitution does contain much that is good. It is democratic and guarantees freedom, equality and justice for citizens. It may not always have been interpreted that way, however, for the good of all citizens. Some citizens have been badly served by the Constitution, including homosexuals and people with mental health issues. I am conscious that today is world mental health day and there are people with mental health issues in our society whose rights are not respected. </p>
          <p eId="para_343"> Overall, however, we have been fortunate that the Constitution did build on the Proclamation of 1916 to which equality was central. Deputy Catherine Murphy and I are the two Independent Deputies on the convention and we have a 100% attendance record. Continuity and consistency in attendance is important. </p>
          <p eId="para_344"> We cannot discuss the convention without acknowledging the work of the officials, including the chairman and other staff, before, during and after it. I acknowledge in particular their work with the wording of the ballot papers, which has been problematic. The discussions have been open and frank but I still think the plenaries are top heavy with political contributions. The round-table discussions, however, do ensure that everyone has a voice. The feedback signifies that everyone feels their view is respected and heeded, and that no one dominates the round-table discussions. </p>
          <p eId="para_345"> The February session of the convention was about amending the clause on the role of women in the home, encouraging their greater participation in public life and increasing their participation in politics. Were changes to the Constitution necessary in this regard? Article 40.1 suggests gender equality because it states: "All citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law."</p>
          <p eId="para_346"> Article 16.1.1o states: "Every citizen without distinction of sex who has reached the age of twenty-one years, and who is not placed under disability or incapacity by this Constitution or by law, shall be eligible for membership of Dáil Éireann." There is a general consensus about gender equality, but is that enough? There is also the recognition of a special role for the family in Article 41.1.1o, which refers to the family as "the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society". Article 41.1.2o refers to the family as "the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State".</p>
          <p eId="para_347"> Article 41.2.1o states: "In particular, the State recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved." Article 41.2.2o states: "The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home." I am not too sure why that Article has not been challenged, particularly in times of austerity. </p>
          <p eId="para_348"> All the papers presented at the convention were interesting but one in particular, by Professor Gerry Whyte from the Trinity College School of Law, gave examples where Article 41 featured in litigation in regard to gender discrimination and recognising work done in the home. In some cases the article was used to support preferential treatment for deserted wives and not to justify the exemption of women from jury service. It was not interpreted as allowing discrimination against widowers concerning their eligibility to adopt. </p>
          <p eId="para_349"> I liked Chief Justice Denham's observation when she said that Article 41.2 does not assign women to a domestic role, but recognises the significant role played by wives and mothers in the home. That does not mean to exclude them from other activities, but it is really about recognising that the work women do in the home is of immense benefit to society.</p>
          <p eId="para_350"> Mr. Justice Murray presented an interesting paper on this article which covered fathers. He sees that the Constitution implicitly recognises, similarly, the value of a man's contribution in the home as a parent. One wonders therefore if there is a need for change. There have been various reports, some of which have suggested deleting Article 41.2. Subsequent reports called for modification, while another report sought the Constitution to recognise the significant contribution of both males and females caring for children and elderly relatives. Some wanted to retain Article 41.2 but in a revised, gender-neutral form.</p>
          <p eId="para_351"> All of that debate was going on before the Constitutional Convention, and it continued at the convention. There is no doubt that the sections on women and the family do come from an older traditional view of the family - the male and female married with children. However, we know that Ireland has seen a massive change in terms of the family. We have different relationships now, including lone parents, grandparents <i>in loco parentis</i>, and same-sex partner families. Another dynamic is the changing nature of society with stay-at-home fathers and those who care for dependants, other than children, in the home. That also formed part of the discussions at the convention. </p>
          <p eId="para_352"> We know what the convention came up with last February. One point that emerged is that changes concerning women must also take account of changes to the definition of the family. Some 88% were against leaving the relevant article as it is. If it were to be changed, 88% wanted to amend or modify it. The vast majority, 98%, wanted to make it gender neutral and acknowledge other carers in the home. There was a narrower margin for including carers beyond the home. We know of the debate about the wording including "endeavour to support" and "provide a reasonable level of support", but on average the convention as a whole favoured a reasonable level of State support. </p>
          <p eId="para_353"> There were interesting results on the aspect of increasing women's participation in politics. The main one that stood out for me was that the majority favoured non-constitutional methods and routes in order to increase participation by women in politics. They sought Government action but I do not really believe that Article 41.2 has prevented me, or any other woman, from doing whatever we wanted to do in terms of a career or becoming involved in public life and politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_354"> Perhaps adding "she" to the language of the Constitution would be a start. However, there are certainly reasons, which have nothing to do with the Constitution, why more women are not involved in public life and politics. We know that girls tend to do better than boys in State examinations. We also know that women are the heart and lifeblood of communities. Women are predominantly involved in so many civil society groups and voluntary organisations. Why do women not progress into more senior levels of public life? Sometimes women would see it as regression, rather than progression.</p>
          <p eId="para_355"> We have had two female Presidents but not one female Taoiseach. The stark statistic is that 15% of Dáil candidates are women and 15% of Deputies are women. In the local elections the figure is 16%, which is not much better. The Dáil has never been less than 85% male, which might account for certain dysfunctional aspects and the length of time it takes to do things. The Westminster Parliament has seen the rate of participation by women increase from 9% to 22% and the French from 11% to 27%. I acknowledge that in the constituency of Dublin Central we have the perfect gender balance: two men and two women Deputies.</p>
          <p eId="para_356"> The suggestions from the Constitutional Convention are a way forward but in themselves will not bring about a greater participation of women in public and political life. Many reports have been done on the difficulties involved and child care is seen as being one. There are long unsocial hours involved in being a Deputy but I cannot understand why this is only related to women who are mothers and not to men who fathers. It is downgrading men and seems to imply that they have no role in rearing their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_357"> Research tells us that the greater the participation by women in parliament the lower the level of corruption. More women means a more consensual style of politics, rather than the current confrontational style. We know that parliament would be more consultative. The evidence is that women conduct politics in a more open and transparent way. </p>
          <p eId="para_358"> I am on record as being against quotas for women, while I accept that politics would be much better with more women involved. Women are significantly under represented but I do not see quotas as the way forward because then we would also have to examine having quotas for various age groups, socio-economic groups, certain jobs and professions, and our new communities who are not represented. </p>
          <p eId="para_359"> A mind-shift is required, particularly on the part of political parties, because there is no opposition to women standing as Independents.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">We know that currently most Deputies are male and that incumbents have a higher re-election rate. Will the parties sacrifice seats to give more woman an opportunity? While quotas were a factor in the increase in Rwanda, the increase in the number of women elected in the Scandinavian countries predated the introduction of quotas.</p>
          <p eId="para_361"> Amendment of the Constitution is only one step, although a significant one. I acknowledge the value of the work of the Constitutional Convention on this matter. However, it is important account is taken of the sections on the family. One of the groups, Women for Election, suggested a wording which the Minister might consider, namely, "That the State shall endeavour by appropriate means to promote equality in politics." </p>
          <p eId="para_362"> I acknowledge the commitments given by the Minister in his opening speech. The Constitutional Convention, which is to complete its work shortly, will discuss the issue of blasphemy at its November meeting. Consideration will then be given in the new year to the establishment of a further convention and possible topics for discussion. In this regard, many submissions and suggestions have already been received. I believe another Constitutional Convention should not be established until the issues, reports and recommendations of the current convention have been followed through in a significant and meaningful way. </p>
          <p eId="para_363"> I acknowledge what the Minister said earlier but I believe we must first deal with the issues addressed by the current Constitutional Convention before establishing another one.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor<recordedTime time="2013-10-10T12:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_364">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the second report of the Constitutional Convention on the role of women in the home, a matter of great importance to me and the vast majority of women throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_365"> I welcome the recommendations of the Constitutional Convention. I propose in my contribution to focus on the proposed amendment of Article 41.2o on the role of women in the home to include a gender neutral reference. Article 41.2.1o states: "In particular, the State recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved." Article 41.2.2o states: "The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home." The specific reference in Article 41.2.2o to the role of women in the home and to mothers' duties in the home has given rise to great criticism and opposition throughout the country. As a mother who has worked within and outside the home, I, too, am critical of it. I have the utmost respect for women who work full-time in the home. Similarly, I have the utmost respect for women who work full-time outside the home. I do not, however, respect the manner in which this Article pigeonholes women into one particular role, one that is dependant on A.N. Other. Gender roles have changed greatly in contemporary Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_366"> Article 41.2.2o enforces a sexist or stereotypical view of women. It does not give recognition to modern 21st century families or recognise that caring in the home is increasingly shared by mothers, fathers, grandparents and others. As aptly stated by Sheryl Sandberg, a leading advocate for the promotion of more women in the workplace, most people assume that women are responsible for households and child care. Most couples, not all, operate this way. This fundamental assumption holds women back. I would like to read into the record some significant statistics which illustrate how many women are engaging in labour outside the home. Currently, 47% or 975,000, people in employment are female, more than half of whom have children. Women who engage in labour outside the home should not be defined as neglecting their duties in the home. It is very unfair and unjust to place such a societal stigma on working women. Furthermore, Article 41.2.2o greatly reflects the influence of the Catholic social teaching of 1937. The contemporary Ireland of 2013 has changed utterly since then. An amended Article 41.2.2o should be reflective of an inclusive society, regardless of religion or gender.</p>
          <p eId="para_367"> This brings me to the recommendation that any change to Article 41.2.2o should be gender neutral and should refer to carers in the home and beyond it. I strongly welcome this recommendation. Care is a public good. It supports the maintenance of a cohesive society and the production of a healthy well-functioning citizenry and workers. As Joan Tronto reminds us, care is not a parochial concern of women, a type of secondary moral question or the work of the least well off in society rather it is a central concern of human life. Although research indicates that 61% of carers are women and that 86% of child care is provided by women, we should not be that narrow-minded as to allow our Constitution, a document that will guide generations to come, to exclusively define care as a female role.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> While the convention narrowly voted against a constitutional provision enhancing the participation of women in public life and politics, I strongly support its call to the Government to do more to enhance participation. Ireland currently ranks 25th among the 27 EU countries in terms of female representation. Currently, only 26 of our 166 elected representatives are female. On a global scale, Ireland ranks 89th in terms of female political representation, which is lower than Iraq and Afghanistan. Why, when women make up 50% of the population, should we allow decisions, some of which pertain directly and only to women, to be made by a group that is 84% male? </p>
          <p eId="para_369"> I welcome the gender quotas introduced by the Government which require the candidate selection process to field at least 30% female candidates in elections. This is a good start. I encourage all women to take on the role in politics that rightly belongs to them. Politics is no longer a man's game. I welcome the Minister's response to the report and look forward to progressing its recommendations.</p>

          <from>Deputy Robert Troy<recordedTime time="2013-10-10T12:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_370">Last Friday we witnessed the deep respect the Irish people have for the fundamental law of the land, the Irish Constitution. It was a shot across the bows of any cynical personal constitutional crusade and a timely reminder that it is the people who ultimately decide the rules by which we are governed. I hope that the Government does not draw the wrong lesson from the Seanad abolition debacle. It was a vote for real reform, not the <i>status quo</i>. There is a pressing and urgent demand for meaningful political reform in this country. Last week's vote reflected the fact that people want more than mere cosmetic tinkering and cynical stunts.</p>
          <p eId="para_371"> The economic crisis has exposed some of the profound institutional weaknesses in how we do politics in this country. However, the crisis also allows us an opportunity to focus on these problems, set out a new vision and improve matters. We must look at this juncture in history as an opportunity to set right the ship of State for future generations. Today's topic reflects one of the pressing areas that we need to address if we are to build a political system fit for purpose in 21st century Ireland. The chronic under-representation of women in public life and archaic language of the Constitution is a serious barrier to the kind of society we hope to achieve in a modern republic.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">The work of the Constitutional Convention is an important move towards addressing these issues. </p>
          <p eId="para_373"> To first address the role of the woman in the home, the gender specific language employed by the Constitution and its articles prescribing that a woman's role is in the home belong to a separate time and different Ireland. While it is easy now to be critical of outdated thinking, to do so is to fall into the old trap of reading history backwards. The past is a foreign country and we should be wary of projecting our values on it in too harsh a manner. The Constitution is a delicate balance of modern needs, tradition and precedents. The language in Article 41 no longer reflects such a balance as it fails to represent a modern Ireland. Against this backdrop, it must be amended.</p>
          <p eId="para_374"> As is captured in the essence of Article 41, the care provided in the home is the backbone of society. However, the provision of care and an active role in the home is not confined solely to women. I welcome steps to ensure the article will reflect gender neutral language and maintain the recognition of the role of a caring home as the invaluable basis for the common good. The Fianna Fáil Party concurs with the Constitutional Convention's findings in this regard and the viewpoint previously expressed by the Constitution Review Group report of 1996 that the Constitution should recognise the significant contribution made to society by the many people who care for children, elderly relatives and others in their homes. Amending Article 41 will reflect the deep value care gives to society, while upholding the founding values of the Republic, as echoed from the GPO when the Proclamation gave equal recognition to Irish men and women.</p>
          <p eId="para_375"> To address the second issue of encouraging greater female participation in public life, I am all too aware that my party failed to have any female Deputies elected in the previous election. It is worth reviewing the stark facts surrounding the gaping chasm in gender representation at the heart of Irish politics. Women account for only 15% of Dáil Deputies. While this is the best level of female representation in the history of the House, it marks an increase of only 5% in 35 years. Of our 43 constituencies, 21 did not elect a single female Deputy in 2011, largely as a result of a lack of female candidates on the ballot paper. Despite the use of multi-member constituencies, almost half of Irish women do not have a female Deputy in their constituency. Since the foundation of the State, the Dáil has never been less than 85% male. Progress was made between 1977 and 1992 when the percentage of female Deputies increased from 4% to 12%.</p>
          <p eId="para_376"> At local level, the story is similar, with women making up only 16% of elected local authority representatives, which represents an increase of just 1% in ten years. This is despite women comprising approximately one third of the membership of the main political parties. The National Women's Council estimates that at the current pace, it will take 370 years to achieve gender balance in Irish politics. Ireland has one of the worst rates of gender balance in its political institutions in the democratic world. We rank 23rd out of the 27 European Union countries and 78th in the world in terms of female representation in the lower house of parliament. The facts are striking and an indictment of our failure to achieve a representative democracy worthy of the name.</p>
          <p eId="para_377"> Before discussing constitutional change, it would be remiss of us to exclude the need for soft measures to enhance female participation levels. Tackling the issues of child care, cash, confidence, culture and candidate selection procedures, the so-called "five Cs" which create major barriers to female participation in politics, will involve coherent Government action across a number of areas. Constitutional change is only one part of a broader process that must involve family friendly working hours, improved child care provision and a cultural shift within political parties. Recognising our own failings, the Fianna Fáil Party launched a detailed policy document outlining proposals to confront the problem of gender equality within the party. The party system needs to recognise the scale and depth of the problem and outline actions to tackle it.</p>
          <p eId="para_378"> Hard legislative and constitutional measures such as gender quotas must strike a balance between democratic choice and directly incentivising greater levels of female engagement. While the linking of party funding to candidate levels was a welcome step in this direction, a direct constitutional article on gender quotas and Government action would not be appropriate. We welcome the Constitutional Convention's recommendation that gender equality be explicitly recognised in Article 40 of the Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_379"> It is important to bear in mind that advancing women's participation in politics requires a blend of soft cultural and hard legislative action. The Constitution should sustain this with a clear expression of our commitment to real gender equality.</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> I thank the participants in the Constitutional Convention for their thoughtful contribution over a range of topics to date. Their work and thoughtful reflections have been a major addition to the national discourse on reform. I hope the Government, in light of last Friday's rejection of the proposal to abolish the Seanad, will take the leash off the convention and allow it to discuss a wide range of topics. A constrained convention will not live up to its potential or the pressing need for deep, sustained and real political reform. I look forward to the Government engaging with these issues and taking action on them in the future.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Byrne<recordedTime time="2013-10-10T12:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_381">I commend the Convention on the Constitution on its hard work since it first met in December 2012. Thus far, the convention has dealt with a wide range of issues under the careful guidance of Mr. Tom Arnold and has made some interesting recommendations for the Oireachtas to consider. I also commend the many individuals, organisations and community groups who made well thought out submissions to the convention. It is great to see such enthusiastic engagement with the convention and its work.</p>
          <p eId="para_382"> The purpose of this debate is to discuss the recommendation by the convention to amend Article 41.2 of the Constitution, which provides that "the State recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved". It further provides that "the State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home". At its meeting on this issue in February last, 88% of members of the convention voted in favour of modifying rather than deleting Article 41. </p>
          <p eId="para_383"> The Constitutional Convention made clear proposals for change, with 98% of members voting in favour of making the article gender neutral and including other carers other in the home, while 62% voted in favour of changing the article to include carers beyond the home. As is recognised in the excellent submission of the Constitutional Convention, women have traditionally taken responsibility as the principal carer in the home. This role has traditionally been undervalued by the State and society. My mother spent much of her life working in the home, as did most women of her generation. This was the norm, one which was enshrined in the Constitution. Since then, however, the norm has been turned on its head as many women sought to continue their careers after having children. Nowadays, it is often more beneficial to a family to have a husband or partner stay at home and act as carer. These changes have accelerated in the economic downturn as many men who were previously the main breadwinners, including many who had worked in the construction industry, find themselves earning less than their wives due to cuts in payments or hours or without an income as a result of job losses. </p>
          <p eId="para_384"> As a society, we have been trying to find our feet since the changes brought about by the economic crash. The proposal to change Article 41.2 to make it gender neutral reflects the fact that men are the main carers in many homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">In our efforts to move with the times, however, we must not forget the enormously valuable contribution made to society by women through their work in the home over generations. These women and their work which can be valued as an economic contribution to the State, has been forgotten by the State. When the time comes for them to retire, many find themselves entitled only to a non-contributory pension despite having worked all their lives and made this economic contribution to the State. Those women have lost out financially because of their commitment to the family and to society.</p>
          <p eId="para_386"> I am pleased the proposed changes to the Constitution continue to protect the rights of mothers to work in the home and to be the principal carer if they wish. By making it gender-neutral it also reflects the way women are now continuing their careers outside of the home after having children. Women who wish to do this must be supported by the State. One area in which this is very important and relevant to us here is in politics. I also commend the convention on taking up this issue. Even though it did not recommend a change to the Constitution to place an obligation on the State to encourage women's participation in politics, there is a wish that this be done. The Government has taken the lead by introducing quotas. It is important to have more women in politics. Other speakers have already covered what I was going to say. Women in politics bring a balance and a sense of calm in times of despair.</p>
          <p eId="para_387"> The other very valuable aspect of the recommended change by the Convention on the Constitution is the way it will recognise the value of care in the wider sense to Irish society. This includes care of people with disabilities. It also, of course, includes care of elderly relatives undertaken by men and women. For example, I can speak of my two brothers. In the last few months of her life, my mother was supported and cared for by my two brothers - a care that was unconditional love. It allowed us to keep her at home and continue to mind her in a familiar, safe and secure environment, which is what she always wanted.</p>
          <p eId="para_388"> I was pleased to hear the Minister commit to working through the wording on gender quality and to further enhance the role of women in society in response to the work of the Convention on the Constitution. I support the work of the convention and the work that it is doing on behalf of all citizens of the State. I wish it well as it completes its work over the coming months. I wish the Minister well in ensuring that any proposed changes to the Constitution will be supported by the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_389">I have had the pleasure of being one of the two nominees from the Technical Group, along with Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, to the Convention on the Constitution. Both of us have been fortunate in being able to attend all the sessions so far, which is very helpful in getting a feel for, in particular, the citizen members. I made it my business to ask a number of the citizen members how they felt the convention was going and what they wanted to get out of it. They put in considerable time reading the material beforehand and taking the weekend to have an honest deliberation. The one thing they wanted was for note to be taken of the recommendations. They wanted it to mean something and result in referenda being put to the people on some if not all of the recommendations. There is a very important message in that. If there is to be a further successful constitutional convention we need to be able to show not just that it was a good method of deliberation on issues, but that there was an actual result in terms of putting carefully considered and thought out proposals to the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_390"> When I first looked at the list of issues we were to consider, I wondered why we were even considering this one. For my entire adult life I have felt it was an inappropriate provision in the Constitution because it shows a dependant-type approach to one gender. I felt there were meatier issues we could consider. I felt that if this was put to the people it was something that they would feel needed to be changed. However, it opened up the debate on the role of care, irrespective of the gender of the care-giver. Recognising that is valuable in itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_391"> Most of us feel that people should have the choice to go to work and in particular when they have very young children they should have the choice to stay at home. This means that Government policy must more or less assist, regardless of whether the care-giver is male or female. The workforce now contains a very high number of women. An issue that constantly comes up is that of affordable child care. It will not go away if women are going to continue to play a full and active part in the workforce. They are very often required to work because many young families have big mortgages making it a necessity for both parties in a relationship to work. We also have a large number of lone parents. There is considerable evidence that those parenting alone suffer poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_392"> Sweden has made a consistent effort to encourage women to participate in politics. While it is laudable to change how politics is funded to encourage women into active politics, it is important that we do it at local government level, which is an important entry route. I support quotas because I believe that nothing else will work. When people talk about quotas for women, it is almost invariably said that they are lesser candidates because they have been selected by way of a quota. It is interesting that we are prepared to take 85% male representation and if we consider that there is equal intelligence between the genders it means that we are actually losing out on a contribution that could be made, even from the point of view of the level of intelligence, life experiences and different ways of looking at things.</p>
          <p eId="para_393"> We are not just discussing representative politics, but also how we can involve more women in decision making. The Government made a commitment that it expected to have 40% of women on State boards. I tabled a series of parliamentary questions on the matter and Mary Regan published an article in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> with a breakdown by Department. That number has been exceeded in Departments like the Departments of Health, and Children and Youth Affairs, or in areas with boards related to those Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">However, there is underperformance in respect of the targets in places like the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and there is a direct relationship with the outcomes for the Department of Health and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. It is vital we start to see that gap close, especially in the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, because they have a direct bearing on the quality of the provision that can be made from the other Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_395"> At the time the 1937 Constitution was framed, the backdrop was different. Many of its provisions are rather progressive when one considers what was happening in Europe at the time. I had thought that most of the provisions around the family had been more or less insisted on by the Roman Catholic Church or the hierarchy at least. Only when I participated in the Commission on the Family some years ago did I acquire a fuller understanding of how what was happening elsewhere in Europe served as a backdrop to how the Constitution was framed, and I was rather surprised by that.</p>
          <p eId="para_396"> I return to the point I made at the beginning. Before we embark on another constitutional convention or an expansion of this convention, it is important to finish the work of this one and ensure it results in the appropriate questions being put to the people in order that we make the changes that have been recommended.</p>

          <from>Deputy Clare Daly<recordedTime time="2013-10-10T13:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_397">I thank the Acting Chairman for the offer of extra time. I might take a little of it but I noticed the Minister was a little touchy yesterday during the criminal justice debate and I have no wish to delay him from his lunch. Therefore, I will try to be as brief as I can.</p>
          <p eId="para_398"> While listening to the debate from my office earlier, I heard a good deal of commentary from the Government benches which I can only describe as patronising claptrap. I am unsure how many women from Darndale or Moyross are on the Constitutional Convention but I imagine not too many. There is a whopping discrepancy between the lofty aspirations we are hearing from the Government benches and the reality for women as a result of the consistent cutbacks the Government has embarked upon. We have seen evidence presented in study after study showing that the brunt of the Government's cutbacks have fallen on the shoulders of women. How can women possibly participate in public life when they bear the burden of the most expensive child care in Europe, when they work in a scenario whereby their wages are still less than 80% of those of men, when older women are more at risk of poverty than older men and so on? I will not bore the Deputies with the details; the information has been well-flagged and highlighted. We must have a sense of proportion and consider this in reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_399"> There is a huge gulf between equality and reality when the Government is pursuing a policy of austerity that disproportionately affects women and that, in fact, exacerbates inequality. As long as these issues are not tackled, we can have all the aspiration we like but it will make no difference. Like other Deputies, I imagine, I receive calls every week from women who cannot get rented accommodation because landlords will not take rent allowance, from women whose partners have left, perhaps, who are struggling with a mortgage they cannot pay and who have to deal with the children and all the other pressures that come to bear. First and foremost, we must put the issue in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_400"> Let us consider Article 41.1.1º and Article 41.1.2º. I believe these should be removed and that is what we should be looking at. I note the comments made by the Constitutional Convention linking them to the issues of carers and so on, but that is being somewhat politically correct or trying making it gender-neutral. That is a separate issue. Let us be clear: the intention of Article 41.1.1º and Article 41.1.2º was to limit the role of women and mothers in society. That is what they were designed for. They should never have been included in the first place and we should take this opportunity to get rid of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_401"> I reject the idea that Article 41 reflected a more conservative time. I simply do not believe that is true. We have seen the commemorations under way at the moment for the Lock-out and the phenomenal role played by women workers, in particular laundry workers, and so on in the Lock-out and the struggle for independence. It is clear that women played a very real part in the struggle. In 1922, a great many rights for women were enshrined in the Constitution. We know that Countess Markievicz was one of the first female Ministers anywhere in the world. It was not the case that women fought for their rights, which of course they did, but that there was an unusual situation in Ireland whereby many of the rights which women had in the early years of the State were subsequently rolled back on and taken away by successive Government legislation. This is evident from measures such as married women being banned from working as teachers, that ban being expanded into the Civil Service subsequently, the prohibition on women serving on juries and the situation whereby the Minister had the power to restrict the number of women working in certain industries and so on. That was a conscious process by the State that culminated in the Constitution of 1937, which firmly put women in the home. At the time, the newspapers reported that the reason for this was the Government of the day wanted to ensure women would not be wrenched from the bosom of their families, from their cherished household duties and from the preparation of their husbands' dinners. Clearly that was written by people who never had to wash clothes in cold water, try to keep a tenement clean or keep their children fed when there was no money to go around. That view was rooted in an ideology which did not see women as citizens but was, in part, more about keeping women out of public life.</p>
          <p eId="para_402"> True equality means the recognition of difference. Women are clearly different from men, most particularly in the area of reproduction and so on. Therefore, supporting children and mothers is a key road to follow in dealing with equality. While dealing with these issues economically is the most positive step forward, as a signal and an ideological statement, the removal of these provisions from the Constitution would be a far greater step in the direction of egalitarianism, recognising people as citizens and recognising that the nature of the family and home life has changed forever. We should support people to enable them to be economically independent and to live the lives they choose in whatever family formation best suits their needs.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Alan Shatter)<recordedTime time="2013-10-10T13:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_403">I thank everyone who has contributed to this very interesting debate, for the contributions made, for some of the constructive suggestions that have come forth and for what, I believe, has been an important debate. I am grateful to have this opportunity on behalf of the Government to respond to the Second Report of the Convention on the Constitution. I stated at the start and I repeat now my thanks to all those participating in the convention, including the members of the public and the political members, for their work and participation, all those providing background support, and, of course, the chairman, Tom Arnold, who did such a good job.</p>
          <p eId="para_404"> I have listened with interest to the various contributions. As I said at the start of the debate, the Government welcomes the convention's report. We continue to be encouraged by the wholehearted engagement of the participants in the process. I note Deputy Ó Feargháil mentioned his party's original doubts and cynicism surrounding the value of the convention. I am pleased that he now recognises it is playing an important role and those participating in it and giving of their time are making valuable contributions. All the Deputies who spoke in the debate have acknowledged the sterling work done by the Constitutional Convention to date. It is particularly important to have citizens or individuals not elected to the Parliament and who are not part of some specialised elite working and engaging constructively with parliamentarians in the exercise of parliamentary democracy. All too frequently, those who contribute to the work of committees in the Houses and whose contributions are very welcome come from one stratum of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">They are perceived as specialists in their areas and while their levels of expertise are of huge value, people who do not have recognised specialties are not given an opportunity to contribute. The convention has provided such an opportunity and I believe its model could provide a useful blueprint for bringing about greater public participation in public decision-making in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_406"> Many Deputies made valid suggestions and offered ideas, which will contribute further to the debate on the convention's recommendations on advancing the role of women in public and political life. I invite all those who made contributions today, including the political parties represented in this House on the Opposition side, individual Deputies, Independent Members and Deputies right across the board, to contribute to the process in which the Government is engaged. If there are specific proposals they wish to make as to the content of an article that might implement the convention's views or which might contribute towards the deliberations on the appropriate replacement for Article 41.2, I would invite such a contribution. Moreover, my Department and the committee that is being established would greatly welcome that.</p>
          <p eId="para_407"> In inviting such contributions, however, I ask Members to have regard to the financial realities of the State. When eliminating an article or, rather, when putting to the people a proposal for the removal of an article that, as I stated earlier, clearly has proven to be of no benefit to women, that sought to label women as primarily having a role solely in the home and which was part of a philosophy that gave birth to the marriage bar on women working in the public service, consideration must be given to how to provide something that is appropriate, gender neutral and non-discriminatory but which also does not impose costs on the State and on taxpayers that the State cannot afford at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_408"> If the article is to be replaced by something appropriate, it must be replaced by a proposal that will receive substantial support by referendum from the people. This is the challenge with which the Government is confronted, in that it has from the convention a recommendation of change but not the proposal as to what might be the wording with regard to that change. There is a diversity of ideas in this area. Much of the work that has been done in this area has focused on the equality between men and women in the home, as opposed to one or other having a special role. While there have been suggestions about recognising the special role of parents in the home, from my recollection and from my academic writings in this area in years past, there has not been a proposal for a provision that would incorporate in full what is recommended and suggested by the convention in effectively extending it not simply to men and women in equality but to all carers, as well as to carers outside the home who provide caring. The issue of how that could be done, how meaningful it would be and what financial implications it might have is a matter of great complexity.</p>
          <p eId="para_409"> The terms of reference given to the convention indicated it effectively was asked to consider the current article and what change might be made to it. It was not part of the convention's remit expressly to propose that it simply be removed from the Constitution, which is another possibility, albeit not a proposal that has been made to the Government. However, as someone who has worked over the years in the areas of constitutional law and family law, I note there is an interesting legal issue surrounding whether its simple removal is another objective, bearing in mind the provisions to ensure equality between men and women in Article 40 of the Constitution. Consequently, there are very interesting and difficult legal issues in giving effect to a proposal for change and for removal of a provision that reflects a philosophy of the 1930s, which imbued Irish society for the following decades. Many years ago, I wrote about this particular article and personally I always have regarded it as inappropriate, as not in the interests of women and as effectively consigning women solely to a role in the home without actually ensuring any financial protections for women in that role. Consequently, while I am pleased the Government has the recommendation from the convention, it is so broad that there are substantial complex issues to be addressed as to how to proceed on foot of that recommendation. In this context, I repeat my invitation to go beyond today's debate to Members of the House who might give further consideration to this in the coming months and to what an appropriate alternative might be to the content of the current Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_410"> It is my objective to ensure that both the House and the Government approach the convention's recommendations with a positive mindset. I believe Deputy Catherine Murphy stated - she will correct me if I am wrong - that before the convention is asked to do any further work, the Government should get on with implementing or responding appropriately to recommendations made by the convention. I believe any fair-minded person who considered the manner in which the Government has approached the first and second reports would regard it as having treated the reports with great seriousness and as advancing matters along the road proposed by the convention. The Government also will regard all further reports with seriousness. It never was an objective to create a situation in which a group of people would meet over weekends to do serious work and to engage in serious deliberations and for the Government then simply to ignore what they had to say and to consign their reports to gather dust on shelves. One reason there was a self-imposed obligation by the Government to respond to reports within a specific time in this House was to ensure this did not and could not occur, and I can give every assurance it will not occur.</p>
          <p eId="para_411"> In the context of some references made to the role of women in politics, unlike Deputy Ó Fearghaíl who spoke in a positive manner, Deputy Troy could not resist the temptation to give the Government side a kick, arising out of the previous referendum held over the weekend. In the context of that referendum, I note the Government fulfilled its commitment to put the issue to the people. The people made a decision and that decision is respected. In the context of any referendum that may be held arising out of the different proposals coming from the convention, it will be a question of a proposal being put to the people, who will make their decision. However, in the context of any proposals that derive from the recommendations of the convention, it is important that they be given time to be developed where there has not been a specific proposal. Even where a specific constitutional article has been proposed, or variants of particular articles, as has already arisen in one report, there will be a need to give it careful consideration to ensure it will fulfil the objectives intended, that it will be understood by the people in a referendum and that the people be given an adequate opportunity to understand what is being proposed and to debate it.</p>
          <p eId="para_412"> I am proud that the parties in government are meeting their obligations and promises in this area. Personally, as someone who has favoured constitutional reform in a number of areas, I regard the work of the convention as very exciting. It is opening up doors that in some areas have been closed and is prioritising some issues, at the request of the Government, that often get put on the back-burner because other issues are perceived to be more urgent. I reiterate that I very much welcome what is being done in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_413"> In the context of references to the impetus to increase women's participation in politics, it is fair to state that all parties and all party leaders made a significant contribution to the debate that took place at the conference organised last year by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">I have already outlined many of the positive actions, and I will not repeat them, taken by the Government to foster gender equality since taking office two and half years ago. I never expect Deputy Clare Daly to acknowledge anything positive done or achieved by Government. It is rather unfortunate that she was the only Member of this House who descended simply to abusing some of those who contributed to today's debate. I reject, in its entirety, her inappropriate comment that Members on this side of the House, in their contributions to this debate, were engaged in patronising claptrap. This is an issue we take seriously. It would be good if when making her contribution in this House she could restrain herself, on occasion, from engaging in unnecessary personal abuse which only devalues the substance of what else she has to say.</p>
          <p eId="para_415"> I referred previously to our EU Presidency conference on the topic of women in the workforce at which the OECD argued strongly that all EU member states, including Ireland, need to increase female labour market participation to stimulate economic growth. EU Employment Commissioner Andor also stressed the importance of addressing gender equality at the same conference and for much the same reasons. This is something that I and the Government fully support and recognise. The further advancement of women in the workforce is not an issue that can be dealt with in isolation. It is part and parcel of the focus of Government to get people back to work. We have more than 400,000 unemployed in this country and while the number unemployed is reducing it is still substantial. Greater female participation in the workforce is inextricably connected with the growth of jobs in this country and what the Government can do to stimulate jobs being created by the private sector and to ensure the barriers that may exist for women in the workforce are addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_416"> I want to acknowledge what was said about certain local government matters. I personally find it extraordinary that so few women are in top positions in the administration side of local government. The overwhelming majority of county managers are men and I do not know the reason for that. In the context of the huge numbers of women who are involved in the administration of local government in the different sections of local authorities across this country, I do not know the reason there is this male dominance. In terms of the equality side of my brief, that is an issue on which I will have a conversation with my colleague, Deputy Phil Hogan, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, who I know would have a concern in this respect. That is a stark anomaly. I do not know if it is to do with the system used to make appointments in the context of the interview boards that are formulated but it is particularly odd at this stage that this remains the position. It is an issue that I, as Minister with responsibility for equality, would like to see addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_417"> I thank Deputies Ó Fearghaíl, Mac Lochlainn, Maureen O'Sullivan, Mitchell O'Connor, Troy, Catherine Byrne, Catherine Murphy and Clare Daly for the contributions made on an important issue which is one we are addressing as part of our agenda for change to bring the institutions in this State, the Constitution of this State and the manner in which government is conducted in this State fully and totally into the 21st century, but when it comes to constitutional change at the end of the day it is the people who are the final arbiters. I hope the discussion we have had today on the very interesting report made by the convention will lead to further public discourse and discussion over the next 12 months. I look forward to bringing to government by the end of October next year the results of the workings of the groups that are being formed and again to come before the House on those matters. I also look forward to any further substantive submissions that any Member of this House or any individual outside it may wish to make to contribute to the process.</p>

          <p eId="para_419">I hope I am continuing at the right point because I am not sure where I finished the last day. Therefore, if I read a point twice into the record the Members will understand.</p>
          <p eId="para_420"> Perhaps the wording of section 6 is too vague and might be open to arbitrary compulsory purchases without the need to prove there is a public interest in doing so. Perhaps that section requires amendment to make more precise the circumstances under which a compulsory purchase might be made. We certainly do not want to have situations where for example land might be subject to a compulsory purchase order so that it could be then sold on to a commercial interest, as happened in the case of Bellanaboy, and as people have expressed concern in relation to wind farms. I do not believe there can be too much objection to the Minister having an input into forestry plans, as proposed in section 6(<i>b</i>) as there needs to be control over the manner in which forests in private ownership are used. However, there is perhaps scope for greater consultation between the Department and private owners in the framing of such plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> As part of a plan to extract more value from the forests with a view to expanding the overall sector, perhaps it might be an idea to hold a consultation with private owners in order to find out how individual plans for the use of the forests might be co-ordinated with a national plan. There is the question of whether such a plan exists, as one of the complaints against Coillte from people with a direct interest in the sector is that there is no overall plan, or that if there is one, no one knows what it might be. Again that ties in with the overall perception and suspicion of Coillte as a body shrouded in secrecy and not subject to the transparency and inquiry that pertains to other public bodies. I suggest to the Minister that he make it a priority to frame a long-term plan for the forestry sector and that this be subject to debate and scrutiny at committee level in here, and to wider consultation with the private sector in forestry, and others with an interest in the use of the forests for recreational and other purposes. If that was to be carried out, the proposals in the Bill would not only make more sense but would be more broadly acceptable as they would be seen as part of a cohesive plan, rather than, as some suspect, simply the random conferring of extra powers without any real understanding of how they might be utilised.</p>
          <p eId="para_422"> That aspect also relates to section 10 which concerns the drafting, submission and approval of forestry management plans by owners of private forests. This is a sound proposal and one that is necessary to ensure that forestry in private ownership is properly utilised. However, perhaps more thought needs to go into the framing of such plans. Rather than individuals submitting their own plans based on the utilisation of their forestry, perhaps there could be local area management plans, centred on either the productive or amenity usage of the forestry. For example, an individual owner's plan for the utilisation of their forest might tie in with potential employment opportunities through the processing of the wood, or even in tourism projects. In general I can see no fault with the provisions to ensure the protection of existing forestry as outlined in Part 3 of the Bill. However, I reiterate what I said earlier regarding the role of Coillte in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_423"> While the regulations governing private forestry owners are quite strict, and will be tightened up if this legislation is passed, there appears to be little onus on Coillte to observe the same criteria in regard to the protection of the forestry and the natural environment for other plant and animal species related to the forest.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">For example, Coillte sold 400 acres of public forestry land at Bellanaboy to the Corrib gas consortium in order that it might build a refinery there. As far as I am aware, an environmental impact assessment was not carried out in respect of the site and, since I became a Member in 2002, successive Ministers have repeatedly refused to explain the circumstances of that sale. While it is right and proper that private forestry owners have an obligation to protect the environment, surely the same obligation must also to apply to Coillte.</p>
          <p eId="para_425"> Concerns have also been expressed in respect of what is proposed in section 17 with regard to, for example, the regulation of tree felling and requirements relating to replanting. One objection is that the requirement to replace a felled tree with one of the same species imposes too much of a restriction on forestry owners in the context of how they might utilise their lands. While there is much emphasis on the need for management plans, it could be argued in this instance that the stringent conditions regarding replanting take no account of such plans. If, for example, a forestry plan submitted by an individual owner proposes that existing trees be replaced with a different species during the next replanting period, would such a move be automatically ruled out? There is considerable debate about different species and, in particular, about the replacement of imported pine species with native varieties. In general, this appears to be favoured and is a factor in the cultivation of trees suitable for processing into alternative fuels. Is there not a danger then that the provisions relating to replanting might impose overly stringent conditions and, therefore, prevent the transition to other species which have more economic potential and which could give rise to greater benefits?</p>
          <p eId="para_426"> Some people would argue along the same lines against the requirement in section 18 that felling licences will be required in order for landowners to thin trees. While there does need to be supervision of forestry in the context of the preservation of stock and so on, surely a large degree of discretion can be granted to and trust can be placed in individual owners when it comes to thinning, which is an essential part of forestry management. Does this not impose too many restrictions and introduce an unnecessary level of regulation? It has been pointed out that this has already given rise to a bureaucratic backlog, with officials unable to keep pace with the number of applications for felling licences. I understand that only half such applications are processed in the year in which they are made.</p>
          <p eId="para_427"> The language used in section 22 is quite harsh. In the past I have pointed out, in the context of farm regulations and the fisheries protection legislation introduced by the previous Government, that there is a tendency to use terms more appropriate to criminal activity and to criminalise bad practices on the part of farmers and fishermen. It appears the trend in this regard is being continued in the legislation before the House. Of course those who are engaged in fraudulent or other criminal behaviour must be subject to sanction. However, many involved in the rural economy are of the view that an unwarranted level of suspicion and bureaucracy obtains in respect of them. They are also of the opinion that the Bill continues this trend.</p>
          <p eId="para_428"> I look forward to the Minister of State's responses in respect of the issues which have been raised. I hope he will be in a position to take on board some of the points that have been made. It is important that the right framework for the development of forestry here is put into place. I hope this debate and the possible amendment of some sections of the legislation will contribute in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_430">Ireland's forestry sector was once described as a sleeping giant, an asset with so much more to deliver to the economy in the context of providing income for forest owners through direct and indirect employment, exports and home-grown sustainable and renewable sources of energy. Output from the industry has been estimated at approximately €2.2 billion since 1994. Forestry has delivered an average output of 5.65% per annum. I am not definite that this is the actual figure and, if volatility is taken into account, it could be below 5%. This high-quality Irish asset is too often overlooked. The forestry service remains inadequately staffed and is ill-equipped to deal with the increasing volume of applications from those in the private forestry sector whose trees are rapidly approaching maturity. On the horizon are possible plans on the part of the State to sell off our forestry. That would be a retrograde step and it would constitute a terrible move in the long term.</p>
          <p eId="para_431"> On average, it currently takes approximately 12 months for a thinning or tree felling licence to be granted. That is ridiculous. I can say this because I live in the vicinity of the Comeragh Mountains and I know many of the people who work in the forests there. I have not even referred to the incredibly frustrating position in which forestry owners find themselves in the context of trying to organise contractors, sales deliveries and timely thinning. More than 19,500 landowners have planted in excess of 250,000 ha of forestry since 1980. Much of this is now ready for thinning. Forecasts indicate that the number of trees harvested from private forests will increase tenfold during the next 15 years. The Bill does not appear to contain anything much that will change the system used to grant licences. I may have missed something and, if I have, perhaps the Minister of State will point it out.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> The rules and regulations which govern the forestry sector are extremely outdated. Any move to alter the position in this regard would be welcome. There is a great deal in the Bill which will add to the red tape with which forestry owners are already expected to deal. The administrative duties for which it makes provision will result in the imposition of further costs on the owners of forests and the staff of the forestry service. Despite the huge potential that exists in this area, the Bill contains little that will assist in increasing afforestation rates. The new management plan requirements - which will add another layer of bureaucracy - will be off-putting for forest owners. I have spoken to quite a few of the latter in respect of this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> There is a major challenge for the industry in the context of the protection of our forests. In this regard, I refer to the threat posed by forest fires. I have been informed that instead of providing supports, the Government is actually removing them. For example, grant aid is no longer available to forest owners who replant their lands after fire or storm damage. In 2012, the support available for the reconstitution of crops damaged by deer and frost was also removed. I would like the Minister of State to provide an update on any plans to reintroduce the relevant schemes. I am not stating that commitments were given but prior to the general election in 2011, reference was made to reintroducing some of the schemes which obtained in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_434"> The new EU forestry strategy acknowledges the contribution of the forestry sector to rural development, growth and job creation. I am not sure but I understand that Ireland's total forest cover stands at 11%, which is one of the lowest levels in Europe. We need to do more to ensure that the economic, social, environmental and recreational benefits which can accrue from a vibrant forestry estate are recognised by compensating forest owners for the costs relating to forestry establishment and for the income they forego while their timber crops are maturing. We should consider the economic impact of the forestry sectors in countries such as Norway and Denmark and also the social, environmental and recreational benefits to which they have given rise. These countries are way ahead of Ireland in this matter. It is difficult to believe that our total forest cover stands at 11%. This figure has not changed for approximately 20 years. That is dreadful, particularly when one considers the amount of forestry land which could be made available to the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_435"> The taxation restrictions introduced in the Finance Act 2006 do not recognise the unique nature of growing forests, which only realise the full revenue at the end of a growth cycle. Such a cycle is commonly in the region of 40 years but it stretch to 50, 60 or 70 years. This issue must be addressed, particularly because it represents a considerable threat in the context of developing the industry. The latter is, of course, what we need to do in the coming years. The current number of logs harvested annually in Irish forests is not sufficient to meet demand from the processing sector. Logs continue to be imported, which is ridiculous.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">People in forestry are aghast, shocked and taken aback that we have the potential to create extra employment and to develop the industry and yet shiploads of logs are imported into the country. That is criminal.</p>
          <p eId="para_437"> Demand continues to outstrip supply and this position will worsen as an increasing volume of timber residue and small logs will be required for the rapidly expanding wood industry sector. I know the Minister will do his best but if we look at the forestry sector and the current economic crisis, there is potential to create employment in and to develop recreational use. That can help the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_438"> If we look at Norway, Sweden and Denmark, the number of people employed in the forestry sector in those countries has increased dramatically over a number of years but the number employed here appears to have stagnated and the figure of 11% has gone nowhere over the past 20 years. People in the industry in Europe find it quite shocking when they see the potential Ireland has. Forest owners here have set up committees and they meet people from Norway, Denmark, Sweden and other countries. They come back here astounded and shocked when they see the government input in those countries compared to that here. A small amount of investment in relative terms would help the economy over a long period of time. We are talking about 20 to 40 years but is that not what it is all about? It is about our children's children and everything we can do to sustain and grow the economy. This is where we are losing badly.</p>
          <p eId="para_439"> I keep harking back to this but I found it astounding when I was given the figure of 11% some years ago. In my constituency, if one leaves Waterford, one sees thousands of acres of forests extending to Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir and elsewhere and the potential there for employment, recreational use and so on. I remember driving through those forests as a child but 30 or 40 years later, nothing has changed. We have not attempted to develop or create economic value from these forests, which is astounding. This is not a criticism of this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_440"> I am disappointed we have not set out a strategy in the Bill for long-term development so that we can project how much money can be made over a period of 30 to 40 years and how jobs can be created. Strategies put forward in other countries, such as Norway, project 20 to 30 years ahead. They are now able to project how forestry will affect their economies and job creation in 20 to 30 years' time. It also affects the national debt because they will create or lose jobs and make money for the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_441"> It looks as if I will vote against this Bill but I will speak to people today and tomorrow. I am very disappointed we have not made any economic projections. Many people working in the forestry industry will also be disappointed that much of what has happened here over the past 20 to 30 years will not change as a result of this Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_442">With the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's indulgence, I would like to dedicate my comments on this issue of Ireland's forests, which is very close to my heart and to the hearts of many people in this country, to my auntie, Silvia Stewart nee Boyd Barrett, who died on Sunday after a short and sudden illness. I have just come from her funeral. She was very proud to have a nephew elected to the Dáil and she was a big inspiration to me because her home was a place where there was great debate, discussion and ideas. The Ceann Comhairle would have known her quite well and her sister who died a few years ago. I would like to dedicate what I will say on this issue, about which she felt strongly, as do I, to my aunt Silvia.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2013-10-10T13:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_444">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</p>
          <p eId="para_445"> It is kind of appropriate, in a way, to connect any discussion about Ireland's forests to things that are important to us, to people and to places which are important to us. A play I strongly recommend to people that has just opened is Frank McGuinness's new play, "The Hanging Gardens", which is about Irish families, the places they inhabit and their roots, the roots of people and of places. There was a beautiful line in the play spoken by the father of the family who was nearing his death. The family was gathering around him in the place that was most important to them. He said to his children, "Make your refuge of the things that are most precious to you". That was his advice to his children. I thought it was a very profound and poignant line because it was about those connections of people and places and roots which are important - our personal history but also our cultural history, our tradition - and how they link the past and the present to the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_446"> Nothing symbolises that relationship and those precious things as much as trees and forests - maybe even more so in this country. In these straitened economic times, there is an understandable tendency to look at every issue through the prism of the balance sheet, the monetary value, and how it can help the public finances. It is understandable that we have to do that but it is often a mistake and, in something like forestry, it would certainly be a grave mistake. </p>
          <p eId="para_447"> Any discussion about forests needs to begin with understanding how important they are to us as a culture, as something that helps identify us as a nation and to people in all sorts of ways. Of course, they have economic value, which is important, but the beginning of wisdom is to understand just how precious the forests are to the people of this country at every level. They mark our history in the sense that they were here long before us. They sustain our life now. Without them, there is literally no existence. They breath the air we need to survive. If we do not protect them, we will not survive.</p>
          <p eId="para_448"> In a Bill dealing with the management of Ireland's forests, we must recognise the absolute imperative of doing everything we can to protect and nurture them because they are so important at every level now and in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">During the real debate about whether we should sell our public forests, the people showed how much they cared and how important the issue was. I want to give credit to the Government for listening to people because I know it is under pressure. The people spoke and the Government listened and decided to keep the forests in public ownership. We need to go further now. It is not enough to protect them by keeping them nominally in public ownership - we need to manage and nurture them in a way that will protect them long into the future and will realise their value at every level. In addition to their financial value, our forests have a cultural value as public amenities. They are vital because they literally sustain our existence.</p>
          <p eId="para_450"> I want to support this Bill in that regard. When this House passes the Bill I want us all to be able to say that it safeguards the future of our forests. I have to be honest and say that at present it does not do that. It expresses at the level of general aspiration what we would all want to see, but it does not do it in a way that will guarantee Irish forestry is protected, nurtured and cultivated in a way that allows it to be what it can be.</p>
          <p eId="para_451"> We all know we are dealing with an historical legacy when we address the management of this country's forests. This country used to be a forest nation. At one time it was totally covered in forestry but that was decimated, because of the legacy of colonialism and empire, to the point where at the beginning of the 20th century our forests were almost gone. While this State has slowly improved that situation, we are still a long way short of where we should be at in terms of forestry. The comparisons with the rest of Europe are stark. Even though trees grow almost twice as quickly in Ireland as in anywhere else in Europe, because of our climate, we have the second lowest level of forest cover of any EU member state and the lowest level of native tree cover of any country in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_452"> Our native species comprise a tiny proportion of our national forest estate. That is something we have to change, for all sorts of reasons including their amenity value. The native forests that were devastated and destroyed are our forests. They are important at all kinds of other levels. The Bill seeks to uphold some of those values, such as the protection of the environment and the maintenance of biodiversity. We cannot do these things if we do not bring about a dramatic improvement in the level of native broadleaf forest cover. The monoculture forestry of foreign species is damaging for our environment and is not conducive to the cultivation of biological diversity. The various habitats found in our native forests create the environment for animal biodiversity. The Sitka spruce monoculture of evergreen forests does not protect, nurture or enhance biodiversity; in fact, it damages it. This type of forestry leads to extensive acidification of our rivers and other waterways. Many reports suggest that this problem is at a dangerous level and cannot get any worse without poisoning our environment in a serious way. Native species deal with that problem. They do not cause such damage. They protect water, biodiversity and the environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> We need a radical expansion of forest cover in this country to meet the targets we have set. We are aiming to have 17% forest cover by 2030. The long-term target is 30% forest cover, which would bring us up to the EU average. We are currently far short of that. The Bacon report suggested that we should be planting between 10,000 and 15,000 hectares of trees each year, but we have dramatically failed to achieve that. We are planting approximately 5,000 hectares of afforestation annually, on average, which is far short of the targets we need to meet if we are to adhere to the Kyoto climate change targets and our own stated objectives for increasing forest cover. We need to diversify the species mix and expand the amount of native broadleaf cover. It is stipulated that there must be a reasonable mix of native and foreign species when afforestation is taking place, but there is no such stipulation in the case of the replanting that is required when trees are cut down. There is no requirement that at least 50% of the trees that are planted during reforestation should be native species. That has to change. A specific provision to that effect should be included in the Bill. A species mix is needed when we are replanting after trees have been cut down, as well as when we are planting new forests. That is just one example of the sort of thing that needs to change if we are to meet our own targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_454"> The problem is that nothing in this Bill really ties us into meeting the objectives that have been set. We should be providing for binding targets instead of general aspirations. There is concern that many environmental organisations that are involved with forestry have not had a chance to make an input into this Bill. In the section of the programme for Government relating to legislation, the Government said there would be a shift towards pre-legislative consultations that would allow stakeholders and concerned groups to make an input in advance of Second Stage debates. We should be able to hear the forestry organisations' ideas on issues like afforestation; problems like clear felling, the industrialisation of forestry and the damage caused to the environment by monoculture; and the vital need for community and public participation in the management and control of our forests. These matters came up again and again the last time the groups were asked to make submissions, which was five, six or seven years ago. No such consultation has taken place on this occasion, even though it is important to update the input into the drafting of this legislation of experts and people who care. Sadly, the legislation reflects that fact. It is general and aspirational.</p>
          <p eId="para_455"> Ultimately, most of the power to deliver on the generally good aspirations in the Bill will be in the hands of the Minister, who will be responsible for the detail. There is no mention at all of the committees the Minister will be given the power to establish, or the role of community participation in trying to meet the goals and objectives of the Bill. Experts from the academic world, environment and forestry groups and other amenity users should be able to make an input into the development of the sort of forest policy we need. This has not happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> I talked to some of those groups in recent days and they were angry that the Bill is even before us. Although they want this Bill, they thought they would have a chance to have an input into it. God knows they have shown in the past six months how much they care. We should see it as a positive that people who have a passion for forestry, who want to develop it and who see its value and importance want an input into the legislation that will develop and manage our forestry. I ask the Government in all sincerity to stall the process after Second Stage to allow for public consultation and submissions before the Bill is moved on to Committee Stage when the Bill will be amended in order that we hear those voices. I do not mean the Bill should be stalled forever - we want the Bill - but let us have a chance for people to come in.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> A glaring omission is that the forestry review report, which was a good review, is also doubling up as a strategic environmental assessment of our forests, but it is doing so without the promised review of Coillte. At the same time that the forestry review was set up and started, there was supposed to be a review of Coillte. I believe, although I do not know for sure, that that review was begun but was never completed or published. How can we have a Bill to manage our forests when we do not have a review report of the biggest owner of forests? Coillte controls 50% of the forests. The Government cannot be serious about what we need to do for forestry if we do not know what is going on inside Coillte. As much as I and others fought hard against Coillte's sale, we did so in the knowledge that it has problems. We all know that, and everybody on every side of the House and at the committees when the matter has been discussed acknowledges that to be the case. We need a serious review to be completed to inform the Bill in order that it is up to standard and meets our requirements for managing our forests.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> We recently discussed the Freedom of Information Bill. Some Members feel that the Bill has omissions in that semi-State enterprises are excluded from its provisions. Coillte is one such body and is therefore excluded from that Bill, which is a problem. We are talking about the public forest estate for which the public has demonstrated its passion and to which it has demonstrated its attachment, and we are not allowed to ask questions about what is going on inside a company we own, and there are serious question marks over the sale of forest land in recent years. I think the sales run into the hundreds of millions of acres. I do not have the figures in front of me, but significant areas of forest land were sold. In fact, the only way Coillte has made money in recent years is by selling off forestry. Serious questions must be asked about why it is no longer planting new forests, about the Derrybrien calamity, which saw a mountain collapse despite prior warnings, and about all sorts of other things that I do not have the time to go into.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> I want a Bill passed that will do justice to the importance of our forests as amenities and as part of our culture. I have not even had the time to go into the huge potential of forestry for the creation of jobs if we are to meet our targets for 30% or even 70% forest cover. That could be an enormous boost for the country. However, none of that can be done without the information, consultation and participation of the people who care and know about our forests. I urge the Government to heed that appeal and bring those people in before we move on to the amendment Stage.</p>

          <from>Deputy Heather Humphreys<recordedTime time="2013-10-10T14:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_461">First, I extend my sympathy to Deputy Boyd Barrett on the loss of his aunt. He was obviously close to her and I know he will miss her.</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Forestry Bill 2013. The forestry sector plays an important role in our economy, particularly in rural areas. The fact that forestry cover nationally stands at 11% shows what an important national asset it is. It brings significant benefits, including rural employment and exports, and it is also of significant social, recreational and environmental value.</p>
          <p eId="para_463"> Almost half of our forestry is privately owned by farmers, and it is important that their voice is heard when finalising the Bill's details. I recently met an IFA delegation who expressed concerns about certain aspects of the Bill. It is widely acknowledged that the rules and regulations which govern the forestry industry need to be updated. The licensing system operates under the Forestry Act 1946. The legislation is almost 70 years old and is clearly no longer appropriate for a modern forestry sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_464"> There is also a need to reduce the level of red tape and bureaucracy that farmers face, but there are concerns that aspects of the Bill may have the opposite effect. I have been told that the fines associated with felling a tree without a licence or in contravention of a condition of a licence are excessive. There are times when, in the interest of safety, a tree may need to be cut urgently and it is felt that fines should be in line with the nature of the offence and take account of the circumstances involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> I welcome the proposals to simplify the granting of a felling licence process by replacing the two existing licences with a single felling licence. The removal of the requirement for an application to be lodged at a Garda station is also a positive development. It will make the application process considerably easier for farmers and should also reduce the lengthy waiting times for a licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> I also welcome the provision to allow farmers to remove up to 15 cu. m of wood for their own use in any 12 month period provided the trees are outside a forest. This would allow farmers to use their wood for their personal use. This is important for farmers in rural areas where wood is a vital fuel resource for many, particularly given the rising price of oil and heating costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> There is concern, however, about the requirement that a person wishing to fell trees as part of good management practices, such as general thinning operations, will need to apply for a licence. I ask the Minister to consider amending this section to reduce the administrative burden on farmers. I also ask the Minister to take on board the concerns expressed by the farming community about the powers that are to be conferred on authorised officers under the Bill which far surpass the responsibilities of existing enforcement bodies and may act as a major disincentive for those considering forestry as a land use option. Similarly, there are serious concerns about the powers that are to be conferred on the Minister of the day, particularly on the function to compulsorily purchase land suitable for forestry.</p>
          <p eId="para_468"> The forestry sector has the potential to make a significant contribution to our economic recovery if the necessary supports are provided. There is huge demand for timber globally, and we need to ensure Ireland is well placed to take advantage of this growing demand. I therefore ask that consideration be given to setting a goal for timber production which could act as a similar template to Food Harvest 2020 for the agrifood industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> I commend the Minister on treating this matter as a priority and on bringing this legislation before the House. However, if we are to realise the potential of the forestry sector, it is important we get the Bill right. I ask the Minister to take account of the concerns I have outlined and consult the farming community before finalising the legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_470">I thank Deputy Heather Humphreys for sharing her time with me. I congratulate Deputy Tom Hayes on his appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. In that role, he is responsible for the forestry sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_471"> I wish to take up a point that has been referred to by one of the previous speakers. It is not all about the economics of forestry, which are very significant. The impact of a thriving forestry sector can be much more than just its economic value. In that context, as a proud Tipperary man, I am sure the Minister of State will search long and hard to find a more appropriate testimony to the significance of forestry than that contained in the <i>Lament for Kilcash</i> or <i>Caoine Cill Cháis</i>. I am sure many of us learned this poem long ago in school. It began with the lines "Cad a dhéanfaimid feasta gan adhmad? Tá deireadh na gcoillte ar lár; níl trácht ar Chill Cháis ná ar a teaghlach is ní chluinfear a cling go brách." Kilcash is in the Minister of State's constituency and was the home of the Butlers. The poem is a lament for, among other things, the lady of the House who was one of the Butlers but also for the demise of Irish forestry and the woodlands around Kilcash. The line relates to a reference by previous speakers to the impact of a positive forestry sector. The poem goes on to reflect on the biodiversity that forestry supports such as the ducks' voices, the geese, the eagle's cry, the bird's song and the bees and refers to "no hazel nor holly nor berry". If the Minister of State wants appropriate motivation for the forestry sector and what can be achieved, I would advise him to frame a copy of that poem and hang it in his Ministerial office because it is a testimony to the fact that long before the establishment of this House, we had very substantial forestry cover.</p>

          <p eId="para_473">At the beginning of the 20th century, this cover dropped to approximately 1%. The European average is in the region of 35% while our average is about 11%. I accept that this Bill is not the be-all-and-end-all. It is not going to cure all the ills of the forestry sector and it is about setting out a regulatory framework. However, it is important to acknowledge that forests are much more than just the economic value they bring to the nation's balance sheet. Reference has been made to biodiversity but also to our greenhouse gas emissions and the contribution forestry makes to the regulation of global climate and temperature. They are all very significant issues in respect of which we have global obligations and targets to meet.</p>
          <p eId="para_474"> I am not sure that it would be appropriate to stitch into this legislation targets for afforestation levels. However, it is important that this legislation gets the balance right in terms of the regulatory framework. It begs the question "cad a dhéanfaimid anois leis an mBille seo?" I am not sure that we have got the balance right. From my reading of it, it is an administrator's charter. It really does not seem to grasp the fact that if the forestry sector is to thrive and if we are to achieve targets of first 17% and then 30%, they will not be achieved through State afforestation, significant as that role will be. We will largely depend on the private forestry sector and farmers in particular to meet those targets. There is much in this Bill that will frighten landowners. It might be appropriate between now and Committee Stage to reflect on some of the contributions that have been made in that context and take on board the points that are being made. </p>
          <p eId="para_475"> It is a very significant economic sector that is valued in excess of €2 billion. Rural Ireland is trotted out as if it is a homogenous area but forestry is a particularly important sector in areas where the traditional farming practices of dairy or beef farming are not as prevalent or significant in the local economy. This is predominantly marginal land. In terms of the ambitious targets of 17% and 30% we hope to meet, the fact is that we will be moving on to much more productive land and that is an issue that brings with it considerable cultural difficulties. I thought Deputy Boyd Barrett's contribution was very fine but there are different cultures at play. There is an urban culture which obviously relishes its inhabitants' opportunity to walk in woodlands but there is a rural culture that is very reluctant to embrace the concept of increased afforestation on what is considered good land. Good land will be afforested to a greater extent than it was in the past - certainly in the history of this State - if we are to meet those targets. If we are to do that, we need a cultural change and an educational initiative to sell the opportunities that come with it. I am not sure that the framework is appropriate in terms of what is in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> It is an industry worth €2.2 billion that employs somewhere between 10,000 and 15,000 people. They are mostly in areas where the land is of marginal quality. It is those who are directly involved in ownership but there are downstream industries in timber processing, haulage and associated services so it is a very significant industry and one where the legislation has been found to be significantly out of date. My colleague referred to it. I am not sure when the previous legislation was introduced - possibly 60 or 70 years ago - but it is long due an updating. </p>
          <p eId="para_477"> It must also be acknowledged that while we started from a very low base, private concerns involved in forestry have been the ones who have stepped up to the plate in terms of meeting targets for increased afforestation. More than 20 years ago, there was virtually no private forestry and State forestry and subsequently Coillte was the predominant player. Twenty years ago, it was a balance of 70% to 30% between the State and the private sector. Due to initiatives, encouragement and an appropriate framework, we now have almost a 50:50 balance between public and private forestry. The targets we set for a higher level of afforestation will only be met if we have the appropriate framework for private investment and that is the challenge. </p>
          <p eId="para_478"> The Bill contains things that are excessive. Section 6(<i>e</i>) refers to "land suitable for afforestation or for any other forestry-related activities". The inference I read from that section is that such land can be compulsorily purchased. If we are to encourage the private sector to get involved in forestry, the idea of Big Brother having compulsory purchase powers over land suitable for forestry strikes the wrong note completely. In his response, could the Minister of State tell me what the rationale for the inclusion of that provision in the Bill is?</p>
          <p eId="para_479"> Most of us in rural constituencies and certainly those of us from farming backgrounds would be aware of the cumbersome nature of felling licences. Much of what is contained in respect of reform there is welcome. Dangerous trees can be felled in a much speedier manner, which is particularly welcome. In respect of the replanting requirement, the Minister of State is, for the purposes of the legislation, mentioned as having all of these powers. He can attach conditions to replanting lands that have been clear-felled and can do so in a manner that can impact on the title of the land. </p>
          <p eId="para_480"> Sledge hammers cracking nuts come to mind. It is inappropriate and potential investors in forestry will be frightened away if they think their opportunities to maximise returns from their land holdings may be compromised by the State obliging them to do something. If they can show they can get a better economic return through a different approach, that should be open to consideration. People will be slow to sign up to forestry management plans if the Minister is able to impose conditions on replanting without appropriate consultation or reference to the potential for adverse economic impacts on forestry owners and their entitlement to compensation from the State where they are obliged to do something else. This issue is related to the imbalance in forestry policy between native species and spruce and other imports, which are currently predominate. We need to take a co-operative approach rather than wield the big stick. There is too much of the stick in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> I look forward to engaging with the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, on Committee Stage but I ask whether the amount of consultation that has been pursued to date was sufficient to take account of the views of the industry. The people to whom I have spoken think the suggestions they made as part of the consultation process for the Bill, which has had a long gestation, are not reflected in its contents.</p>
          <p eId="para_482"> Section 26(1) provides:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_483">A person who, in applying for a grant, loan, registration, licence or approval under the relevant statutory provisions - </p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_484">(a) furnishes information, or </p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_485">(b) makes a statement,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_486">that he or she knows to be false or misleading in a material respect, shall be guilty of an offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">Most people who get into forestry employ a forester to manage their lands. Given that most of these professionals have professional indemnity insurance, if they are in breach of regulations or obligations in respect of sustainable forestry management is it appropriate to penalise the landowner rather the agent who is acting in a professional capacity?</p>
          <p eId="para_488"> This legislation was never going to become the be-all and end-all for the forestry sector. Forestry is an important part of our economy and it plays a significant role in a range of areas, from recreation and biodiversity to climate change and greenhouse emissions. I acknowledge what Coillte has done in regard to recreational forestry.</p>
          <p eId="para_489"> I beg the Acting Chair's indulgence if I make reference to a case I encountered through my constituency office involving a former employee of Coillte who retired on a pension of €30 per week after 30 years of service. That is a gross offence to an individual who gave long service to a State company, particularly when others in that company have retired on enormous pensions. I will give the Minister of State the details of the case so that he might examine them.</p>

          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív<recordedTime time="2013-10-10T14:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_490">Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Stáit. Is é seo an chéad Bhille atá tugtha faoi bhráid na Dála aige, go bhfios dom, ina ról mar Aire Stáit a bhfuil freagracht ar leith aige i leith foraoiseachta. Os rud é go dtagann sé as Contae Thiobraid Árann, ní fhéadfainn gan a rá leis:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_491">Cad a dhéanfaimid feasta gan adhmad?</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_492">Tá deireadh na gcoillte ar lár.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">Caithfidh mé cuairt a thabhairt ar Chill Chais am éigin.</p>
          <p eId="para_494"> I welcome this opportunity to discuss the forestry industry. It is often treated as Cinderella when it comes to land use in Ireland but, as other speakers have noted, afforestation offers many benefits. However, we should remember it is one of several competing uses for land. Contrary to what many people think, the better the land, the better the forestry. It is not as simple as forestry being confined to marginal land while the good land is used solely for agriculture.</p>
          <p eId="para_495"> I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, to follow the example of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine in dealing with this Bill. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, took on board a significant number of amendments to the Animal Health and Welfare Bill 2012 and he took all of our proposals seriously. On Report Stage he either accepted our amendments or came back with his own alternatives. The IFA has raised issues with the Forestry Bill. The best way of dealing with the issues raised by the IFA or anybody else - the IFA does not have a monopoly on raising issues - is to tease them out on Committee and Report Stages to decide whether their concerns are valid and how we might work collectively to improve the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_496"> If the debate on the Seanad and Dáil reform are to have any relevance, we must improve the way in which we scrutinise legislation. Unfortunately, the media often describe the business of this House in terms of votes and confrontations. They seem to think that Ministers never listen to rational or reasonable arguments put forward by Opposition Members. If an amendment stands up to scrutiny as part of the tedious work done on Committee Stage, it is incumbent on the Minister concerned to take it on board irrespective of who proposes it. However, if an amendment is shown to be superfluous or without foundation, the Minister is perfectly right to reject it. When we do this type of work we must forget about party divisions and recognise that all of us can play a role. The role of Opposition is to voice the concerns that are raised with us and to decide whether the counter-arguments hold water. If we take this approach to legislating we will be able to deal with serious issues. </p>
          <p eId="para_497"> I have great sympathy for those who see more bureaucracy in many of the provisions we make in this House. I do not know how many times over the years, whether in government or opposition, I have been assured that the process to be followed will be so simple that it will not require delays or paperwork. Inevitably, the process in question did not work out that way. We should be careful to ensure there is a purpose to every regulation and that the information sought will be used. We must not ask anybody to do anything that is not strictly to the benefit of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">Many ordinary people, particularly those in small operations, find that the amount of paperwork involved in the simplest processes is horrendous.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> We keep discussing necessary reforms of the Houses. I bet Members that, if we held a referendum on changing how the Oireachtas operates and another on getting answers to letters and decisions on applications from the State in good time, it would be 10:1 in favour of the latter. I must wait more than a year for a decision from the Ombudsman. The State has become bogged down in process and untimely decision making.</p>
          <p eId="para_500"> As the Minister of State knows, I raised a question a number of weeks ago about delays in the issuing of planting licences. I understand that there is some toing and froing between his Department and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS. It is not right that people must wait while two Government bodies pass the parcel on decisions. We must introduce legislation on time limits on decision making. A planning application takes eight weeks and one must jump when asked for further information before a decision is given. It should be the case that, unless there is a valid response to a licence application within a fixed time, that licence should be automatically granted. Bureaucratic delays are costing money.</p>
          <p eId="para_501"> I have had a long association with forestry. I started work in Corr na Mona on 2 January 1974. In 1978, I was involved in the setting up of a fencing stake mill. I knew nothing about forestry, but I learned fast and furious. The successor company on the same site, ECC Teoranta, is probably known to the Minister of State as one of the largest timber mills in the country. In fairness to Connacht Gold and P. J. Fahy, they have made a success of that mill. It started as a lamb fattening station, but fattening mountain lambs in a shed proved not to be the most economic prospect after the oil crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_502"> Since then, I have witnessed significant change in the timber and forestry industries. When I was involved, there was no Coillte Teoranta. Everything belonged to the Department. It is fair to say that those forests were well managed. The situation changed and Coillte Teoranta was established. I do not agree with the popular belief that Coillte Teoranta does not have a central role in afforestation. As a State company, it should be encouraged to afforest more land and to have a planting policy. It should not merely become the manager of an existing State forest. Given its know-how and skill, it should be part of the national drive to plant. Any private planting is actually funded by the taxpayer. It would be cheaper to have Coillte plant more forest, as the taxpayer would not need to provide direct funding. I foresee a considerable role for Coillte.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> I welcome the decision not to proceed with a foolish policy. Everyone in the industry from workers and timber millers to recreational users welcomed how the Government drew back from selling the forest crop. I do not doubt that the Minister of State was very relieved when the Cabinet decided not to sell Coillte. However, we should not assume that the issue has now been addressed. Coillte has more potential and should not be left as is. We should view it as a leading edge development company with a large land resource.</p>
          <p eId="para_504"> I do not believe in merging Bord na Móna and Coillte. Their <i>raisons d'être</i> are fundamentally different. However, there is no reason for a lack of total co-operation in those parts of their businesses that overlap.</p>
          <p eId="para_505"> I will address this issue in two segments, the first of which is the development of the timber industry. The construction industry used to use very little Irish timber in construction. We were told that it was too damp and not up to standard. The change in the past 15 to 20 years has been extraordinary - kiln drying, stress testing, other technical innovations and better management of quality control in timber mills. Not only is Irish timber acceptable on the Irish market, but it has 5% of the British market.</p>
          <p eId="para_506"> We often discuss the large down sides of the past five years, the terrible fallout for construction, etc. The construction industry has seen significant unemployment. What is often overlooked is the fact that, in 2008, between 70% and 80% of major timber mills' sales were to the domestic construction market. They have managed to change this situation with no loss of employment and just a few weeks of short-term working. Now, 70% to 80% of their timber is being exported to Britain. We should salute those in the industry, including Coillte Teoranta, which worked with the mills through a difficult period. Had Coillte been sold off, it would not have been able to save our timber industry. We should also salute the processors, who adopted an extraordinary get-up-and-go attitude instead of crying about a major problem. They got out on the road and decided that, with their home market gone, they needed to get into export markets. They did so successfully. In the past five years, they have invested in further technological developments so as to produce better product and compete in export markets. It is important to note that the industry's exports are worth €303 million to this economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_507"> This example shows the major advantage of resource-based industries. If they move upmarket, pursue technological improvements and develop their products, they will hang in during the bad times when overseas industries might decide to move elsewhere. I always place a large premium on indigenous industry. My argument for investment in and State support for indigenous industry is that, if supported, it is less likely to leave during a downturn. Basically, it has nowhere to go. The people involved are from this island and their operations are based here. Obviously, multinationals consider the world stage. I am not saying that we should not have multinationals, but we should encourage our resource-based industry. We must also continue pursuing technological innovation.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> Our large timber mills are producing high volumes of high-quality standard products. When I was involved in exporting timber to Germany, I was always fascinated by its large number of micro-timber industries. They produced everything from garden paving to products that tended to be done in concrete in Ireland. At the time, arguments were put forward to the effect that our timber was not as suitable.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">Many of those technical issues can be resolved if we develop the right technology. It is important to invest in technological development such as the Marine Institute does for the maritime sector and Teagasc does for agriculture. We should examine the forestry industry to discover if there are other uses for our timber.</p>
          <p eId="para_510"> There are major possibilities for indigenous timber in the energy sector and the Western Development Commission has done a lot of work in that regard. There are also challenges because burning wet timber does not provide much heat. There are ways to overcome that problem, but a concerted programme is required. Nonetheless, every forest product is important. </p>
          <p eId="para_511"> In addition, afforestation is important for nature reserves, including as a habitat for the red squirrel which has been under threat in the east. West of the Shannon, however, it seems to have withstood the ravages of the grey squirrel. Many other wildlife species inhabit our forests also. The State must look beyond the purely commercial value of public goods, as well as recognising the contribution of State and private owners to wider environmental issues. Carbon sequestration is another major benefit. </p>
          <p eId="para_512"> Having been in the timber industry, I was in the unusual position of winding up as Minister with responsibility for rural recreation. Some 45% of the country's waymarked ways are over Coillte lands. If Coillte was not in the equation, we effectively would not have such waymarked ways. I pay tribute to Coillte for its early recognition of the part it could play in rural recreation and the company's willingness to invest in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_513"> When the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform works out the dividend for Coillte, he should give a rebate from that dividend for the public goods element of its work, particularly if the company can prove it is investing in such matters as rural recreation which is so important for tourism.</p>
          <p eId="para_514"> It is important not to have over regulation in forestry. There is a balance to be struck in laying down broad powers for the Minister who may say that he or she would not use them unreasonably, and on the other hand not having a workable system. We should take our time with this Bill and ensure that in every stage of the afforestation process - including planting, growing, felling and replanting - the requirements are balanced. There should not be a surfeit of regulations for small amounts of work. </p>
          <p eId="para_515"> We cannot seem to get into our heads, either here or in the EU, the idea of <i>de minimus</i>. The process for felling a few hectares of forest should be a lot different to what is involved in felling an entire forest. We must ensure that in areas of ecological sensitivity we will preserve the ecology, while on the other hand being able to operate a commercial business.</p>
          <p eId="para_516"> I wish the Minister of State well in his new appointment. While his portfolio may not have the biggest profile, he can make a major contribution to progress in the areas under his Department's aegis. We are all agreed that forestry is good and by working together we can try to make sure that we will have a vibrant forestry industry that complements the country's superb agricultural industry.</p>

          <p eId="para_521">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Forestry Bill 2013 which seeks to update existing forestry law. Forestry is vital to the livelihoods of many farmers across the country, particularly in the midlands.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> Priorities in the forestry sector on economic, agricultural and environmental grounds have changed significantly since the Forestry Act 1946. Forestry premiums and grants provide farmers with an annual income stream from their woodlands and the industry provides significant employment like Glennon Brothers in Longford, which this year celebrates 100 years in the processing business.</p>
          <p eId="para_523"> The Forestry Bill 1945 was enacted at a time when the national forest estate was much smaller. Forestry activity was mainly undertaken by the State when we had strict control of felling because of severe timber shortages. The increasing volume of timber being harvested has become cumbersome in the context of the felling licence system, whose updating is long overdue. The requirement that all limited felling notifications must be lodged through a local Garda station, which was an outdated process, is no longer required.</p>
          <p eId="para_524"> Direct output in Ireland's wood products sectors, including panel board mills, saw mills and other wood products sectors, was €1.3 billion in 2010. The total direct and indirect value to the economy of the three wood processing sectors was €2.2 billion. The average employment figure for the forest sector as a whole is estimated at close to 12,000, the majority of whom are employed in rural areas like Longford and Westmeath, where jobs are provided across the sector in activities such as growing, harvesting and processing.</p>
          <p eId="para_525"> One of the new Minister of State's first actions was to visit Glennon Brothers' establishment in Longford. He got a great insight from two Longford entrepreneurs on how the industry works. The Minister of State was fairly experienced in this industry before taking over the portfolio. At parliamentary party meetings and in this Chamber he has always made valuable contributions in debates on the agricultural sector and forestry in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_526"> There has been a significant increase in demand for forest-based biomass and lower value firewood. Glennon Brothers sawmills in Longford is one of the largest sawmills in Ireland, employing over 300 people. Glennon Brothers and similar companies export volumes of high category timber mainly to markets in the UK, France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Overall timber demand - that is, biomass for renewables and conventional demand for the timber processing sector - is expected to increase over the next decade.</p>
          <p eId="para_527"> To avoid medium-term shortfalls in wood fibre and to meet the demands of our export driven timber processing sector, mobilisation of the private forest timber resource is necessary. We must simplify the current licence granting system. </p>
          <p eId="para_528"> Currently, there are two types of felling licence, a general felling licence which allows a person to cut down trees as part of normal forest management practices, including forest thinning and clear-felling, and a limited felling license which allows a person to cut down trees other than for normal forest management reasons, including trees located in hedgerows. This is further complicated by the necessity to notify the Garda Síochána of all applications for a limited felling licence. This process has become cumbersome because of the increasing volume of timber being harvested, in particular from the private sector. While in theory it should take only two months for a felling or thinning licence to be granted, this process currently takes up to 12 months, causing a lot of grief for forestry owners trying to organise contractors, sales deliveries and timely thinning. The Bill aims to streamline this process by removing the need for notification of all applications for a limited felling licence to the nearest Garda station and providing that, in future, all applications will be made to the Minister for a single felling licence, thus replacing the tedious dual system of general and limited felling licences.</p>
          <p eId="para_529"> Where a person wants to fell or remove a tree that is not exempted, he or she must apply to the Minister for a licence. The application must contain the particulars of the tree or trees concerned. A licence is valid for a period not exceeding five years. I would argue that for standard plantation forestry, a felling licence should be valid for a considerably longer period than five years as provided for in the Bill and should include all thinnings up to the final felling of a forest. This would reduce unnecessary cumbersome work that would otherwise slow down the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_530"> I am concerned that this Bill has no firm goal and contains little or no developmental or promotional aspect in regard to forestry. According to expert opinion, the annual planting rates for trees needs to be increased by more than 300% if our target of 18% coverage by 2030 is to be reached. No reference is made in the Bill to a target planting of approximately 16,000 hectares per annum. I am concerned at the long list of offences and penalties contained in Part 7 and the almost draconian approach to dealing with them. This represents a missed opportunity to rid our regulatory framework of unnecessary red tape. More than 19,500 landowners, mostly farmers, have planted in excess of 250,000 hectares since 1980, much of which is now ready for thinning. This is a rapidly maturing private forestry sector and we need to allow it to grow.</p>
          <p eId="para_531"> There are numerous benefits to forestry for farmers, forest owners and the wider economy. On top of premium payments, forest owners can avail of returns from thinnings due to the increasing popularity of wood energy and the clear-felling of their forestry plantation. Forestry is of long-term economic benefit to the economy in that it generates jobs and contributes to our national exports. It is also benefits the environment and is of recreational and amenity value to society in general.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> I welcome this Bill and hope that the Minister might take into account some of my concerns.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCarey" eId="spk_157">
          <from>Deputy Joe Carey<recordedTime time="2013-10-10T15:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_533">I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, on his recent appointment to office. Coming from a part of the country where the sector is of some significance, he will be committed to the industry. I wish him well in during his tenure in office. It is appropriate to remember at this time the Minister of State's predecessor, the late Shane McEntee, who, in his capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for forestry, served with distinction, great energy, passion and commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_534"> The Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, has been at pains to point out that the purpose of this Bill is primarily to streamline and simplify the various processes associated with forestry. This is to be welcomed. I welcome that the licence system operated under the Forestry Act 1946, as it pertains to felling licences, is to be changed and that following enactment of this legislation, licences will be valid for up to ten years rather than five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> The Minister of State said with regard to section 24 and the charging for felling licences and other services provided by the legislation that it is a matter of policy whether the Minister should charge for such services and its inclusion in the Bill should not be interpreted as a statement of intent at this point. I would welcome a more concrete and definitive statement in regard to what the State expects to receive for the issuing of licences and the administration of services. I raise this point because, like many Deputies from certain parts of the country, I, too, deal regularly with forestry representations from constituents.</p>
          <p eId="para_536"> If we want to get the most out of this potentially very valuable sector, change is required. The State severely dented confidence in the sector with the significant reduction three years ago of annual premiums. An afforestation contract between landowner and State is a big step. In essence, it is a commitment to tie up one's land to forestry in perpetuity. This is a big step, one never taken lightly by the landowner. To have the terms of this contract changed subsequent to signing can only make landowners wary of future investment or land use change. In addition, the current initiative by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in relation to repayments in respect of remapping leaves much to be desired. In one particular case with which I have been dealing, the Department is seeking the repayment of moneys dating back to 1998. I do not agree with this and believe that the Statute of Limitations should apply in such cases. I can understand and appreciate the need to recoup moneys, but this should not be achieved by the changing of parameters a number of years down the line. I would welcome if the Minister of State would address this point in his Second Stage response.</p>
          <p eId="para_537"> Irish forestry has changed significantly over the past 25 years. Thirty years ago, 30% of forestry was in private ownership. There are currently 17,000 private forest owners, with an average forest size of ten hectares, representing 47% of all forestry. This significant growth in our private forest estate is fast becoming a considerable wood and energy resource. Most of the private forest estate has been established over the past two decades, with many areas now entering the first thinning stage. This presents us with a huge opportunity and an even greater challenge. I do not believe we are properly positioned to maximise the benefit. The economics of thinning relatively small forests has not been dealt with properly. Many forest owners in County Clare tell me that they cannot get contractors to do a first thinning on a relatively small plot because the value of the thinning will not cover the cost of doing it. This is simply a matter of scale in machinery. There is not an infinite window to get it right. If we do not or cannot thin properly now, we will not have a premium timber product in 15 or 20 years time.</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> I would like to see acknowledged in the Bill that what works for large Coillte type forests might not be appropriate for 47% of our national resource. It would be a travesty if small ten hectare forests were not to achieve their potential because of a lack of proper management. The timber industry is now splitting into two definitive sectors, namely, timber product and green energy. While this is welcome, there are inherent dangers in this regard. Finsa Forest Products in Scariff, County Clare, a significant player in the production of various timber board and a significant employer in east Clare, unfortunately no longer manufactures, resulting in the loss of many jobs. Among the many reasons for its closure was that it could not compete against the newly State subvented energy sector in the purchase of pulpwood.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">I say this to ensure the Minister is aware of the need to continue to strike a balance between timber and energy production in the forestry sector. The Department must address this difficulty as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_540"> In referring to the Finsa company in Scarriff, I find it peculiar, when driving through east County Clare, that I persistently encounter timber lorries leaving the county. This area is one of the most afforested regions in the State, yet all the raw materials are moved out of it. It would be appropriate for the Minister of State with responsibility for forestry to liaise and work with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to seek to maximise employment in the timber industry in County Clare. Afforested areas are often those areas where land is not of the best quality and one often finds a correlation between forestry and areas of economic disadvantage. There is a need and an opportunity in County Clare, specifically east Clare, to develop a sustainable, job creating timber and wood energy industry. I invite the Minister of State to visit County Clare to meet public representatives and other interested parties to explore this potential.</p>
          <p eId="para_541"> I welcome and support this legislation and wish the Minister of State well as he steers his first Bill through the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Crowe<recordedTime time="2013-10-10T15:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_542">I welcome aspects of this Bill, which will be judged on the basis of whether it inhibits people from entering the forestry industry. A report published by the Irish Farmers' Association raised concerns in this regard. I also welcome the decision to remove from the Government's agenda - hopefully permanently - the proposal to sell off Coillte forests. An IMPACT commissioned report by Dr. Peter Bacon concluded that the sale of Coillte forests would have been a massive financial error and would have generated major losses for the State. It would also have had implications for the amenity aspects of forestry.</p>
          <p eId="para_543"> My constituency of Dublin South-West takes in part of the Dublin mountains, which are a popular location for leisure activities. Given that the Dublin and Wicklow mountains are close to the edge of the capital, one frequently hears about anti-social activity in the area, for example, thefts from cars belonging to visitors and walkers. While the Bill does not address that issue, we should take action to deal with this wider societal problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_544"> We must also encourage more people to use our forest amenities. Public access to Coillte lands was a major concern for those who opposed plans to sell off our forests. Given the problem of obesity and other health problems, it is important to make forests more accessible and open for people who wish to engage in activities such as walking. We need to encourage the view that forests are part of our heritage, rather than something on the margins. If we get young people involved through scouting and youth groups, we will instil a greater appreciation of the environment and so forth.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> It is difficult to obtain information about Coillte. One report indicated the sale of the company could generate €1.3 billion. Public representatives do not have an opportunity to query decisions made by Coillte. While it is nominally a private company, the primary shareholders are the Minister for Finance and, I understand, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. It would assist our understanding of forestry if the activities of Coillte became more transparent and public representatives were given an opportunity to discuss decisions taken by the company as well as their impact on farmers, private forestry owners and local communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_546"> Access to privately owned forestry does not come within the remit of the Bill, other than the introduction of an obligation on private forestry owners to ensure forests are properly looked after. Forestry owners will also be required to obtain a licence to thin out scrub and so on. This suggests an assumption on the part of the Department that private forestry owners will destroy forests. I do not believe that will happen. Farmers who remove weeds on their farms will not destroy their farms. This provision is over the top and needs to be addressed on Committee Stage. As the IFA has noted, it may inhibit people from entering the forestry sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_547"> I know a number of forest owners and remember visiting the forest of a late friend whose family had owned the forest for generations and who were very proud of its history. He spoke of officials and political representatives who produced great ideas but did not understand what was involved in maintaining and harvesting a forest. I get the sense from the legislation that while it may look good on paper, it may not be possible to roll it out. This issue needs to be addressed. </p>
          <p eId="para_548"> More defined regulation is needed with regard to access to forestry for members of the public. In my local authority, we discussed motions about access to land. This issue is a minefield and one would need to be Solomon to decide who was right or wrong in many cases because both sides of the argument had merit. Although this issue has been parked, it will need to be addressed at some stage. </p>
          <p eId="para_549"> I recall discussions on the Wicklow Way, which created difficulties as responsibility cut across South Dublin County Council and other local authorities. I remember the publication of a grand plan, route maps and so forth. Local farmers argued that they were not involved in the process and had been taken for granted. Common sense is required in this regard. I accept, however, that the Wicklow Way has developed into a fantastic amenity.</p>
          <p eId="para_550"> Recently, anti-social behaviour at Bohernabreena waterworks resulted in some official or other deciding to close public access to the facility. Hundreds, if not thousands, of people use this amenity at weekends in the summer. Perhaps its popularity was the problem but it was closed despite only a handful of visitors engaging in anti-social behaviour. One could argue that this step was necessary because of the water treatment works. The decision also impacted on access to the Wicklow Way, however. I heard, for example, that two Japanese tourists who inadvertently entered the Bohernabreena site were told they would be fined if they did not leave immediately. This was hardly an example of Ireland of the welcomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">I was subsequently told they genuinely did not know the area was sealed off. There was uproar involving fishermen. Two Dodder anglers and another angling company had access to it and were paying rent. They were denied access to it. There are huge difficulties with public access.</p>
          <p eId="para_552"> Ten years ago Dr. Peter Bacon analysed the sale of our forests and referred to the overall place of the forestry sector in the economy. Unfortunately some would argue little has been done since to develop the potential of the sector. Across all parties and none in this House, there would be the view that it has huge potential. Other speakers talked about the potential for jobs, but there is also the potential of getting people out of the city into forestry areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_553"> There are difficulties with replanting our forests. Many in the House would favour more afforestation, planting trees, improving the environment, biodiversity and so on. However, part of the difficulty is that although people sign up to planting their own trees, no one knows where the trees are. So there is a need to involve people. If it was opened up to the public, youth clubs and scouting organisations, it could be a way to get people back to work, training and so on. Those elements do not seem to come together. There is huge potential in that regard. We talk about upskilling people and so on, but we know how many people are working in this area in other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_554"> Dr. Bacon concluded on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis that public investment in forestry compared favourably with State investment in other sectors. He emphasised the need for strong co-ordination between the public and private sectors in forestry. The potential for forestry is evident if we look at what is happening in other countries. In Switzerland almost 100,000 people are employed in forestry or in related industries such as paper production. The forest area in Switzerland is twice that of this State, but the overall sector employs almost ten times the number of people employed here. There is clear potential for expansion.</p>
          <p eId="para_555"> Clondalkin and other areas traditionally had their paper mills and so on. Much of the potential for recycling paper has been moved outside the country. If we are talking about joined-up government, we need to put in supports to keep those types of industries in the country. We need to become much more independent and not reliant on sending our waste materials outside the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> I spoke about Coillte doing its own thing without being accountable to public scrutiny. If it is worth €1.3 billion and if we are serious about public accountability, we need to come up with some mechanism for scrutiny into decisions made in that company. Some newspapers referred to links with former politicians. We need considerably more transparency which would be helpful for the company. We need to give people the opportunity to look at decisions that are made. We need to give the company an opportunity to explain some of its decisions. It may require people coming together to discuss areas such as diversity and making some of our forests more environmentally friendly.</p>
          <p eId="para_557"> Contrasting the Bacon report with the fact that the State was seriously considering selling off public forests probably says all that needs to be said about how successive Governments and Coillte have treated the sector. I presume the Government will now claim it has made a decision on the matter. However, given the financial pressure on us, there will always be the potential for it to be sold off, but I see it as a resource. It is not healthy for people to have to rely on some media interest on what happening with our forests and it needs greater attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_558"> Now that privatisation is supposedly off the agenda, we need to look again at the Bacon report and frame a proactive policy to use the public forests properly in co-operation with private forest owners and related enterprises. The Bacon report also referred to the amenity value of the forests and I touched on that at the start. There are varying estimates of the economic value these bring. It is an area capable of greater development and expansion. We can also learn from other countries that are much more advanced in this area. There would be genuine cross-party support for initiatives in this area - I do not believe people would adopt party-political lines on it. There is so much good will for us to tap into. We should use the collective ideas of the House to move things forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_559"> The Bill is important in setting out the regulatory framework for private forests. I hope a proper balance will be struck to assist the future development of the forestry sector based on co-operation between the public and private sectors. My biggest concern would be over the nanny state and overregulation. Whether forestry is public or private we need to make people much more aware of the resource we have. We need to encourage more people to invest in forestry. Every day we talk about the potential to create jobs and people say the State cannot do that. This is one area where the State under supposedly a private company could create a huge number of jobs. If Switzerland can employ ten times the number we employ in this area, there is huge potential.</p>
          <p eId="para_560"> We need to look at the diversity of the forests. If we are talking in terms of private forestry, our policies should encourage private individuals and forests to grow oak trees and those trees that are more environmentally friendly than trees such as firs. That is an area in which we as legislators can make major changes.</p>

        <speech by="#AnneFerris" eId="spk_159">
          <from>Deputy Anne Ferris<recordedTime time="2013-10-10T15:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_561">I represent the county with the highest percentage forestry cover in Ireland. Just over 18% of the land area of County Wicklow is planted in trees, which is twice the national average. The Bill therefore will have a significantly higher effect in County Wicklow than in most other parts of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_562"> Wicklow's trees support hundreds of jobs in the forestry industry. The people who manage Wicklow's trees contribute an estimated €100 million annually towards a €2.2 billion national forestry sector. The value of forestry to our economy can only increase further. Timber is a global commodity that is much in demand and Europe is a net exporter of wood. However, the economic value of forestry must be balanced against its tourism and eco value. The tourists who walk in the forests of County Wicklow spend about €5 million in our local economy every year. The other tourists, the ones attracted to our county because of the beautiful green and afforested environment but do not actually walk in them, spend a further €5 million in hotels and shops and restaurants. Forestry associated tourism nationally is worth about €270 million to Ireland's economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_563"> It does not stop there. Our forests in Wicklow are the forests that keep on giving. Situated on the doorstep of Dublin, Wicklow's forests have significant national amenity value and contribute greatly to biodiversity. They also act as an important carbon sink for emissions from Ireland's capital city. Approximately 70% of Wicklow's forests are owned by the people and are in the care of the State forestry agency, Coillte. In this context it was a significant relief to me and thousands of my constituents when it was announced earlier in the year that the proposal to sell off Coillte's harvesting rights was no longer on the Minister's table. There was a real fear about the economic impact that could result to the forestry sector and the local tourism sector in Wicklow should control of the phasing of timber felling and replanting be handed over to a third party. This is especially the case since it would have resulted in more frequent felling with the associated visual and tourism impacts or in the movement of timber processing overseas, which would have affected forestry jobs in Ireland. I lobbied quietly but consistently against that proposal and I am pleased for the people of Wicklow that it has not come to pass. I am also pleased that there is now a renewed focus on legislating for the management of the highly valuable asset that is our forestry sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_564"> The work of forestry maintenance, felling and replanting is at the core of this important industry. To protect tourism we must ensure that the environmental impacts of these activities are tightly regulated. At the same time, to encourage investment in the sector we also need to ensure that compliance with regulations does not become too costly and off-putting for the small forestry developers who manage almost half of the country's forests. Many of the evergreen forests planted between 25 and 30 years ago by private individuals are coming to maturity now and I understand that in the coming years there will be a long queue of applicants for the tree-felling licences provided in this legislation. It is important that this process is managed cleanly and efficiently and that it is not seen as prohibitive or onerous. It is important that the forestry regulation brought in now is seen as part of a wider ambition to promote replanting and growth. Jobs in our tourism and forestry sectors depend on the continued renewal of our forests and the Forestry Bill 2013 must play a part in ensuring that objective is achieved.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanRyanDublin" eId="spk_160">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Ryan<recordedTime time="2013-10-10T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_565">I welcome this Bill which gives the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine increased power to support, improve and protect our forestry industry. It is vital to have a strong and growing forestry industry that will support and create jobs and which, I believe, can have considerable spin-off benefits for tourism and our environmental ecosystems.</p>
          <p eId="para_566"> In 1996, under the rainbow coalition Government, a report entitled Growing for the Future – A Strategic Plan for the Development of the Forestry Sector in Ireland was released and it has provided a basis for Government policy ever since. In particular, the plan sets out the implementation of sustainable forest management. In the strategic plan targets were set for forest cover as a percentage of Irish land, afforestation, that is, the planting of new forests, and annual timber production. Unfortunately, under successive Governments we have fallen well short of our targets. Under the strategic plan, targets for planting 25,000 ha per annum up to 2000 and 20,000 ha per annum thereafter were set with the goal of increasing forestry in Ireland from 7% to 17% by 2030. Subsequently, annual timber production should have increased from the 1995 figure of 2.2 million cu. tonnes to 10 million cu. tonnes. We have fallen well short of our targets in both areas with our levels of afforestation actually decreasing and our annual timber production remaining relatively flat.</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> With this Bill, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine can push for us to reach our targets in afforestation and timber production and I expect he will do so. The Bill also strengthens the Minister's role in conserving our environment through the removal of threats such as fire, the use of good forest management and the protection against damage from disease, invasive species, pests and other organisms. Last week we learned of confirmed reports of ash dieback at a plantation in Leitrim containing imported ash trees. The trees were destroyed in a bid to contain the outbreak and avoid the spread of the disease as has occurred on mainland Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_568"> Section 29 empowers the Minister to make regulations to protect our trees, including the restriction or expulsion from the State of any invasive species which could be deemed harmful to the environment. Our ecosystem is under an increasing threat from invasive species beyond trees and plants, from grey squirrels to giant hogweed to the North America crayfish. Invasive species threaten our delicate ecosystems and a strong response is required from State bodies to combat them. I call on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and all future Ministers with responsibility for forestry to act swiftly under the powers contained in the Bill to counter the threats of invasive species and the damage they do to our natural environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_569"> Apart from benefits to the timber industry and the improvement in our environment, forests provide the largest outdoor area for recreational use in Ireland, attracting 18 million tourists per annum. This recreational use generates €268 million in economic activities for communities, especially in rural areas. This figure could increase further and generate more economic activity. However, to accomplish this we need a comprehensive cross-departmental strategy which should be led by the Minister to link our forestry industry with our tourism industry to maximise its potential. We could look to the tourism forestry protocol agreement in the Australian state of Tasmania for an example of joined-up strategy between a forestry industry and state tourism boards. I call on the Minister to consider a similar approach in Ireland. Such an agreement in Ireland, facilitating communication, consultation and liaison, would ensure the forestry industry and the tourism authorities would recognise that together their respective industries are crucial to the delivery of sustainable growth of the Irish economy, especially in rural Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_570"> Under section 8, the Minister can establish one or more committees to advise and assist him in his functions. I encourage the Minister to examine the setting up of a cross-departmental group to promote forestry tourism. This would have manifold benefits for tourism in rural Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_571"> As a Labour Party Deputy, I am pleased to speak to this Bill on forestry after the contribution of my party in government in ensuring that Coillte remains in public ownership. I am convinced that this outcome would have been less certain without the Labour Party in government. I acknowledge the campaign conducted by the IMPACT trade union in the achievement of this outcome. The irrefutable economic argument for the retention of harvesting rights made by IMPACT and the economist Peter Bacon was supported by the Labour Party and our partners, Fine Gael, in government in a palpable example of what we are achieving. Against this backdrop we can look forward to improving our forestry industry, investing energy into expanding our afforestation programmes and, in turn, creating improved benefits for our economy and with this in mind I welcome the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_575">Forestry is an important contributor to our economy and exports. Too often, it is regarded as the Cinderella industry of our agricultural sector and rural way of life and that must change. In this context I welcome the Forestry Bill 2013 and the opportunity to contribute to it. The Bill is the start of a change which, I believe, is needed in the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> I remember being told in secondary school about the green gold of forestry in Norway, Sweden and Finland. It was often cited as a major contributor to the wealth of those Scandinavian nations. As students we never fully understood how Ireland could not capitalise on its green gold, given the more favourable growing climate for forestry here and the fact that this was a naturally afforested island prior to Cromwell and the various plantations.</p>
          <p eId="para_577"> There is still great potential for our island in the forestry sector if we make the right decisions. As a small open economy with a strong services dimension, our economic fortunes are closely tied to the consumer influences of taste elsewhere and economic performance in America, the EU and further afield. The difference between GNP and GDP highlights the challenge. Therefore, in developing our economy and export offering, natural resources of a renewable and sustainable nature, such as forestry, are very important. With this in mind, I note the research of UCD and UCC in 2010 which highlighted that when the processing sector, for example, panel board mills, sawmills and other wood products, was included in estimates the forest industry was worth €2.2 billion to our economy annually.</p>
          <p eId="para_578"> It is a native natural source of wealth worth protecting and expanding. It is a source of wealth in a sector in which global demand is expected to increase in the coming 20 years. As a country, we should be clever in how we position ourselves to meet this challenge and opportunity and the Bill is a start in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_579"> This country has shown leadership as a small nation in respect of its environmental commitments and adherence to international treaties and other protocols.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">While some may query the speed and depth of our compliance, other larger industrial powers have failed to sign up to them at all. Forestry can and will play further a significant role in meeting national greenhouse gas emission reduction targets and in fighting climate change. It also is worth noting that wood fuels are the second largest contributor, after wind, to the growing renewable energy sector in Ireland. This has helped to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 560,000 tonnes of CO2 in 2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> Forest cover stands at almost 11% nationally, with privately owned forests accounting for 46% of this total. There have been many attractive economic incentives to bring people into private forestry. However, a major public relations battle remains to be won in rural Ireland in respect of increasing the forestry footprint. The planting of land is still met with great suspicion in rural Ireland even if the land concerned is of little use for anything else. One point that should be further developed is that communities which engage in forestry activity should benefit more from the employment opportunities the industry presents. This would be of real benefit to such rural communities by contributing in real terms to the social and economic rural development of such areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_582"> Half a century ago, the forestry sector was highly labour intensive. In recent years, however, the majority of forestry operations have been mechanised to a dramatic extent, particularly in respect of harvesting. These operations involve the employment of specialist roving workers who do not necessarily reside in the rural community in which they are working and planting. To a large extent, the same is true in respect of planting, which historically was carried out by residents in the rural communities. It now largely is carried out by contractors who do not necessarily draw their workforce from the rural communities in which they are planting. Changes in work practices, such as the abandonment of thinning in favour of earlier clear-felling, also reduce the dependence on rural-based labour.</p>

            <p eId="para_583">I apologise for my late arrival. I wish to raise the issue that was highlighted in media reports this morning regarding a practice that in America is called the fainting game or sometimes the choking game and which has been around for some time. Its origins go back to the 1980s, when it swept through America for a period before going into decline. However, more than 80 deaths in America have been attributed to this phenomenon. While it principally is confined to teenagers, some of those who have died from it were somewhat older. Nevertheless, it is a highly disturbing phenomenon and I mention it because, unfortunately, a teenager is seriously ill in hospital in our own jurisdiction at present, having fallen victim to this dangerous practice. It has been described among young people as being some type of a high, to use that awful word, but of course it can prove fatal to those for whom it goes wrong. Like all Members, I hope the teenager in question will recover in full. It is a difficult time for him and for his family and, obviously, Members wish him the best.</p>
            <p eId="para_584"> However, I wish to make a connection with many things that are going on in the society in which we live, which I prefer to describe as the post-Celtic tiger fall-out syndromes. In the case of young people, most of this centres on the incidence of suicide, as well as excessive use of alcohol and other drugs. Moreover, the report produced by the Rape Crisis Network Ireland that was launched yesterday by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, is one of these alarming reports that tells us something about ourselves and forces us to look in the mirror about what this post-Celtic tiger period has meant. As legislators or adults, one might talk about the difficulties for unemployed people or those with difficult mortgages and so on. However, sweeping throughout this country is the connection between the case to which I have just referred regarding the young person in hospital and the issue of suicide, on top of which is the report that came out yesterday. I will cite just one figure from the aforementioned sexual violence report, which is that 35% of perpetrators of sexual abuse against child survivors were themselves under 18 years of age. I daresay this would have been unheard of 20 or 30 years ago. While launching the report yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, put it very well by stating: "While we have been horrified over historic abuse, this report forces recognition of current abuse and highlights yet again that the horror of abuse remains part of the tragic experience of too many Irish children." Consequently, when talking about rape or suicide, we no longer are talking about adults, as historically we have done.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Deputy Paschal Donohoe)<recordedTime time="2013-10-10T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_587">I thank Deputy Maloney for raising this issue and will address the specific points he made. I also heard the media reports this morning to which he referred and join the Deputy in extending Members' thoughts to this family at this difficult time and hoping for the recovery of their son, who is in hospital at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_588"> It is highly appropriate that the Deputy should raise this issue today, which is World Mental Health Day.</p>
            <p eId="para_589">Many of the issues to which he referred could not be raised on a more appropriate day. He has identified many difficulties associated with growing up, particularly for young people on reaching their teenage years. While there is a large number of positive developments open to them in terms of the freedoms and technology that are available, there is a darker side too with regard to the risks and dangers posed to them, as identified by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_590"> The key message to be conveyed is the need to foster a culture whereby all those enduring mental health difficulties, including young people, do not hesitate to seek and receive appropriate help. Physical and emotional development during adolescence can obviously bring its own stresses of many kinds. In order to nurture our children, and ensure they maximise their potential to develop into well-adjusted adults, we must respond properly to their social and emotional needs. The foundation for good mental health is obviously laid in the early years. Society as a whole benefits from investing in children and adolescents on many fronts. The Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is acutely aware of the need to prioritise mental health services in this area, including an integrated and effective approach to educational aspects. The vulnerability of youth is demonstrated by the fact that this is when about 75% of mental illnesses first emerge. The community mental health model asserts the principle of placing vulnerable children, or families, at the centre of the care process. If we can identify issues as they emerge, research tells us that early, and often brief, intervention prevents longer-term pain and lost opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_591"> The Government, in line with A Vision for Change,<i>
							</i>has prioritised mental health services through providing €70 million over the last two years for many new initiatives. This year the HSE will have funding of approximately €730 million for mental health, and a significant proportion of this is directed, in partnership with non-statutory agencies, towards young people. In addition to the services provided by the HSE child and adolescent mental health service, significant work is being done, for example, by organisations such as Jigsaw or through the See Change and Make a Ripple campaigns. A new action plan on bullying<b>
							</b>was launched on 29 January last by the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to help prevent and tackle bullying at primary and second level.</p>
            <p eId="para_592"> In addition, the National Office for Suicide Prevention in partnership with the Department of Education and Skills has developed national guidelines on mental health and suicide prevention for the post-primary school sector. I am conscious also that many reports and other sources have rightly highlighted the need to better tackle the issue raised by the Deputy. The Government will continue to take account fully of these in progressing mental health well-being for young people, in line with evolving service priorities and overall resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_593">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I am glad he referred to the issue of bullying which I omitted to mention. It is an ever-increasing difficulty among school-going children in particular which seems to have reached almost phenomenal rates. Anyone who engages with school teachers will confirm that. There seems to be a spate of it from one end of the country to the other. It is not an urban phenomenon, rather it is widespread. As some reports have indicated, there is a very strong link between the cowardly practice of bullying one's peers and suicide, an issue to which the Minister of State and I have alluded.</p>
            <p eId="para_594"> A strong point was made by Dr. Rosaleen McElvaney, the author of the Children's Mental Health Coalition report, Someone to Care, a report to which the Minister may have referred. Dr. McElvaney acknowledged the considerable challenges in providing care for children in the mental health sphere. It is a difficult one. She said there is "a clear need for a shared understanding and common language". Dr. McElvaney also said: </p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_595">For example, many young people are involved with the youth justice system due to mental health difficulties that are left unaddressed. We need a process that diverts them towards community services that address their needs. Earlier intervention and support will lead to better outcomes for all involved.</p>

            <p eId="para_596">The Deputy in his contribution made reference to a phase of "looking into the mirror" and about our having to confront things about our society that are both good and bad. There is no doubt that the huge difficulties and challenges our young people face with respect to their mental health is one part of the jigsaw in terms of ensuring we have a society that looks after people who need help while also recognising that essential public services must be funded and in place to deal with the type of difficulties to which the Deputy referred.</p>
            <p eId="para_597"> The Deputy made reference to A Vision for Change. As he may be aware, A Vision for Change identifies the need for 80 child and adolescent child and psychiatric inpatient beds for the most vulnerable, who need the care and the service they deserve, and we must ensure they can be provided for them in the right place. Currently, 39 such beds are available and there are plans in place to put additional beds and services in place. A further eight beds will be commissioned in Cork and a further five beds will reopen in Galway by the end of the year. A second phase in terms of a child and adolescent unit at St. Vincent's Hospital in Fairview will be put in place to increase capacity from 12 to 18 beds by the end of 2013. Putting in place those services will be an essential part of the broader set of services that must be available to deal with the issue the Deputy identified. It is apt that he should raise it today, World Mental Health Day. I offer our thoughts and sympathies to the family dealing with the terrible difficulty that prompted Deputy Maloney to raise this issue in the House.</p>

            <from>Deputy Shane Ross<recordedTime time="2013-10-10T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_598">I address this issue in the context of many people who have approached me on it and which is obviously an increasingly difficult problem for a large number of people. It is the issue of stepfathers or stepmothers voluntarily adopting children but the real issue is where their partner, and in most cases it is the natural mother of the child, is forced to adopt the child also. I will give a simple example, with which the Minister of State will be familiar, of where a mother has a child, she parts with the natural father, she takes on another partner and the other partner volunteers to adopt that child. The child's natural father disappears off the scene but the mother, by law, also has to adopt the child.</p>
            <p eId="para_599"> The reason I believe that is wrong and should be remedied is because many mothers find this particularly offensive. It causes them an enormous amount of stress because they believe something has been taken away from them. It is difficult to explain often in strictly logical and legal terms and they have to come back and ask the State if they can now adopt their child when all that really is happening is that their new partner is volunteering and wanting to adopt the child. That is not just an emotional intrusion. The process whereby this is done is also an intrusion upon their lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_600">Whereas it is both right and fair that the adoptive father - as is the position in the case to which I refer but it could also be an adoptive mother - should be subject to some form of observation, scrutiny and approval, it seems absurd that the birth mother should also be subject to the latter when she has kept the child all along. I am familiar with many cases where social workers came into the house in which all three parties - mother, prospective father and child - live and spent a great deal of time with them. He or she then proceeded to interview them and eventually granted approval to the adoptive father and the natural mother to adopt the child.</p>
            <p eId="para_601"> The Minister will understand that it is unfair to place people under pressure of this sort. It would not happen unless they were simply and solely deciding to do something which is in the interests of the child, namely, to give him or her another - and an official - parent. He or she would not otherwise have two parents as a result of the circumstances which obtain. I cannot see anything wrong with issuing birth certificates containing the names of all three parents, namely, the natural mother, the natural father and the adoptive father. This is a problem with gives rise to great emotion and which, due to changes in society, is increasing in frequency. It would be very easy to put matters right in respect of by introducing a small number of legal changes.</p>

            <from>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Deputy Frances Fitzgerald)<recordedTime time="2013-10-10T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_602">I thank Deputy Ross for raising this issue. I am committed, in conjunction with my Government colleagues, to bringing forward amending legislation to address current anomalies with respect to adoption by step-parents. As the Deputy indicated, those anomalies include the requirement - as part of step-parent adoption - for a natural parent to adopt his or her own child, including compliance with the requirements associated with the adoption process. In other words and as the Deputy highlighted, such parents must undergo the adoption procedure as if the child were a stranger to them. It is almost like starting out afresh. A further anomaly relates to the creation of a wholly new birth certificate recognising the newly-adoptive parents and possibly removing the recognition of a birth parent, very often the father.</p>
            <p eId="para_603"> These provisions originated in legislation in 1952 and were further consolidated, but not addressed, in the Adoption Act 2010, which was brought forward by the previous Government. The 2010 Act is complex and there a number of issues - including that under discussion - which have arisen since its enactment. I have indicated previously that I believe it timely to consider a review of some of the policy matters that arose in the Act. In addition to the issue of step-parent adoption, a number of other matters must be considered in the context of a review of the Adoption Act. These include the rights of birth mothers and birth fathers and issues relating to the right to an assessment. There is an automatic right to assessment in this country and the number of people being assessed far exceeds the number of children suitable or available for adoption. This means there is a major imbalance. Other issues which have arisen relate to the age of prospective adoptive parents, the tenure of declarations of eligibility and suitability, etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_604"> I appreciate the difficulties and frustration the anomalies relating to step-parent adoption pose for many families. I should point out that a cornerstone of the Adoption Act 2010 is the consent of the natural parents, which is a legal basis of all adoptions. This underpins the process for the subsequent adoption of a child by a new family unit. However, I understand that this places natural parents in a difficult position in the area of step-parent adoptions. I am of the view that the law must be changed in order that birth parents will no longer be obliged to adopt their own children in order to facilitate adoption by step-parents. It is not appropriate that we continue to subject birth parents to outdated legal conventions when it comes to step-parent adoption.</p>
            <p eId="para_605"> Based on my concerns, a number of months ago I sought clarification on the constitutional and legal position in respect of this matter. We had been informed that a number of constitutional issues apply. However, I am now confident - on the basis of legal advice I sought and received - that there are no constitutional barriers to legislative change in this area. Many people will welcome that fact. I accept that some complex legal and policy issues remain and that these need to be resolved within the broader framework of the family law relating to parentage and guardianship. Where the natural father is still alive and where there may be ongoing contact or whatever, guardianship - if the position relating to it were to be made more flexible - might be the more appropriate legal option for step-parents in certain circumstances. This would tie in with a more open approach to adoption. However, I appreciate that certain couples would prefer adoption as opposed to guardianship.</p>
            <p eId="para_606"> I am working with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, who will be bringing forward a Bill in the near future. Some of the issues I have just outlined will be addressed in that legislation. I am preparing adoption legislation which arises on foot of the result in the referendum on children's rights. The legislation would provide an appropriate mechanism by means of which the matter under discussion might be dealt with.</p>

            <p eId="para_607">I thank the Minister for her reply, which is enlightened in sentiment but perhaps somewhat unclear in the context of intention and timing. I am delighted that there are no constitutional difficulties in respect of this matter. I did not anticipate any such difficulties. When I heard the words "complex" and "review", I become concerned that nothing is going to happen or that a matter will be placed on the long finger to such a degree that it will fall to a future generation or Government to address it. In that context, I understand that problems arise in the context of addressing the overall issue of adoption.</p>
            <p eId="para_608"> I am not asking the Minister to immediately address all the anomalies thrown up by the 2010 Act. I am simply requesting that she give a commitment to the effect that action will be taken in order that it will no longer be necessary for natural parents to be obliged to adopt their own children. What I am seeking is nothing more complicated than that. I do not believe what I am suggesting would have any complex knock-on effects in respect of other matters. I am merely representing the person in the position I have outlined who finds it emotionally offensive and practically difficult to do that about which we are talking. Perhaps the Minister might provide a commitment to the effect that the particular item to which I refer and which is causing so much trouble could be addressed in isolation and prior to all other matters. What is so offensive is that a mother or a father should be obliged to go before the Adoption Board and ask to adopt her or his own child. The provision in this regard should be deleted from the adoption legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_609">If it were that simple, I would proceed in the manner outlined by Deputy Ross. I am considering the precise implications of changing the position. I understand why he might advocate that we should just bring an end to what is happening, particularly as it would not have implications for any other approaches to adoption and consent. However, I am of the view that there are implications for other aspects of the adoption process. I am teasing out precisely what are those implications. I want to change the position in legislation and I will do so as soon as possible. I am informed that if we were to make the change the Deputy suggests, it would have a knock-on effect on other aspects of the legislation. As stated, however, the new parentage Bill, which is due to be introduced either prior to the end of this year or earlier next year, will provide an opportunity to make some changes. I will deal with this issue in the context of the adoption legislation I propose to introduce.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith<recordedTime time="2013-10-10T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_611">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_612">The latest claim of responsibility by so-called dissident republicans for the murder of a man found in north Belfast yesterday is a dark reminder of the grave threats that unfortunately still hang over Northern Ireland. I am very loth to use the description "dissidents" to identify the criminals involved or to debase the term "republican" by associating it with them. Yesterday's grim discovery was sharp proof of the brutal criminality by a small number who continue to stalk Northern Ireland. Similarly, the brutal murder in Derry today is another source of serious concern, and I note comments attributed to the SDLP Assembly Member, Pat Ramsey, on<i> The Irish Times</i> website which read as follows: "there is no doubt whatsoever that dissidents were involved".</p>
            <p eId="para_613"> These murders come at a critical juncture in the peace process. The arrival of Ambassador Haass and Dr. Megan O'Sullivan represents a real opportunity to give the process a badly needed shot in the arm and, indeed, a new impetus. The politics of division embraced by Sinn Féin and the DUP has crippled necessary further progress on that valuable peace process. They both appear to be content with playing to their respective galleries for partisan gain. That is not the leadership which would be expected from an executive. This atmosphere of mutual stagnation is a fertile breeding ground for dissident activity and the kind of loyalist thuggery we saw during the flag protests.</p>
            <p eId="para_614"> In a fragile society like Northern Ireland, if the institutions fail to bring about real benefits on the bread and butter issues of politics, it inevitably creates a climate for violence by a small number in some communities. The simmering threat by violent groups that occasionally flares up, as we saw yesterday, is a major concern and must be addressed by the Northern Ireland Executive supported by the Irish and British Governments. The crippling impact loyalist groups had on Belfast city centre at the end of last year and in the early months of this year and the devastating impact it had on the local economy is a testament to the unfinished business of the peace process.</p>
            <p eId="para_615"> It goes without saying that progress achieved in the Good Friday Agreement and, indeed, in the St. Andrews Agreement has been of enormous benefit to us all on this island. As we know, the Republic of Ireland is a key stakeholder in that process. In its submission to the Haass panel, Fianna Fáil affirmed the need to ensure the Republic, in co-operation with Britain, continues to act as guarantor for the process and continues to assist in driving it on. The brutal murder discovered yesterday should spur on the important work with which we are charged. The Government simply cannot afford to neglect Northern Ireland nor can the British Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_616"> The Government should take action to deal with a number of specific issues. One is to ensure the ongoing co-operation of the Garda and PSNI. That is a working relationship we have all seen improve dramatically over the past decade. The resource restraints being placed on the Garda should not interfere with its vital work in tackling the terrorist threat in Northern Ireland. The second is supporting the Haass panel and encouraging it not to go short simply for the sake of a deal. This is a chance to confront the unfinished business of the peace process. It is an opportunity to move Northern Ireland further along that path and to realise that the peace process is about more than just the absence of violence. However, that is not to underestimate in any way the importance of ridding our society of that violence.</p>
            <p eId="para_617"> The Government has to step up to its historic responsibilities, and the current juncture is a real chance to do so. Yesterday's discovery should act as a further motivation to rise to these challenges.</p>

            <p eId="para_618">I join the Tánaiste in offering sincere sympathies to the families of the two men murdered in north Belfast and in Derry. We both utterly condemn these vicious, brutal and cowardly murders, as has Deputy Smith.</p>
            <p eId="para_619"> As the Tánaiste stated earlier, the people of Belfast and Derry and, indeed, people all over Ireland have moved on. There is no justification for crimes against the community. While investigations are at an early stage, it seems clear that criminal terrorists in the guise of so-called dissident republicans were involved. I noted the Deputy's reluctance to use the words "dissident" and "republican" in his description of them, with which I entirely agree. As is clear to us all, the only motivation for these murders is self-interest as opposed to any broader agenda for the communities in Northern Ireland or in our State. My colleagues in this House are at one with me in expressing horror at what has happened. These people have no mandate and their actions lead nowhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_620"> The Deputy will know that these so-called dissident republicans are criminal terrorists who will readily use lethal violence in pursuit of their own, often personal, ends. They have more than just a passing acquaintance with organised crime to fund their activities and lifestyles, and they have no regard for life or law.</p>
            <p eId="para_621"> The Minister for Justice and Equality and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland held one of their regular meetings on 23 September to discuss matters of mutual interest, including the security situation and ongoing efforts to combat terrorism. The threats to peace posed by dissident groups are undoubtedly serious. Since 2009, a series of violent attacks by these dissident groups has taken place, resulting in injuries and in the deaths of two British Army personnel, two PSNI officers and a member of the Northern Ireland Prison Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_622"> The deaths of Sappers Quinsey and Azimkar, Constable Carroll, Constable Kerr and Mr. David Black, the routine so-called punishment attacks and murders of civilians along with the continuing threats against the Police Service of Northern Ireland are viewed with widespread revulsion across society on the island of Ireland. It is clear that these people enjoy no popular support within the community. They have nothing to offer the people and they have been overwhelmingly rejected.</p>
            <p eId="para_623"> The Deputy asked this Government to live up to its role and obligations in the North. I assure him of our continued commitment to do so. The Tánaiste has continued to engage in intensive discussions with political, civic and community leaders in recent months. In his regular discussions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, he has emphasised the Government's role as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement. Both Governments have restated their support for the Executive's work towards creating a shared society and prosperous economy in Northern Ireland, as outlined in the Executive's Together: Building a United Community strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_624"> During his recent visit to Belfast, and in forthcoming visits to Derry, Armagh and Belfast, the Tánaiste has met, and will continue to meet, community and business leaders in support of their ongoing work towards a reconciled and prosperous future for everyone on this island. In his contacts with political leaders in Northern Ireland, he has urged them to seize the opportunity presented by the Haass talks to deal with the contentious issues of flags, parades and the past.</p>
            <p eId="para_625"> The Deputy can be assured of the continued commitment of the Government to ensure the Garda Commissioner and the PSNI Chief Constable place strong emphasis on the close and high quality co-operation between the two police services which is essential to face down this paramilitary threat.</p>

            <p eId="para_626">I share the Minister of State's revulsion and the comments he made on behalf of the Tánaiste in regard to these desperate murders. I happened to be in my office at 1 o'clock today and I listened to Tommy Gorman report from Northern Ireland. I did not think we would be back to the days when we would have to listen to a report about two murders linked to the activity of those terror groups. We need constantly to send out a very clear message that we need to be vigilant and diligent in regard to the peace process. While it does not in any way excuse violence or terrorism, there are some communities, in particular in the urban areas, which need investment in education, in upskilling their people and in jobs, but that is not easy.</p>
            <p eId="para_627">I do not say that to excuse violence or terrorism in any way. As we are debating Northern Ireland today, we should be focusing on the major investment conference that takes place in Belfast tomorrow. I did not think we would have to speak about a matter of major concern like the appalling deaths of two people at the hands of so-called dissidents. The Garda Síochána and the PSNI should receive absolute and total co-operation from every right-minded person on this island as they hunt down the murderers and bring them to justice.</p>

            <p eId="para_628">I have taken careful note of Deputy Smith's remarks. As he said, there is no rationale for acts of terrorism like the killings of recent days. Like the Deputy, I did not think I would have to speak about two murders in the week of a conference that has been organised to try to create a prosperous and inclusive society and ensure Northern Ireland will have the kind of bright future we all want for it. The Deputy referred to a number of areas in which the Government needs to engage. I can categorically assure him that we strongly support the process in Northern Ireland. He spoke about the need for close co-operation between the PSNI and the Garda Síochána and said the two police forces need the right support to do all of their work. As I indicated in my opening statement, both forces and both Governments could not be more supportive of the need for tight and integrated co-operation to deal with the criminality that is at the heart of the difficulties mentioned by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_629"> I have heard Deputy Smith raise the Haass process on a number of occasions in this House. I was present last week when the Tánaiste outlined the Government's support for it. The Tánaiste and his Government colleagues have engaged in dialogue as part of that process. We are doing all we can to ensure it is successful and inclusive. The Deputy spoke about the need for broader and continued Government engagement in Northern Ireland. When the Tánaiste responded to this point earlier today, he made it clear that he has planned a number of visits to the North, as one would expect. As a sign of my commitment and that of the Department of the Taoiseach to this issue, I will visit Stormont next Wednesday to talk about the broader issue of Europe, with specific reference to the Government's commitment to supporting European investment in the North.</p>
            <p eId="para_630"> Of course the Deputy is correct when he suggests that the best antidote to this kind of terror and criminality is a prosperous and secure future for all the communities in the North. In addition to the work being done by the PSNI and the Garda to deal with the terrible murders that have been mentioned, it should be emphasised that the Government, Deputy Smith and all the other Deputies in this House will continue to do all we can to ensure investment is in place to prevent people from being tempted by the kinds of incentives referred to by the Deputy.</p>

            <from>Deputy Paudie Coffey<recordedTime time="2013-10-10T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_631">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important topic. I am glad the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is in attendance in the Chamber to hear my concerns in this regard. Over the years, the manufacturing sector has contributed substantially and positively to the Irish economy. It has provided good and honest employment to thousands of workers and their families. I believe the manufacturing sector was neglected during the Celtic tiger years, unfortunately. Competitiveness was lost and priority was given to an unsustainable construction sector. We lost our focus on manufacturing.</p>
            <p eId="para_632"> As the Minister knows, Waterford city and the rest of the south east have traditionally had a strong manufacturing base due to the presence of companies like Waterford Crystal, Waterford Stanley, ABB, Teva, Honeywell, Bausch and Lomb and GlaxoSmithKline. Many hundreds of small and medium sized enterprises in the region have been and are very productive in the manufacturing sector. The thousands of jobs provided by these companies have sustained the lives of workers and their families, and in turn the local economy, for many years. That is why we cannot give up on this essential sector. It needs continued Government focus and support.</p>
            <p eId="para_633"> Bausch and Lomb continues to employ over 1,700 people in Waterford city. GlaxoSmithKline employs over 750 people in its Dungarvan plant. Teva employs more than 450 people and Waterford Stanley employs more than 100 people. Small and medium sized enterprises in the area continue to employ thousands of people in the manufacturing sector. We heard the sad news on Tuesday that Honeywell, which is a strong traditional company in Waterford, had announced a redundancy programme for 74 of its employees. The only positive thing I can take from this devastating news for these employees and their families is that the company is committed to retaining 700 jobs in the city. The redundant workers must be given every assistance and support at this difficult time. More important, they need to be given some hope that they have a real prospect of finding new employment opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_634"> Today, I carry a message directly from the people of Waterford to the floor of this Chamber and to the Minister. Waterford city and the south east region are in urgent need of Government assistance and intervention to achieve economic recovery. We all know the region has suffered and continues to suffer disproportionately by comparison with the rest of the country. It is very difficult and frustrating to note that more than 3,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost in Waterford and the south east region over the last six years. I know that the Minister and IDA Ireland are doing their best and have been very active over the past couple of years. IDA Ireland visits to Waterford have increased substantially. According to figures I have seen, there were 11 such visits in 2011, 26 in 2012 and 12 to date in 2013. We need delivery on that now. We need to see some foreign direct investment in Waterford city.</p>
            <p eId="para_635"> The Government and the Minister have been proactive. We have seen some positive progress since we came into government, having taken the reins of power during the worst economic crisis this country has ever seen. I would like to compare the employment situation in the south east in June 2011 with the position in June 2013. The number of people in employment in the region increased by approximately 3,000 during that period. I welcome that increase. The unemployment rate in the region has decreased from a high of over 20% to the current figure of 18.3%, which is still far too high in comparison with the State unemployment figure of 13.3% last month. The live register in Waterford is now at its lowest level since April 2009. This is further progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_636"> I have mentioned some positive statistics, but I emphasise that we are starting from a very low employment base. The job losses in Honeywell highlight the fact that the recovery in Waterford and the south east is extremely fragile. Additional help is now required to address the higher than normal unemployment rates being experienced in Waterford and the rest of the south-east region. Direct Government intervention is required to help us at this stage.</p>

            <from>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Richard Bruton)<recordedTime time="2013-10-10T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_637">I thank Deputy Coffey for raising this important issue. I would like to express my sympathy to those workers who are affected by Honeywell's decision. Obviously, I share the Deputy's concern about the loss of jobs at Honeywell. As the Deputy knows, this turbo-technology company notified IDA Ireland on 8 October that due to forecasted reductions in demand for its products, it intends to begin a voluntary redundancy programme to reduce its current workforce by up to 34 positions by the end of November.</p>
            <p eId="para_638"> Honeywell currently employs 375 people in Waterford. It has informed its employees of its plans to make these redundancies. It manufactures and supplies turbo-wheels to Honeywell turbo-charger assembly sites in Italy, the Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia. These sites sell to automotive engine manufacturers globally. Honeywell's parent company, Honeywell International Inc., is a diversified technology and manufacturing company that serves customers worldwide with aerospace products and services, control sensing and security technologies, automotive products including turbo-chargers, specialty chemicals, electronic and advanced materials and process technology for refining petrochemicals.</p>
            <p eId="para_639"> Honeywell in Waterford has had to review its business structures to increase its competitiveness as the global automotive industry has become increasingly more competitive. Car demand is weak in Europe at present, with many automotive companies realigning production with current demand. The company will now enter a consultation process with the workforce in Waterford. It is expected that the redundancies will be voluntary, in line with previous reductions. We are seeing more and more companies engaging in this type of restructuring, where companies are looking strategically at opportunities in the global market and taking steps, such as making redundancies, to position themselves for future growth. The proposed redundancies in Waterford are part of the adjustments the company is making to meet the evolving needs of the business and to remain competitive in a challenging global environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_640">Honeywell has two sites in Waterford involved in the parent companies activities, which I am glad to say will not be affected by the proposed redundancies. IDA Ireland will discuss the plans for the site with the company and will remain in regular contact with local management.</p>
            <p eId="para_641"> On Deputy Coffey's wider issue, I fully recognise that manufacturing has been neglected. It suffered through a loss of competitiveness, which resulted in a loss of markets, leading to a tough attrition on employment and manufacturing. Overall, there has been a massive decline in employment in the sector from about 300,000 to 200,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_642"> There are opportunities in the manufacturing sector, and I established a forum to look at those. Next year, we will introduce a national step change initiative to assist manufacturing companies, both Irish and non-Irish, to lift their capability and open up new markets. Improved competitiveness, changes in the markets and increasing personalisation or customisation of product lines have opened up opportunities and we need to seize those, which is what the initiative is about.</p>
            <p eId="para_643"> I also recognise the point Deputy Coffey rightly made that Waterford and the south east have suffered disproportionately. As the Deputy knows, after the TalkTalk closure, I established a forum on the south east and put a special focus on Waterford through the IDA and, as the Deputy acknowledged, there has been a big step up in activity. We have had some successes. For example, Nypro, a multinational company, made a significant investment in Waterford. We have further ambitions. It is encouraging also to see in the south east a strong resurgence of many indigenous enterprises, including Glanbia, Dawn Meats, Eishtec, which has been stellar in its performance since the closure of TalkTalk, and FeedHenry. There is good activity in the area, but I will continue the emphasis on the south east and to target my activities.</p>

            <p eId="para_644"> I acknowledge the Minister's response. I appreciate that he has visited Waterford and is working to improve the economic lot of the citizens of Waterford and the south east.</p>
            <p eId="para_645"> Since TalkTalk's high profile closure, we have seen economic reports. Indeed, I welcome the Forfás economic development strategy. The Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation's south-east economic development strategy was also published recently and we also have the DKM economic strategy for Waterford city and county. The reports highlight the same issues and show what city and regional weaknesses need to be addressed. Some of those need direct Government support and intervention. I will name some of the requirements, but key is the establishment of a regional technological university. That is in the programme for Government, and it needs to be delivered as soon as possible in order that we can help the economy of Waterford and the south east. Under the Minister's direct responsibility is the location of a regional director for the IDA. The joint committee's report and the economic strategy for the region identify that we are at a disadvantage because we do not have a regional director for the IDA located in the gateway city of Waterford. That issue must be addressed. Furthermore, I know that the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brian Hayes, is looking into matters at the Mount Congreve gardens, which are being run by the Office of Public Works. That international attraction can help the region's economy. In addition, the extension of the runway at Waterford Airport also needs to be looked at. Those are some key areas where Government intervention and support will help to address the huge deficits in economic activity and employment figures in Waterford and the south east.</p>
            <p eId="para_646"> Only four Deputies represent this active constituency. Waterford is the gateway for the south east. We are demanding Government support. In fact, we expect Waterford to be supported on the same level as other cities. I ask the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues to give Waterford the focus it deserves. There are positive signs. As I have mentioned, 3,000 more people are employed in the Waterford and south-east region than there were when this Government came into office, but we need to see further progress.</p>

            <p eId="para_647">I fully recognise, and this came out in the south-east action forum we established, that there are serious structural problems in Waterford and the south east that go beyond, if one likes, enterprise agency activity. Continuous investment is needed in those areas. There also needs to be collaboration across many interests, which is a positive feature arising from the forum's work. In establishing what are the competitive advantages of the region and promoting them effectively, there are stellar organisations, such as Waterford Institute of Technology, WIT, which is Willie Donnelly's operation. That impressive operation has been a significant magnet for new start-ups.</p>
            <p eId="para_648"> I recognise that there are deeper and wider problems, and I look forward to meeting the joint committee and going through its report. As Deputy Coffey rightly recognises, from the enterprise perspective, although there is a long way to go, there are positive trends in the south east's employment. Our task is to consolidate and expand that progress.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation<recordedTime time="2013-10-10T16:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_650"> I thank Deputy Calleary for raising this important issue. Microfinance Ireland, MFI, began operations in October 2012. It is the first time such a scheme has been put in place in Ireland. By its nature, the scheme is demand driven. To date there have been 295 applications and 107 approvals for a sum of €1.62 million. Some 237 jobs are estimated to have been supported through the scheme. We had hoped at the outset that there would be 500 applicants and a drawdown of €8.8 million. We all have the same objective of making people more aware of the scheme and its benefits.</p>
            <p eId="para_651"> A key challenge for MFI is to ensure people are aware there is support for new and existing viable microenterprises with perceived or real higher trading risk and which have been refused credit by banks. The modification that banks no longer have to refuse applications is welcome. I am glad to announce that change as banks were taking too long to make decisions. We have received clarification that a general indicative approach from the bank is sufficient ground on which to make an application. That will accelerate applications considerably, which is good news. An information pack will be delivered to all Deputies over the coming week with details of the revised website and new structures to promote this end. There are ongoing promotional and awareness activities to ensure awareness of the scheme is promoted to its full potential among relevant microbusiness groups across all sectors of business.</p>
            <p eId="para_652"> National and local radio advertising continued throughout the period of January to June 2013. During this period, two main bursts of advertising were commissioned to support both national and local audience reach, including Newstalk, an RTE prime time listenership radio package and 21 local radio stations. MFI has also undertaken a number of other publicity and awareness raising activities, including targeted media releases resulting in coverage in various newspapers, access to finance seminars, breakfast briefings, etc. It is doing its utmost to promote the scheme. Banks were taking too long to give a refusal because there was a requirement for a certification letter. As the main news today is that that is no longer necessary, it will be more effective than any campaign.</p>

            <p eId="para_653">I thank Minister of State, Deputy Perry and welcome the Minister, Deputy Bruton, back from his temporary leave of absence. I hope this gig goes better than that one did.</p>
            <p eId="para_654"> I welcome the change outlined by the Minister of State which needs to be shouted from the rooftops to applicants under the microfinance scheme. I still have queries about the pricing of the scheme. The interest rates are still very expensive, among other issues. The most recent ISME survey to which 1,026 owner-managers responded indicated the average decision time on lending had expanded from four to five weeks. I realise the survey was carried out over the summer period, but both Ministers know there are serious delays in bank decision-making. The overall issue of SME finance is still very important. I have tried on several occasions to get answers to a number of questions which keep being passed up the line to the Department of Finance. Concerning really good SMEs which are trading well but which, because of property issues which arose back in the so-called boom times, are experiencing difficulties, has the Department engaged with the banks in terms of perhaps offering a business version of the split mortgage that would allow businesses to rest that debt, continue to trade and be in a position to service the debt in a number of years?</p>
            <p eId="para_655">What kind of engagement has the Minister of State had around that idea or what kind of proposals has he made to the banks for viable day-to-day businesses that are under huge pressure due to property investments? If they can be released from that pressure, they can grow their business and employment and be able to service that debt at some stage in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_656">In respect of microfinance, there will be a major event entitled Taking Care of Business in Dublin on 23 October. Other measures include the midlands think tank awareness and local enterprise offices which will be a real vehicle for pushing the 25,000 applications. The County Enterprise Boards (Dissolution) Bill is going through Seanad Éireann.</p>
            <p eId="para_657"> In respect of Deputy Calleary's question about the banks, they are very much domestic banks and the Government has ring-fenced €8 billion for the indigenous business population. It is advised that people make applications. Banks have given a significant commitment to the Government and are looking very seriously at where jobs are attached because the 200,000 companies employing 700,000 people are the backbone of the economy. The purpose of government is business. Without doubt, the banks need viable companies. Where people are making a real-time application, where proper due diligence is done on the merits of a business and where they can separate, the banks are quite supportive of that application. The head of the Credit Review Office, John Trethowen, has recommended that the limits on the threshold for appeals by small businesses to the office be extended. The budget will be very much based on business and entrepreneurial activity in the economy but, equally, the support of companies who find themselves with a massive property portfolio and where the viability of the business is questionable. Both of the two banks that are sponsored by the State to a large degree are very much engaging with businesspeople and where people have been refused, there is the code of conduct for banking which has been revised. People can appeal a decision within 21 days. I expect that the recommendation to the Government by Mr. Trethowen that the new limits for appeals to the Credit Review Office be extended from €500,000 to €3 million will be approved. If approved, it will certainly open the facility for businesspeople to fall into a group from which they were previously excluded.</p>

            <p eId="para_658">In respect of the credit guarantee and microfinance schemes, this is the time of year when the self-assessment deadline is due. I would encourage Microfinance Ireland to use that database as Revenue is communicating with all self-assessed people to promote the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_659"> We really need to become serious about the Department pushing the Department of Finance to push the banks about some sort of viable product for splitting viable businesses from overhanging debt and property-rated loans that these businesses will service in time. At least, it will give them the break to expand their businesses and employment. I would like to see the Minister of State's Department put pressure on the Department of Finance and for it to be the champion of some model like that. We are offering domestic mortgage holders a range of solutions but this is something that would be directly relevant to many really good businesses if they could move away from their debt - not abandoning it but paying it in time - and to release their capital and energy to grow their business and employment.</p>

            <p eId="para_660">I assure the Deputy that the Minister is actively working with the Minister for Finance with regard to the potential for the business sector. We recognise fully that the potential of Ireland lies in its 200,000 small businesses. The banks have very much obliged to support viable companies. We have had excellent facilitation from the Credit Review Office, which has been very successful in a number of applications that had been refused by the bank. There is a better understanding where there would be risk of collateral security and the banks are very much obliged to take on board the guarantee given by the State. The most important micro is the microfinance fund. Microfinance Ireland assured me today that all Deputies will have a new promotional pack that they could leave in their offices so that people can see it when they come to them about microfinance, the personal loan guarantee and the rest of the suite of opportunities and engage directly with the banks because many people do not go through the appeal process. We want to ensure that they do and benchmark the 21 days after which the bank is duty bound to come back with a decision.</p>

            <p eId="para_662">The number of Irish emigrants who have returned to Ireland in the past two years is estimated at 36,000. The CSO does not track their subsequent entry to employment. At a macro level, the Government's strategy is to rebuild the economy and accelerate the transition to a sustainable, jobs-rich economy based on enterprise, innovation and exports. It is in this way that we will create the environment in which sustainable jobs will be created, living standards will be raised and Ireland will be regarded as an attractive location in which to live and work.</p>
            <p eId="para_663"> I fully recognise the increase in emigration that has occurred since the onset of our economic crisis. I firmly believe that job creation is the most effective policy to tackle emigration. This Department's focus is on employment creation in the enterprise sector. We are doing this through the Action Plan for Jobs and have already seen the positive results of the action being taken across the whole of Government to support the enterprise sector to sustain existing jobs and create new ones. In the past 12 months, an estimated 39,000 jobs have been created in the private sector. It is estimated that over 90% of new jobs have gone to Irish nationals. These opportunities go to a mix of people - some leaving the live register, some entering the labour market for the first time and some returning emigrants. There are many initiatives from other Departments that seek to provide alternative routes for those who might be considering emigration. JobBridge, Springboard, Momentum and JobPlus are all new initiatives supplementing existing programmes in FÁS and the Department of Social Protection.</p>

            <p eId="para_664">While 56,000 people came into the State, the CSO figures illustrate that 89,000 people have emigrated over the past year. This figure translates to 1,700 people leaving every week. The recent National Youth Council report found that a quarter of the population had a direct experience of emigration of a close family member and that half of all 18 to 24-year-olds would consider emigrating. We are losing a generation. The Government cannot kid itself that this is acceptable or a lifestyle choice. The recent UCC study by Emigre Project found that 62% of emigrants were graduates. Surprisingly, 47% were in full-time employment while 13% worked part-time and only 23% were unemployed. Most left due to lack of opportunity. Only 22% believe that it is likely that they will return in the next three years.</p>
            <p eId="para_665"> Since the Government came to power, 43% of the jobs created have been part-time and over one third of all part-time workers are under-employed. What is the Government doing to develop high-quality, full-time jobs and opportunities? What target is it setting to reduce emigration and what targets has the Minister set for getting returning emigrants into employment in the State? </p>

            <p eId="para_666">I did not in any way indicate that the level of emigration was satisfactory. Virtually all of the 39,000 jobs created in the past 12 months are full-time. The figures quoted by the Deputy were earlier in the recovery period. What we are seeing is that, initially, there was a concentration on part-time work but as job expansion has gained a foothold, we are seeing a predominance of full-time employment so that is an improvement.</p>
            <p eId="para_667"> I acknowledge that there is a very significant loss of people with graduate skills. That is undoubtedly the case. Our target has essentially been one of 100,000 additional people at work. That has been the target we set and at the core of that is a successful enterprise strategy. The allocation of those opportunities as between people coming from the live register, people entering the labour market for the first time or returning emigrants is not easy to influence. I see our primary task as creating the opportunities. The pattern has been that in previous recessions, when we get a recovery going, many of the people who left during the recession return with considerable skills and experience. Our central focus is to make this economy strong and sustainable and ensure that the employment sectors we grow are deeply rooted and that people can have confidence in them.</p>

            <p eId="para_669">Setting targets for return is tricky. Undoubtedly, we will see a return when we have a strong economy. The Deputy indicated that there is an ebb and flow every year of people who leave Ireland and come back. Even during the boom, 13,000 people were leaving Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_670">Even now a significant number of Irish people are coming back. The tide ebbs and flows.</p>
            <p eId="para_671"> I acknowledge that an issue arises in regard to mismatch of skills. We must ensure a closer connection between the choices young people make in education and the opportunities that are available to them. That is a challenge and it is well known we cannot fill positions in certain areas from Irish trained people. We need to work on ways to allow more people to find opportunities at home. Work is being done in that regard through Springboard and the Minister for Education and Skills has committed to doubling the number of ICT graduates over a five year period as part of a joint initiative with my Department. Positive programmes are being developed to address the question of appropriate skills for the growth sectors.</p>

            <p eId="para_672">3. <b>Deputy Shane Ross</b> asked the <b>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</b> in view of the latest official forecast for employment, if he will provide a breakdown of the number of jobs he and his Department anticipate being created by each significant sector in the economy, including, specifically, from the high-tech sector, the multinational sector, State enterprise, small and medium businesses, the financial services sector, and agriculture and food, in the next three to five years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_673">Both the Department of Finance and the ESRI have this week produced improved employment forecasts for 2013 and 2014. These improved forecasts are supported by the latest employment statistics published by the Central Statistics Office, which show that employment increased by 33,800 in the year to quarter two of 2013 net of a reduction of 5,400 in public sector numbers. This was the third consecutive quarter where an increase in employment was recorded. Increases in employment have been recorded in nine of the 14 economic sectors categorised by the CSO, including agriculture, forestry and fishing, construction, industry, wholesale and retail and accommodation and food services. Most of these sectors are targeted for attention under the Action Plan for Jobs. We have now moved from a situation where the private sector was losing over 7,000 jobs per month before this Government came to office to the current situation where it is creating over 3,000 jobs per month. </p>
            <p eId="para_674"> This Department does not undertake employment forecasts. However, the Government’s Action Plan for Jobs has set the objective of supporting the creation of 100,000 extra jobs in the economy over the period 2012 to 2016 through a series of annual measures aimed at improving Ireland’s competitiveness and making it easier for enterprises to do business. As part of the action plan, Forfás assessed the job potential of several sectors, including manufacturing, agrifood, ICT, tourism, business process outsourcing, international financial services, the green economy and retail and construction. There is a strong mix of both multinational companies and indigenous SMEs involved in these sectors. Enterprise Ireland has set a target of supporting 10,500 new jobs on a gross basis in 2013, while IDA Ireland aims to generate 13,000 gross new jobs this year. I am currently preparing the 2014 action plan on behalf of the Government and we will continue to build on the success of the actions we have taken over the past two years.</p>

            <p eId="para_675">I thank the Minister for his reply but he did not quite answer my question. I understand his comments on making forecasts but my question, which follows on from Deputy McLellan's, asked the sectors in which the increases in jobs are expected to occur. The Minister referred to the acute problem of the mismatch of jobs and skills. This problem is not new, however. It existed under the previous Government, when the US Chamber of Commerce made some stark comments about the large number of jobs that were available in the multinational sector. No Government has addressed the problem with particular energy and FÁS, which until recently was continuing to overtrain people for construction jobs, still does not appear to have learned the lesson. How, precisely, is the Government addressing the problem of producing people with skills for sectors where employment is anticipated to grow? I am disappointed that the Minister appears to be unable to identify the sectors in which the jobs will be created.</p>

            <p eId="para_676">Deputy Ross asked for forecasts which we do not provide. I indicated in my reply that we investigated the potential of sectors such as manufacturing, where we have identified potential for creating 20,000 jobs, and we are putting polices in place to realise that potential. In the financial sector, we have developed a five year plan to create up to 10,000 jobs in international financial services. Food presents a clear opportunity in this regard. Harvest 2020 aims to develop the agriculture sector and my Department has recently announced plans by Glanbia and Kerry Group to invest significantly in anticipation of greater output. We have also closely examined the potential of ICT, a sector in which a significant proportion of IDA jobs - 13,000 per year - are being created. We have identified opportunities in cloud computing and big data. In the digital games sector, a potential 2,500 jobs have been identified. We are investigating subsectors in which opportunities have been identified with a view to developing policies to deliver on these opportunities. That is the approach we take because it is not as exact a science as forecasting X number of jobs in manufacturing in 2014.</p>

            <p eId="para_677">I agree with the Minister that it is a difficult area and understand why he is reluctant to give exact figures. However, this means the mismatch is almost certain to continue. We do not know how to train people because we do not know where the jobs will be created beyond a vague identification of the sectors. Where does he think jobs will be lost in the coming years? I hope his optimism is justified in regard to bringing the numbers down but there will certainly be job losses.</p>
            <p eId="para_678"> What store does he put in the forecasts produced by various bodies? The ESRI predicted growth of 2.7%, compared to the Department of Finance's prediction of 1.2%. Previous forecasts have been way off the mark not only in terms of growth, but also predictions of employment numbers. The ESRI, which this week issued a forecast that everybody greeted with enthusiasm, predicted in 2007: "The highest growth is expected among business, financial and legal professionals, whose numbers are predicted to rise by nearly 50%." Are these predictions credible?</p>

            <p eId="para_679">We should consider what happened in the past 12 months. Agriculture, forestry and fishing generated 16,000 jobs, industry generated 7,000 jobs, wholesale and retail generated 3,000 jobs, accommodation and food services generated 10,000 jobs and professional, scientific and technical sectors generated 5,000 jobs. Growth in these sectors is adding significant numbers of jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_680"> The expert group on future skills needs assists my Department and the Department of Education and Skills in building connections between education and industry. I do not pretend the bridge we are building is perfect but, in realistic terms, jobs have declined in recent years and skill shortages have not occurred in many areas. They are only beginning to emerge now. The ICT sector has faced a continuing skills shortage but in manufacturing, while key skills like plastic moulding and tool making are in demand, we are not yet seeing thousands of vacancies or needs. The expert group has identified areas of expertise in manufacturing and they are being communicated to colleges and SOLAS to assist in their planning. The process is ongoing for offering guidance to colleges, students and parents as to where skills opportunities can be found. Clearly wrong turns were taken and it takes time to get people to switch focus. However, a considerable amount of information is informing that process.</p>

            <p eId="para_682">The challenge facing IDA Ireland is to continue winning top quality investment for Ireland in a difficult and competitive global environment. It also seeks to secure a required spread of investment across the regions. Investors usually come with quite clearly specified requirements and the IDA Ireland offers regional locations that meet those requirements in the choices for scheduled visits. It vigorously markets the gateway locations within each region and highlights the opportunities provided by hub locations that are within commuting distances of those gateways. With continuing enhancement and improvements in physical and digital infrastructure, a foreign direct investment, FDI, project secured for one gateway can have a positive impact on hubs, other gateways and their surrounding areas. However, it must be acknowledged that the decision on where a client company will locate a new FDI investment is made by the senior managers of the companies involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_683"> From 2008 to 2010, more than 16,000 net jobs were lost in IDA companies. Since the Government entered office, more than 12,500 net new jobs have been created. There have also been notable regional successes, including 1,500 jobs in PayPal and eBay in Dundalk, 200 jobs in Allergan in Westport, 200 jobs in Nypro in Waterford and 400 jobs in Northern Trust in Limerick.</p>
            <p eId="para_684"> The existing base of multinational companies in a region represents a substantial opportunity. Approximately 70% of all FDI investments won by the IDA are from the existing client base. In addition, success in a sector gives confidence to other investors of the region's capacity to meet their needs. The IDA seeks to develop sectoral clusters within regions.</p>
            <p eId="para_685"> ConnectIreland is a new initiative for promoting FDI. It has been successful in accessing new streams of investment, many to regional locations. For example, Mafic announced 70 jobs in Kells, Magni announced 50 new manufacturing jobs in Portarlington, with other jobs announcements in Galway and Longford. A key to its success is the vigorous involvement of the individuals and communities in specific regions to promote this opportunity and I encourage local authorities to build such networks.</p>

            </p>
            <p eId="para_687"> I am determined to ensure that Ireland can continue to compete globally for foreign direct investment. In winning such investments, however, I am mindful of the need to address the concerns that have been expressed to me by Deputies on all sides of the House about the relatively low level of site visits to certain regional locations. I have accordingly requested IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to work with my Department so that we can explore what further initiatives we can take to ensure a better approach to enterprise development in regional locations. This exercise will complement the in-depth analysis of our FDI strategy that is being undertaken. This analysis will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland's strengths in attracting FDI and changes to the EU's state aid rules that will be introduced in 2014. These factors will inform the formulation of an appropriate FDI strategy for the period post 2014.</p>

            <p eId="para_688">I thank the Minister. I will take him up on ConnectIreland, which is a fantastic project. Mr. Terry Clune and Mr. Tom Dowling have done good work in that regard. It has potential.</p>
            <p eId="para_689"> The difficulty lies in the fact that, given the visitation figures, there is a danger of a two-speed recovery. I accept that there is employment growth, but there is no sense in us concentrating that growth in specific parts of the country and not giving other parts that opportunity. Longford, which fits many of the criteria that the Minister mentioned, such as commuting areas, has received no visits since the beginning of 2012. The Minister referred to commuting distances, yet Carlow, Kildare, Meath, Wexford and Wicklow have received only one IDA site visit each this year. There are locations on the outskirts of Dublin that meet many of the criteria required by any international company. The figure of 275 visits so far this year is healthy. However, unless they are spread around areas outside of Dublin and other cities we will not achieve the full recovery that we need.</p>
            <p eId="para_690"> The most recent annual employment survey by Forfás shows that employment in agency-assisted companies in the north west decreased by more than 20% in the past nine years. There has been a further 1% reduction since the Government entered office. We need to start using regional centres. They tick all of the boxes that the Minister just outlined. The Department must push the IDA on what has been done in Longford. I cannot imagine that Deputy Bannon is keeping quiet on the matter. Just to save himself from that alone, the Minister should put a bit of pressure on the IDA to adopt a greater regional focus.</p>

            <p eId="para_691">The Deputy speaks for many other Deputies who want to see a broader spread of IDA projects. I am mindful of the need to try to address those as best we can. There is considerable pressure on IDA Ireland to do so. An in-depth analysis of our FDI strategy is being undertaken. One of its dimensions will be a consideration of how to achieve a better regional spread.</p>
            <p eId="para_692"> Often, we compete for projects globally. It is not a question of Longford competing with Leitrim or Dublin. Rather, it is a question of whether Ireland can get a project instead of Singapore, the Netherlands, Luxembourg or wherever. That is the context.</p>
            <p eId="para_693"> This discussion of regional strategy needs to focus more on the competitive advantages of regions and not just in terms of FDI. In some regions, FDI only plays a small role. Many regional strengths are not in that sector. We need a regional strategy that accounts for entrepreneurship, the base of Enterprise Ireland companies and their capacity to become exporting companies. I am anxious to examine this type of broad-based, regional enterprise strategy. I am starting initiatives in this regard to determine whether we can frame such a strategy on a broader base. This is not to say that FDI is not important in all regions.</p>

            <p eId="para_694">In terms of a broader approach, Mayo County Council's economic investment unit is the way to go. If the Taoiseach allows the Minister and Minister of State in, they should visit to see that work. Alternatively, we could arrange for the unit to visit them. The Minister of State would be well aware of it.</p>
            <p eId="para_695"> The Minister mentioned Allergan. A few weeks ago, we had the opportunity to meet its international board, which visited Westport for its annual meeting and spoke about the Allergan product. Would IDA Ireland locate Allergan in Westport today? Based on these figures, it would not, yet the Allergan experience of Westport has been amazing, as has its workforce. I want the workforces of Longford and elsewhere in my county to get the chance to recreate companies in the same way that the Allergan workforce has done in Westport since the mid-1970s. Based on this visit profile, that will not happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_696"> I accept that we are competing against large regions, but even Wicklow, Kildare and Meath in Dublin's commuter belt are not getting an appropriate number of visits. They can be sold as city regions with connectivity to colleges and industry and all of the criteria about which the Minister spoke, yet we seem determined to focus our efforts on this city. If we keep doing so, we will start walking down paths that we took in the 1990s and the early part of this century that we do not want to walk again.</p>

            <p eId="para_697">The truth is, we need to be able to build on regional strengths, whatever they may be. Some companies will come for deep labour market pools. They identify their needs early. Either Ireland delivers on those needs or we lose the projects. This can result in a narrow choice of regional locations. However, this is not the case with other projects. Clearly, we need to develop a better flow of projects that are more regionally mobile. ConnectIreland plays a part in that. We also need to strengthen regions. I am keen to see them building competitive strengths and to work with them in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_698"> It is not as simple as just telling IDA Ireland to start shifting pawns around the board, but we can build stronger magnets of attraction within our regions and pursue companies that fit them. This forms part of the revision of strategy that we need to consider.</p>

            <p eId="para_700">Liaising with banks in respect of their lending to small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, has been a continual process involving myself, colleague Ministers and officials. Most recently I met the CEO of one of the pillar banks in June.</p>
            <p eId="para_701"> The Cabinet committee on mortgage arrears and credit availability meets monthly and reviews access to finance for SMEs, including bank lending to SMEs. The credit consultation committee established under the terms of the Action Plan for Jobs has met seven times since its inception to discuss with the banks and other interested parties the availability of credit to SMEs.</p>
            <p eId="para_702"> In developing the Action Plan for Jobs, I have sought the broadest possible involvement through submissions and regional meetings. I have included banks in this process. I have had direct meetings with senior bank executives at national level. The Minister of State, Deputy Perry, has also undertaken a specific regional round of seven meetings on access to finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_703"> As the Deputy knows, arising from this work I have developed the micro-finance initiative, the loan guarantee scheme and the development capital fund. My Department is in regular contact with the pillar banks to discuss the availability of credit to the SME sector and to discuss the performance of the SME credit guarantee scheme and the micro-enterprise loan fund, which the Minister of State has outlined to the House. My officials and I also work closely with the Credit Review Office, CRO, to track lending and credit refusals in order to safeguard businesses and jobs.</p>

            <p eId="para_704">The SME sector is responsible for more than 78% of all jobs in the economy. We supported the Government when it introduced the micro-enterprise loan and credit guarantee schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_705">These schemes were developed to supplement bank lending and not replace it. They are not performing and should be reviewed. Given that the cost of the credit for the microenterprise scheme exceeds the market rate, this is not surprising. However, we believe that if amended, these schemes can play a role for SMEs.</p>
            <p eId="para_706"> Bank lending to the SME sector continues to be troubled. SME rates of refusal are growing again, as demonstrated by ISME surveys. The Credit Review Office continues to challenge the individual decisions of banks after an application has been refused.</p>
            <p eId="para_707"> How can the Government use its standing as a major creditor of the banking system to ensure banks lend to meet the cashflow and investment needs of SMEs? In his meetings with the banks, did the Minister raise the issue of meaningful additional lending targets as separate from roll-over loans? Has he raised the issue of legacy loans arising from property that are dragging down viable businesses? When will banks start putting the people's money to productive use?</p>

            <p eId="para_708">There is a lot in the Deputy's questions. I thank both Opposition parties for their support for the two initiatives - microfinance and the credit loan guarantee. They are new and have not been tried before. We are determined to improve them, and the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, has outlined the position concerning microfinance. There is also a later question about the credit loan guarantee. We have initiated a review and are re-examining the terms of that guarantee. We want to improve it in order that it can meet the ambitions we all have for it.</p>
            <p eId="para_709"> Data are hard to get concerning the refusal of loans to SMEs. However, the RED C survey undertaken for the Government shows an improvement in refusal rates, although it is still too high. We must ensure the requirement to be refused a loan before accessing microfinance or a loan guarantee should not become a bureaucratic obstacle. We are trying to streamline that as well as ensuring bankers in the front line know such schemes are available. They should direct people, at the time of a refusal, to actively consider these alternatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_710"> Banks are meeting their lending targets but the Deputy is right that new lending to SMEs has only risen in two quarters out of the last four. It is bouncing along at a level of about €2 billion a year. I would certainly like to see that figure growing. That is not to say, however, that the other restructuring offers are not important as well. We have ambitions to have more targets in the area of new lending.</p>

            <p eId="para_711">I thank the Minister for his reply. Many businesses were told by banks to diversify their investments, including property. Many SMEs followed this advice.

            <p eId="para_712">When the Deputy says "bail out developers", the truth is that no developer has received any bailout. As the Deputy knows from newspaper reports, developers are being continually pursued for assets by State agencies. Of course, we have had to keep the banks open. Bank shareholders have been wiped out, but the banks continue, and we need to rebuild solid lending institutions focused on the needs of SMEs.</p>
            <p eId="para_713"> There are many problems in this area, and there is no doubt that a banking system that is reducing the size of its loan book and is trying to get back into a proper relationship is constrained. On aggregate, we have €2.5 billion in alternative funding sources for business that is not coming from banks. That is part of our response, between the National Pensions Reserve Fund, development capital funds and the schemes to which we referred. There are targets on pursuing the banks but we are also introducing new vehicles that we must make strong and roadworthy. That process is continuing.</p>

            <p eId="para_715">Last May, I announced a new call for expressions of interest under the €175 million Seed and Venture Capital Scheme 2013-18, which will see the continuation of the Government’s support for innovative Irish SMEs. The scheme is targeting an additional €525 million in funding from the private sector, which will mean a total fund of €700 million available for investment over the lifetime of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_716"> This new Seed and Venture Scheme 2013-18 will proceed by way of a series of calls for partners to establish individual funds tailored to different sectors and strategies in line with Enterprise Ireland targeted areas. These are competitive calls and funding partners will be selected based on sectoral expertise, track record and supporting networks which they bring to the funds.</p>
            <p eId="para_717"> Venture capital schemes tend to have a ten year time horizon during which drawdowns of funds investing in high potential companies are rarely linear but become easier to forecast after the initial investments have been made. Different funds have different timelines depending on the release of calls for expressions of interest and come on stream as and when fund-raising is completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_718"> I am confident the venture capital funds will be fully utilised. This scheme builds on EI’s engagement with seed and venture capital which goes back almost two decades. It has been successful in assisting the growth of high potential start-ups, attracting leveraged funds, bringing top level managers to Ireland, and attracting interesting first-time international money to the Irish SME market.</p>
            <p eId="para_719"> Investments under the predecessor funds numbered 159 in 2012 with an investment of €81 million. This compares with 134 in 2011 when it was €60 million, and 107 in 2010 when it was €42 million. This is encouraging progress and justifies the commitment to this new scheme to sustain investment in enterprises with high growth potential.</p>

            <p eId="para_720">The Minister mentioned 150 investments in 2012 worth €81 million. How many jobs are they currently sustaining? I am concerned that it will go the same way as the microfinance and loan guarantee schemes in terms of ignorance. What specific role will Enterprise Ireland have in this regard or will it be using its high potential start-ups client base to promote this scheme? What kind of system has the Minister put in place to review the scheme in order that my first concern does not happen, viable long-term jobs will be supported, and supported companies can continue to draw on and access other sources of finance?</p>

            <p eId="para_721">These programmes, of their nature, take time to evaluate. An evaluation of the scheme that is coming to an end would not be complete at this stage. However, sample indications from 69 companies suggest a total employment of 691 to date. Typically, these companies are export oriented. Total direct employment in companies in 2009 was 9,733. Generally speaking, these are high growth companies and it is only at the end of the fund that one can undertake a commercial evaluation. All or most of the high potential start-up companies have a target of delivering ten jobs within three years. Their performance is encouraging. Enterprise Ireland and Forfás regard the programme as being their best in terms of providing a return to the taxpayer. This is a source of continuing mixed source funding for these high growth companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_722"> The Deputy's question did not focus on evaluation, although I could assemble some more data for him. By and large, these companies have been successful and we can prove the leverage from the money we put in. It started out as 50:50 so we had to put in a euro to get a euro, while now we have to put in a euro to get three. Therefore, the leverage is improving as it goes along.</p>

            <p eId="para_723">Under the heading of microfinance schemes or venture capital funds, there is a more efficient way of using that money to get greater returns, which is through peer-to-peer financing or credit funding, about which the Minister knows a lot. We talk about new financing models for SMEs, but this financing model does not involve banks or the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_724">It will provide greater returns for the lender and borrower. It is an efficient way of getting funding for SMEs. There is a role for Government supports from somewhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_725"> There is a huge market in the UK for peer-to-peer financing. The UK Government has done a little to help this market through changes in the taxation laws and by way of funding. For example, where certain borrowing arrangements are met through peer-to-peer financing and the Government provides a top-up, on which it gets a return. Will the Minister consider the introduction of similar measures to assist the peer-to-peer financing model in Ireland?</p>

            <p eId="para_726">I support Deputy Murphy's proposal. Many of the high potential start-ups, HPSU, companies being targeted would be comfortable with the model of financing he suggests. While I welcome the venture capital scheme, again it focuses on the export orientated sector, which is fine, but our home grown businesses are still a little lost in terms of financing initiatives. There is no home for them in terms of the continued emphasis being placed on other sectors. While I welcome that emphasis our home grown industries, which do not necessarily have or will ever have an export orientation, are still being ignored. We must collectively ensure supports are put in place for them.</p>

            <p eId="para_727">I agree that crowd-funding is an interesting area. I am aware of one such initiative in Ireland and recently met with the sponsors of it. It is beginning to have a track record. What I found interesting was that much of the funding came from the local customer base rather than from remote locations. As such, a community of interest was built around a business so that people were not only using it but were investing in it. I will look at how the Government can better support this idea. It can form part of the picture which, as Deputy Calleary rightly said, will be a mosaic. Banks internationally and globally are retreating from some areas. Our dependence on banks as a source of funding is pretty high. We need to construct a mosaic of sources of funding. I am aware that there are a number of the initiatives referred to in the field and that they have the potential to grow further. We have not reached any conclusions in terms of access to finance. The suggested area is one that we can develop. The Government is open to credible suggestions from Deputies on this issue. As stated by the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, the establishment of the local enterprise offices as one-stop-shops will provide us with a better window on the needs of these companies. We have created a centre of excellence in Enterprise Ireland. It is a two-way process and it is hoped we will get better intelligence to mould effective policy instruments.</p>

            <p eId="para_728">7. <b>Deputy Clare Daly</b> asked the <b>Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation</b> the action he will take to assist small businesses in this current economic climate in view of the fact that they are the largest employer in the country. [42576/13]</p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#JohnPerry" eId="spk_215" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Jobs,_Enterprise_and_Innovation">
            <from>Deputy John Perry<recordedTime time="2013-10-10T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_729">The Government recognises that small and medium sized businesses are a key component of the Irish economy and the backbone of employment in Ireland. SMEs make up over 99% of businesses in the enterprise economy in Ireland and account for almost 70% of people employed. Supporting SMEs in the current difficult economic climate is a key Government priority. Government action to support small and medium sized businesses in the domestic economy have been set out in the Action Plan for Jobs 2012 and 2013 and work will continue in the context of the Action Plan for Jobs 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_730"> Significant initiatives have been taken in a number of areas, including improvements in access to finance through the credit guarantee and microenterprise loan fund schemes; tackling of the issue of late payments through the transposition of the EU late payment directive into Irish legislation; development of a single licensing application portal in respect of 159 licences across all sectors of the Irish economy, 35 of which are in the retail trade and are provided by 13 different authorities; reform of the county enterprise boards through the establishment of a first-stop-shop for small business through the new local enterprise offices, mandated by an effective service level agreement with Enterprise Ireland; improvements in the competitiveness of the business environment; expanded supports for start-ups, first time exporters; and new schemes to help small businesses recruit via JobBridge, JobsPlus, Springboard and Momentum.</p>
            <p eId="para_731"> The Action Plan 2014, which is currently being finalised, will seek to build on the progress already made and is set to deliver a suite of actions to support enterprise. The focus of the budget will be very much on entrepreneurship. SMEs will continue to be a key element of this process and a number of proposed actions are currently being examined, the focus of which will be aimed at supporting this vital sector of industry. </p>
            <p eId="para_732"> The Government is also committed to ensuring that ongoing dialogue with the small business sector is facilitated to ensure that business and Government work together to identify the necessary actions to support SMEs in Ireland. This is being done through the Advisory Group for Small Business and the High Level Group on Better Regulation, which includes representatives of ISME, construction companies and so on. I am encouraged by the progress in employment creation by small business in the last 12 months. Most of the 39,000 additional jobs in the economy have come from the SME sector. However, we have a long way to go. The high level group on better regulation, which brings together senior Government officials, representatives from local authorities, business and trade unions, also serves as a forum for Government to connect with business. The Government is working to reduce the burden of red tape on companies.</p>

            <p eId="para_733">The problem is that the Minister of State's response is that what the Government is doing is in the plan. However, the reality is that for many small and medium sized business on the ground life is still incredibly difficult. Despite the initiatives listed by the Minister of State they are still struggling. It is not good enough that some of these initiatives are only coming on stream two and a half years into the lifetime of this Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_734"> There are 408 rateable properties in Swords, which is in my constituency. Some 120 of them are empty. One of the key pressures on small businesses is that of council rates. Councils are also under considerable pressure because of the precarious nature of Government funding. In many instances, the pressure being put on small businesses to pay rates is driving them out of business, leading to premises lying idle. I have not seen anything from Government to address this scenario.</p>
            <p eId="para_735"> Businesses are also being squeezed in other ways. I am currently dealing with a case involving a medium sized sub-contractor who has done work for a major construction company that has a contract with a local authority. The main company concerned, SIAC, has been paid by the local authority but refuses to pay the sub-contractor who is a small to medium sized business providing employment. Main contractors who engage in the sweating of sub-contractors in order to get a lower price should be prevented by Government from accessing any future public contracts. This type of behaviour is jeopardising employment in the small and medium sized sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_736">We are not only talking about taking action, we are delivering on it. Yesterday, officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform dealt with the issue of rates and the valuation process. Current property ratings are based on 1986 values. A review of rates in Dublin and, possibly, Limerick is currently ongoing. Rates for properties constructed during the boom are also based on property values in 1986. The roll-out of the local enterprise offices will provide local government with the autonomy to work with local authorities in providing derogations in town centres. I agree with the Deputy that many companies are struggling and that many premises are vacant. We must encourage enterprise into these premises by way of rent reductions and derogations from local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_737"> There is a late payments directive in place. This requires all Departments to make payments within 15 days. There is also a voluntary code in this regard for the private sector, in respect of which there is a code of conduct. The Government has also launched the trading online and local employment office initiatives, which are important. Reform of the Companies Act is also ongoing. Many initiatives have been introduced. I agree it is about confidence and credit in the economy to encourage local spend.</p>
            <p eId="para_738">Yesterday's report is encouraging as it shows that confidence is growing again. The review of the microfinance fund will enable people to apply for finance when starting up a company. I travel around the country and I am greatly encouraged by the number of enterprises being established daily. While the economic climate is difficult, opportunities are available. </p>

            <p eId="para_739">Flexibility in the rates system is critical. I am not sure of the timescale the Department has in mind or how creative local authorities will be allowed to be in this regard. A fundamental departure from the current system is required to critically support companies that are struggling and may have been operating in an area for some considerable time. This issue needs to be addressed. The largest problem facing many small businesses is the lack of purchasing power among ordinary people. Unless the Government departs from the austerity policies of cutting wages, increasing taxes and taking money out of the economy, many businesses will not take flight and succeed. I concur with the Minister of State that there are many creative, innovative ideas and much expertise in the economy but unless people have money to purchase the products that companies and individuals want to develop, these ideas will go nowhere.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mick Wallace<recordedTime time="2013-10-10T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_740">While the Minister has done well in meeting his responsibilities for exports, jobs and enterprise, the economy has suffered a great deal on the Government's watch. Besides the lack of action to address upward only rent reviews, which I do not propose to discuss now, lending to businesses remains a serious problem. I am aware from experience that banks are ending financial arrangements with companies in order that they can recommence them. A company will receive a letter stating the term of a loan has been cancelled and a week later the bank will indicate it is willing to re-open the loan. The reason for this approach by the banks is that it allows them to define such loans as new lending.</p>
            <p eId="para_741"> Many companies are borrowing from banks to repay loans to other financial institutions. Another significant problem is the lack of loans to companies in the domestic economy that are seeking to reinvest. </p>
            <p eId="para_742"> Rates are also a serious problem. I have five premises in Dublin which are being re-rated. We have been informed that the rates on these premises will increase by 47%. While we have appealed the decision, we are not sure what will be the outcome. I do not understand the logic of increasing rates which were already set at a high level.</p>
            <p eId="para_743"> There is no doubt the reduction in VAT to 9% in the hospitality sector has been of great benefit to the restaurant and hotel industry. For example, my companies have benefited from the measure. I am not sure what the Government plans to do in the budget but I hope the new rate will be retained. The level at which rates are set is creating a serious problem. If they increase further, as seems likely, it will be very challenging for the sector. </p>

            <p eId="para_744">I concur with Deputies Daly and Wallace on the issue of rates. The Minister of State referred to local government reform. The abolition of town councils will result in higher rates for many businesses. No detail has been provided on rates equalisation. Many businesses in town council areas pay a lower rate than businesses in county council areas. Will their rates increase as a result of the abolition of town councils?</p>
            <p eId="para_745"> Has the Minister made proposals to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government on introducing an inability to pay mechanism for businesses which do not have the funds to pay the rent for a specific location?</p>
            <p eId="para_746"> I recently met representatives of the Waterford city centre business association. The re-rating project in Waterford is resulting in horrendous increases in rates for premises whose value has declined. Business in the city is not even at the level recorded in 1986, yet the rateable valuation of many premises is increasing significantly. </p>
            <p eId="para_747"> Deputies cannot ask direct questions about financing for small and medium-sized enterprises because they are redirected to the Department of Finance. Asking a question of that Department is akin to throwing a ball against a haystack. Surely the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has a position on the possibility of establishing a bank to provide funding to domestic small and medium-sized businesses, as the former ICC Bank used to do. We are back in that space and I hope the Department acts as a champion in government for the case for having a specific focus on banking and an outlet for domestic companies.</p>

            <p eId="para_748">I concur with previous speakers' comments on rates, which are a noose around the necks of business. The system must be reformed. The broadening of the tax base through the introduction of the domestic property tax and water charges has created scope for carrying out a review of the manner in which rates are collected from business. I have always maintained that rates on business should be linked to the performance of the business as opposed to the value of the premises. Under such a system, businesses which can afford to pay will pay and large rates bills will not block new entrants to business.</p>
            <p eId="para_749"> We have heard a great deal about the 9% VAT rate for tourism related businesses in the context of the budget. Not only should we retain this beacon for the economy, but we should extend it to other sectors. The introduction of a 4.5% rate of PRSI for people earning €350 per week or less was a proactive measure, which has helped many employers bring people into employment. I urge the Ministers to seek to retain it in next Tuesday's budget. </p>

            <p eId="para_750">Of the 39,000 jobs created, more than 19,000 were created in the domestic economy. On the issue of purchasing power, consumers have benefited from greater value for money in the retail trade, which has become extraordinarily competitive. Expenditure on shopping has declined significantly, although I recognise that people have limited budgets.</p>
            <p eId="para_751"> Deputy Wallace raised the issue of rates. Ultimately, a company's customers will pay the rates as they are built into a business's stacked up costs. Rates have been in place for decades and are factored in when calculating one's profit margin. Current rates are based on 1986 property values. People have been advised to appeal or seek a review of decisions on rates. The information provided to us yesterday indicates there should not be any substantial increases in rates. Businesses also have available to them a mechanism for reviewing decisions. </p>
            <p eId="para_752"> On the issue of banking, we have a State-owned bank and two pillar banks which are committed to lending €8 billion that has been ring-fenced by the Government for that purpose. Securing funding from banks is not the only issue. Many retailers are collaborating with their suppliers and availing of alternative mechanisms. I meet many young people who are starting businesses. The issues they face are not only securing loans, but also developing a business plan and company profile. While one can blame the banks, lending is a two way street. If a loan application is viable and stacks up, it makes good sense for a bank to approve it because banks are in the business of lending money. They want customers to grow on the basis that they must satisfy their shareholders. The domestic banks need business. </p>
            <p eId="para_753"> We are encouraged by The Gathering. Those who visit Dublin at weekends will see no sign of recession in the capital. One will see confidence in city centre businesses, especially restaurants. The new VAT rate has been of great help in that regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_755">I am pleased the Deputy tabled this question because the Irish Presidency fought with some success on this issue. The regional aid guidelines enable the State's industrial development agencies to pay grants, at enhanced rates, to businesses to support new investment and new employment in productive projects in Ireland's most disadvantaged regions. This helps the convergence of these regions with the more advantaged regions of the Union. All such grants come from the Exchequer, in other words, there is no EU or other external funding. </p>
            <p eId="para_756"> The new guidelines were adopted by the Commission on 19 June 2013. There are no provisions or means for a review of the content of the guidelines. </p>
            <p eId="para_757">European regions eligible for regional aid are divided into A regions which are the most disadvantaged within the Union in terms of economic development and C regions which are also disadvantaged, but to a lesser extent. All Irish regions are classified as C regions, both for the current 2007-2013 regional aid map and for the upcoming 2014-2020 map.</p>
            <p eId="para_758"> For the current 2007-2013 map, the BMW region was designated as an economic development area because it had moved ahead of the A status that it had in 2000-2006. The guidelines stipulated that areas such as the BMW region would be granted economic development status for the 2007 to 2013 period only. As a result of this designation, the BMW region was effectively given a derogation to grant slightly higher aid rates to assist the transition from A to C status.</p>
            <p eId="para_759"> Both the current 2007-2013 regional aid guidelines and the upcoming 2014-2020 guidelines outline that the aid intensity in standard C areas must not exceed 30 % for small enterprises, 20% for medium-sized enterprises and 10% for large enterprises.</p>

            <p eId="para_761">These rates are all 5% less than currently available in the BMW region, but as I have stated, that region cannot be afforded special economic development status under the next map.</p>
            <p eId="para_762"> My Department is consulting stakeholders on the drafting of the 2014-2020 Irish regional aid map. Economic data such as unemployment and gross domestic product for all counties, including those counties in the BMW region, will once again be analysed afresh when deciding which counties will be included in the next regional aid map.</p>
            <p eId="para_763"> The initial regional aid guidelines proposal from the Commission, published in May 2012, presented significant challenges for Ireland. This proposal prohibited aid to large enterprises, reduced our population coverage from 50% to 25% and reduced aid intensity rates. Following sustained engagement with the Commission and like-minded member states at ministerial and official level, Ireland secured entitlement to maintain regional aid qualification for areas accounting for 50% of the country’s population, with coverage actually slightly increasing to 51.28%.</p>
            <p eId="para_764"> On the key issue for Ireland, aid to large enterprises, a compromise was agreed with the Commission that will allow member states to provide investment aid to large enterprises for new economic activities and diversification of existing enterprises into new products or new process innovation. Aid intensity rates were also maintained at their current levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_765"> In essence, the final version of the regional aid guidelines negotiated by Ireland and like-minded member states represents an important step in ensuring Ireland, and the EU in general, maintain the ability to strengthen the EU economy and promoting cohesion between regions.</p>

            <p eId="para_766">I thank the Minister of State for his detailed reply. While I acknowledge the progress that has been made, the reality is that everything has been different since 2007. The Minister of State does not need to be told that there are parts of the BMW region that would certainly qualify for A grade. The region itself has grown, with Galway city and parts of Louth having had substantial employment growth, but in other areas there has been no growth. In the north west, agency-assisted employment has fallen by a fifth since 2003, including another 1% drop. The whole regional aid policy needs to be reviewed at European level in light of the collapse in European economies in recent years. Many areas that may have been stronger in 2006 or 2007 have fallen back. We have discussed emigration and the flight of people from many of these areas. The way to get these people home is to promote industry, particularly home-grown industry. The change in state aid affects our ability to do that. We need to go back to these state aids at European level. The Government needs to use the influence it has gained in recent months to drive that campaign. We need to review this because the country as a whole will lose out, and if we do not do this, I suspect the European Union will lose out because investment will go to areas outside the EU.</p>

            <p eId="para_767">More than 51% of the country qualifies for category C regional aid. It was originally proposed that large enterprises would not be funded in the regions. We got that included. The regional aid is not a funding scheme for the EU. It is just a set of guidelines for enterprise support agencies in Ireland to follow.</p>

The Deputy is talking about getting regional development and getting people into the regions. Dublin and other large populated areas do not qualify for any of this assistance so we have that advantage. We can still get up to 30% for small companies and 10% for larger companies, which was taken off the table meaning that the west would not have been entitled to any aid if the Minister, Deputy Bruton, had not fought for it to be included. People see regional aid as money; it is only the guidelines to qualify for funds. Ireland has done very well to secure the deal we did during our Presidency.</p>

            <p eId="para_772">I commend the Minister, Deputy Bruton, on his work on this to date. Wearing my constituency hat, all along people in Kerry felt disadvantaged because we were left out of that region. In the future we feel we should have a level playing field with everyone else. We have suffered. Tralee and other parts of Kerry have large areas that are industrial wastelands at the moment. A large factor in that has been that we were left out previously. We need to look at this from both sides of the argument. There are counties such as mine that have suffered. In future we need to be given an equal opportunity.</p>

            <p eId="para_774">I am delighted this question was raised because it will come up in the European Parliament elections. People perceive regional aid as a pot of money from the EU. The Deputy has stated very clearly that certain areas of the country that were previously excluded are now included. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, is to be commended on his negotiations. If we had conceded, there was a significant possibility that no large enterprise would have been included in the regional aid map, which is not now the case. We have only dropped the marginal 5%. The BMW region benefited considerably through the companies brought into the region. There is still a substantial benefit - up to 30%, 20% and 10% for large companies. The fact that the area has been extended to include Kerry will enhance the opportunities. Deputy Calleary asked how we can attract foreign direct investment. We have a bigger map with bigger potential for aid to go into those regions. It is a huge benefit with regard to the employment grants for the employment of staff. It is a considerable advantage for the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in attracting foreign direct investment, given that more than half the country is included.</p>
