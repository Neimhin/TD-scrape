Given that the joint committee has such a heavy workload this week, consideration of the minutes of yesterday's meeting will be deferred to next week.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Michael McGrath.  No. 4 on our agenda is correspondence, consideration of which will be deferred until our meeting on Wednesday, 14 November.  The Oireachtas broadcasting unit has advised that the meeting is being televised live on UPC channel 207, with transmission commencing at 9.30 a.m.  As I am conscious that the Minister for Finance will be in the Dáil at 11 a.m. to take the Credit Union Bill 2011, the committee's proceedings will have to conclude by that time.

I welcome the Minister and advise members that briefing documents have been circulated by e-mail in advance of the meeting.  The Minister will make his opening remarks which will be followed by a question-and-answer session.  I remind members, witnesses and observers in the Visitors Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off.  The meeting is being broadcast by UPC on channel 207 and if a mobile phone is left on, it will interfere with the broadcast, sometimes to the extent that it is seriously disrupted and those watching cannot follow or hear the proceedings.  Members and the Minister are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I now invite the Minister to make his opening statement.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	2	I thank the Chairman and members for inviting me to address them in advance of the ECOFIN Council of Ministers which will take place next week.  I will begin by providing an overview of the European and international dimensions to the work of the ECOFIN Council.  As this will be the penultimate Council under the Cyprus Presidency, I take the opportunity to brief the committee on some of its key dossiers.  I will also speak about the agenda for Tuesday's meeting, after which I will be happy to take questions and observations from members.  The work of the ECOFIN Council is heavily influenced by the work of the European Commission, the priorities of the rotating Presidency, the work of Heads of State and Government who meet regularly at European Council summits in Brussels, the ongoing volatile situation in the financial markets relating to the crisis in the eurozone and the work of the G20 and the IMF.  Specifically in regard to ongoing international developments, the G20 met in Mexico earlier this week to consider a number of issues which we will discuss later in the week at the ECOFIN Council.The G20 summit closed on Monday and the Mexican Presidency issued the usual communiqué setting out decisions taken. With regard to the EU Presidency, the Cypriot Presidency still has one third of its term left to run and it is committed to making progress on a number of key dossiers, including the single supervisory mechanism under the banking union heading, and additional measures to strengthen economic governance, referred to as the two-pack. On the single supervisory mechanism, the Cypriot Presidency has stated it will do all in its power to secure agreement during its tenure. On the two-pack, it is also hopeful it will be able to respect the European Council invitation of 18 and 19 October 2012 and reach agreement with the European Parliament with a view to adoption by the end of 2012 at the latest. The Cypriot Presidency has also successfully co-ordinated a review of the European semester and it will shortly submit a synthesis report to Council bringing together the deliberations over recent months of various Council formations. This will help inform the roadmap on the organisation of work for the 2013 European semester, which will be prepared by the incoming Irish Presidency. Turning to next Tuesday's ECOFIN meeting, the Department has already supplied the committee with the latest draft agenda for the meeting, and I will highlight some of the key issues that will be discussed. At next week's Council meeting, Ministers will be updated on the progress in the trilogue discussions that are under way to achieve agreement on the two-pack. I expect the Council will be asked to give a mandate to the Presidency to continue negotiations with the European Parliament on the basis of a new set of compromise suggestions which will be put forward by the Presidency. It should be noted that the scrutiny sub-committee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform will meet on 14 November. The sub-committee has invited officials from the Department to the meeting to discuss the two-pack, as well as the financial transaction tax and the common consolidated corporation tax base. Returning to the upcoming Council meeting, the Commission will present an update on the status of the revised capital requirements rules. The proposal is at trilogue stage of negotiations, and it is likely the Commission will urge that these negotiations come to a conclusion. The need for stronger capital and liquidity standards for EU financial institutions is evident from the financial crisis and Ireland recognises this is a vital piece of legislation. There will be a state of play report on the single supervisory mechanism, including an exchange of views. The latter will be on the basis of the Presidency report that will be prepared following an ad hoc working group on 5 and 6 November. Under the proposal, the ECB will take on the prudential supervision of credit institutions. A regulation amending voting procedures in the European Banking Authority is also proposed as part of these reforms. The objective is to ensure equitable treatment of euro area and non-euro-area member states within the single supervisory mechanism. A state of play discussion on the financial transaction tax is scheduled for the meeting. At the June 2012 ECOFIN meeting, it became clear that agreement on the Commission's draft directive to introduce a financial transactions tax would not be reached at EU 27 level. Those countries that favour the tax are now trying to introduce it by way of enhanced co-operation, under which at least nine countries must participate. I understand that 11 countries - namely, Germany, France, Austria, Belgium, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Italy, Slovakia, Estonia and Greece - have written to this effect to the European Commission. On 23 October 2012 the Commission submitted its proposal for a Council decision to authorise enhanced co-operation in the area of a financial transaction tax. The Council will have to decide after consent by the European Parliament. A subsequent Commission proposal for a directive implementing enhanced co-operation in the area of a financial transaction tax should follow in due course. The mandate for negotiation of amendments to the savings taxation agreements with third countries will be discussed at ECOFIN. There will be a proposal that the Council adopt relevant decisions authorising the opening of such negotiations, and we hope the proposal will be agreed. We will discuss in restricted session issues related to the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact. In particular, the items discussed will pertain to Greece and may include recommendations for specific measures to be taken by Greece to address its excessive deficit. The Presidency will inform the Council on the follow-up of the ECOFIN-related decisions taken by the European Council on 18 and 19 October. The October Council was dominated by discussion of economic issues, particularly the interim report on the future of the economic and monetary union, which identifies the single supervisory mechanism and the broaderbanking union as essential building blocks to delivering genuine economic and monetary union. The Council will have an exchange of views on the outcomes of the annual meeting of the IMF and World Bank Group in Tokyo and the G20 finance Ministers' and central bank governors' meeting in Mexico, as well as a possible follow-up. The Council conclusions on climate finance - fast start finance - will be agreed in advance of the 18th conference of parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, in Qatar from 26 November to 7 December 2012. The Environment Council adopted conclusions on the other aspects of the preparation for Doha on 25 October. Draft Council conclusions on the annual EU statistics package will feature on the agenda. This may only be an "A" item on the Council agenda, which would allow for its approval without any major discussion. Ministers will have an exchange of views on state aid modernisation from which the Presidency will draw its own written conclusions. The Competitiveness Council will also deal with this issue on 10 December 2012 but is not considering adopting Council conclusions. It is expected that ECOFIN will subsequently adopt Council conclusions, taking into account the Presidency conclusions from the November ECOFIN discussion and the discussion at the December Competitiveness Council. I would like to say a word on our own economic and budgetary situation. The Department's latest projections were set out in the 2012 stability programme update, which was published on 27 April. GDP growth returned last year and further modest growth is anticipated for this year, again coming from the external side. It is expected that somewhat more broadly balanced growth will develop next year and beyond. However, so far the exporting sectors are leading the recovery. This underscores the importance of restoring sustainable growth in the euro area, which is a key trading partner for Ireland. In this context, resolving the difficulties in the euro area will be vital. Furthermore, taking account of the Exchequer returns for the first ten months of this year, our budget is on track, and I am confident that fiscal targets will be achieved again this year. The Department will produce revised forecasts for 2012 and later years shortly. These will take account of domestic developments over recent months and the current outlook for the international economy. However, given the worsening of the external environment - particularly in key trading partners - it is clear that short-term growth prospects will be weaker than previously anticipated in the April stability programme update. A considerable amount of progress has been achieved on the reform programme and enhanced governance measures in the EU as a whole and in the euro area. Europe 2020, the EU's growth strategy for the coming decade, is now well-embedded throughout the EU. This is also true of the EU semester, which has now become an important part of the annual work stream of the Commission and Council. The successful implementation of the 2013 semester will be a priority for Ireland's Presidency. The euro plus pact, which is now in place as part of the EU semester, has concrete goals aimed at fostering competitiveness and employment. The six-pack, which came into effect last December, will reform the Stability and Growth Pact by, among other things, ensuring better budgetary surveillance and focusing on prevention and correction of macro-economic imbalances. The two-pack will therefore be the key final piece of the reform strategy for the euro area. The four presidents' paper on the economic and monetary union was released in June. The paper's four essential building blocks are proposals for an integrated financial framework, a budgetary framework, an economic policy framework and greater democratic legitimacy and accountability. An interim report by President Van Rompuy was presented to the October European Council.A specific road map for the achievement of a genuine economic and monetary union will be presented at the European Council meeting on 13 and 14 December.  Moving forward, it is Ireland's view that the focus must be on delivering in all respects the commitments already agreed by the Heads of State and Government, including those of 29 June. Those commitments were vital in giving certainty to the markets and for Europe's credibility. During its Presidency next year Ireland will mark 40 years as a committed member of the European Union. We will take up the Presidency of the European Union on 1 January 2013 and will work in collaboration with the other members of our trio, Lithuania and Greece. Membership of the EU during the past 40 years has been good for Ireland in terms of attracting a considerable amount of foreign direct investment and in gaining access to a much bigger market for our exports. Equally, Ireland has been perceived by our European partners and successive members of European institutions as a diligent, pragmatic and constructive member of the Union. We have demonstrated this continuously during the past six occasions on which we held the Presidency of the European Union and have gained a reputation for holding efficient, business-like and pragmatic Presidencies. In 2004, Ireland presided over the enlargement of the European Union to 25 member states. The Government believes that Ireland's future is intimately linked with continued membership of a strong and vibrant European Union and as a member of the euro area. It is the intention of the Government to continue to proactively engage with senior officials in the EU institutions and with our EU partners in the implementation of policies aimed at strengthening growth and stabilising turbulent financial markets. This is reflected in the main themes of our Presidency, which include promoting growth and restoring the EU's competitiveness. I thank members for their attention. I am happy to respond to any questions from members.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	3	I thank the Minister for his opening statement.  I propose that ten minutes be allowed for the opening round of questions and five minutes for any second and subsequent rounds.  Before I invite Deputy Dooley to put his questions, I have a question for the Minister on the financial transaction tax.  The Minister's report to the joint committee today indicates that that has not yet been fully decided and that there are processes in place for a commencement date.  Is that correct?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	4	Yes.  The Chairman will be aware that the Commission published a paper some time ago.  It became clear during the early discussions on that paper that it would not be possible to get agreement across the 27 eurozone members.  The treaty provides that a smaller number of member states can proceed by way of enhanced co-operation.  To do this, nine states must write to the Commission indicating that they want to move in that direction.  Eleven member states have done so.  It is a long and intricate process under the treaties.  While there will be some discussion on the matter on Tuesday, it is unlikely that significant progress will be made in the short term.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	5	I note that Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece are among the 11 member states involved in that process.  Those countries are in similar financial programmes to Ireland.  What is Ireland's determined position in this regard?  Is it an observational one or has a more determined decision been taken on the matter?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	6	Ireland's position is that at a level of principle we would support a financial transaction tax, provided it was applied universally and particularly to the main world financial sectors.  That would be our ideal position.  If it applied in Singapore, Hong Kong, New York and Tokyo as well as in London and the European centres, we would go along with it.  Our next position, in order of descent, would be that if a financial transaction tax was agreed across the 27 members, we could also agree to that.  Our fear is agreement to any lesser group having a financial transaction tax in which the United Kingdom would not participate.  Some 33,000 people here work in financial services and we believe that if a financial transaction tax were introduced here and not in the United Kingdom, activity would migrate from Dublin to London, resulting in a loss of part of the industry and some jobs.  On the other hand, we can see the merits and principles of a financial transaction tax.  In the event of a group of nine, ten or 11 member states agreeing a financial transaction tax, we will not seek to put barriers in the way of its being introduced elsewhere.    What is currently being discussed is a form of stamp duty on share transactions and other financial transactions.  A low level of 0.1% is the tentative suggestion, although that is not a hard proposal.  In Ireland, we already have a stamp duty on transactions in shares, which stands at 1%.  What is being debated is not particularly out of line with what we are doing, although what we are doing is at a higher level than what is being contemplated.  Listening to the contributions of colleague Ministers around the table, I found there was no common view across the 11 member states that have signed the enhanced co-operation request.  Each has its own attitude.  As such, it might be quite difficult to get agreement when it comes down to the particularities of a tax, even among the 11 concerned.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	7	As I understand it, from what the Minister had to say this morning, Ireland will not be engaging in the first round of discussions on this issue but is taking an observational position.  In the eventuality that an FTT is up and running in a minimum of nine countries, will the Department engage in monitoring the tax that we are foregoing in this regard?  If so, I would ask that the Department report on that matter to this committee.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	8	We will closely monitor any development because it is an issue of great relevance to Ireland.  I do not believe there is a question of Ireland foregoing any tax.  That is conceived so far on the basis of what has progressed.  Our tax take for the 1% stamp duty will be in excess of any possible take that will accrue from a financial transaction tax.  A number of other issues are running parallel to this.  There is agreement among the 11 member states concerned that a financial transaction tax is in principle a good idea.  However, what to do with that financial transaction tax is a matter of debate.  Some people believe that as per the Tobin tax, with which Members will be familiar, it be used to fund non-governmental organisations, NGOs, in under-developed countries.  Another cohort of people think it should be used in the area of climate change, to reduce carbon emissions and so on.  The stronger view now is that it would form a separate stream of direct funding for the European Union.  Currently, this funding is provided by way of contributions from member states.  The thinking now is in terms of a separate stream funded by a financial transaction tax and, possibly, other means in the future.  We are in the early stages of debate on the issue, with 16 of the 27 member countries having already removed themselves from the enhanced co-operation.  There are a range of issues on which there is not unanimity.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	9	I welcome the Minister and his officials and wish the Minister well in his negotiations and discussions at ECOFIN.  The Minister said in his concluding remarks that Ireland would focus on delivering in all respects on the commitments already agreed to by the Heads of State and Government, including those of 29 June.  I assume we can take that as relating to our bank debt in particular.  It is well recognised that there are two aspects to our bank debt, namely, the €30 billion associated with the promissory note and the €29 billion associated with our pillar bank investment.  On the promissory note, there has been an expectation for some time that a technical paper would be produced setting out a mechanism by which some form of resolution would come about.  In this regard, discussions since June have focused on trying to resolve the cost to the taxpayer of the investment that had to be made in our pillar banks.May we take it that there is a continued effort to follow both streams of resolution, the promissory note and dealing with the pillar bank investment?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	10	The decisions of the Council on 29 June were much wider than any commitments made to Spain or Ireland.  The primary decision at that Council was for banking union, and that consists of the three pillars of supervision across Europe, a mechanism whereby insolvent banks across the eurozone and the Union would be resolved centrally by a European mechanism, and a guarantee scheme through insurance for depositors across the Union.  The best way to understand it is to consider how banks work in the United States.  If a bank fails in Texas, the Texan authorities would not have the responsibility for the resolution of the institution.  There would be no big fuss and it is part of the system.  In that context the commitment was made to separate banking debt from sovereign debt.  In this light, a commitment was also made to the possibility of a direct recapitalisation of Spanish banks through use of the European Stability Mechanism, and then there would be examination of the sustainability of the Irish debt position, with all sovereigns treated equally.  It is true to say we are pursuing, as the Deputy noted, both sets of negotiations.  We are engaging on the promissory note, as we have been for some time.  The deadline in that regard is effectively the next payment date, which is 31 March next year.  We are not waiting until then but pushing for an earlier resolution on that.  There is also a position on the trading pillar banks and how we might be recompensed for the fact that the Irish taxpayer ultimately carried the responsibility for recapitalising both Bank of Ireland and AIB.  The Deputy knows from the statement of 29 June on banking union that before any direct recapitalisation of the banking system in Europe can occur, the supervisory aspect of the banking union must be put in place and seen to be working.  That is on a longer timeframe than the promissory note to which I referred.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	11	The Minister is familiar with the country note prepared by the International Monetary Fund, IMF, clearly indicating that our debt to GDP ratio position will not be sustainable unless we get a very significant resolution, particularly on the investment in the pillar banks.  It indicated that the ratio would continue to rise and one of the modelling exercises related to a return to the State of €24 billion.  Unless we get something in that order, the model predicts we would find it difficult to have a sustainable debt position.  What is the Minister's expectation in that regard?  I have seen some modelling done by a number of economists and the IMF indicating that the impact would be relatively minor on our overall debt position because of an elongation of the repayment associated with the promissory note.  The significant positive impact on our debt position would be a return to the State of something in the order of €24 billion to €25 billion, which was invested in the pillar banks.  The Government seems to take some solace from the fact that has been identified, particularly by Chancellor Merkel, as us being a special case as a result.  Does the Minister expect to have a further discussion on this?  I accept the Minister discussed the matter during the week with Mr. Schäuble, who reiterated this special case position.  Does the Minister expect to have discussions as part of ECOFIN about our special case?  What is the Minister's expectation?  Does he expect a position of investment in the order of €24 billion or is it more likely to be the ESM purchasing shares in the pillar banks at market value?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	12	I will comment briefly on the word "sustainability", which is used in two senses.  It is used colloquially, such as when people say it will be very hard for Ireland to deal with servicing this bank debt with sustainability.  When people use it in debate, they do not mean we will default but rather that life is being made difficult for everybody and taxpayers in particular.  It is also used in a very narrow sense, effectively meaning that if a country's debt position is not sustainable, the country will default.  In the first sense I agree with the Deputy and the IMF analysis but in the second sense I do not.  There is no question of us defaulting.  The position is that if our debt peaks at 120% or 121%, we can still service it and it remains sustainable in that sense.  Nevertheless, it would put a very severe burden on the taxpayer, and the amount of resources dedicated to servicing a debt of that level would inhibit growth rates.  The Secretary General of the Department, in speaking to the committee yesterday, used the metaphor of driving a car with the handbrake on.  When speaking about sustainability, particularly with regard to the IMF, it is not an inability to pay that is discussed but rather the difficulty in paying, the burden placed on the taxpayer and the inhibition of growth rates.  There have been various interchanges since 29 June, particularly involving the Taoiseach and Chancellor Merkel, and both on the telephone and in face-to-face meetings.  The German finance Minister came to Farmleigh the week before to meet with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and I had a lengthy meeting with him.  He reaffirmed the position of Chancellor Merkel so there is nothing new to add to the position already stated.  It has been recited, parsed and analysed on a number of occasions in the joint statements made by the Taoiseach and Chancellor Merkel and after the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and I met Mr. Schäuble.  There was a press conference after our meeting and the German Finance Minister quoted Chancellor Merkel in expressing the exact policy position of the federal government.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	13	We can see the National Treasury Management Agency's prediction for the debt to GDP figure to reach 117.5% this year and 120.3% next year.  One projection I have seen for the interest payments on that debt next year will be €9 billion.  How on earth can anybody describe that as sustainable?  Of course, the interest payments can continue but that would be at the cost of impoverishing the Irish people and diverting resources that should be going into desperately needed public investment, for example, into paying the national debt.  How on earth does anybody believe that the sharks in the financial markets will entertain this State for major lending in a year or two when all the economic indicators are downwards?How does the Minister square these circles? 
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	14	There is no doubt that the arrangement into by the previous Government in respect of bank debt has put an enormous burden on the people.  Every household is affected by it and the Government is not making light of that.  It is a huge burden.  The Deputy stated that it is 121% of GDP.  Of that amount 40% is the transfer of bank debt onto the sovereign.  If we did not have to carry the burden of bank debt on the sovereign then the debt GDP ratio would be somewhere over 80% and would be one of the lowest in the European Union.  The average debt of the euro group is about 94% and we would be well under if we did not have to carry the burden.  The purpose behind the two pieces of negotiations is that we envisage a reduction in the burden on the Irish taxpayer thus making it more sustainable.  In blunt language, to reduce the imposition of the servicing of the debt on the taxpayer is the purpose behind the two pieces of negotiations but I cannot predict the outcome.  The Taoiseach has explained the policy position in great detail and the lines that we are pursuing to secure a better deal for Ireland.  We are trying to untangle a previous complex arrangement that was entered into.  We would all agree that the original agreement on bank debt, in particular, imposed a very heavy burden on the taxpayer.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	15	The Minister is right.  It was criminal lunacy but his Government continues the policy of bleeding the Irish people of their resources in order to honour that criminal arrangement.  In light of how indefensible this is, that the Irish people are held to ransom to bail out the European financial system, how does he explain that his colleagues, particularly in German, have made such heavy weather of recognising and acting on an unjust and unsustainable proposal?  Why is there talk of not having an arrangement for debt reduction until after elections take place in Germany near the end of next year?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	16	The previous Government made legal commitments which we cannot resile from.  It would not be in the interests of the country to do so because resiling from those arrangements would put us in a default position.  Default is not part of our policy and in the absence of a default we are negotiating a better position for Ireland.  The Deputy mentioned the German authority.  It is quite clear from the statement on 29 June and the joint communiqué from the Taoiseach and the Chancellor, that Germany is now fully cognisant of the special position of Ireland and that it is positioning policy to do something about that.  It is also a condition, and always was since 29 June, that before there is a move on these matters the direct supervision of the European banking system must be put in place which will be done during the course of 2013. 
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	17	The Minister is right that the previous Government was criminally negligent and responsible for this situation.  The three institutions of the troika, the European Central Bank, the European Union and the IMF, were equally complicit in putting a gun to the head of the disastrous previous Government.  That means that it put a gun to the head of the Irish people.  Why should we adopt a position of justifying ourselves when the previous Government clearly placed a demand on the Irish people to pick up tens of billions of euro of private debt?  It put the debt on their shoulders.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	19	The Irish people are in a position to make a demand and let these institutions know what is acceptable.  The Minister's Government, following on from the disastrous policies of the last Government, is bending the knee to these institutions at every point rather than standing up to them.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	20	That is not true.  On a number of occasions the Deputy has stated his position on these matters.  We both agree that the original deal was a bad one.  The Government is trying to unwind it by negotiation.  As Deputy Dooley pointed out, there are two parts to the negotiations and we are proceeding with them.  We are making some progress and we shall see where it works out.  It is also true that Ireland has a deficit problem and a debt problem.  Both problems are not entirely separate because the services cost of the debt kicks across into magnifying the deficit problem.  Even if there was never a legacy banking issue in Ireland we are still not collecting anything like the amount of revenue that is necessary to run the services on which spending is conducted in Ireland.  There is an impression that if we could sort out the legacy banking issue then everything would be resolved but that is not the case.  There is an equally difficult position with the deficit and we must close the gap between revenue and expenditure and that is what the budgets are about.  I agree with the Deputy that there is a crossover.  Obviously, servicing that debt appears in the current account.

I shall commence by asking him about the single supervisory mechanism and what he referred to as an exchange of views.  He mentioned a proposal that referred to a prudential supervision.  Today, as he will know, we will have all read the newspaper reports on pay levels for executives in the IBRC.  We all welcome the call made by Mr. David Duffy that resulted in a pay reduction for Mr. Eugene Sheehy.  I wonder, within the prudential supervision and the exchange of views, if we could have some discussion on the banks that have been nationalised or left in the control of the State?  Does he see a situation where officials can thumb their nose at pay reductions?  On 5 April the Minister asked Mr. Alan Dukes to require the IBRC executives to take a 15% pay reduction.  I think Mr. Dukes has still not got back to him on that.  Is there scope within the single supervisory mechanism to address the issue?  I know that it involves a difficult legal position given the botched bank bailout by the last Government but, nonetheless, CEO pay is capped.  Perhaps there is a potential to introduce a cap on pay for lower grades. 
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	23	There is general agreement that the light touch supervision that prevailed in Ireland and elsewhere before the banking crisis was one of its causes.  Everywhere, including Europe, has moved away from light touch regulation.  From a policy point of view - driven by the AAA countries in Europe - anything like a common banking system could be put in place.  In other words, before other people would take responsibility centrally for the debts of banking systems and other sovereigns, an effective supervisory system is the first step that must be put in place.  Instead of the Irish Central Bank and the Irish regulator being the sole regulator of the Irish banking system, its regulation would move to Frankfurt.The regulatory system would be organised and driven by Frankfurt. In practical terms, there are approximately 6,000 banks in Europe and there is a debate about the extent, but the Commission proposal is that all 6,000 banking institutions in Europe should be under the supervisory control of the European Central Bank in Frankfurt. How it would work in practice is that it would be the legal entity which would be empowered to regulate. It would work to a common rule book for all the banking institutions in Europe but in the actual application of the regulation there would be nothing to prevent Frankfurt from delegating its legal supervisory authority to local regulators. However, it would also have an override provision, where it could intervene where it thought it was necessary to impose its regulatory regime directly. These are the things that are being worked out. I am outlining the shape of it to the committee. Whatever its shape, it must be refined, agreed and be in place early next year, and a legal framework must be in place by 1 January. That is what is meant by the supervisory position. On the question about the IBRC, it is true that I wrote to Alan Dukes and asked him to talk to the board of IBRC to ask it to apply a pay cut across the pay levels. It was done in the public service and I cannot see why it would not be done elsewhere. At the time, it was discussed by the board of IBRC but the members of the board did not think it was wise or prudent to take the pay cut. The members said the IBRC was losing staff and that it would be very difficult for it to hire. However, my position is that while they have the legal authority to set the pay scales arising from the articles of agreement they entered into at the time the status of Anglo Irish Bank was changed by the previous Government, there is a public interest as well and I will continue to push it. We will see where it goes. The Deputy is correct that I wrote to the bank, but the board said it did not think it would be prudent to apply a reduction in salaries. However, we are working on it. At the same time, the board of IBRC took a 20% reduction in its director fees and took another 15% reduction subsequently. The chief executive has a salary this year that is approximately €200,000 less than what it was last year.

It is important to pursue it and, perhaps, contact Mr. Dukes again.  I have a question about growth.  Mr. John Moran appeared before the committee yesterday.  Much of the commentary appears to forget that Ireland has growth at present, uniquely among similar countries in Europe.  However, there appears to be a downward projection for what our growth figures will be.  Will that help in the negotiations with respect to the promissory note?  At what point does the Minister think the revised growth figures can be made public and how, if at all, will they impact on the budget he is drafting?

We released growth figures in April and they are operable at present.  The next set of growth figures will be released by us in the next couple of weeks.  A large of amount of very strong data are coming through for this quarter, especially for the services sector.  The Deputy will have seen the export figures and the purchasing managers index.  While we have not got a final cut on what the Department of Finance forecasts will be, the trend is that it will be marking up the growth rate for 2012 from 0.7%, which is what we based the figure on, and it will pull back the estimated growth rate for 2013.  It is not all bad news.  There will be an adjustment upward for 2012 and an adjustment downward for 2013.  However, it is not yet finalised so I cannot give the precise figures in advance, but that is the tendency or trend.
#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	26	I welcome the Minister and his officials.  I wish to deal with two issues.  The first is the cost of funds to our banking system at present.  I also wish to hear about the Minister's strategy for the ultimate sale of the banks and how the cost of funds will play into that.  The ECB is reducing the amount of funding it is providing to our pillar banks.  There are many strategies one can use to sell a bank and many different forms of funding can be used.  One can have direct funding from the European Central Bank, personal deposits, corporate deposits or wholesale markets.  In any business model one tries to buy low and sell at a higher price, but we are doing the reverse of that at present.  AIB lost €1 billion last year.  Has the Minister had discussions with President Van Rompuy about trying to provide us with more funding directly from the European Central Bank as we move forward?  We talk about trying to capitalise the bank through the ESM.  That can be done in a less onerous way than going to the markets.  AIB representatives appeared before this committee last week and said they have commenced negotiations with potential investors.  However, if we go to the private markets to sell our shareholding in Bank of Ireland and AIB, we will require multi-strand forms of funding going forward.  I have a preference for going to the ESM.  The reason is that I believe there is a strong argument to be made for our banks to be predominantly funded through the European Central Bank.  It would be a great deal cheaper and less onerous.  Also, it would be a way of dealing ultimately with personal debt.  What are the Minister's thoughts on that?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	27	First, how are the banks funded?  They take in deposits, and the deposit flow into the banks has increased.  If one looks at the project as a repair of the banking system, the fact they are getting an increased flow of deposits is a good indicator that people with savings believe the banks are being repaired.  They are now at the stage where I think interest rates on deposits will probably come down because they have a strong flow of deposits.  Much of their funding also comes from the emergency liquidity assistance, ELA, funding from the European Central Bank.  However, it is not that the ECB is cutting back on the amount of funding available but that with the increased intake of deposits and the deleveraging of the banking system, the Irish banks require less than they did previously.  It is a demand-driven scheme rather than a supply-driven scheme.  On the sale of the banks, one would look first at values.  We own 15% of Bank of Ireland.  We also have preference shares there which will be taken out at some point.  We own 99% of AIB, effectively the whole shareholding.  The National Pensions Reserve Fund calculates values and it puts a value of between €8 billion and €10 billion on this.  This year's figure was revised earlier this year; it was €8.1 billion.  Last year's figure was €8 billion.  This is inexact, however, because one is assuming there is a willing buyer.

The precedent would be applicable to Ireland.  That was the thinking.  If that model was followed through, the ESM would take a bank share.  It would buy the entire shareholding in the case of AIB or take a share in Bank of Ireland.
#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	30	The cost of funds deriving from deposits is far higher than the cost of funds directly from the European Central Bank.  Representatives of the pillar banks appeared before the committee last week and they said they cannot envisage interest rates, particularly those applicable to mortgages, going down in the short, medium or long term.  To the contrary, they envisage them increasing.  That will impose a greater burden.We have talked about debt, which can be sustainable, but in this case it is crippling sustainability. We are asking a racehorse to do a mule's job. It does not apply to a modern society trying to develop itself. Ultimately, we must revise strategy and talk to the European Central Bank to get further funding directly from it. That can only apply if we are on fixed line strategy with the ESM to take shareholding, as opposed to the investment from private stakeholders who will ultimately benefit on the back of the negligent lending of the past. 
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	31	I will bear Deputy Spring's comments in mind.  There are two national interests, which are not always in line.  One is the individual difficulties of mortgage holders and other creditors of banks.  It is in their interest to have low interest rates.  On the other hand, as we are effectively the sole owner of AIB, the other national interest, which is the taxpayers' interest, is to ensure the banks become profitable so there is value in the shareholding held by the taxpayer.  When we look at the level of charges and interest rates applied by the banks, the consideration on behalf of mortgage holders contradicts the consideration of making banks profitable.  It is a difficult matter.

On the ESM, the statement of 29 June envisaged that when banking supervision was put in place, something along the lines suggested by Deputy Spring will happen.  The Irish banks are fully recapitalised under stress conditions.  Within the current property values, the banks are adequately capitalised.  When Basel III regulations on bank recapitalisation come into effect, that may change.  It will not change because of new difficulties in the Irish banking system.  Basel III is further down the line.  Do the committee members think a fund in Europe, designed as a rescue fund, is the best entity to run an Irish bank?  It has no experience of running a bank.  Its function is to raise money on the markets and give it out to countries in difficulty.  We must consider that point and the arrangements-----

I want to pick up on his comment that there is no question of default.  I understand why Deputy Noonan, as Minister for Finance, can say nothing else.  For the Minister to start engaging in the kind of things I might say would drive up borrowing costs for Ireland.  As a Member of the Oireachtas, however, it is very difficult to hear.  The Minister made some fantastic speeches in opposition, including calling the payments to bondholders a disaster and an obscenity and asking how any Government could stand over them.  The Minister laid out why he is doing it and, although I do not agree with all of what he is doing, I understand why he is doing it.  Some 40% of the debt is not ours.  The markets do not believe there is no chance of default and have factored in a greater than 40% chance of default, reflected in the sovereign risk premium.  The Minister cannot say there is any chance of default but I can and I will.  It may be necessary and we should always bear in mind that 40% of it is not ours.  We would never default on debt that was ours.  Regarding the question of Deputy Dara Murphy on the letter to Anglo Irish Bank and wages, did the Minister send a similar letter to AIB?  What is the level of debt surrender engaged in by Bank of Ireland?  If the Minister does not know now, he can come back to us.  We had an extraordinary presentation by Richie Boucher last week, where he refused to answer legitimate questions.  In some cases there was no commercial sensitivity or non-disclosure reason why he could not answer.  He thumbed his nose at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and it was an extraordinary performance.  I would appreciate it if the Minister for Finance can find out.  In respect of domestic mortgages, has Bank of Ireland engaged in debt surrender to date?  I would love to hear the thoughts of the Minister for Finance on the fiscal union in five years' time.  The two-pack is pretty serious.  The first part refers to regulations on "common provisions for monitoring and assessing draft budgetary plans and ensuring the correction of excessive deficit of the Member States".  This is serious in terms of national sovereignty.  The single supervisory mechanism, the single banking regulator, the common capital requirements and the Stability and Growth Pact are serious matters and we are signing up to them.  Can the Minister for Finance give his view on what it will feel like for the Oireachtas to make a budget in five years' time?  Will European officials see the budget ahead of time?  Will they be able to veto budgetary options the Government of the day would like to engage in?

It is unreasonable to ask me to be held accountable for everything across my departmental brief when I have been invited to discuss the ECOFIN agenda.  It is not that I am reluctant to do so but I am hesitant in case I give inaccurate information to committee members speaking from memory when I have not briefed myself on the issues raised and without accompanying documentation.  I am quite prepared to answers the questions but I would prefer if members proceeded by way of parliamentary question and tabled written questions.  Then, I will supply answers but I hesitate to do so now because I have only the brief on ECOFIN.  I briefed myself on that topic last night.

The documents in response to the committee's request include the two-pack, which is being negotiated at a trilogue with the European Parliament, the Presidency and the Commission.  The documents provided refer to the governance part of the two-pack and some regulations on the common provisions for monitoring and assessing draft budgetary plans and ensuring the correction of excessive deficits of member states in the euro area.  There is also regulation on the strengthening of economic and budgetary surveillance of member states experiencing, or threatened with, serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability in the euro area.  There is progress towards agreement with the Parliament but there remain areas of divergence.  The Presidency has filed amendments to bridge the gap.  Members of the committee are familiar with the six-pack and the provisions of the stability treaty, which was passed in Ireland by referendum in May.  It has now been passed by the euro group countries.  It feeds into the additional regulatory regime.  The only additional item coming forward is suggested by the German finance Minister, which is that the Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs be given the same kind of powers as the Commissioner for Competition.Members will recall that the EU Competition Commissioner can take action, without reference back to the college of commissioners, if states are acting against the rules of competition. It is now being suggested that Commissioner Olli Rehn and his successors should have that kind of interventionist role. That would give additional supervision. It remains to be seen whether that comes to anything. As far as I have seen, no formal papers have been filed in this regard to date.

As the Deputy will be aware, the ESRI and the Central Bank developed a paper on the financial transactions tax at my request when it became clear that certain European countries were going to push the matter fairly hard.  I wanted the advice I was getting within the Department of Finance to be supplemented by an examination of the possible impact on Ireland of the financial transactions tax, as then envisaged in the Commission paper.  We got the paper from the ESRI and the Central Bank and it was published on our website last June.

I would like to know how the workings of the Clearing House Group contributed to the Minister's consideration of his policy position.  The ESRI report weighed heavily on the 1984 Swedish movement to bring in a financial transactions tax.  Does the Minister accept that the research done by the ESRI and PricewaterhouseCoopers was very flawed?  The financial transactions tax that is now envisaged is very different from the Swedish model and the model examined by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the ESRI.  Members of the Clearing House Group who regularly meet representatives of the Department of Finance are advising their senior clients that a patchwork tax would be the worst kind of financial transactions tax and that it would be much better for the EU to have a unified financial transactions tax.  Is the Minister prepared to review his policy position on the matter in co-operation with this committee?

The proposal at the time involved the imposition of a financial transactions tax at a very small level to fund overseas development aid, in effect.  The plan was that it would lead to a big international budget for this purpose.  Sweden was the only country to put in place a financial transactions tax along the lines suggested.  It was a disaster from Sweden's point of view because it closed down the Swedish financial sector, in effect.

We are talking about a different type of tax.  As it is a residency tax, it could actually lose revenue.  Transactions could take place here but the tax could be paid in other countries.  I do not think we are having that serious debate.  I know the Chairman is about to cut me off, so I will ask my other question.  This committee has asked for the position papers and minutes of the Clearing House Group that meets the Department of Finance on a regular basis to be made available to it.  I hope the Minister will respond by indicating his support for the request and for the committee's position.

It is a fact that when Sweden introduced a financial transactions tax, it wrecked that country's financial services industry.  The Swedish authorities say that quite openly at meetings.  They are very antagonistic to financial transactions taxes as a result of what happened previously.  I know the situation has moved on.  I set out the Irish policy position on a financial transactions tax in considerable detail in reply to the Chairman's first question here today.

Three things struck me when I looked through the paper.  The two main reinforced steel joists of the meeting are the capitalisation of the banks and the role of a central European banking supervisor.  The rest of the issues are packed in around those two issues.  There is a darkening shadow of debt over Europe.  Politicians across the eurozone are beginning to understand that there has been a criminal capture by the financial system of the budgets of eurozone countries.  The financial transactions tax might have had an earlier origin with other ideas for funding different efforts across European Union countries, but it is now essentially converting itself into an insurance fund for banks.  They get the uneasy feeling that the balance sheets of the 6,000 banks across the eurozone are not as healthy as they have tried to fool everybody about.  We had our own banks in last week.  The sort of good news from Anglo Irish Bank was that the final estimate of its loan losses might be €25 billion, rather than between €29 billion and €36 billion.  That is patently disproved by the facts.  It had a €74 billion loan book at the start of the collapse.  Half of that is €37 billion.  There is going to be a loss of €37 billion, regardless of the mirrored corridors of accounting.  When they said their final estimate is €25 billion, that was after taking credit for approximately €17 billion of interest on promissory notes over the term of those notes.

One of the points the Minister is raising at the ECOFIN meeting is the revised capital requirement rules.  I ask him to outline his view on that matter and what impact he expects the revisions to have on the capitalisation of our banking system.  The Minister referred to the fact that 40% of our national debt relates to the banking system.  In that context, I ask him to indicate how that debt has a knock-on effect on our budgetary position.  The total interest charge for servicing our debt will be €4.1 billion in 2012, €5.6 billion in 2013, €5.5 billion in 2014 and €5.6 billion in 2015.  What is the value amount of those totals that relates to banking?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	91	On the Deputy's first question about the capital requirements directive and regulations, it is important that the heightened pace of the trilogue negotiations is maintained and agreement is reached on the outstanding issues before the Basel III deadline for implementation on 1 January 2013.  In that context, Ireland welcomes the efforts to reach a compromise on the outstanding issues and we favour keeping the proposed text as close to the Council's compromise text as possible.  The prudential capital assessment review assesses the capital requirements arising from expected base and potential stressed loan losses and other financial developments over the medium term and was published in March 2011.  The covered institutions are well capitalised at levels of around 15% to 16%.  These capital levels for tier one capital ratios are clearly well above the minimum of 10.5% required by the Central Bank.  The recent European Banking Authority capital raising exercise did not require further injections into the Irish banks.  CRD IV and CRR, therefore, hold our banks to a higher requirement than has been the case before now, and this will help secure the long-term future.  The servicing costs of all the debt from the Irish banking system do not arise in terms of the ECOFIN agenda, but I can provide that information to the Deputy.  I do not want to speak from memory because I do not want to put out inexact figures.

The Minister spoke of the knock-on effect of that on the budgetary system.  I was just inquiring about the negative impact the bank debt is having on our budgetary position.  We have a dead weight of banking debt which has become sovereign debt.  I was seeking a flavour of-----

I will send them on to the Deputy.  In terms of helping the Deputy, if he thinks of the promissory note repayments on 31 March every year in respect of Anglo Irish Bank alone, the sum is €3.1 billion.  That will go on for about 12 years, and then there is a long tail to it after that of decreasing amounts.

As the Deputy knows, the previous Government negotiated an interest rate holiday so it did not hit our budgets, effectively, until the change of Government.  Within the sum of €3.1 billion there is a lot of capital repayment built in.  The amount is not standard as one goes through the years so, again, in the interest of being exact, I would need to give the Deputy that information later, and I will do so in writing.

Are we approaching a situation where Europe can start dealing with specific problems, like Ireland's debt problem and the deal we are seeking to resolve it?  At a meeting of this committee yesterday, one of my colleagues pointed out that if growth is weaker than expected in the next few years that could have a knock-on effect in terms of us being able to reduce our unemployment levels.  In that context, getting a deal and more support from Europe could have a major impact on our ability to get out of the crisis we are in.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	97	It is certainly in Ireland's interest that Europe would grow at much stronger rates than at present.  Some European countries are in recession at the moment and, indeed, we are one of the stronger countries in terms of growth rates.  We had a growth rate of 1.4% last year, better than the budget provision of 0.7% for this year and somewhere around the middle of the forecast for next year.  We will see in a fortnight's time what the figures will be.  Obviously, if we have stronger growth rates our tax take will increase, our deficit will decrease and more people will go back to work.  Our model is export-led growth and because of that we need growth in the European Union because Europe is such a big customer of ours.  We need growth in Europe to get maximum effect from the model of recovery we are using.  Approximately 20% of our exports go to the United States of America, a further 20% go to the United Kingdom but 40% go to the European Union, with the remainder going to the rest of the world.  One can see from those figures the importance of growing European economies in terms of demand for Irish exports of both goods and services.  We would like to see a European solution that addresses growth and jobs, and the Taoiseach has said on a number of occasions that the main theme of the Irish Presidency will be the growth and jobs agenda.  The Deputy asked how Europe is going at the moment.  It is more settled than it was six months ago but many problems remain to be addressed.  The Greek problem continues but we hope that progress will be made on that in the coming weeks.  Spain still has its difficulties, as Deputies will know from reading the newspapers.  Italy, too, has its own difficulties.  Places like Cyprus and Slovenia have very big banking problems.  Individual countries within the EU all have their own programmes for strengthening their own economies.  The difficulties in Europe are not behind us but significant progress has been made.  The next big European project is banking union.  That should be very helpful to the integrity of the eurozone and the wider ECOFIN zone.  We will see how that develops and how rapidly it can be put in place.

I call on Mr. O'Keeffe to give us some commentary on his submission.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	99	I thank the committee for the opportunity to summarise our pre-budget submission and our position on alcohol taxation.  We represent an industry under considerable pressure.  Pub sales in the past five years are down 34%.  We believe we have a strong case for an excise reduction but we recognise the reality of the public finances.  Accordingly, we are calling for the status quo in terms of excise, that is, that excise levels be maintained at current levels.  We are keen to make one important point clear and understood to the committee.  Excise has a disproportionate impact on the on-trade.  If an excise increase went through, it would result in job losses in the on-trade and a loss of revenue to the Government by virtue of the fact of the VAT intensity of the on-trade.  More VAT is generated from the on-trade than the off-trade.  We are keen for the committee to recognise the differential impact between the on-trade and off-trade when it is considering its view.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	103	Clearly, a rise in taxation would further depress the on-trade.  It would result in a switch in product and channel from the on-trade to the off-trade and it would result in a loss of jobs and tax revenue.  The level of these losses would depend on the level of the tax increase.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	104	If there were a 1% decrease, would it create employment or job opportunities?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	105	A decrease would have an important and positive impact on the industry and the psychology of the consumer.  People look closely at the price of drink and if the price of drink came down, it would be a positive thing.  It is important to recognise that the Government has been supportive of the industry through the 9% VAT rate on food in the hospitality sector, which is positive, and in terms of The Gathering initiative in 2013, which is designed to promote Ireland.  It would be conflicting to have a hike in excise in the year of The Gathering.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	106	I thank the Chairman for having us before the committee today.  Our association represents independent, specialist off-licences.  We have 350 members who run pure or specialist off-licences.  These are family owned and operated in the community.  Unfortunately for us, alcohol in the off-sales sector is in the crossfire of a war for market share within the grocery industry.  The upshot of the deep discounting of alcohol has been the loss of 2,800 jobs in our sector.  There have been 75 closures in the past four years and seven closures since July 2012.  Based on these figures, we reckon we face a further 25 or 30 business closures in 2013.  Our members are trained, highly skilled owner-operators located in the heart of the community.  They employ expertise in retailing alcohol but their livelihood is being undermined and threatened by the use of alcohol as a driver for footfall to sell other, dearer grocery products.  An excise increase is a luxury we cannot afford.  Currently we are having difficulty competing with the large multiples because they can absorb increases and sell below cost and reclaim the VAT on any loss against other grocery products.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	108	Yes, alcohol is our only product.  Failure to adhere to the law would mean a loss of livelihood.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	109	I welcome the National Off-Licence Association, NOffLA, and the Drinks Industry Group of Ireland, DIGI, and I thank them for their pre-budget submissions.  It seems the role of the multiples in the sale of alcohol in the off-trade has completely distorted the market.  I am keen to establish whether there is a way of marrying the health objectives we all share while recognising the financial and budgetary constraints within which the Government must work.  I know many members of Ms Jones's association are struggling despite a shift from the on-trade to the off-trade.  Frankly, many in the on-trade are on their knees.  Is there some way to address this, perhaps through the licensing system, by revising the level of licence fee paid or by attaching a levy to the multiples?  The way in which they are selling alcohol makes it ridiculously cheap.  This is having many negative consequences and it should be reviewed.  Is there some way of marrying these two issues, perhaps through the licensing system?  Am I right in saying that a large multiple only pays the same amount for its licence to sell beer, wine or spirits as a small independent off-licence or a Centra selling wine?  I understand they pay €500.  Is that correct?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	110	There are three licences involved, each for €500.  Therefore, the total renewal fee is €1,500.  That is not linked to turnover.  It is a standard fee across the board whether one is a large multinational or a small shop like mine.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	111	Is it irrespective of floor space or turnover?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	112	Yes, and it is regardless of retail sales or volume.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	113	That is a glaring anomaly which should be addressed.  It is a possible mechanism by which the market can be regularised and by which the role of the multiples can be put under the microscope.I know it can be difficult to prove whether or not alcohol is being sold below cost and the point has, correctly, been made that multiples have such a wide range of products they can afford to have loss leaders to get customers in the door and increase their footfall. Is there clear evidence that alcohol is being sold below cost?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	114	I can give an example.  In its latest offering, dated 5 November, Tesco offers two litres of spirits for €40.  In other words, one can buy two litre bottles of vodka, rum, gin and so on, for €40, or €20 for a litre.  The duty on that is €12.45 and the VAT is €2.87.  That leaves €3.80 for the guy in Sweden to pick the winter wheat for the Absolut vodka, bring it in, distil it, box it, ship it through customs, send it to Ireland, give it to a wholesaler, sell it to a multiple and for the multiple to take it out of the box and put it on the shelf.  To argue that below cost selling is not taking place is a farce.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	115	On that point, I will bring in Mr. O'Brien and Mr. O'Keeffe.  Are certain brands of beer, or whatever, on sale in multiples at prices that are less than it costs you to put them on the shelves of your bars?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	116	Absolutely.  The wholesale price at which most of our members buy is higher than the retail price in the multiple retail sector.  That is a fact.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	117	Is the differential pence or more?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	118	The differential is in euro, and sometimes in many euro.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	119	I do not agree with the exercise we carry out every year, where tax increases on alcohol and tobacco in the budget are justified on the grounds of health.  I have always opposed these tax increases, particularly on tobacco.  The health issue is an excuse and hypocrisy by Governments.  Health issues are serious but they should be dealt with in a different way, rather than by piling on taxes.  That is also my position with regard to the forthcoming budget.  At the same time, I am in favour of a complete ban on the advertising of legal drugs which can have very damaging effects, even though most of us take them to some degree or other.  If there was no increase in tax on alcohol, or even if there was a decrease, which is unlikely, what is the chance of Mr. O'Keeffe's industry giving a break to the customer?  There is a huge rip-off in the pub industry on the sale of wine per glass, for example.  In an off-licence premises of one of Ms Jones's members one can buy a bottle of wine for €8, but one would be charged €5.50 for a glass of the same wine in many pubs.  If, conservatively, one can get five glasses from a bottle of wine, that amounts to €27.50.  That is a huge rip-off of someone who is having a social drink.  If the Exchequer does not take money from the public, some element of the drinks industry will.  
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	120	First, we reject any notion of a rip-off.  Second, when there was an excise duty decrease three years ago, the Central Statistics Office, the independent Government statistical service, showed the reduction was passed on in full across the industry.  Third, there is a fundamental difference between buying a product to take home and buying the same product to consume in an on-trade environment.  We have to make a margin to sustain ourselves financially.  A price range is in operation in the market.  One can buy a glass of wine in a Dublin pub for between €4.50 and €10.  A consumer will be able to find a pub that offers a really strong price value proposition and where he or she will be happy to pay the price.  Alcohol in the on-trade is a discretionary item.  People come to pubs because they want to.  They come because we offer a product and service that is attractive.  Not every pub is attractive to every customer, but the individual can find a pub that suits his or her needs so that we are both happy to do business.

Is the Drinks Industry Group of Ireland, DIGI, an umbrella organisation that represents all drinks suppliers?  Do the witnesses accept that there is a social cost to the over-consumption of alcohol in Ireland at present?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	122	Suppliers, publicans, the National Off-Licence Association, restaurants, hotels and everyone except multiple retailers are in the DIGI group.  We represent everyone in the chain except retail multiples.  I accept that the abuse of alcohol has a social cost.  We support measures targeted at dealing with alcohol misuse.  Most of us are involved in the DrinkAware campaign which is probably the single best resource for helping people to deal with understanding drink.  The misuse of alcohol clearly has a social cost.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	124	Mr. Donall O'Keeffe can speak for publicans, but the pub is, clearly, a regulated environment.  An off-licence is also a regulated environment, in that professional people are serving there.  The difference is that the product is consumed in the regulated environment of a pub, with appropriate and trained staff.  It is, clearly, different if the customer takes the product home.  That is true.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	125	We argue strongly that the pub is a controlled and social environment in which to consume alcohol.  It is controlled from two angles.  There is control by the management and staff, and publicans take their responsibilities very seriously in this regard.  No publican wants his pub full of people drunk out of their minds.  It is not an attractive atmosphere and does not attract good regular business.  It is in the publican's own professional and business interest to control that environment.  Second, there is the social control from other customers.  Consumed socially, alcohol is very enjoyable.  A customer can meet people and have a drink and a chat.  It is a very positive thing to do.  From my perspective, representing publicans, it is the best environment in which to consume alcohol.

Does he accept that it is indisputable that the availability of very cheap alcohol in off-licences is directly linked to over-consumption, particularly by young people but also by people generally?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	127	I will answer that, as an off-licence operator.  The prevalence of excessive drinking has emerged as a result of price promotions and the merchandising of alcohol to drive footfall into multiple mixed trading environments.  Specialist off-licences retail in a responsible manner.  They must; otherwise, they will lose their licences.  They must make margin and pay their rent, rates and staff.  They cannot afford to retail alcohol below cost or at cost.  If they do, they will go out of business.  The manner in which alcohol has been permitted to be price promoted by mixed trading environments in the media has permitted this.  It is incumbent upon the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Health to bring forward their action plans. The Commission on Taxation has stated that the impact on health and public order, among other things, must be considered. The Department of Finance has taken action in that among EU countries, Ireland has the fourth highest excise duty on beer and spirits, the highest excise duty on sparkling wines, the third highest excise duty on wine and the second highest excise duty on cider. Many member states have no excise duty on alcohol. It is difficult to park a health and justice argument into a finance and taxation argument and I do not think it is right.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	128	It is important to note that overall consumption in Ireland has declined by 20% in the past ten years.

I represent a fairly rural area in Sligo and north Leitrim.  Sligo is a fairly big town but much of the area is rural.  I am very conscious that a number of pubs and off-licences have closed over recent years.  We spoke briefly about the social implications of pubs serving drink.  I also see a social benefit in having a bar in a rural area and it is a great loss when a local bar is closed.  Many rural folk may go down to the pub once a week to have a few pints, meet their neighbours and have a chat.  If that pub closes, often those people will not go out.  It might be an over-simplification to hope that a reduction of 1% or 2% in excise duty rates, if it were envisaged, would change the situation dramatically.  Surveys have shown that people do not have enough disposable income at the end of the week and they have to make tough choices.  Increasingly, people are choosing not to go to the pub or to the off-licence.  It is quite understandable that if a person wants to buy a bottle of gin or wine, they will go to wherever they can buy it cheapest.  In my view that is rational and logical.  How does the number of licences per capita in Ireland compare with international figures?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	130	I have not studied European norms.  We have done comparisons with the United Kingdom.  In simple terms, we are not as densely pubbed, so to speak, as the UK.  The UK has a deregulated system and, on a per capita basis, there are three times as many pubs in the UK as there are in Ireland.  In our view, Ireland is densely pubbed in that there is no shortage of pubs.  That is not a matter for debate.  Compared with the UK, however, Ireland is less densely pubbed.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	132	Yes.  They are closing at a far faster rate than in Ireland.  The information is anecdotal but the rate of closure is probably six to seven times the Irish rate.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	134	Yes, it is a completely different structure.  I am just referring to the number of outlets.  In the UK the top six or seven chains each has several thousand pubs.  The largest chain has 8,000 pubs.  It is a very different structure of ownership and of supplying the market.

I understand the desire of the drinks industry not to be the subject of further tax increases.  However, I am confused to hear that the consumption of alcohol is down by 20% in less than ten years.  I refer to a recent report which said the very opposite by stating that in the period 1970 to 1990, there was a doubling of alcohol consumption and that 50% of the population abstained from alcohol.  Now, only 15%, if even that, abstain from alcohol.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	136	Both are correct.  It depends on the length of the time period.  From the 1970s there was a large growth in consumption per head.  Females, who generally did not consume as much alcohol - the lady would have the glass of sherry - became almost what one might call normal drinkers.  That raised the average level per head.  It maximised at the turn of the century, in 2001, and since that year it has dropped from about 14 litres per head to just below 12 litres per head.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	138	There is a demographic factor as well as a health factor.  Those aged 20 to 30 years tend to be bigger drinkers than when they marry, have children, settle down and have other responsibilities.

I want to deal with the nub of the issue which is the marketing, advertising and merchandising of alcohol.  The quid pro quo is that if the industry wants a stay on any further taxation on alcohol, it should be the promoter rather than the Government or Members of the Oireachtas who seeks containment of merchandising and advertising.  In my view, the glamorising of alcohol is where the problem lies, even more so than the price of alcohol.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	140	If I may answer from the perspective of a supplier, we have what is probably the most stringent code in the world in respect of the promotion of alcohol.

I ask the delegation to develop its point about excise duty as this would be of assistance to the committee and to the Department.  The issue of below-cost selling is recognised as a difficulty.  There are three different types of outlets for the sale of alcohol.  The off-site outlet issue is far more complex, and Ms Jones made this clear in her contribution.  The big multiple retailer and the independent or family-owned chain of off-licences operate a different model, albeit with under the same rules.

What we are doing is facilitating the various organisations, associations and groups which made pre-budget submissions in the context of outlining their positions.  We ask that our guests do not go into detail in respect of their submissions because these have been circulated to members for their perusal.  Instead, our guests can summarise what they see as the main points of their proposals and members may then pose questions.  I invite Ms Kathleen O'Meara and Mr. Ronan Lyons to make their opening comments.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	152	I and my colleague from the Irish Heart Foundation, Mr. Chris Macey, welcome the opportunity to come before the committee.  As the Chairman indicated, our submission has been circulated.  We have come to this budget process with a new and radical idea.  Members will be aware the Irish Heart Foundation and the Irish Cancer Society are committed to the battle against tobacco in Ireland, especially in view of the high death rate relating to smoking.  The idea we have come up with in the context of the forthcoming budget is that tobacco profits should be controlled.  The tobacco industry in Ireland is earning extraordinary profits.  These are much higher than needs to be the case and, as a result, we have an opportunity to do two things.  The first of these would be for the Government to take €150 million extra from the industry, which would send a very strong signal.  We would urge that at least some of this money be spent on combating the marketing practices of the tobacco industry, on assisting those who want to quit smoking and on providing help to those who have been harmed by smoking.  Our proposal is specific in nature and it is designed to take some of the huge profits earned by the tobacco industry in Ireland.  To put it in simple terms, the Government takes 79% of the industry's profits.  The figure for the UK is 90%.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	153	That information is contained in the submission.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	154	Yes.  We are proposing a very simple solution, namely, the creation of a regulator to regulate the Irish tobacco market.  There are particular reasons we are proposing this and these are based on how the tobacco market operates in this country.  We are of the view that a regulator is necessary both in the context of taking the profits to which I refer and to regulate the market in a certain way.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	155	My name is Ronan Lyons and I am speaking today on behalf of the Smart Taxes Network.  I will be brief because I would like to maximise the time available for questions and discussion.  Given that a property tax is on the way, we would argue strongly in favour of a tax that is based on site value rather than on a full tax.  The reason for this is that it would be better from both from the point of view of progressiveness and from the perspective of offering an economic incentive.  In addition, it will be easier to introduce.  I will not say any more than that now.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	156	The committee receives submissions from different groups and there would be a conflict in respect of them.  As part of its presentation and in the context of the interests of its retail members, I am sure IBEC will state that the smuggling of tobacco is increasingly becoming a problem.  If one sets aside the health issues and concentrates on the product, it is evident that there is smuggling and criminality on a massive scale and that, as a result, the Exchequer is losing huge amounts of revenue.  Further increases in the price of tobacco are merely going to compound the problem.  As Deputy Dara Murphy stated earlier in the context of price elasticity, increasing the price can often lead to unintended consequences.  Perhaps our guests might comment on that aspect.  On the introduction of a site valuation property tax, a particular issue arises.  This relates to the position of those who own high value houses which are situated on low value land versus people who own low value houses which are situated on high value land.  How fair is Smart Taxes Network's proposal in respect of this matter?  It could be criticised because it suggests that more money be taken - in the form of a wealth tax - from those who fall into the latter of the two categories to which I refer.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	157	There is no doubt that tobacco smuggling is a very big issue.  In addition to the revenue that is being lost, cheap tobacco is being made available to young people.  In our opinion, this is keeping smoking rates among children very high.  However, there is a great deal of misinformation in respect of this matter.  We are strongly of the view that tax increases are not necessarily the driver of the problem in question.  Not many people are aware that the price of cigarettes in the UK is actually higher than it is in this country.  The cost of the premium brand of cigarette in Ireland is €9.20, whereas in the UK it is €9.30.  The UK authorities have been increasing the price for the past ten years on a price escalator above inflation of between 2% and 5%.  In the same period, they have cut the rate of smuggling from 21% to 9% because they are dealing with the problem.  In this country we are reducing the number of customs officers by hundreds.

There are members present who could speak for as long as Mr. Macey.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	159	Sure.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	161	This is an enforcement issue as far as we are concerned.  It is also an issue relating to the activities of entrenched criminal networks as opposed to one of tax.  This is proved by the UK case.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	162	In the context of high value houses on low value land, this is very much a footnote to the differential effect of a full value tax compared with a site value tax.  The latter encourages people to use land well.  If we were to introduce a full value tax, we would actually punish construction activity at the very time when we need to be fostering it by encouraging retrofits and extensions.  We must encourage people to use their land well, particularly because many of them will, as a result of negative equity, be stuck on the same plot of land for the foreseeable future.  The primary effect of a site tax would assist in encouraging individuals to use their land well.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	163	Would it not be possible to deal with that difficulty?  One of the positive aspects of Smart Taxes Network's proposal is that it would not penalise developments or home improvements.  Other jurisdictions have vacant site registers in respect of which compound penalties apply and these ensure properties are not left vacant.  Putting in place such a register here would strengthen the Derelict Sites Act.  We could also consider imposing a property tax that would be calculated not on a per €1,000 basis in respect of the value of a house but which would be calculated on the basis of €25,000 or €50,000 bands instead.  If one's house is worth €200,000 and if one spends €100,000 carrying out work on it, we know for a fact that it will not increase in value by €100,000.  The value increases proportionately rather than on the basis of the amount of money spent on improvements.Would there not be the same outcome if there was a band based upon value?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	164	That strikes me as an incredibly complicated way of achieving a simple outcome.  The UK is stuck using a band system that was agreed in 1991.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	166	When any country has had an opportunity to put in place a property tax system from scratch, it has avoided bands.  The UK is stuck using 1991 values more than 20 years later.  We should put in place the simplest system that achieves the same effect.  If one wants to punish vacant lands and sites, which is already done via site-valued taxes and, as such, an extra system is unnecessary, I recommend that it be done via a per person tax credit, which would further shift the burden of taxation away from people and onto land.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	167	I welcome our guests.  I might take Ms O'Meara up on the idea of extracting further profits from the tobacco companies operating in Ireland.  Does such a model work elsewhere and could we emulate it?  Extracting profits is an attractive idea about which I would like to know more.  What level of profits is being earned by tobacco companies in Ireland?  What does Mr. Lyons believe the impact will be on householders of adopting a site value tax as opposed to the Government's apparent plan, namely, a market value tax?  If the burden is being spread via a site value tax to other forms of property owners, will individual households have smaller bills?  What categories of people are captured by a site value tax that are not captured by a market value tax?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	168	Last year, €1.36 billion went to the Exchequer in the form of tobacco tax.  It is difficult to quantify the tobacco companies' profits in Ireland.  In the UK, Philip Morris and Imperial Tobacco earn 50% and 65% of turnover, respectively.  We have done a great deal of work in devising a model specifically for Ireland.  From figures supplied through the Revenue Commissioners, we have been able to identify that the tobacco industry takes 21% of the retail price.  In the UK, that figure is much lower.  This is the gap that we are considering.  I did not have an opportunity earlier to explain how the companies have done this in an interesting way.  Generally, there is a price increase in every budget.  In recent years, that increase has been in cent.  Despite the fact that the tobacco industry approaches people such as the Deputy, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners and argues against price increases, it increases its own prices while the Government increases taxes on tobacco in the budget.  Therefore, it widens its profit take and keeps its profits high.  This fact has not been identified prior to our work.  We are looking in that direction for profit.  Normally, we would ask for a tax increase and we are not ruling it out.  Indeed, we ask that members consider a tax on hand-rolled tobacco, which is currently much lower than the tax on rolled tobacco.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	170	We have asked the Government to consider a tax on hand-rolled tobacco.  The Irish market is not unique, but it differs from the UK market.  For this reason, we are proposing a particular model.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	171	As Deputy McGrath suggested, the impact of the site value tax would be less than it would under a full tax.  The principal reason is that vacant development land and developed land are treated equally.  If one takes the route of a full value tax instead, it is effectively equivalent to a second bailout.  The vacant landbanks on the edges of towns would not be hit in a tax liability sense.  Their value would be increased relative to everywhere else and their owners would be given free money by the rest of society.  An element of the impact should be stressed.  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has discussed his desire for the regeneration of town centres.  A full value system would push people onto the fringes of towns and remove activity from the centre.  A site value tax would encourage people to use valuable land in the centre of towns.  This is as much a commercial as a residential point, but it holds true to the system.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	172	My problem with the Irish Cancer Society's policy traditionally is that it always hits on price increases to try to overcome the damage done by nicotine addiction.  Unfortunately, that increase hits the poorest people in society.  As the submission states, smoking is the greatest contributor to health inequalities and accounts for up to half the difference in life expectancy between the richest and the poorest groups in our society.  Is this because there is a higher level of addiction among people with lower incomes?  If so, piling additional costs on an addiction that is difficult to break places additional hardships on people who are already stretched financially.  I always vote against the Government's increases under spurious health arguments when the reality is that it wants another grab at working class people's profits.  The executive summary of the Irish Cancer Society's provisions does not seem to refer to the advertising of tobacco, which remains prevalent in various ways.  Is this not a key area to hit?  Would it not be better to commit resources to helping people overcome this addiction without breaking their pockets?  I fully agree with hitting companies' profits up to the limit.  I am in favour of taking the companies into public ownership and, on a different basis, recognising smoking as a serious health and societal hazard.  Be it a site value tax or a property tax, the reality is that it is another grab.  It will be a tax on the shoulders of people who are bailing out speculators and bankers all over Europe.  In many cases, people have been impoverished as a result.  The domestic economy is trashed.  Whatever form the tax takes, Mr. Lyons is in favour of placing another burden on those people.  Some of us fundamentally oppose that idea.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	175	I will ask Mr. Macey to respond.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	176	A tobacco tax is undoubtedly regressive.  However, 58% of 18 to 29 year old women in the lowest socioeconomic groups smoke.  This figure is more than double the figure for the general population.  One in four women in those communities will die from tobacco.  It is the greatest driver of health inequality in the country and tobacco tax is every state's greatest weapon to tackle tobacco addiction.  Not only should the taxes increase, but that money should be spent on helping people to get off cigarettes.  If people can do so, they will be better off in the long run.  We view it in terms of the health savings, which are more important for the communities in question than the economic savings of continuing to smoke.The bigger the financial burden a tax increase places on people, the more likely they are to give up. That has been proven by statistics. I would not push that argument too hard but it is still a fact that this can help people to stop smoking and help them and their communities to be healthier. It can reduce overall costs to people.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	177	In speaking about taking yet more money from the pockets of ordinary householders, I understand the motivation behind the point.  There is a gap between Government spending and receipts.  I would like to close that gap as fairly as possible and going after wealth is part of the solution.  Two thirds of wealth in Ireland is in real estate, with the bulk of it in land.  A site value tax would be much more progressive than another increase in income tax, as the increase in income tax would eat away at tax credits.  One cannot hide a house in Switzerland and if a person owns a large house in Ireland, it will fall under a site value tax.  The most valuable sites in Ireland are still worth up to €10 million per acre, so we should get some of that publicly created value back into public hands.

Is it idealistic?  There are two ways for the State to extract profit from tobacco companies, which operate legal businesses in this country.  Some 79% of the total profit goes to excise or VAT.  Has there been any legal opinion as to whether it is possible for any government to engage in a profit tax that is different from income or corporation tax?  The witnesses do not have the figures but what if the State got approximately €250 million from the  €1.36 billion, with the retailers getting a chunk, along with people working for the companies and costs for buildings, etc.?  The tobacco companies would have a profit so has it been ascertained if it would be legal to propose to treat the profit differently than that of any other industry legally carried out in the State?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	179	Tobacco profit is not the same as profit from other companies, and the industry is not like others.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	183	Yes, it is related to health.  Political will would be required to do this, and we have seen examples of political will in this area in Ireland before.  We are not saying this is a simple request and it is not.  We have been told that it is potentially difficult in the context of the tobacco tax directive but our advice is that it can be done.  In particular, it can be done because this issue is health-related as opposed to a normal market element.  There is no question that it would be an intervention in the market but there are other examples of market intervention.  We are asking for this market intervention because tobacco harm is so considerable and there are public health issues involved that are being dealt with internationally.  For example, the only public health international treaty concerns tobacco, namely, the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.  That is a World Health Organization treaty and Ireland is a signatory to it.  It is an unprecedented treaty in many ways and it is designed to intervene in and control relationships in particular around tobacco.  It is recognised internationally and by the Irish Government that the tobacco industry is not a normal industry and the level of harm being caused by it means that governments must take a particular view about it.  Therefore, we ask for political will to become evident.  A previous Minister responsible for health, Deputy Micheál Martin, took action that at the time was unprecedented in the world.

We conducted research on this which was published in the UK in 2010, The Case for OFSMOKE: How Tobacco Price Regulation is Needed to Promote the Health of Markets, Government Revenue and the Public.  I will leave the reference with the committee.  It states:Most governments have extensive experience in undertaking these sorts of activities and the fact that price cap regulation is used in other sectors provides sufficient evidence of its feasibility and legality under both World Trade Organization and European Union rules.It would be compliant with Article 3 of the Global Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  Although it is considered a restriction, it would be legal under international law.

Advertising on the packaging indicates such products damage health and there are now pictures to illustrate that.  People from the tobacco industry indicated that the volume of cigarettes sold illegally for consumption is now huge.  Do the witnesses have updated figures?  From every ten cigarettes smoked, how many are smuggled and how many are bought in ordinary shops?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	188	Revenue Commissioners figures are very different from the industry's figures in that respect.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	192	They follow a number of processes.  A market research company carries out work on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners with the office of tobacco control in the HSE.

Apparently, a person can buy cigarettes on the black market at a quarter or a fifth of the price in a shop.  A shop may charge €10 for a packet of cigarettes that is sold for €2 or €3 on the black market.  That is a major incentive for crime, as the Chairman mentioned.  The penalties for bringing in cigarettes illegally are absurdly low.  These products arrive in 40-foot containers and not handbags or suitcases.  If the shippers could be fined €100,000 or €250,000, they would be more careful about the cargo taken on board and prevent illegal products from using their ships.  It is not for me to ask some questions and if I am lucky, some journalist might pick up on the issue.  As part of the presentation, the witnesses should articulate the answers and help us make them a reality.  With regard to Mr. Lyons's comments, I agree that a site value tax is the way to get optimum use from land and resources in an economy.  If it is introduced at a low level, it could be done fairly.  I have not seen practical worked examples of how people would have to complete a form or valuation on a self-assessed basis.  We have been told that a decision has been taken and the Government wants to collect this through the Revenue Commissioners.  That is a given unless there are strong reasons for this not to be the case.  Perhaps it should.  How can we get a simple form together so people can provide their own self-assessment?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	194	In year one there would be a tax credit to have a site formally assessed and this would be done with a checklist approved by the Revenue Commissioners.

A site value tax relates to the income generation capacity of any site, either in the form of rental for a house, office block or factory.  There should be a sensible economic connection with the piece of physical land, and it would be a fair basis for starting the collection of a tax.  If there is income from land, there is an ability to pay tax from the income.

Representatives of the Irish Exporters Association were to participate in this session but they are not present.  The session is scheduled to run between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. but a vote is expected in the Dáil at 3.40 p.m. and, therefore, we will manage this as best as we can.  The intention is not go through in their entirety the submissions the delegations have made but to give the representatives an opportunity to highlight what they consider to be the most significant aspects or the priority issues and for members to question the proposals and seek further information.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	201	I thank the Chairman.  The fundamental point Retail Excellence Ireland, REI, would like to make is that the Minister for Finance let many retailers down in the most recent budget when he announced that the Government would not act on the matter of upward-only rents, a subject the Chairman worked tirelessly on, having pledged that it would.  The one good thing that came out of the Budget Statement was the application of guidelines to insist that the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, would engage with vulnerable tenants and potentially reduce rents.  We meet NAMA officials every six weeks and they are doing that.  They have reduced rents in the majority of cases for vulnerable tenants.  We would like those guidelines to be applied to other State landlords in the upcoming budget such as the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, which is currently increasing rents for tenants in Cork, and local authorities, which are forcing through rent increases on top of untenable rents.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	202	Essentially we have two key principles in our budget submission this year.  The first is that the budget ensures businesses can retain and create jobs.  The way to do that is not to increase the cost of doing business.  Second, we need measures to support the restoration of consumer confidence in the domestic market.  With regard to the cost of employment, the budget is all about the threats rather than necessarily what we want in it.  The kites that have been flown so far have destroyed investment and expansion in the interim because people are so worried about measures such as employer's PRSI increasing, mandatory pension provision and the transfer of four weeks of sick pay onto employers.  Anything that adds to the cost of hiring somebody will militate against employers creating jobs in exactly the same fashion as the slashing of the redundancy rebate last year killed off the transfer of businesses.  One cannot buy a business now because the risks are too high.  We want the Government to job-proof all policies and to make an assessment of the impact on jobs of the implementation of various measures.  That is the key and critical message.  We have many tax proposals in the submission that might help small businesses, in particular in the area of finance and improving cashflow, and I can take questions about those, but the key message is not to increase costs.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	203	With respect to Mr. Fitzsimons's opening statement, the committee made a recommendation yesterday afternoon having met Mr. Moran, the Secretary General in the Department of Finance on that matter.  Similar measures are needed for IBRC and other State-owned properties.  In the submission, REI is seeking the establishment of a stimulus group that would encourage citizens to apply for seasonal and temporary positions within the retail sector.  Could he elaborate on that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	204	We raised this with Mr. Ollie Rehn and we got a favourable response in Europe to some of the ideas we raised.  Basically the retail industry used to employ more than 300,000 people and when the recession came, this reduced to a skeleton full-time staff of 255,000.  That means when the seasonal peak arrives at Christmas, there is a necessity to hire many more temporary employees than we used to.  It is our contention that between 30,000 and 35,000 will be employed this Christmas.  The problem our members have is it is challenging to make these appointments because people on social welfare find it a challenge to get back on welfare when the work finishes.  It takes six to eight weeks for them to resume their welfare payments and they are bereft of cash to live off during that period.  Thus, they will not take advantage of the opportunity to work temporarily and that is a concern.  We need to build a flexible social welfare system that fits today's environment, not yesterday's where we all had jobs for life.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	205	Is that an issue for the SFA?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	206	It is.  I did a piece of work on this that I will send to the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation separately about direct member experience.  It is not just in this area.  It relates to the general principle of how the welfare system works.  We need to move to an hour-based system.  The reality is our system derives from the concept of the five-day week.  Most businesses operate a seven-day week and, for example, nursing homes need people for a few hours in the morning and a few in the afternoon.  The system, therefore, needs to be redesigned in the sense that it should not hamper anyone to take up employment.  Signing on or off should be fluid.  If the welfare system can be integrated more directly with the Revenue, given employers are supplying Revenue with the relevant information when they set up employees on the tax system, it should be a simple process to offset one against the other to ensure people do not lose out.  However, seasonal sectors such as the fishing industry present huge problems in terms of practical details.  Even where up to three months' work is available, there is no incentive for people to take it up.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	207	I welcome the REI and SFA representatives.  Mr. Fitzsimons said that progress is being made on the guidelines as they apply to NAMA properties and that is welcome given the ban on upward-only rent reviews will not be extended to existing leases.  How widespread is the problem of State-owned institutions such as the banks being difficult in renegotiating rent for tenants?  I am aware of the IBRC case in Cork.  Are there cases where the intransigence of these State bodies has cost jobs or has the potential to cost many jobs?  The timing of the budget has been the subject of comment recently.  The Christmas period is a critical time for REI members because so many of their sales are achieved during that period.  Is there is an optimum time for the Budget Statement?  Should it be brought forward by a number of weeks to give people a clearer run into Christmas or should it be put back to the new year?  The key issue for Ms Callan and the SFA is no increase in the cost of employment.I attended one of the briefings in the audio-visual room in Leinster House that addressed the sick pay scheme and employer PRSI. It is unfortunate that both schemes fall within the Department of Social Protection, given the enormous adjustment that Department must put through in the forthcoming budget. Can the witnesses crystallise the impact of the measures? People in business are very scared that either or both measures will fly in some shape or form. What would be the impact on existing businesses and their potential to take on new staff?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	208	In response to the first question, on the budget scheduling, the worst time is the first week in December.  People plan their gifts for loved ones and, more importantly, people decide to buy cars in November and December and then collect them in January.  The most preferable date is the lowest ebb in the economic cycle in the retail context, which is February and early March.  If we are ploughing ahead with austerity, as we must, it would make sense to do so at the quietest period in the cycle rather than at its peak.  Speculation, kite flying and discussion about austerity measures leads to people being frozen with fear.  The State as a landlord is not a major issue because most landlords are private entities.  The Minister for Finance mandated NAMA to engage with tenants and it is now the largest landlord of any type in the country.  We urge committee members, the Department of Finance and the Minister to apply the guidelines if they make good sense.  Vulnerable tenants need the guidelines.  Why not apply them to other State landlords?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	209	Specifically on the topic of job creation, a survey of our members showed 46% thought the biggest barrier to job creation was not enough business and 33% said it was cost.  These are the top issues for people thinking about whether to create jobs.  In the context of the budget, we need to move it out of peak business cycles and have uncertainty squashed fairly fast.  One of our five key messages is not only to have an annual budget but to know what will hit us over the coming three years.  Uncertainty kills decision making.  If it is bad news and people know about it, they can decide to invest and plan accordingly.  It is critical to the restoration of confidence.  With regard to cost, people are struggling to pay wages at the end of the week so anything that increases costs will militate against their decisions to hire people.  One particular example concerns the redundancy rebate reducing from 60% to 15%.  If someone with 20 years service was eligible for the maximum of €600 per week, the overall redundancy payment amounts to €24,600 and, under current rules, the company must come up with an additional €11,070.  For every person the company was going to make redundant, it must now get rid of two people because the bank will not supply money to fund redundancies.  There is no incentive for people on the margin to continue to trade or to sell a business.  It makes people go into the insolvency fund.  It is nonsense and was not thought through.  The approach of the Department of Social Protection concerns its own budget.  We need a whole of Government perspective.  There is no point in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation writing an action plan for jobs with 200 good ideas when, in one fell swoop, negative decisions wipe out that good.  That is why we need consensus.  I have never taken so many calls and e-mails from our members about any single issue as about the sick pay issue.  They cannot understand it.  In the case of our nearest neighbours, Northern Ireland, people are paid at half the rate here.  Employers there pay the sum in the first instance but reclaim the amount through the income tax system.  It will also put us at a competitive disadvantage.  Across Europe, there is no consistency in systems in terms of clarity, despite the Minister's comments.  The briefing arranged by the Minister had experts flown in from the UK who spent two years analysing this, including consultation, examining medical issues, the problem of certification, and systems and cost problems, and they decided not to change the system because of the recession and the dramatic negative impact it would have on businesses and growth.  Ireland has done no analysis, despite the Minister's promise of a cost-benefit analysis.  The Minister promised she would exempt small companies up to 100 employees, which was promptly revoked by her officials.  In this malaise of uncertainty, people are making decisions and have stopped creating jobs because they are worried about what will happen.

I had a number of retail units and I come from a small business background.  I am sympathetic to the witnesses.  Having said that, it is important to note the Government has reduced PRSI in its brief term in office.  In international terms Ireland is going up the charts as a place to do business.  In comparison with many of our competitors, Ireland is now a cheaper place to conduct business.  Commercial rates have not increased over recent years, with the exception of a couple of local authorities.  Although the witnesses refer to destroying investment, despite the extremely difficult economic climate, the economy is experiencing modest growth.  We should all be more careful in our language and when using terms like "destroying".  I accept there are difficulties for people in the retail sector and we are hopeful improvements in foreign direct investment will trickle down to small business, which is the natural order of things.  Last week, representatives from the banks appeared before the committee in an extraordinary session and there was significant questioning about how banks are dealing with small businesses and lending.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	213	It is untrue to say the country has decreased PRSI.  There have been PRSI exemption schemes to support companies hiring long-term unemployed people and those coming off JobBridge.  The problem with the schemes is that they have been underused relative to their value.  Small companies are not tax experts and the scheme does not really resonate.  One of the proposals, which is under discussion, is that it should be simplified.  The proposal should be to give businesses €1,000 or €2,000 to take people on.  This is plain language and is why measures such as the special savings incentive account scheme worked all those years ago.  That would be better than the tax system.  In real terms, we have experienced nothing but increased taxation on labour.  The marginal tax rate for self-employed people is 55% and 52% for employees, which is one of the highest in Europe.  It is a deterrent and we should be incentivising people to work.  A tax on labour is a disincentive to work.  We welcome the reduction of business costs but it is mainly in the private sector.  Government-imposed charges and fees have increased.  It is business to business negotiation that has seen the benefit.  It is no great feat that commercial rates have been frozen when rents have dropped by 20% or 30% in real terms.  Rates have not dropped to the same extent even though we have years of deflation.  There was no deflation in rates.  The whole system is unfair.  Why is the business community paying for the public good?  It is not receiving a service in return.  The whole system must be completely revisited and we are disappointed that, in the programme for Government, even if the €500 million of efficiencies in local authorities is achieved, it will do nothing to help businesses.  Instead, it will offset the central Government contribution.  The proposal is not to split it equally with ratepayers so rates will remain the same.  Members may be aware of the revaluation process at present, which will take ten to 15 years to get around the country.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	215	With regard to bank lending, the fundamental is that we have good vibrant businesses to lend to, which are not basket cases.  To do that, we need to reduce business costs.  We need to realign our domestic economy costs to equate to current market demand, which is dissipated.  Rates have been mentioned.  I am aware that it would be a challenge to reduce rates.  They are currently increasing because of revaluation.  Anyone in a primary location, such as a high street or shopping centre where all the retailers are, is facing increases in the revaluation process.  It is fundamental that ratepayers receive a service.  We have been arguing this for a long time and we launched the Town & City Management Framework, a way of managing towns.  Many retailers are happy to pay the same rates but they want the same service one gets in a shopping centre.  They want a secure and safe environment, fair and equitable car parking and a good vibrant retail mix that engages with customers.    In Dublin city, the ratepayers want to pay more.  They are willing to participate in a bid to pay more rates if they are assured of the delivery of services that will, in turn, increase consumer demand because customers will want to come into a safe and engaging space.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	217	Ms Callan knows the domestic economic is being eviscerated by the disastrous austerity policy and the bailout of European bankers, speculators and the like.  Small enterprises and self-employed people, along with workers, are its foremost victims.  It puzzles me why her organisation continually pushes a policy that will further eviscerate the domestic economy.  In her submission, for example, she shows herself to be in favour of the impoverishment of young people who cannot find jobs.  For people under 25, she proposes a weekly dole of €55.  She complains that social welfare benefits are too high.  What does she want?  Does she want a slave population that will work for nothing for her members, or for employers generally?  Is that the policy of her organisation?  She has called, again and again, for a property tax and a water tax on ordinary householders.  Here, she is at one with the Government which speaks in terms of broadening the tax base, as a cover-up for a grab for hundreds of euro more that many people simply cannot afford, as if there was a pot of gold hidden under every house that can be reached into to pay this tax.    She recommends a tax of €400 which can go from that up to €1,000.  With regard to water, the ESRI and other agencies want a combined tax of €1,300 per annum, which will mean new taxes on top of ordinary people.  This will cut down people's ability to buy the services of Ms Callan's people.  There is a fundamental contradiction in her position.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	220	In reality, our members have come together and looked at the budget from a realistic stance.  We are where we are.  No one wants to be here but we are borrowing €1 billion a month to fund our public services.  Given that position, we must make choices.  In our analysis, as Mr. Ronan Lyons has said, property tax is the least damaging to economic development and growth.  The only way we are going to exit this crisis is by growth and by allowing businesses to get on with their jobs and try to create more jobs.  I hope we will all agree on that.  Our position is not incongruous.  It is about hard choices.  In making those choices, we accept that it will take money out of people's pockets and we do not want that to happen.  It has to happen somewhere, however, and it is better that we tax assets, and a property tax is a wealth tax.    With regard to our analysis of the social welfare bill, it is a reality that we got carried away during the Celtic tiger years.  The Department of Social Protection's statistical information on social services for 2010 states that the rates of short-term payments had increased by 80.5% in 2010 on a baseline of 2001.  During that time the consumer price index, CPI, went up by 21.7%.  Our social welfare rates went up at four times the cost of living.  They are completely out of line with international trends.  We certainly do not have a slave population.  We have the second highest minimum wage in Europe, which is something our members are having to deal with.  Our analysis of youth unemployment is based on a UK model of trying to incentivise people who have never had a job to go and find work.  Schemes such as JobBridge have been successful, but JobBridge could be much more successful.  Some 2,000 of the internships that were advertised attracted no applicants.  We have an issue with making work attractive and encouraging people.  While I accept that there are not enough jobs for everyone, there is a mismatch that we need to get to the bottom of.  This has to do with delivering on Pathways to Work and the Department of Social Protection engaging better with employers.  We all have a common aim, which is to exit the crisis and to have a better life for all our people.  The way to do that is to give someone a job, rather than leave them floundering on welfare.

I am not saying there should not be any cuts, but I question whether there might be taxes.  In order to pay a contribution for a service one has to have income.  Income is the flow out of which taxes can be paid.  When everything is in balance, as Mr. Ronan Lyons said in the previous submission, one can have a tax from the notional income that comes from owning sites or land, depending on whether the land is residential, commercial, retail or whatever.  When in balance, an economy can put a demand on the owners of land for a contribution towards the general purse.  When, however, the revenues of the State have suffered a sudden drop off a precipice and when expenditure is way above revenue, one has to look to revenue, temporarily, as bridging financing for the readjustment programme in order to maintain fairness as well as take a reality check, to use Ms Callan's own words.  There is income.  We know this from having asked the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners.  A high incomes levy on incomes of €120,000 and over would produce €520 million.  A corporation tax uplift of 2.5% on the headline rate-----

#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	223	I am asking why they both make the same point.  Here is a reason for suggesting their presumption is misplaced.  They say it in two lines in both submissions.  The submissions contain some good points about supporting investment and jobs through the tax system.  Points Nos. 1, 2 and 3 under that heading are imaginative, creative and realistic.  I come back, however, to the fundamental point that one should not presume that taxes cannot provide the short-term three year bridging financing to carry €1.25 billion of the readjustment programme without hurting the economy, as Deputy Joe Higgins has said.  The indigenous economy, GNP, is worth €130 billion while GDP is €150 billion or more.  The one that everyone in Europe talks about is GDP but this country is, realistically, on GNP.  For our 250,000 employees, it is GNP that counts.  We must get this message across to people listening in from abroad.  It is not happening.  They do not understand the household and business debt burdens on our society.That is why the proposal about the cash receipts basis being increased is very clever, because the small businesses cannot get the liquidity to pay their VAT bills due to the volatility of their incomes. Well done, but I urge the witnesses to think about it and not to be afraid. I have asked the chief executives of the multinational corporations about corporation tax. They would not blink if the rate went from 12.5% to 15%, and that would yield €670 million.

It is correct that when we frame these conversations we must be cognisant of the catastrophe that has happened in the sector.  It would not be fair to do otherwise.  With regard to the budgetary process, we met the troika and it was quite shocked at how long the process is in Ireland.  It really starts in July when the discussions begin in public.  Many of the sector's issues focus on cost base.  That is logical because it is an item that could be under the control of the State.  Obviously, demand has collapsed so I would like to hear more from the witnesses about how to stimulate demand in the economy.  On jobs retention, Germany has a system under which viable companies can put in a proposal whereby over a small period of time, perhaps a year or 18 months, they get some level of support from the state to help them keep their employees employed.  That stops after the specified period.  There is a view that the issue of upward-only rent reviews is dead and buried, but there are possibilities.  We could legislate for a reduction in the length of rental contracts.  I understand that rental contracts in this State are far longer than the European average.  A reduction of those rental contracts would allow for the frozen high rents to come to an end sooner, which would be in everybody's interest.  Have the witnesses considered the idea of a progressive rates base, whereby the rates take is not changed but the balance of who pays the rates changes?  In other words, a small firm that is not making a profit would pay slightly lower rates than a large multinational that is making a larger profit.  Therefore, typically a rate would be based upon the type and size of the business as well as taking into consideration the profitability of the business.  What are the witnesses' views on those issues?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	225	To take the latter point first, I disagree with rates based on profit.  There would be an inherent motivation to not be the best.  It would be rewarding the unprofitable.  In retail, the most progressive, forward thinking retailers are commonly the most profitable.  Indeed, last Saturday evening, we, along with the President of Ireland, interviewed the winner of the store of the year, who has hired many people over recent years despite the recession.  He is a good retailer.  I do not wish that guy to be incentivised with lower rates if he becomes unprofitable.  The fundamental issue with rates, regardless of how they are structured, is that we get service.  One pays a service charge in shopping centres.  There are weekly and monthly service charge meetings, accounts are put up on the board, everybody has their say and they decide what the shopping centre will do.  They spend the money and do it transparently.  Currently, we have these beautiful big glass boxes called local authority buildings sitting in county towns, but there is very little transparency.  There is a parade to announce the fact that the path was slightly improved or a bit of damage was rectified, but they are not dealing with vacancy, dereliction, street lighting or crime.  Next week, the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, the Garda Síochána, our organisation, Chambers Ireland and the County and City Managers' Association are coming together to devise a way forward for our town centres.  Hopefully, through that type of national representation we will motivate stakeholders locally to engage with their local authority and put some plans together to re-engage with customers.  Regardless of who pays the rates, if the rates are wasted we are fooling ourselves and wasting time.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	226	On the point about stimulating demand, as I said at the outset the biggest issue in this regard is to have clarity, confidence and knowledge about what the plan is.  That is fundamental.  From the business community's perspective in terms of stimulating our investment and looking at expansion, notwithstanding the absence of customers there are the problems of credit and credit flow that were mentioned earlier.  To refer back to the tax measures that could help, we believe it is important to introduce a roll-over type of relief in the budget whereby we can incentivise entrepreneurs who sell a business to reinvest in another business.  That will help in terms of investment finance for new start-ups, which will be critical for creating an enterprise culture as we move forward.  We propose moving to a VAT cash receipts basis.  We understand that moving from €1 million to €2 million is no problem with the EU and can be done straight away.  It would massively impact and help companies with their cashflow, which would allow them to invest more which, hopefully, will build confidence.  We also believe there should be specific examination of releasing personal pensions.  It is ironic that when owner managers put money into a pension pot when they could afford it, they were allowed to invest in property and equity but not in business.  It is an absurd system.  Either changing the system or allowing the early release of those non-essential funds is critically important.  From the business community's perspective in terms of confidence, it is very much about its ability to invest and expand.  For customers, it is about messaging, clarity and knowing where we are going, which is somewhat unclear.

Has any analysis been undertaken by the witnesses to estimate the reduction in the number of jobs or the cost for jobs as a result of the redundancy changes and the future possible change in sick pay?  There is a major change by the Government with regard to county enterprise boards, CEBs, in terms of marrying them to local authorities.  What are the witnesses's views on that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	229	We have conducted a survey analysis of members.  I will send it to the committee so the members will have the details.  On the CEBs, it is fundamentally flawed logic.  It will cause serious damage and our major concern is that there has been no attempt to ask the end user, the business person or the person who is thinking about setting up a business, what they want from the service.  It is all about internal wrangling and moving things out of one Department and into another, with no end user in sight.  It needs to be seriously examined.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	230	Integration of services locally is fundamentally important in respect of the county enterprise board being joined at the hip with the local authority.  A final point to be made, and Deputy Mathews alluded to it, is that retail in the GNP is worth a significant amount of money to this country.  It is largest private sector employer with 255,000 people employed, yet we do not have any transparent leadership in the Government for that industry.  If we wish to talk about rent, we must go to the Department of Justice and Equality, in the case of rates it is the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, for labour issues it is the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation or the Department of Social Protection and for e-commerce it is the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.

I welcome Dr. Seán Healy from Social Justice Ireland and Mr. Tom McDonnell from TASC and thank them for appearing before the committee. Rather than go into the budgetary submissions and give full presentations on them, it is an opportunity for the delegates to identify one or two points the would wish to raise with committee members and also it is an opportunity for members to tease out some of the concepts in the proposal in greater detail.  I welcome you to the committee.  I will begin by asking Dr. Seán Healy about his proposal on property tax, where he stated that he is in favour of the site valuation model as opposed to the valuation model.  There are arguments for and against this, one of which is that the site valuation model does not provide the type of gatekeeping that a true valuation model would have.  For example, in the early 1990s if a person was earning €35,000 his or her house would, perhaps, have been worth €50,000.  People saw their house values increase to €200,000 to €300,000 but their salary did not increase with it.  There would have been an immediate question as to the level of taxation on people's property not meeting that of their income.  I would like to hear more on that issue.  The universal pension system was also mentioned.  Perhaps Dr. Healy would elaborate his views on that issue.    Mr. Tom McDonnell proposes an 0.35% tax on residential property.  How did he arrive at that rate?  How does he see it applying to citizens?  Does he propose that it apply to all citizens, regardless of annual income and household income?

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	236	There is space to say what you wish but I would appreciate if you would take the questions as well.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	237	That is no problem.  The most important thing I would like to say to the committee is that at the core of any issue around budget is the question of consistency in government policy, what might be called coherence in government policy.  What I am saying is that the Government should not have a series of policies that are working in different directions.  For example, the most important issue that needs to be addressed within the overall budget context is to face up to the fact that the current set of proposals on the budgetary adjustment aimed at producing a borrowing reduction of €3.5 billion in 2013 is not a consistent or coherent position.  The reason being that the way it is set up, there is a ratio of almost 2:1, that is €2 in cuts for every €1 in tax increases.  If the Government persists with that policy it will not be able to meet other objectives, such as protecting vulnerable people or core public services, whether those services are delivered by the State, the private sector or the community and voluntary sector or combinations of one, two or three of those.  That is not doable if the Government continues to move in that direction.  Another point about the same issue is that the overall low tax take in Ireland is not sustainable given the commitments the Government is already engaged in on a range of fronts.  One the one side, the Government is trying to reduce borrowing which is desirable and has to be done.  On the other side it is trying to ensure public services are maintained and delivered at a frequency and capacity that people require.  People are trying to provide those services and maintain what is available with far less of a tax take than any other country in a similar position.  One might say the Government is trying to deliver European Union levels of service with American levels of taxation and I do not believe that is possible.  In that context what is needed is more coherence and consistency in policy. What we would be looking at therefore is the service levels that people want and how they are to be delivered, the level of social protection and so on.  We also need to consider what is possible in terms of a fair taxation system and if there is a shortfall of a certain amount how then can those services be delivered.  Does the tax take have to be increased or do we have to find other ways of doing it?  The point is that there should not be an attempt to do the impossible.  I wish to make one other reservation and then respond to the two questions.  Social Justice Ireland is strongly of the view that Ireland cannot get itself out of its present predicament without getting a serious break on the debt issue and that does not mean extending it, unless for 20 years, such as getting a bond and paying it in 20 years time.  That is not the way to go unless one goes with the Karl Whelan proposal that we pay it all back in 3.1 billion years at the rate of €1 per year, with the interest to be paid at the end.  Clearly it is a rather facetious proposal but it is trying to make a simple point that it is not possible with Ireland's current levels of debt, which are rising, to get ourselves out of this spiral.We also need jobs. Without investment there will be no jobs at any scale. Without sufficient jobs there will not be recovery. Without recovery, we will be stuck in this austerity for the foreseeable future. Those issues are on the broader budgetary table which maybe we are not dealing with because we are just dealing with the taxation issue here, but the taxation issue feeds into that. We would be proposing, for example-----
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	238	I ask Dr. Healy to conclude answering.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	239	We propose that there should be a substantial off-the-books investment in a program to generate jobs.  All of the proposals are in the document.  The Chairman asked me about the universal pension proposal.  What we are doing is straightforward enough.  We are proposing that the Government does two things in the budget.  On the one side it should offer tax relief at the standard rate for pension contributions so that it is no longer available at 41%.  At the moment some 80% of pension contribution tax breaks go to top 20% of earners.  Therefore the richest 20% in the country get 80% benefit from the tax break.  For the sake of consistency in policy, coherence and trying to benefit everybody, it would be much more sensible to stop that, make it available at the 20% rate for everybody and use the money not to write off debt but to create a universal pension.  At the moment there is a need for that type of initiative.  Some 46,000 women in Ireland do not have a right to a pension of any kind and never will.  This is an issue that has been ignored by successive governments for three decades.  It is an historical issue about how pensions developed in Ireland.  People never got into the system or were taken out of the system going back to the times of the marriage bar and such like.  The 46,000 women would be covered in this because it would be universal.  Everybody at 66 years of age would get-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	241	As we have calculated it, it would be the same rate as the contributory old age pension.  We would scrap the non-contributory old-age pension and everybody over the age of 66 would get the level of the contributory old-age pension.  In no case would anybody get only part of the contributory pension, which is happening to many people because they have not made sufficient contributions over their working life, have not been in the system for long enough or for whatever the reason bars them from getting full payment.  That is a fairer system and is a redistribution from the top 20% throughout the system, picking up the holes and closing them off.  That is what we would do with the universal pension.  On property tax, we favour a site value tax.  The easiest way to calculate it is by paying a tax on the basis of the services that have been put into the site by the taxpayer in the first place.  For example, if a particular area has many services, then the site value has been increased dramatically by the taxpayer putting money into that area.  Another geographical area might have little or no taxpayers support put in.  In such cases we believe the site value has not been enhanced by the public purse.  For example, somewhere near the Custom House-----

The Luas practically passes the door of the Custom House.  The DART railway station is across the road from it.  Busáras is there and the city centre is very close.  All the other public services including sewerage and water services are supplied.  Therefore a considerable amount of tax money went into the development of that property.  What does someone living close to Mullaghanish near Ballyvourney have?  The State does not supply water there.  Although there might be electricity, there is no public transport - there might be a bus once a day but people need to get themselves down to the village.  With all the supports and taxpayer investment that has gone into it, that part of Dublin 1 is obviously quite different from a rural place that has had very little investment.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	247	TASC recognises the size of the deficit and it is within that context that we propose the set of measures we do.  For consistency with the Government's position we have decided rather than necessarily implicit support for stating that a budge adjustment of €3.5 billion is the appropriate amount, we have to the greatest extent possible attempted to adhere to the Government's triple lock although not fully.  In proposing our composite set of proposals to an adjustment of €3.5 billion we have considered the wide body of empirical literature and radical literature as to which types of tax have which types of effects.  These include long-term effects, short-term effects, sustainability, efficiency, social justice, equity and so on.  We have considered all of these issues and it is in that context that we make our proposals.  I echo Dr. Healy's points on debt sustainability and the need for a deal on the banking debt, but we can come back to that.  The Chairman asked me specifically about the property tax.  The evidence is very clear.  Recurrent, as opposed to transaction, tax on immovable property is the most efficient and sustainable tax over the long-term.  If properly designed, it can be equitable.  For example a recurrent tax, which is a flat tax, such as the one that is in place at the moment is of course not equitable.  It is a question of how the system is designed and to what extent waivers are given and so on.  We advocate having no waivers and rather having an ability-to-pay-based deferral system.  This ensures the integrity of the funding or revenue source over the long term because it will eventually accrue to the Exchequer in the form of capital acquisitions tax being supplemented by a lien on the house or as part of the subsequent transactions.  Therefore it is sustainable over the longer term and because it is a known resource coming in over the longer term, the bond markets and everybody else can regard that revenue as being stable, which is not true in the case of, for example, stamp duty.  We picked a tax which is market-based in the short term but have given great consideration to the concept of a land or a site valuation tax over the long-term.  Ultimately the current market value of the asset is the amount a buyer will pay for it rather than some notional value which will be subjective pending rezonings and so forth.  Dr. Healy spoke about the services provided and of course the market value will reflect the services in the area, whether it be a Luas line, motorways, shops and so forth.  Therefore a property in Ballyvourney which is identical in every way to a property in Ballsbridge except for location will be valued at a much lower price because of the amenities available in Ballsbridge.  As property prices increase and decrease, it will obviously impact on the revenue to the State, but because the value of tax increases as the price of the property increases, it acts as a dampening effect, both up and down, on the fluctuations in property prices over the medium and long-term thereby helping to prevent future crises.  Nevertheless the advantages of the site valuation system are also very enticing.  We have proposed that it should be a 0.35% levy which should apply to all residential properties except for those for social housing, for housing homeless people and so on.It should be universal and there should be horizontal equity. While everyone should pay, people in defined situations such as mortgage arrears or whose combined household and child care costs exceed a particular proportion of their household income resulting in it going below a certain level would qualify for a deferral. The 0.35% rate was decided on in the larger context of identifying particular forms of taxation to provide a sustainable tax base over the long term. It is our position, based upon the evidence, that these types of taxes are the least damaging to employment, growth and sustainability over the medium and long term and should, therefore, be substantial. For example, a tax of 0.35% on a house worth €200,000 would be €700. This would be deferred in respect of a person experiencing mortgage arrears, based on his or her inability to pay.

I would like to focus for a minute on the property tax.  I do not agree with the notion of a site valuation tax.  Support for or against it is, I suppose, based on one's general experience.  There is usually a nice social mix of housing in rural villages.  Often there could be one large house, built by a professional who had the means to do so, next door to a more modest house which meets the needs of its occupants and is on a site of the same value as the large house.  For this reason, I would be concerned about concentrating our focus on a site valuation tax.  I am interested in hearing Dr. Sean Healy's view, given his understanding of social mix and the dispersal of population, on how a site valuation tax might work negatively in this regard.  While it may not necessarily lead to ghettoisation, it could impact negatively on the way in which rural parts of Ireland nicely knit together.  I believe the tax would be better reflected on the property rather than the site.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	249	I do not believe there is any likelihood it would lead to ghettoisation.  In my view, people would benefit from whatever services were available and would have to provide the other services that are not available.  Where there are different types of houses because some people had more money than others that is another issue.  There are other ways of dealing with that, namely, an income or wealth tax or a combination of both on people with higher income who have built the larger homes which are worth more.  What we attempted to do was to link the tax with what has already been done with taxpayers' money.  The services provided in a village or town will be of a particular level, with variations from place to place.  The smaller the town or village, the more likely it is there will be fewer public services available because less money will have been invested in service provision there.  In that context, it would appear to us that a site value tax would be fair.  I do not believe it would have any real ghettoisation effect.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	250	I would not go so far as to say it will result in ghettoisation or gentrification.  However, I believe basing it on market value is probably less susceptible over the long term to the creation of the type of effect that a site valuation tax would have.  That is not to suggest I believe that would happen.  Nevertheless, it is a greater risk.  Ultimately, basing the tax on the value of the wealth asset - the property, be it principle or private - should be the basic system employed.  It is possible to have a maximum cap in terms of the proportion of income a person would pay.  Again, we would advocate that that would be a parity, ability to pay and deferral system.  While over the longer term the risks vis-à-vis ghettoisation or gentrification do appear, unfortunately every tax and public service created has a behavioural effect on the economy.  There is no doubt about that.  There are winners, losers and unintended consequences, as evidenced from some of the property based tax reliefs over the past decade, which relate to other factors.  We are calling for the tax to be introduced in this year's budget and to apply from next year.  It needs to be done quickly and at a reasonably high level and should probably be increased in future years.  Ultimately, from an economic efficiency perspective and from an equity point of view, we believe the evidence favours the type of model we are proposing.

I would like to make one brief observation.  The essence of our non-contributory pension is its universality.  In comparative terms across the European Union, in particular the eurozone area, it is quite generous.  Like Deputy Dooley, I am not convinced by the site valuation tax model.  Perhaps Mr. McDonnell will respond to following matter, which goes to the core of social justice.  It has been suggested that people in social housing would be exempt from whatever type of property tax is introduced.  I am aware, as I am sure are other members, of areas where there is a mix of private and social housing.  In many cases the people in social housing who have far more disposable income than those in private housing who are faced with paying mortgages and so on.  Perhaps Mr. McDonnell will say how he arrived at the rationale for an exemption for such a large block of housing in the State, namely, the social housing block.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	252	I should perhaps have been more exact in what I said.  What we specifically called for is an exemption for social housing and group residential facilities used exclusively for certain specific purposes such as the provision of housing facilities for the homeless.  Perhaps I did not make that clear in my earlier remarks.  We are not calling for an exemption in respect of all social housing.  We are speaking specifically about residential facilities which are used for designated purposes.  We are conscious of equity issues.  TASC is a think-tank, whose raison d'être is economic equality in the context of efficiency and so on.  Therefore, we believe it should be the market value of the wealth asset that is taxed.  We should, because these are immovable assets as opposed to certain other types of assets which because of capital controls are easy to move off-shore, focus on these assets, at least for now.  I agree with Deputy Murphy about the universality principle.  There should be no waivers rather deferrals only should be permitted, which eventually come due.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	254	Borrowings are taken into account in the context of ability to pay.  Where a person's housing and child care costs exceed a particular amount, in terms of the housing costs being associated with mortgage borrowings, this would have to be taken into account in the context of the deferral system.  This is set out in our submission to the interdepartmental group.  Broadly speaking, this is the only sustainable system that can be maintained.  On the issue of people losing properties and so on, that arguably requires a different set of policies, which are not fiscal policies.It has more to do with personal insolvency and other areas.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	256	The non-contributory old age pension is not universal because it is means tested.  We are speaking about a non-means tested old age pension which would be paid to everybody at the same level and which would be at the level of the contributory old age pension.  There is an illusion that everybody in Ireland is entitled to a pension at least equivalent to the non-contributory old age pension.  This is not true.  Many people receive a partial payment in their contributory old age pension and they are not in a position to claim on a means tested basis to get the balance through the non-contributory system.  A total of 46,000 women receive nothing because they have no entitlement to a pension under any heading.  They can make a claim for the non-contributory pension if they do not have enough income to live - whatever the basic parameters are for this at any time - but they do not have a right to it as such.  It is means tested and if they have means or notional means, they do not receive it.  We are in favour of a universal payment.  The question was asked that if people in social housing have more money available than people in other housing, why should they not have to pay a property tax.  My approach is that they should pay tax in another way.  If they have more disposable money available than other people, it is not because of their welfare payments, because these payments are already below the poverty line.  In most cases a welfare payment does not provide enough to live life with dignity.  It is not sufficient to provide the level of income required for a minimally adequate standard of living.  Research carried out by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice shows this to be the case.  If the people have money from other sources, this money should be open to taxation in other ways.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	257	At one stage TASC was considered to be a radical think tank alternative, but I must say Mr. McDonnell's contribution was hugely disappointing.  In reality it bought in completely to the bailouts and the austerity agenda when what we need are radical alternatives.  With regard to the property tax, I believe Mr. McDonnell stated every house valued between €150,000 and €300,000 should be taxed per annum at €675.  Is this correct?

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	261	Where on earth does Mr. McDonnell think hard-pressed working people on modest incomes will find this extra money?  I presume he is also in favour of a water tax, which will increase this amount to €1,000 or €1,300.  From where is this sacred text about property tax and broadening the tax base coming?  It is as if every household has a hidden pot of gold it can pull from under the floorboards and pay as property tax.  In fact, it will come from the same place as income tax and VAT, which is the take-home pay of working people.  I find extraordinary Mr. McDonnell's proposals for a deferral if people are on low incomes or unemployed.  Take the generation on 35 or 40 year mortgages as a result of the extortion and racketeering which went on in the property market and of which they were victims when they needed to buy a home to start a family.  For the past ten years they have paid extortionate rates.  Perhaps they must move on to an interest only arrangement with the bank for the next ten years, after which they may barely be able to afford the payments again.  At the end of all this, thousands or perhaps tens of thousands of a tax will have mounted up.  I must put it to Mr. McDonnell that this is extraordinary.  I agree with much of what Dr. Healy's organisation, Social Justice Ireland, has said, but he is opting for a site tax which would also be on the family home.  The home does not earn an income.  It costs money to keep.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	262	Those in difficulty would presumably qualify for a deferral.  One of the advantages of this system is that the tax burden is lower during a time of high unemployment and low incomes throughout the economy and rises at stronger periods.  Property is wealth, and this would be a wealth tax.  I regard a wealth tax as very much a progressive measure.  For too long we have had a dysfunctional tax system.  The amount of revenue brought in by the State is far beneath the levels sufficient to generate western European standards of public services, which I assume Deputy Higgins supports.  Therefore the question is how this is paid for and who pays for it.  Wealth as opposed to income only must be a component of this.  It is the least damaging to employment and efficiency.  The question then is how this is done.  One begins by taxing immovable property in a universal system which acknowledges that those on low incomes and suffering from mortgage arrears difficulties are exempted for a period.  If they remain in difficulty for the coming 20 years, they will continue to qualify for a deferral until such time as the house is transferred.  If the amount is €700 a year for 20 years the total would be €14,000 which would be paid when the house is sold.  It would be much less damaging to the individual at that time than it would be to have to pay €700 per year now.  We feel this is by far the best system to help reduce the €10 billion structural deficit we have in an equitable and efficient way consistent with not damaging employment.  For what it is worth, the majority of the remainder of our proposals are taxes on inter-generational wealth transfer and inheritance.  We also speak about reducing pension tax expenditures because the current system is a disgrace.  I do not know any economist on the right or left internationally who would support our system.  I agree with Dr. Healy that the basic pension should be increased because this is how one helps people.  I strongly advocate that no cuts whatsoever should be made to primary or secondary benefits for vulnerable groups and taxes should not be increased for low income groups.  Through carefully working out all of these measures one can design a system, even for this year at €3.5 billion, which protects the most vulnerable in society and places the burden precisely where it should be, which is on the wealthiest and highest income groups.  We do not buy into the austerity narrative.  We have argued for years about how it is counter-productive.  We have called for the €4.5 billion from the National Pensions Reserve Fund to be targeted.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	263	It is important to understand where we are coming from in all of this.  For much longer than a decade, since before the recession hit us in 2008, we have been arguing about the tax base, and Deputy Higgins is well familiar with our arguments.  We were very conscious of the fact that the tax base was being narrowed which made the tax take very vulnerable if anything happened.Since 2001 we have clearly indicated, in print and in meetings with politicians up to and including the Taoiseach of the day, that the amount of houses being built was in excess of what was required. We used the phrase, "You did not need to be Einstein to know that there would come a day when we would have to stop building too many houses" because there was more than enough to keep us going. Consequently, the Government's tax take was extremely vulnerable because there was too much emphasis placed on transaction taxes. Then Social Inclusion Ireland reached the sensible conclusion that it was best to substantially increase the tax take from fixed assets or wealth in one way or another and thus property became part of that. We opted for a site value tax because we thought it was more likely to work, more effective and more equitable. I shall deal with the equity side. A high value was placed on land in urban areas but much of that was tied to the social and economic investment that was paid for by taxpayers. That being the case then there should be a payment given back to all taxpayers, and not just the taxpayers living in the area, from what had been provided in the area at taxpayer's expense. We then concluded that site values was a better way to go. It can be argued that a substantial portion of the benefit of the land value should be enjoyed by all of the members of the community, not just the owner of a particular property. An increase in site values is linked to the investment in infrastructure in the area and much of that was paid for by taxpayers. Therefore, it can be argued that a substantial portion of the benefit gained by an increasing site value should go to the whole community through the tax system. That is why we opted for this approach rather than house values.

Fr. Healy gave the Custom House and Dublin 1 as an example and talked about all of the infrastructure. First, we must bear in mind that most of the high concentrations of poverty are also found in inner city areas and that is precisely why taxpayer investment and infrastructure was made.  Second, I shall reiterate the point made by Deputy Higgins.  We are not dealing with perfect equilibrium because people are up to their tonsils in debt and they were fleeced.  They are now in negative equity and can only afford to pay interest only mortgages at present.  That problem will not go away anytime soon.  I was surprised by how the group dealt with a wealth tax.  Why was it not more expansive in how it defined wealth?  There are more assets than the family home.  Can I ask each of the delegations to identify what it thinks is the most important matter for the forthcoming budget when it comes to dealing with two categories of citizens, the children and the working poor.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	271	I shall answer the Deputy's other question.  In order to help the working poor we simply propose that tax credits be refunded.  There are 130,000 people in jobs but they are so low paid that their household is in poverty.  Therefore, we must do something to target those people and to keep them in their jobs.  We have talked about how to incentivise people to take up jobs.  These people have jobs but they are paid so little that they are below the poverty line or are struggling financially.  A simple measure that would help would be to refund the two main tax credits to which they are entitled.  In other words, change the system so that they can benefit from the full value of their tax credit.  For the most part, they do not benefit from the full value of the tax credit, so they could receive a payment from the State to make up the balance.  That means that the poorest people in employment, the working poor, would benefit from the full value of any changes in the tax credit system.  I know that we are not likely to see that in the budget this year or next year.  There was a time when they were increasing and I hope that it will happen again.  It is perverse that a tax change of that nature can help everybody except the poorest in employment.  We came up with a costing of €140 million that was based on numbers from three years ago.  At the time the Revenue Commissioners claimed that it would cost over €3 billion.  We held discussions in this committee room that eventually sweated down their figure of €700 million and, in subsequent discussions with our technical people, the figure was further reduced to €350 million. The Revenue Commissioners have not been able to move our cost of €140 million by one cent because it was rock solid.  The proposal would probably cost less now because there are fewer people in employment than three years ago.  The provision can be made for that sum.  It is most important that there is no reduction in child benefit and no second tier payment introduced as a quid pro quo for a cut in child benefit.  I am sure that the members will question what I am saying and whether I support the wealthy.  The Department of Finance and the troika asked me the same questions but I gave them the same answer that I shall give here.  Let us take two households that each have a total income of €100,000, two people live in each, the households are identical and pay the same tax.  If one household has two children then it receives over €3,000 from the State in child benefit.  It is a contribution for the two children but it is far below the cost involved.  Along comes a recession and Ireland is in trouble and needs to make savings in order to reduce its borrowing.  What does the Government mean when it proposes a cut in child benefit?  Which household will it take money from?  Obviously, the household that contains four persons.  To me that is not obvious.  It is not the right thing to do and I would leave them alone.  The State already does far too little for children by way of a contribution or supports.  Instead, if the Government needs to take money from the two households in order to make a contribution to Ireland reducing its borrowing then it should come from both houses through the income tax system or some other process rather than cut the child benefit.  The child benefit is the only payment of substance and my group deems it to be not nearly adequate.  It is the child's payment and should remain as it is.  If one examines the range of services for children the one thing that they all have in common is that they are underfunded.  There is insufficient funding across the system.  The last thing that we should do is to reduce the little funding that exists through that one payment.  There are much fairer ways to increase the tax take and reduce the borrowing than targeting children who are in no position to speak for themselves.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	272	I shall address Deputy McDonald's questions by starting with the issue she made about Dublin 1.  My organisation proposes a system that is based on market value rather than site value.  The measure would address the basic issue but also our ability to pay the deferral system and income is a component of that.  For example, if a person is unemployed then it is certain that he or she would defer a payment and, therefore, would not pay the tax.  With regard to whether one should expand the wealth tax from the property tax, there are a number things that can be done and that Ireland should be doing.  Although this is not strictly a wealth tax, we should support financial transaction taxes which ensure the movement of finance.Taxing financial assets in Ireland is quite difficult because of the open nature of the economy. We will look at this in greater detail in the future. One of the reason we do not have specific proposals on such taxes is that we do not have cost proposals on it. We do not have the numbers.  In terms of perfect equilibrium, it is not a perfect equilibrium and that is the reason it must be sustainable over the long term. When one has high levels of unemployment and incomes go down, the income component of a deferral system kicks in. In addition, house prices are falling. This tax will be less of a burden during times such as now. When good times return, if they ever do, then the level will increase. On the issue of the sustainability of the debt and whether we should be repaying it, the position taken by TASC, as we articulated last year, is that we should suspend the payment of the promissory note, pending a full renegotiation. We have made that clear. We believe Ireland should come up with its own technical paper in which all the options available to Ireland are examined. I have been asked what can be done for children and for the working poor. One begins by issuing a guarantee that there will be no cuts to services for children, no increase in taxation vis-à-vis the low paid, credit spans and so on. A broader commitment is also made, including a commitment to a quality audit so that as part of the budget process one looks at how the proposal will affect children over the entire year. We need to know that by looking at the evidence and having the debates in January and February and not in the middle of November when we all criticise the decisions that are not based on evidence and are made on the night before the budget. We need to take a multi-annual approach. One of the areas that Dr. Seán Healy raises is the idea of refundable tax credits, which we fully support. It is a very good way of supplementing the incomes of the working poor.  The money in the National Pensions Reserve Fund, which is approximately €4.5 billion, is uncommitted and could be committed to the domestic economy, not necessarily as a stimulus only but in targeted ways. Let me give examples. A significant cohort of the people who were formerly in the construction sector will never be able to get jobs in construction again. We had a boom. When the economy returns to normal, the levels of construction will be below the boom levels, therefore we must consider now what skills will be necessary for the economy of the future so that we do not create structural unemployment over the next decade and onwards. We need to focus specifically on the long-term unemployed and ensure they will get the education, retraining and upskilling necessary. We need to pour money into developing people. It is about human capital to a large extent.

It is important to see if there are cases of men in these circumstances.  Deputy Higgins raised the issue of property taxation and where payment of the amount calculated on the basis of taxation could be deferred.  He pointed out that the deferral would compete with negative equity.  Some people whose houses are in deep negative equity might never be in a position to pay off the deferred tax and it might never be retrieved.  One must think about that.  One may draw a comparison between the size of a loan and contamination of a site, when it comes to site value.  If one has contamination on a site, then the site value will be zero minus the cost of removal of the contamination.  If one looks at a mortgage that was too big in the first instance on that site, one has a financial contamination of the site and the site has no value.  How can one raise a tax on what would otherwise have been a mortgage free site?  We have the working poor and the new poor, the people who have too much debt and have temporarily lost their income.  There are people who were income rich for a number of years - architects would be a case in point - and they have no income now.  Engineers are in the same position.  We cannot jump to a conclusion on a reflex type of movement.   It was Mr. McDonnell who said that property is wealth.  It is not.  If one has borrowed to finance the property, it is not wealth, it is in fact financial destruction.

There is also a high cost in maintaining older children.  The children who are bigger physically eat more, need more clothes as they grow out of their clothes.  They need to go to the dentist and may need glasses.  Sometimes it is more expensive to meet their needs than it is to leave a child in the crèche.  When there are four children in a family-----

It is whether one has an ability to pay that matters.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	307	We are very clear.  There should be no waivers in respect of negative equity but there should be deferrals based entirely upon people's ability to pay.  If a person's ability to pay status changes, the deferral should be removed and if his or her ability to pay declines, then a deferral can kick in and there can be different levels of deferrals.  It should be a universal system across the board for everyone - there should be horizontal equity.  No groups, because of negative equity, should be able to exempt themselves from a property tax.  I reiterate that all taxes have negative impacts on employment, growth, incomes and also on equity but property taxes or taxes on a moveable property specifically are the least damaging across the board in the case of all of these issues.

They are right in asking do we want to have an American-style tax structure or a European-style structure and the services that go with it.  It seems we want Berlin services with Boston taxes but I do not believe that works.  The witnesses are right in what they said and the points about debt sustainability and the need for investment are critical.

On the pensions issue, the witnesses have hit on something important.  They are right that 80% of the benefit going to 20% of the people is problematic and we need to deal with that but why would they not go a little further?  Some €2.5 billion is given in tax reliefs and most of that goes to the top 20%.  Why would they not go considerably further and argue - I think Vincent Browne argued this point a while ago - for eliminating almost all of that relief and have universal provision of the non-contributory pension at double its current level?  We could afford that if most of those reliefs were eliminated and the private pension system was phased out.  Why would the witnesses not take that more radical route?  On the property tax issue, the witnesses should rethink what they have proposed because they are the good guys but I believe they have got it totally wrong on this issue.  The rate they propose of 0.35% would amount to a property tax of €700 a year on a house valued at €200,000.  People who are not rich live in many areas Dublin where properties have high values and under that scenario they would have to pay €1,000 in property tax alone.  It is of no consolation that the payment of that tax would be deferred until further down the road and people would be accumulating debts.  That is an awful scenario.  The witnesses should rethink this proposal.  Some 70% or 80% of people own their own homes.  There is nothing wrong with that and the family home should not be considered as a form of wealth in the same sense as commodities and financial investments.  The witnesses' position reminds me of the joke about anarchists: Why do anarchists drink green tea?  They drink it because proper tea is theft.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	312	I will deal with the pension issue.  On the Deputy's suggestion to double the level of the universal pension, phase out the private pension industry and pay for it by eliminating reliefs, if we could double the level of the pension and pay for it by eliminating reliefs and so on, the Deputy would find no bigger supporter of that proposal than us because we would be positive in support of phasing out any kind of support for the private pension industry.  There has been a great degree of rip-off in the private pension industry over decades and the major beneficiaries have been those in the pensions industry, not the people who drew pensions or were depending on them.  We made a proposal previously that the State might invest a serious amount in pensions and make the universal payment of pensions as strong as possible and, on the other side, provide capacity for people if they want to invest in their pensions, but the State would do it and all the charges that go to fund the private pensions industry would be eliminated.  The State would run this through the vehicle already in place for handling State money and so on.  There might be  a possibility of doing something in that context and that would need to be examined.  I would have no problem with it and would be more concerned about how much we could do, what would be the value of the remainder of the tax breaks and so on.  I would need to examine those to ascertain what would be possible.  I would have no problem with increasing it, funding it in the way the Deputy suggests and eliminating support for the private pensions industry because it has a negative impact.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	313	I do not believe it is the role of the State to be subsidising the private pensions industry.  Broadly the role of the State is to ensure that all people within the State have an income sufficient to their needs.  We should not be providing any tax breaks.  That would be our longer-term position.   However, a budget is a year-by-year process and one would do that on a phased basis over time and in 2013 we would do it by reducing tax relief to the standard rate, which principally would affect people on higher incomes.  On the property tax issue, 70% or 80% of people own their own homes but the one cohort of people who do not, by and large, are those at the bottom of the scale.  That is the one group we could be sure would be exempt.  It would have positive redistributive effects from that point of view.

It is a serious question.  Mr. McDonnell said certain groups would be excluded but not all council houses.  He might clarify that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	317	We are advocating a universalist position whereby a charge would be imposed on all residential properties unless they are used for very specific purposes such as housing the homeless.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	319	It would have to be for specific purposes such as housing the homeless and similar very limited purposes.  I reiterate that if an individual is on a low income or experiencing difficulty in making repayments, a deferral would kick in until transfer of the property.  Essentially, that would deal with short-term issues about creating additional difficulties for people because it is only people who do not find themselves in large difficulties who would be liable to this tax in the short term.  Given the massive size of the deficit, somebody has to pay and it is our position that this is the best and fairest way to do it.  It would be done in a way that effectively protects the most vulnerable in society and those who do not have the ability to pay.  It would also be efficient and sustainable over the long term and, economically, that makes sense as well.

As I have told other witnesses that have appeared before the committee today, the purpose of this meeting is not to go into a detailed presentation of pre-budget submissions or for members to make statements.  It is an opportunity to drill down to specific proposals contained in a submission, or to get a better insight into the thinking or rationale underpinning it.  In some cases, we will try to ascertain if modelling has been done by individual organisations to see from where the information has been extrapolated.  I thank the various witnesses for attending the joint committee.  They are Mr. Fergal O'Brien, chief economist, IBEC; Mr. Paul Sweeney, ICTU; Mr. Tom Geraghty, PSEU; and Mr. Roland O'Connell, president, Society of Chartered Surveyors. I will get the ball rolling by putting a number of questions to IBEC and ICTU.  IBEC's pre-budget submission suggests a grant or tax credit package to incentivise home improvement works during a three-year window of opportunity.  Similar work has been done in Sweden and certain works are under consideration in Germany also.  Does IBEC feel this would be effective if a property tax was simultaneously introduced, as home values would be factored in with this?  IBEC's submission specifically states that it supports the private property tax.  Can Mr. O'Brien clarify if that is a valuation-based property tax or is it a site valuation approach?  ICTU's proposal suggests a €3 billion three-year stimulus package.  What industries does Mr. Sweeney think would be specifically targeted by this stimulus and what new jobs would be created if such a programme were put in place?  Section 5.7 of the ICTU proposal notes the support of congress for automatic enrolment in pensions.  This ties into what Dr. Healy was saying earlier.  Would this be a universal pension or something that citizens could opt in or out of?  I would welcome greater detail on that proposal.  The ICTU submission also refers to a property tax.  I would be grateful if Mr. Sweeney could expand further on this position.  Is he proposing a banding of property taxes from €100,000 to €150,000 and from €150,000 to €200,000?  Is that the type of model he is proposing?  I invite the IBEC representative, Mr. Fergal O'Brien to begin.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	324	I thank the Chairman and other committee members for this invitation to attend the joint committee.  As regards our home improvements tax credit-grant proposal, we have examined a couple of models internationally.  We have found this type of approach to be effective in stimulating activity in the domestic economy.  This is what we regard as being probably the most significant challenge we face currently, which is to see some sort of normalisation of activity in the domestic economy.  We have focused on the home improvement sector for a couple of reasons.  One is because it is so labour intensive.  It has a relatively low import content.  We also believe we still have significant savings and wealth in this economy so there is a capacity for households to unlock the activity, given sufficient and adequate incentive.  Another issue of which we are particularly conscious - not just in home improvements but also across many sectors of the economy - is the growth in the black economy.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	325	There will be a compliance element to this as well.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	326	Absolutely.  The business community is concerned about the growth in the black economy that we have seen in recent times.  We are quite conscious that, as a result of so many people losing their jobs in the construction sector, it has added to home improvement activity in the black economy.  Our proposal is for the Government to fund an element of home improvement costs.  We suggest up to a maximum of €3,000 in a €20,000 spend.  We are suggesting also that this would be Revenue positive because, first, it would incentivise additional activity and, second, it would move activity from the informal economy into the formal one.  The tax compliance requirements would mean that one would only have fully registered contractors.  In addition, one would have the personal public service numbers of employees working on the contract.  We would have, therefore, fully tax compliant activity.  By making all the activity tax compliant, it would fund the cost of any grant or credit.  One of the benefits of waiting this long into our crisis to start looking at such proposals is that we can see what has happened elsewhere, particularly in the crisis response measures in Canada.

If one takes a model of a €20,000 extension or insulation programme with a 25% tax incentive going to the builder, however, what would the return be to the Exchequer?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	328	We are suggesting that it would go to the home owner.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	329	How would it work?  Talk me through it, for example, in the case of a €20,000 insulation programme.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	330	It is broader than the energy side.  The essence of the proposal is that there is an incentive for the home owner to carry out these works within the window of opportunity and get some sort of subvention from the State.  It pays for itself by creating new activity and bringing activity from the informal economy into the formal one.  As I said, the merit of looking at something like that now is that we can see how these schemes have worked in the recession internationally.  The cost benefits are there and do stack up.  This would really stack up, particularly at the moment in the Irish economy given the increase we have seen in activity in the informal economy.  I do not think there are any implications for property tax.  We think it would be a significant, positive net contribution back to the Exchequer and would create in the region of 6,000 to 10,000 jobs over a three-year period.  On property tax, our submission has focused particularly on where we would be players rather than just commentators.  We have particular concerns on how employers would be affected.  To answer the Chairman's specific query as to whether we have opted for a site valuation or the market value approach, we favour the latter purely for its simplicity, deliverability and administrative reasons.  In an ideal world, the economist in me would go for a site valuation approach, but we do not think that is practical in the short term.  It is something to which we would not be opposed in the long term.  For pure ease of administration in the short term, however, we favour a market-based valuation approach.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	331	On the €3 billion stimulus, congress feels that the Government has got its macroeconomic policy wrong.The evidence is in the day-to-day living, in that people know there are very few green shoots. I note the Minister for Finance appeared before the joint committee this morning and more or less stated there is very little growth. While he is hoping for some uptake on exports, no economy is going to survive on exports. It is a zero-sum game throughout Europe with little growth. Essentially, the key point I wish to make about our submission is we would reverse what the Government is doing, which is very little by way of tax rises. Moreover, it is hammering the poor as 78% of all the tax rises thus far have been on lower-paid working people. Put simply, it ain't working and while they can blame Europe, people in their hearts and souls must know it really is not working and people are going round with their fingers crossed. We have proposed that the taxes should be increased substantially, particularly on high-paid people who are not spending their money. The second thing is the stimulus programme of €3 billion per year, about which the Chairman has asked a question. We published a document in July, which we have costed and for which we ran a model. We have a body attached to congress called the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, which now has an economic model that is as good as those of the ESRI or the Central Bank and it is doing work in this regard. The Chairman also asked where we would invest and we would invest in five broad areas. The first is broadband, which is a serious area. Another is retrofitting and energy efficiency, about which we are at one to a degree with IBEC because our housing stock is poorly insulated and one would get a major gain from this. I do not know whether grants should be given but that definitely is worth thinking about. Another area is public transport, as our public transport system is pretty poor. We have made suggestions on finishing some of the major roads that are nearly ready to be finished, as well as on light rail, buses and so on. We advocated completion of the Luas BDX line, which has got the go-ahead and I believe that is great news for Dublin's citizens. Only Irish people - certain politicians - could design two tramlines that do not meet. The fourth and fifth areas are water and waste treatment and health and education and we advocated certain projects with regard to the latter, such as the children's hospital and the Grangegorman campus. The Grangegorman project is very labour intensive. It is in the inner city and is a very good project in which to invest and we are delighted the Government is going ahead with it. These are the essential points. The Chairman asked about automatic enrolment in pensions. It would be mandatory and consequently, there would be no opt-out. Young people really never think of their pensions and it is only when one hits 50 that one starts thinking about them. An interesting point in this regard concerns people like me, who worked in England for some years. I worked there for six or seven years before going to college, but my brother, who was there, tells me I am going to get a pension from Britain for those years, which is good news. It might only be a fiver a week but it is something one never thinks of when one is young. We can revert to pensions but on the property tax, we are fairly broad in that regard. To be straight with the joint committee it is because congress represents 39 unions in the Republic and getting them together on this was a difficult task. We know what is going to happen-----

I understand a banded system.  The United Kingdom, operates such a system, which I consider to be highly flawed because the band begins at £800 and ends at £1,200.  Consequently, it means that if one is Del Boy Trotter living out in Nelson Mandela House, one is paying £800 while if one is Queen Elizabeth, living in Buckingham Palace, one pays £1,200.  The bands are too limited, too narrow and all the rest of it.  A banded system that began at €100,000 and which went up indefinitely could be something to be looked at.  ICTU's submission talks about a banded proposal and I would like to hear more about that.  Does it envisage an indefinite band or is it a band that is very confined?

The witnesses were invited before the joint committee to be given a hearing on their prebudget submissions.  I believe this is the first time a joint committee has ever done so.  Consequently, I invite Mr. Sweeney to explain to me in detail how ICTU would implement and operate its property tax model.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	353	I would have a threshold below which people do not pay.  People on low incomes also would receive exemptions or one could have top-slicing relief.  Thereafter, it would be progressive, based on the property valuation.  For example, one Irish person, who has a house with ten security guards that is as big as the Vatican and who does not live here would pay a huge property tax.

The Government has been emphatic and clear as far back as October 2009, when the troika came to town, that property tax was on the way.  It does not matter what party is in government in the morning and I believe this to be the only country in the world that has socialists who do not favour wealth tax through properties but that is a separate point.  The fact of the matter is that property tax will be introduced.  That is not for discussion.  However, the congress brought forward a proposal this afternoon favouring a banded approach.  The witnesses should explain to me how the banded approach will work.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	359	With respect, I think the Chair is wrong  I have read the submission and such a proposal is not in it.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	363	I do not see that.  I hesitate, because we have had so many arguments that it is hard to know what position we finally reached.  Consequently, I must read it carefully but I do not see it there.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	364	It certainly was not intended to say so explicitly.  All our submission says is we are operating on the assumption that the Government is introducing a property tax, as the Chairman says, and that it will have a certain yield.  However, if such a property tax is to be put in place, it should meet certain requirements.  Obviously, they include fairness, equity and so on.  That is the full extent to which we had anything to say.

I will start with Mr. Fergal O'Brien, who I gather from his submission is extremely enthusiastic about a property tax.  Perhaps he will talk to members a little about that.  I also wish to ask him about the issue of lending to business.There is, obviously, still a huge difficulty in accessing credit. I was interested to read in the document of IBEC's endorsement of a State-backed enterprise or investment bank. I note the distance we have all travelled since the crisis hit, but this does not strike me as standard IBEC fare.

Mr. O'Brien says a little about it in his submission but I would like to know a little more.  What does he think the scope of that initiative might be?  I welcome the thrust of the ICTU submission.  It is not even a mile away from the thinking of Sinn Féin.  It is unfair to talk about spending €9 billion in total in investment in jobs and strategy.  It is investment and not spending, and is to be welcomed.  It also is notable there seems to be almost complete consensus on the good sense of retrofitting and the necessity of doing it, both for job generation and as an environmental policy.  There is something in that.  Can Mr. Sweeney and Mr. Geraghty talk about two things that interest me?  The first is the proposal to levy a wealth tax at 1% on wealth above €2 million.  I am also interested in the ICTU position on universal payments, such as child benefit, state pensions and ancillary payments to older citizens, such as free travel.  Could members have a view on that?  Could Mr. O'Connell give a view on the balance that needs to be struck between tax raising measures and cutbacks? 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	368	Perhaps I could first comment on the residential property tax.  In the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, we think the residential property tax is a good idea, not because we welcome new taxes but because we feel it is better than the current stamp duty system.  When the property market is booming the economy, in general, is booming and there is considerable revenue from stamp duty.  When the economy is not booming the property market is not booming either and stamp duty income drops off.  The residential property tax should be used to fund local authorities.  Having an annual residential property tax, as opposed to a one-off transaction tax, means local authorities can plan ahead and estimate what their income is going to be.  We have recommended that the property tax be banded.  We have not, however, recommended that the bands be limited when the value of a property gets up to a certain level.  I have just come from a presentation by a member of the UK valuation office, who said the UK top limit is £3,000.  There was also a speaker from the Northern Ireland office, where they have what probably is a better organised and more advanced system.  Their band also cuts off at a certain level.  The Northern Ireland bands run from A to I, alphabetically, and the UK bands from A to H.  That is a policy decision, however, and not something the society would have a view on.  We would echo comments here that the property tax should be straightforward and unambiguous.  It should be transparent and clear.  The collection should be low-cost and done at a convenient time of the year, that is, not when several other costs are being charged.  Most important, it should be easily understood by the public and there should be a level of transparency about how the money is being spent.  We believe it should be used to fund local authorities but there should be an onus on the local authorities to explain to taxpayers where their money has gone and how it is being spent.  As for the method and whether the tax should be based on valuation, location, rent or size, that again is a policy decision because all these methods have pros and cons.  We have done considerable investigation on this, internationally, and have come to the sad conclusion that there is no perfect way of levying this tax.  Within our own society, there is considerable disagreement about which is the best way of doing it and consequently, we have not expressed an opinion as to which is the best way.  Much of it comes down to what the policymakers are trying to achieve.  For instance, the easiest method for the homeowner to self-assess, which also is the easiest method to be verified by the local councils or whatever the body will be, is purely a size-based one because anyone can measure the size of his or her own house.  Any local authority will have records in its planning office as to what is the size of the house.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	374	Perhaps we should be referring to square metreage.  While that system would be the easiest to self-assess, it has all sorts of other drawbacks.  The site value reference has many advantages on some points but one major disadvantage is that for instance, in the case of an apartment block, the site value for an individual apartment would be negative at present.  It is very hard to assess a tax on a negative value.  The society understands there are pros and cons in respect of all the methods.  It is a matter for the policymakers to decide what is their priority and then to choose a correct method to reflect that priority.  If the newspapers are to be believed, it appears as though we are heading towards a valuation based tax and if that be the case, so be it.

In the society's discussions, did it consider issues such as mortgage distress or negative equity?  I hear the points being made by Mr. O'Connell and the society clearly has thought out the various models in a thorough manner.  However, in real terms and in real time, it is not a theoretical proposition and those very people who have paid the transaction tax will be hit again with yet another charge.  Did this issue feature in the society's thinking?

The society is entitled to do so, please do not get me wrong, but I am uncertain whether I accept the society may take a policy view on one element but shy away from the other.  If the society is on board for this, I would anticipate that, as a professional group, it would have thought through the issue in its totality.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	380	I thank the Deputy for that observation.  We did think it through and if I am straying into the grounds of policy, I apologise for it but our view is there will have to be exceptions for a whole series of groups.  Clearly, those who simply cannot afford to pay it must be an exception or some alternative route must be found for them.  How such an alternative route is arrived at is a matter for those who are assessing the tax, rather then for us as property and construction professionals.  Consequently, we believe there should be exceptions.  It extends to instances such as those to which Deputy Boyd Barrett referred whereby people who have very low incomes may be living in relatively expensive houses and cannot afford to pay such taxes.All of those things will have to be taken into account when levying the tax. We have not been cheeky enough to say this is how one should do it in the same way we have not presumed to say this is the right method to assess it because it depends on what the policymakers are trying to achieve. The one big issue we could distinguish within that is that it is a better system for funding local authorities to have an annual tax, even though it is not an ideal time to introduce it and there are huge difficulties with it at the moment. However, an annual tax of that nature is a better and fairer solution than transactional tax. That is as far as we went on that subject.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	381	In case Mr. O'Connell is wondering why I put the question to him on the balance between tax and cuts it is precisely because of the profession he is in.  The allied professionals - architects were mentioned - have taken an absolute pasting because construction went off a cliff and because of the contraction in the domestic economy.  I asked that question not to try to get Mr. O'Connell to stray into broader policy but I am curious to know, in light of discussions among a professional group such as his own, the prevailing view among his peers in terms of getting it right, fixing the deficit and getting ourselves back on some kind of sustainable footing.  Is it his view that the Government is getting it right?  I do not want to put words in Mr. O'Connell's mouth but does he see what-----
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	382	I do but that is a much broader question.  We have covered a lot of that in our submission.  In broad terms, the two big issues that face us in the construction business and in the property business are confidence and finance.  Those are the two big issues which stop activity in the marketplace.  In our submission, we dealt with those under a number of different headings.  For instance, on the residential mortgage side of things, we feel there is some confidence coming back into the market but it is very fragile and it is very localised.  That is very important from a governmental point of view, in particular in the case of new apartments and houses which were built but never sold.  There is a large amount of VAT tied up there and if any of those are sold, the VAT revenue comes back into the central Exchequer, so it is very important to see some activity there.  From speaking to people involved in residential sales, the big issue we found was that approximately 40% of all transactions in the greater Dublin area this year were cash buyers, including people who sold abroad and are moving back and so on.  That is an indictment of the fact that despite the banks being recapitalised by the State, they are not lending.  Do not get me wrong.  We acknowledged, and did not like, the fact mortgages were too easy to get but it is now the other extreme.  There are very viable mortgagees who should be getting loans but who cannot get them at the moment and, therefore, cannot buy a house and generate revenue for Exchequer.    We feel very strongly that despite what the banks are saying, they are not lending at the rate they should be.  Having approved people for mortgages, they are then creating hurdles and difficulties when people go to draw down the finance.  We have asked that it is looked at by the Department of Finance.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	383	Deputy McDonald asked about the wealth tax.  We have suggested a 1% on wealth over €2 million, including one's personal home when it is worth over €1 million.  If it is worth €1.1 million, one only pays on €100,000.  There are wealth taxes in other countries and we had one here before.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	387	To a limit.  One cannot subsidise some of the mad borrowers by not taxing them.  As I said before, there is no point in the likes of us doing the detail on this because the policymakers, or the implementers, will do what they are going to do.  We have a section on universal payments.  There is an intellectual argument against them because of the cost, in particular in tough times.  However, the big thing in favour of universal payment is that they bind society together and get the middle class committed to the social welfare system.  That works very well in Europe, so we have set out a number of universal payments we think should be retained, including the travel pass and dental and optical benefits, although one pays for dental and optical benefits in one's PRSI.  
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	388	I thank Deputy McDonald for her questions.  On the property tax issue, from an IBEC perspective, we have 7,500 member companies, the vast majority of which are in the domestic economy.  No matter what we do on the taxation side, it will impact on their businesses in the domestic economy.  The priority for us in the taxation proposals in our budget is to limit that damage on growth and jobs.  It is nothing the Deputy will not have heard already today.  From an employer's perspective, we have a particular insight into the Government's proposal as to how the property tax will be collected.  We have now heard from the Minister for Finance that the property tax will be collected through Revenue and through adjustments to personal income tax credits.  In some cases, although not in all, it will be deducted by employers in monthly payroll systems.  That is something about which we have quite a concern in terms of employers administering those payroll systems.  Our concern is that if we go down this route of administering the property tax through the income tax credit and the personal tax credit system, it will have two consequences for employers and business.  It will put wage pressure back into the workplace.  We know that from recent experience where we have had income tax increases.  When people have less money in their pay packet, there is a kick back to the employer.  We are going through a phase when we are trying to reduce costs and be more competitive and I think that will be unhelpful.    As Mr. Paul Sweeney said, practically every economist thinks that property tax is a good idea by nature of it being a tax on property and less damaging to growth.  If we administer this through the income tax credit system, it could de facto become a tax on work and a tax which only workers will be pay, or, at the very least, it could be perceived that way.  That would be damaging.  It could act as another reason not to take up a job.  If one looks into the behavioural economics of this issue, how one frames it-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	394	If there were payroll taxes outstanding to the State, then that is a possibility but again I think it would probably be at the margins.  A more substantive issue is that if it becomes perceived as a tax on work, it acts as a disincentive for people to take up employment and one is undoing the rationale for having a property tax in the first place.  If we are going to have a property tax, it must be a real one and not a de facto tax on work.  It must not become perceived as a tax on work and a disincentive to take up a job.  That is much of the feedback we have got from our members in recent times.    However, I think there are ways around that and again it all depends on how one frames this.  The default option should not be for this to be delivered straightaway through the income tax credit system.That should almost be the collection of last resort. We know there has been an issue around payment and compliance with the property charges that have already been introduced. Therefore, I can understand the Government's rationale for opting and wanting to collect the tax in this way but it should not be the first port of call, it should be the last resort in terms of a collection mechanism for the tax. People should be provided with the other options first and failure to pay in some cases could resort to adjustments to their personal tax credits system.  On the issue of access to credit for SMEs, there is no question but that this is still the single biggest issue for SME members. A number of things could be done in the budget to address the difficulty. On the specific issue of the State-backed investment bank, this works well internationally in cases where banking systems are not in turmoil or in a crisis such as in Germany and Canada. The crucial thing is that it is part of a range of options in terms of SME finance. One of the lessons that has to be learned from the crisis is that Ireland was the most reliant economy on bank lending for SMEs than anywhere else in Europe. That will change over time and was a consequence of the easy access to credit. The State has a role to play, be it perhaps through funds at our disposal through the National Pensions Reserve Fund and in time through a State-backed investment bank. Some of the other suggestions in our submission would be around our employment investment and incentive scheme, a follow-on from the business expansion scheme, which is an excellent opportunity to get funding into SMEs. That scheme is not working for various reasons. It is obviously a tough investment climate but the set-up of that scheme is not working. Traditionally the business expansion scheme worked because it was able to draw on a relatively small pool of high net worth individuals who were happy to invest in businesses. For various reasons, wealth destruction and changes to the tax system-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	396	The employment investment incentive scheme could be a very important source of SME funding if it was altered in terms of risk profile, branded and promoted to a wider group of investors.  There are many people who would want to invest in real Irish businesses if the tax system facilitated it.  We are missing an opportunity by not doing that.  I will make one final comment if the Chair will allow me.  On the important issue of access to credit for SMEs, in Ireland there is no incentive for anyone selling a business at the moment to reinvest the proceeds of that sale into another Irish start up or growth business, unlike in the UK where there is roll-over relief whereby if a person selling a business reinvests the proceeds he or she receives an offset against capital gains tax.  There are many people selling good businesses but there is no incentive for them in the tax system to reinvest the proceeds in this country.  There should be such a system.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	398	In regard to the complexities for introducing the property tax and water charges, in the last budget the Government introduced a disgraceful and inequitable tax called SARP, the Special Assignee Relief Programme, for foreign executives, who at the end of the year get a cheque for one third of the tax they have paid sent to them if they earn between €75,000 and €0.5 million, in addition to school fees up to €5,000.  That is a disgraceful tax and should be abolished in the budget.  It saves only €5 million but it undermines horizontal equity in the tax system which is a fundamental principle in any tax system.  We represent 600,000 taxpayers and are annoyed at that tax.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	400	I was going to expand on the answer Mr. Sweeney gave to Deputy McDonald's question about universal benefits.  As he said, on the face it, it may appear attractive to cut the universal benefits in the circumstances but there is another issue related to the much broader problem.  We have a serious difficulty with the income tax system, in that a disproportionate amount is paid by those in the PAYE sector, therefore, cutting universal benefits and means testing them will disproportionately affect those in the PAYE sector because they cannot hide their income, whereas the self-employed are in a position to do so.  I do not have the exact figure off the top of my head but I think in excess of 80% of all income tax is paid for by those in the PAYE sector.  Nobody would seriously suggest that anything like that proportion of total income in the country is earned by those in that sector.  Clearly, they are overpaying and everybody else is underpaying.

I said in the previous section that the mortgage element that attaches by way of charge to the properties that are going to be valued is like a financial rather than a physical contamination.  Mr. Roland O'Connell would be aware that a physical contamination on a site or a property immediately hits the value.  It is just a starting point in theory and in fairness one would say that where there is a mortgage on a property it is actually a charge on the property and, therefore, it reduces its value for the purpose of taxation.  That is a matter of physical and financial fact and has been missed in the discussion.  Another issue I wish to raise because all the delegates represent various bodies is the corporation tax rate - the sacred cow - which stands at 12.5%.  From my discussions which have been pointed and searching with people at the top levels of companies from abroad who have invested and are thinking of coming to Ireland, a 2.5% uplift from 12.5% to 15% in the headline rate, because the PWCs and KPMGs of this world do all sorts of planning-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	411	When the rate was reduced in 1995 by the then rainbow Government, to kick in at 12.5% in 2001, I was on the Forfás committee that recommended the 12.5% rate and, of course, I dissented as I thought the rate was too low.  Congress said it wanted to keep the rate at 20% but it went to 12.5%.  Has it served Ireland well?  It certainly has.  Is it too low?  There are a couple of points on it.  Some 62% of companies do not pay corporation tax because they are proprietary directors and they ensure they do not and those that do, pay an effective rate of between 4% and 5%.  What we have proposed for this budget, which is a little different from what we said previously, when we were talking about the headlight rate referred to by Deputy Mathews, and if everyone in the main parties is so obsessed with the rate, is that essentially the exemptions be curbed and if we raise 2% more in the effective rate, one could raise €2 billion.  The rate is very unpopular.  I was in Berlin last week and got hammered over it.  We are looking for a handout in grants and will not even join the financial transaction tax while at the same time we are bleeding them dry with Dutch and Irish sandwiches or whatever they are called.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	414	I will make a final point, on which we have done a great deal of work.  Many policy makers have been blind to this issue.  I can understand the reason the Government takes a firm line because investors like certainty, which is understandable.  We know that as we head towards fiscal union there will be change.  It is better to organise not to have absolute harmonisation of rates but for co-ordination within bands.  We talk about the consolidated rate.  I agree with those who say that by using the consolidated basis, the figures will be based on the amount one sells in each country, then as a small country, we will lose out.  We need to negotiate on the issue rather than let it be imposed on us.  That is my worry in the long run.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	415	I believe the area of corporation tax is a bit like pricing in any market situation.  We have a transparent competitive corporation tax rate which means that relatively, we get more of our tax revenue from the corporate sector than most other economies in Europe with much higher rates.  If we increase the price, that is the rate, I do not agree that we will get more revenue.  We will probably get less revenue or the same revenue, applying the higher rate.  The main reason would be due to the lack of certainty for business as a result of that change.  It would result in behavioural impacts.  If one looks at the outcome for Ireland and compares it with that of other countries in Europe, we get a very high share of our total tax revenue from the corporate sector by having a simple, transparent, consistent and certain rate.  It would be flawed economic policy to change that.

Will IBEC respond to me on the reasons the economy has collapsed?  What is the problem?  What has happened to our economy that there is no investment?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	424	I will answer that question.  The single biggest reason the domestic economy, because the export economy is performing well, is so weak at present is not because of the impact of austerity but because of the impact of credit flows in the economy.  If one looks at the data from the Central Bank and compares the net lending-borrowing of households in 2012 to the situation in 2007, we have had a swing in the region of €12 billion to €16 billion.  I think that is a multiple of the impact of austerity.  It is the distorted relationship in credit between our households and the banks that is the biggest single reason for the collapse in economic activity.  Much of it is related to what happened to the construction sector.  Some one in two people who are out of work previously worked in the construction sector.  Of course the fiscal adjustment and the austerity is impacting on growth.  If we had normal credit conditions, both in terms of demand and supply, there are supply issues in the banks but there are also demand issues in households.  At present our households have a particularly high savings ratio.  If that savings ratio, as we heard from the IMF was to come down by 4 percentage points it would add 1% to our GDP numbers.  That is the single biggest reason that the domestic economy is so weak rather than the fiscal adjustment.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	430	It is.  The single biggest reason for the multiple of the austerity factor is the shift in credit flow patterns that has impacted on the domestic economy.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	436	Business is investing.  Business investment is increasing and has been for the past year and a half.  It is not as much as we would like and the main reason it is investing is that the export economy is performing strongly.  We will have a record level of exports this year.  We have very little spare capacity in the export sector.  We are seeing our export companies investing more than have been in previous years.  The domestic economy remains particularly weak.  The vast majority of our 7,5000 members are operating in the domestic economy.  Our suggestions here are around the pensions issue, where we are advocating for an early release of the additional voluntary contribution, AVC, component of our pensions.  The suggestions around the home renovations sector is to some degree trying to normalise a credit flow in an economy that is suffering because of the changes in the past couple of years.

I will pass over because we have no time for a discussion on it but I fundamentally disagree with the points made by Mr. O'Brien.  I will address the question on the property tax to each of the witnesses.  Is there not a recognition on the part of all of the delegates that they accept this proposal?  I find it surprising that the unions would accept it rather than actively campaigning against it.  Significant numbers of union members will not be able to pay it.  I do not understand the reason.  The wealth tax has been mentioned, with which I agree.  There is a bit of a slippage between property and wealth tax.  Surely we on the left should be advocating for a wealth tax, which would include property over a certain value, but not the family home, and opt for a higher wealth tax and higher income taxes on people at the top level?  Why is the union making a concession on a tax that will be imposed on union members and will impose a very significant extra financial burden on them and is without question going to have a further dampening effect on the domestic economy, which IBEC should be concerned about?  If the figures for the property tax we are talking about are implemented - ranging from €400, €500, €600 and €700 a year on ordinary low and middle income households - it will have a crushing effect on demand in the economy

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	439	May I respond to the point about the ICTU position in respect of a property tax?  It is not dissimilar to what I have already said, which is that there are divided opinions among trade unions about the issue of a property tax.  There are those who would argue - I am sure this is the view that Deputy Boyd Barrett would have sympathy with given the income tax system is so disproportionately skewed against people in the PAYE sector - that imposing a property tax in addition to that has a disproportionate impact on workers.  Equally, others in the trade unions will argue the opposing point. It is difficult to see how one could have an equitable tax system with a broad base of taxes without having a property tax. Rather than beating ourselves up about whether we are for or against the notion of a property tax, we accept it as a given because the Government has decided that there will be a property tax. We confined our submission to focusing on the protections we would like to see included if a property tax is to be introduced.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	443	I totally disagree with Mr. Fergal O'Brien on the cause of the crisis.  The crisis in Ireland was caused by the banks behaving like drunken sailors and lending money willy-nilly to anyone and everyone.  There was failure on the part of the public sector in the sense that the regulator, imbued with the ideology that markets work without intervention, went along with it and that is the reason this economy collapsed.   The banks have moved from crazy lending to the other extreme, and on this I agree with Mr. Fergal O'Brien, of becoming totally risk averse.  Austerity has caused a problem on the domestic side.  One cannot simply take €25 billion out of an economy, which is the amount that will have been taken out of this economy by the end of next month, which is approximately 16% of GNP.  It is a staggering retrenchment and while it has been necessary to a degree we disagree on the amount of it.

I have a few questions from my brief reading of the submissions.  Reference was made to labour activation measures but how would congress, IBEC and the SCSI envisage they would work in practice?  The biggest single issue we face is unemployment.  We did not discuss that at length but I am sure everyone would agree it is the biggest single issue.  If people come off unemployment benefits that benefits them and the State.  The witnesses might deal with that issue.  I wish to take up Mr. O'Brien's point, which was interesting.  Access to credit is a major issue for the SME sector.  Representatives of Allied Irish Bank and the Bank of Ireland appeared before the committee and we seemed to get different signals from them on this issue.  Bank of Ireland said that the amount of €3.5 billion will all be for new lending and AIB said only €600 million of the €3.5 billion will be for new lending.  There is a reluctance on the part of the banks to engage in calculated risk-based entrepreneurial lending.  Mr. O'Brien might give us a flavour of the different business models in place elsewhere.  I was interested in his point regarding the business expansion scheme.  How does he envisage that could work in practice?  I am centring both questions around employment.  Rather than a headline mention of these measures, I would like to hear how the witnesses would in practical terms link labour activation measures to the provision of credit for SMEs and to comment on the types of funding models that could be used and on access to credit.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	446	I thank the Deputy O'Donnell for his questions.  On the labour market activation measures, there are a few points to be noted on the unemployment issue and I will return to aspects of demand and the domestic economy, which is our single biggest challenge.  Specifically on the activation measures, we did some recent research with our members to ascertain what is working and what is not working.  The JobBridge programme is working well  and business is very supportive of it.  We are seeing a good deal of transition from those internships into sustainable employment and that should continue to be supported.  We have found there is a very weak level of awareness among employers of a range of other schemes such as the employer PRSI exemption scheme and the Revenue assist initiative.  Our recommendation would be to streamline those programmes and research suggests that better promoted, better branded cash equivalent payment schemes rather than a tax foregone model would work better.    Regarding other issues around labour market activation, we still have incredible skill shortages in the economy.  Our technology sector has 7,000 to 8,000 unfilled vacancies.  We have some good programmes that are working, in particular the Springboard programme, which again is a good exemplar of something that is very close to the workplace, it is reacting to real demand for real jobs and it is giving people who used to work in the construction sector good jobs in the medical devices and technology sectors.  In general, as a principle, those types of programmes that are close to the workplace and that will be able to respond to real opportunities and vacancies in sectors are the way to proceed because we have an incredible churn currently in the workplace.  We are losing jobs but a good many jobs are being created, and there are many unfilled jobs.  On the issue of credit for SMEs, there is no question it is still a major issue for our members but it depends on the sector of the economy in which one finds oneself.  Certain sectors of the economy have become very attractive.  If someone is involved in the food and drink sector they probably do not have much difficulty in getting access to credit and there are many institutions willing to do business with them.  If someone is in a less attractive sector they are in a much more difficult position.  Are there problems in terms of credit supply?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	448	That is absolutely the case.  There is a demand issue also but there are many credit supply problems, which are very much sector based.  That is a particular issue.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	450	As to what can be done about it, in terms of the follow-on to the business expansion scheme, my specific proposals in the submission are that we need to reduce the risk individual investors will take on.  We have examined the State aid rules because when one goes into these types of schemes they are very much tied up with the EU State aid rules.  We have look at experiences in the Netherlands and Austria, in particular, where government has guaranteed some of the risk for the individual investors and we seem to have got a good behavioural response from that.  We think that could make quite an impact.  As I said previously, the business expansion scheme worked because a small group of investors saw the advertisement in The Sunday Business Post and went to their advisers and put money into it.  It worked and sustained many good businesses  We need to cast the net much wider, we also need proper promotion and branding of the scheme and some technical changes need to be made to it, but I would hate to see us give up on it because it could make a real different in terms of funding for SMEs.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	452	On the jobs front, the Deputy will be glad to hear that on the property side of our business, jobs seemed to have stabilised and this year there was an under-supply of new graduates.  There were more jobs than there were graduates and one of the reasons for that is employment fell sharply and people went into different business, emigrated or whatever, but now things have stabilised.  We are getting this message across to career guidance teachers and parents to encourage them to get their children to consider the property sector as a job for the future because they tend to spend three or four years in college.  While the construction industry has not stabilised yet, it is getting to that point.  We have had a huge loss of skills but we need to start getting people back into that sector in order that we will have people with skills in the future.  We are quite optimistic about the future of the country as a whole.  The Deputy asked about measures to create employment.  We believe that currently there is outstanding value in the construction sector but we do not believe the State is necessarily approaching this from the right direction.  One of the reasons is that the public tendering process seems to concentrate solely on the lowest tender and in recent years people have been awarded contracts for which they tendered below cost and when their businesses have then collapsed that has created a mess.  We need to examine the public procurement process, how we can do that more efficiently and we need to speed up the process.  What would help in that respect is if the Government across all State sectors had a chief construction adviser who co-ordinated all of those elements.  Mr. John Moran, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance suggested we examine creating a centre of excellence in Dublin for both property and design skills - construction skills  - because we have built up a huge level of talent that we can export.  Many of these people are going abroad to work and we need to support that export of skills where they can be based in Ireland and do work abroad.  There are sectors in which the Government can help with that and we have covered that in our submission.In recent months, we have seen the benefit of investment in strategic construction projects. By that I mean things like the National Convention Centre where a couple of weeks ago the International Bar Conference was held. They brought 5,000 lawyers from around the world who used hotels, restaurants and taxis, all of which generated money for the local economy. The American football match in the Lansdowne Road stadium had the same effect. When there is such good value in the construction sector we should take advantage of that, be it investing in broadband, transport or other long-term infrastructural skills. How do we do that because we have no money? We could get private pension funds to invest in this sector as well as getting money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and the European Investment Bank. One of the issues in getting money from those entities is that private pension funds are worried about the construction risk of investing in something at the nascent stage before it is built. That is a hurdle we have to overcome. How do we bridge that risk gap for them? If we can do that we can then see construction which will create jobs and have a long-term beneficial effect for the State.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	453	I wish to echo something Mr. O'Connell said about public procurements and the lowest tender.  A section in our report this year was inserted towards the end.  A group of unions in construction are perturbed with some of the practices that basically amount to moneys going out of the country.  Outsiders are coming in bidding very low and then ignoring all labour standards and not paying tax.  Frankly, they are fly-by-night cowboys.  We really need people who are giving tenders in Ireland to think more creatively about it because it is a serious problem.  On labour market activation, I agree with Mr. O'Brien that the key problem is lack of demand.  Looking at the supply side on activation, a lot more could be done.   We were nervous about JobBridge but it seems to be working well and we are reasonably happy with that.  It is one of those things that has been very well implemented.  We hope that we get the real jobs for people at the end of it.  One of the points in our submission is that activation requires an intense level of quality service from State agencies.  The OECD has been rightly critical of the way we have dealt with labour market activation in the past.  We need to do a lot more.   We also say in the submission that there should be many more apprenticeship systems.  They seem to be dying out but a modern apprenticeship system is a great way of linking people who are not in employment or education and binding them to the workplace.  We have suggested that there should be apprenticeships in catering, hospitality, commerce and logistics as well as the traditional areas.  They can be flexible systems.  Hopefully, with the new State agencies, including SOLAS, it is an area in which there can be progress.

If there is no other business I will now adjourn the meeting until tomorrow morning when it will continue its overview of the 2013 pre-budget submissions.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.
