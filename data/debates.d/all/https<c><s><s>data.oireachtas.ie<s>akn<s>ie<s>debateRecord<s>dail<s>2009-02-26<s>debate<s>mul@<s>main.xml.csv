#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the threat to the welfare of the Irish farming industry, which has been thrown into a cashflow crisis by the failure of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to honour his commitment to reimburse loans taken out for the building of slatted sheds under the farm waste management scheme, under which €400 million is outstanding, while farmers unable to meet bank charges are facing ruin caused by the Minister's stubborn refusal to extend the deadline for applications, which has led to an untenable rush.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I do not agree with the Order of Business.  There is no sense of realism from this Government in the context of the current economic circumstances.  I propose that we set aside Nos. 24 and 25, important though they are, and discuss the grave and escalating situation in the banking sector and the general state of our public finances.  Given the imposition of a selective, biased and unfair pension levy, every State office in the country is being picketed today, including the national Parliament, Dáil Éireann.  Everybody has the right to protest.  However, the point I made yesterday was that the way the Government has approached the hole in our public finances has been selective, unfair and removed from reality.  That is the reason people are outside the gates of this establishment today.  I propose, therefore, that we set aside Nos. 24 and 25 and that the House discuss the continuing and escalating economic crisis.While I am on my feet, I will point out that it is not within the personality of the Taoiseach to accept any constructive suggestion from any member of the Opposition.  I will say to the Tánaiste——

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	14	I agree with Deputy Kenny about setting aside the business ordered for today.  There is an air of unreality about the business the Government has scheduled for the House to discuss.  All public and State offices in the country, including these Houses, are being picketed by members of the Civil and Public Services Union.  Every social welfare office in the country is closed.  This House, instead of discussing the items scheduled for today, needs to discuss the serious economic circumstances the country is in.  The Government has had its lap-dogs out over the past week or so asking why the Opposition does not stay quiet and support the Government and why we cannot all get together and agree these things.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	15	That is right.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	16	This forum is where we agree things.  This party has been saying to the Government for some time now that we want to reach agreement on an economic strategy to move this country forward.  Last week I said to the Taoiseach, specifically on the issue of jobs, that if the Government introduces a strategy for protecting and creating jobs it will have the support of the Labour Party.  We want an open discussion led by the Government and contributed to by the Opposition to address the economic situation, the jobs crisis and the sense of unfairness and hurt felt by all those staff of the State's services standing on picket lines today and to find solutions to the problems we face.  Unfortunately, the Government is not responding.

The reality is that the economic problems facing the country will not be solved in the absence of agreement.  Unfortunately, we are in a situation where the Government repeatedly comes into the House to insist on doing things its own way and then spins the line that it cannot get the agreement of the Opposition.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	41	Thank you.  We are facing a range of problems in this country.  Deputy Catherine Byrne spoke earlier of the loss of three teachers at the Mater Dei national school in Basin Lane, a DEIS school, owing to the €20 billion hole in our public finances.I say to the Tánaiste, in respect of the legislation dealing with these matters, that the Taoiseach does not have it within his personality to accept any constructive suggestions from the Opposition.  I have spoken to the Minister for Finance on a number of occasions and I recognise the gravity of the banking crisis and that our financial independence is at stake.  Will the Tánaiste confirm if the Government gave its view on the appointment of the new chief executive of the Bank of Ireland?  I do not know the person involved but an internal appointment does not send out the right message.

However, he does not.  In any event, I make the following offer to the Tánaiste as deputy head of Government and a senior economic Minister.  I am prepared to supply financial spokespeople from the Fine Gael Party to participate in an all-party group which will set out clear regulation, a clear mandate and strategy, provide for no deals and ensure proper oversight in the banking sector if the Government is prepared to participate in such a group.Any offer we have made in respect of the national jersey or bipartisanship——

I must ensure the House proceeds in an orderly fashion.  If I start allowing questions and so on that are not in order the whole place and the whole system will break down.  I cannot allow it.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	86	I seek clarification from the Tánaiste and the deputy head of Government that she is rejecting an offer of support with definitive, clear guidelines.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	88	That is hypocrisy, like that which we heard last night.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	101	It is a one word answer I need to hear, either "Yes" or "No".

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	103	What is the answer?

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	105	I asked the Tánaiste a question which, I believe, is in order.  That is the question as to whether the Government intends to introduce another budget and when it intends to do so.  I ask the question first, because it is manifestly clear that the budget introduced in October no longer applies and that the Tánaiste described some of the measures in it as a disaster.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	106	We cannot go into that now.

#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	120	The Tánaiste left Agriculture House in a mess and then she made a mess of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	121	With respect to the Chair, I wish to put a question to the Tánaiste.  I seek clarification as to whether she would accept an offer of support in respect of setting out clear regulations and guidelines about the banking sector, given that we have a very grave situation.  I seek a "Yes" or "No" answer.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	122	The Deputy must raise that matter with the Taoiseach on Leaders' Questions next week.

On that issue, it is bizarre that the Opposition is offering to facilitate the Government when every time the Government asks the Opposition to facilitate it, the Opposition is not forthcoming.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	125	We have been listening to this rubbish day and night.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	126	That being said, it is a very grave and difficult situation.  We are all aware of that and that is why we should not be playing politics with it.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	127	Hear, hear.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	128	If there are forthcoming suggestions, the Government will listen.  The Taoiseach has indicated ad infinitum that he is more than happy to facilitate it.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	148	In light of the difficulties of many industries at present and the need for the simplification of the rules and regulations, when will the company law consolidation and reform Bill be introduced?  In light of the fact that a group of young people were drinking all night in a park outside Monaghan last week, and one of the company, unfortunately, lost his life, when will the sale of alcohol Bill be introduced to ensure this type of situation can be minimised?  When will the eligibility for health and personal social services Bill be introduced to guarantee services to the people who deserve them and not only to the HSE?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	149	The company law reform Bill is very sizable legislation.  The Department has appointed some additional support to bring forward the legislation as quickly as possible.  However, as we have indicated, it will be some time before it is brought to finality.  I will have an undertaking with the Chairman of the committee as to the way to move ahead in the discussion of the Bill.  Regarding the sale of alcohol Bill, it will be the middle of this year and there is no date for the final legislation to which the Deputy referred.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	150	I refer to an OECD report, just published, on the employment situation in Ireland.  The report makes recommendations concerning what training schemes and community employment schemes should be put in place.  In light of the growing job losses and since it is relevant to the Department for which the Tánaiste is responsible, will she organise a debate on this report and on the pressing need to provide opportunities for the unemployed?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	151	There is no legislation promised.  I presume it is a matter for the Whips.

If it is a matter for the Whips I would be more than forthcoming.
#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	153	I refer to the minerals development Bill, the purpose of which, we are told, is to modernise and consolidate all mineral developments in the country.  In view of the fact that Galmoy Mines has already closed and that the largest zinc ore mine in Europe, namely, Lisheen Mines in County Tipperary, is due to close in two years time, when will that Bill be introduced?  Given that the Tánaiste's colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has made an unprecedented attack on agriculture, no doubt the hatchets and chainsaws will be out soon for the forestry sector.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	154	That is very interesting but it is not relevant now.

It is expected to be introduced this year, but I understand it has taken some time to complete the work.There is no time decided yet for the forestry Bill.
#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	158	If the Government does not act soon all the mines will be closed.

I know that the Tánaiste is taking a personal interest in SR Technics on the north side of Dublin where 1,135 jobs are at stake.  I hope she has some good news to report on attempts to find a new owner.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	160	There is another way to raise that issue which Deputy Terence Flanagan will have to use.

These budget cuts are far in excess of the figures we have seen in the media.  In the past two days we have asked about having a debate on the health services.  When will we have that debate?  Can we get real information on the extent of the cuts in the context of that debate so that we can protect basic patient services?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	163	The Whips will discuss that and we hope to hold the debate next week if possible.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	166	Deputies have asked about the legislation to control management companies on numerous occasions, including in the past few days.  The Taoiseach has indicated that progress could be reported.  Will the Tánaiste update the House on that progress and when we will see the heads of the Bill?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	167	The heads have been drafted and we hope to introduce that legislation as quickly as possible.  There is an important timeframe for us all within which to have that available.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	168	Indeed, it is an important time for this Bill.There has been a noticeable lack of information recently in the content of responses to parliamentary questions.  This is not the fault of the Ceann Comhairle.  It may be regarded as cute codgerism.  It is a serious erosion of the parliamentary entitlements of the Opposition, and of democracy.  Some Ministers are notorious for this.

I listened with interest while a chat show compère on the national broadcasting service this morning indicated that he had not heard the Opposition admonish Government about the way the economy was going in the past few years.

These hospitals are bursting at the seams and are barely able to cope.  The role of the midwife could be greatly enhanced.  Does the Bill take account of that?

I have no doubt that the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Martin Cullen, who is sitting beside the Tánaiste is well aware of the money wasted on electronic voting machines.  He spent €60 million on electronic voting machines and said it was "small change" in his time as the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.

Will she, as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, deal with the regulation of communications?  She is more aware than most that new jobs can be created in the digital sector but the environment needs to be right.  If the Government persists with the broadcasting Bill it will unnecessarily establish yet another quango at a time when we need one regulator in the communications sector.

#MaryWallace	unknown-#MaryWallace-party	unknown-#MaryWallace-dob	unknown-#MaryWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	239	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the HSE document, Framework for the Development of a Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Programme for Ireland, which was published in November 2008.  Diabetes is a chronic and progressive metabolic disease.  There are two types of diabetes.  Type 1 diabetes, or insulin dependent diabetes, accounts for approximately 10% of all cases of diabetes.  It affects mainly children, adolescents and young adults and requires lifelong treatment with insulin.  Type 2 diabetes, or non-insulin dependent diabetes, accounts for 90% of all cases diagnosed in Ireland.  It affects mainly middle aged and older people.  Its prevalence is increasing rapidly due to a number of factors, including the ageing of the population and lifestyle factors such as obesity.  Diabetes is a common condition.  An Institute of Public Health report, Making Diabetes Count — What Does the Future Hold?, provides the best available estimate of the prevalence of diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes in the Ireland.  Just over 140,000 adults in this jurisdiction are estimated to have type 1 or type 2 diabetes.  The report predicts that this figure will increase by approximately 37% — to at least 194,000 people, or 5.6% of the population — by 2015.  It estimates that this will largely result from an increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes, as a consequence of the increase in childhood and adolescent obesity.The diabetes policy of the Department of Health and Children, Diabetes: Prevention & Model for Patient Care, was published in 2006.  It sets out a model of care, based on shared care between primary care and acute services, which will deliver quality diabetes care at an appropriate level.  It identifies retinopathy screening for eye disease, patient education and empowerment and the development of podiatry services as key areas for further development.  The Health Service Executive has established an expert advisory group under Dr. Colm Costigan to develop and implement the various policy recommendations.  The group's report, which was published on 14 November 2008, represents a blueprint for the development of services for patients with diabetes over the coming years.  It is practical and focuses on the patient.  It places a strong emphasis on prevention, service integration and community based management supported by specialist services.The expert advisory group emphasises that real savings in health care costs can be achieved if complications of diabetes, such as eye disease, or retinopathy, kidney disease and cardiovascular disease can be prevented.  Retinopathy has been identified as one of the most common serious complications of diabetes.  Diabetic retinopathy, which is a disease of the small blood vessels of the retina, is a common cause of blindness in people between the ages of 60 and 65.  Approximately 5% or 10% of people with diabetes have sight-threatening retinopathy that requires ophthalmic follow-up and treatment.  Of the estimated 140,000 people with diabetes in Ireland, between 14,000 and 16,000 will develop sight-threatening retinopathy.  Screening for, and subsequent treatment of, retinopathy is effective in preventing blindness.  International evidence shows that 6% of those who screened and treated for retinopathy are prevented from going blind within a year.  This figure increases to 34% within ten years.  The expert advisory group has recommended the introduction of a diabetic retinopathy screening programme to prevent eye disease.  A subgroup of the group, the diabetic retinopathy screening sub-committee, was established to develop a framework for the development, implementation and monitoring of the national diabetic retinopathy screening programme.  The sub-committee's report, which was published in November of last year, is being discussed in the House today.In December 2007, before the expert advisory group published its report, it delivered its interim recommendations to the HSE leadership team for the development of diabetic services.  The group decided to prioritise the roll-out of the national diabetic retinopathy screening programme.  The targets recommended by the group at that time were that funding for the development of a national diabetic retinopathy screening programme be prioritised; that funding be made available incrementally over the next four years to implement the programme in each of the four Health Service Executive areas, with the programme being commenced in a new area each year; that the HSE immediately prioritise funding and commence procurement for an eye-specific information technology system to support a national diabetic retinopathy screening programme; that the HSE set up a formal governance structure for a national diabetic retinopathy screening programme; that 95% of registered people with diabetes be invited for screening within five years of full national implementation of the programme; and that 70% of registered people with diabetes attend such screening within five years.In November 2008, the diabetic retinopathy screening sub-committee produced the document we are debating today, Framework for the Development of a Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Programme for Ireland.  The framework sets out the aims and principles that should underpin the development of a screening programme.  The aims of the national diabetic retinopathy screening programme are to detect diabetic retinopathy that is threatening sight but is treatable, to detect any diabetic retinopathy that may be detected with digital retinal photography, to provide screening on a call and recall basis according to best practice guidelines and to refer patients in a timely way for ophthalmic assessment and treatment, as required.I will list the principles of the national diabetic retinopathy screening programme that have been adopted by the HSE's diabetes expert advisory group.  A population-based call and recall programme should be delivered on an annual basis.  Eligible patients should include all those with diagnosed diabetes aged 12 years and over who are medically fit to attend.  It should be accessible to all eligible patients.  It should be free, wheelchair accessible and delivered locally.  Provision should be made for the screening of prisoners and people in nursing or residential homes who are fit to receive treatment.  Screening should be carried out using digital retinal photography.  Screening should be delivered in four area programmes, based on a population of approximately 1 million in each area, and in a geographic area corresponding to each HSE area.  A register of people with diagnosed diabetes should be established for each area and collated nationally.  A grading service should be developed on the basis of the population of each HSE area.  These centres should grade images taken by all photographers in the programme for that area.  The screening model should be mixed — it should feature a combination of fixed and mobile clinics, and possibly photography by optometrists, depending on the geographical distribution of the population, public transport links and economies of scale.HSE areas should propose their preferred service model to the national screening committee and national executive office for approval.  Screening should be carried out in co-operation with general practitioners, hospital diabetes service staff, optometrists, ophthalmic physicians and surgeons.  There should be timely referral, assessment and treatment of any abnormalities discovered.  There should be timely feedback to the screening programme of the result of screening events and of referrals.  There should be a robust system of clinical governance and quality assurance.It was decided to continue the roll-out of the programme across the HSE west, as a population-based screening programme had previously been established in the former North-Western Health Board.  The funding was made available to the HSE west primary community and continuing care budget.  This would allow for screening services to be offered to all people with diabetes — approximately 30,000 people over the age of 12 years — registered with the programme between west Limerick and north Donegal. Due to resource constraints, the diabetic retinopathy screening programme did not commence in 2008.  The HSE is moving into the implementation phase for the roll-out of the screening programme to the rest of the western region, based on the national framework document.  Funding of €750,000 is available in 2009 for this purpose.One of the key parts of the implementation phase is the development of the governance and committee structures, and this process is under way.  Job descriptions and recruitment forms for the eight agreed staff is with the relevant local health office, and it is expected that these posts will be advertised shortly.  The formal procurement process for the ICT requirements of the programme is to begin in the coming months.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	240	I thank the Minister of State for giving me the opportunity to discuss this matter, even if it is only in the context of statements to the House.A few months ago, the Irish Endocrine Society and Diabetes Federation of Ireland made a presentation to the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  Dr. Diarmuid Smith was present and that meeting, and I would like to quote extensively what he said, because I could not put it any better myself.We would like to be able to say that over the past three years the care of diabetes patients in Ireland has improved but, unfortunately, it has not.  The title of our presentation is "Diabetes in Ireland: Are We Coping?"  The stark reality is we are not coping, which significantly affects the quality of care we can deliver to patients with diabetes in this country.  The greatest health challenge the world and Ireland face this century is the epidemic of diabetes.  The prevalence of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes is increasing each decade.  In the case of type 2 diabetes, we expect to see an increase in its prevalence of approximately 37% over the next ten years.We know that if diabetes is not treated appropriately, life expectancy is shortened.  We know that diabetes is the commonest cause of blindness in working age adults.  We know that diabetes is the commonest cause of renal failure and we also know of the need for dialysis in Ireland.  Diabetes is associated with a 40-fold increased risk of lower limb amputation and an increased risk of heart disease and stroke.  Diabetes care consumes between at least 6% and 8% of the annual health care budget and 60% of that budget is spent on the management of diabetes-related complications.  Several diabetes complications are preventable, so if we invest appropriately in diabetes care, we can stop limbs being amputated and people going blind and save the health service money. [The Minister of State has acknowledged this.]In 1989, the Department of Health and Children signed up to the St. Vincent declaration.  With this declaration, the Irish Government made a commitment to reduce new blindness cases due to diabetes by one-third or more, reduce numbers entering end-stage diabetic renal failure by at least one third, reduce by at least 50% the rate of limb amputations for diabetic foot disease and reduce morbidity and the mortality rate from cardiovascular disease.  Unfortunately, successive Irish Governments have failed to deliver on these commitments.In 2002, the diabetes community submitted a document entitled "Diabetes Care: Securing the Future" to the then Minister for Health and Children.  This report outlined very precisely what Ireland needed in terms of staff numbers and infrastructure and provided precise costings on how to establish an internationally accepted national diabetes service for this country.  The recommendations of this report have not been implemented and so today, we are still providing a sub-optimal, under-staffed and under-resourced national diabetes service.  [This has obvious consequences for our patients.]  In 2006, the HSE established an expert advisory group to look at the development and implementation of a national diabetes strategy.  Several people here on our panel [i.e at that committee] were included in this group...They submitted their recommendations to the HSE in September 2007.  However, nine months later [it is now 18 months later], none of the recommendations of the expert advisory group has been implemented.In Ireland, the diabetes community is very clear about what we need to do, how we need to go about delivering a world-class diabetes service for the people of Ireland and how much this will cost the country.  The only blockage appears to be a lack of political will in the past, possibly a lack of knowledge in regard to the seriousness of diabetes and, unfortunately, a lack of resources.  We are asking for the committee's help to have the vision and political willpower to realise that Ireland is facing an epidemic of diabetes.  We need to put structures, resources and staff in place to deal with this national crisis....Diabetes is the commonest cause of blindness in working-age adults.  Up to 5% to 10% of people with diabetes have sight-threatening eye disease [acknowledged by the Minister of State] which requires expert ophthalmic follow up and treatment.  Diabetic eye disease is preventable.  The establishment of a national retinal screening programme using retinal cameras [as outlined by the Minister of State] and pictures would help us to identify diabetic eye disease early, allow appropriate therapy to be initiated early, reduce the number of new cases of diabetes related blindness and improve our patients' quality of life.  It would also be cost-effective as it would pay for itself within a few short years.  The cost of screening a patient with a retinal picture or camera is approximately €65, while the cost of treating someone with sight-threatening diabetic eye disease is more than €1,700.A national retinal screening programme is the international best practice and has been effective in other countries of similar size to Ireland in reducing diabetes related blindness.  However, this programme is only available in small pockets of Ireland like the north west, where it runs very successfully.  In 2007, the HSE west was promised a capital expenditure of €750,000 to expand the retinopathy screening programme within the area.  The money in 2007 never materialised.  [The money in 2008 never materialised either, and we are now in 2009.]  The area received similar funds in 2008 but is still awaiting clearance to recruit staff to run the retinal screening programme. . . [Does that sound familiar?  Did somebody mention recruiting staff?]Our second point relates to diabetic foot disease, particularly in respect of podiatry...Diabetic foot disease is preventable. Ireland has the lowest manpower in podiatry for diabetes.  There are only two full-time hospital posts in the whole country.  The country needs between 90 and 100 full-time podiatrists for diabetes foot care, based both in the community and the hospital. The podiatrists need to be appropriately trained, equipped and resourced if they are to have a positive impact on reducing the risk of diabetic foot disease.  Investing in podiatry care will help us save limbs and improve the quality of life of our patients and would be cost-effective.The third issue relates to a national diabetes register.  I cannot say exactly how many people in Ireland have diabetes.  [Generally, for every case we know about, there is another case we do not know about.  By the time such people present, they have complications which might have been avoided had they been diagnosed earlier.]  We do not know...I do not know whether diabetes is more prevalent in Mayo or Donegal compared with Dublin...[We do not know how we compare with the US or anywhere else.  We need a register, which would not cost much money.]The fourth issue relates to integrated care.  Integrated care refers to the care of patients predominantly with type 2 diabetes.  It refers to the integration and sharing of care of all patients with type 2 diabetes between the hospital diabetes specialist team and the primary care physician [i.e. the GP] who has an interest in diabetes.  The system essentially is structured on an annual visit or a visit every 18 months to the hospital diabetes specialist team, and three monthly in-between visits to the primary care physician...[A small programme was run on this basis in conjunction with Heartwatch, which proved to be very successful in the midlands.]  Patients with type 2 diabetes are often only seen once a year for their diabetes or not at all and if they are seen more frequently, it is often in an unstructured fashion with little access to, or support from, the diabetes multidisciplinary team...The diabetes community wants to develop a system of integrated care between the hospitals and primary care providers.This all occurred last year.  Dr. Smith went on to talk further about the development and the expansion of existing services, and we know none of that happened.  He went to give a stark example:A few weeks ago, in a kidney clinic I run with my colleague, Professor Peter Conlon, in Beaumont Hospital, I met a man from the country who had type 1 diabetes for 39 years.During those 39 years he had never met a diabetes or endocrine consultant.  [Not once.]  I was the first consultant diabetologist he had met.  Unfortunately, at this stage he was almost blind, had laser therapy to both his eyes, had renal failure and was beginning the process for renal transplantation and had lost the sensation in his lower limbs.  I could not believe this could still happen in the Ireland of the 21st century but I am afraid this story is not uncommon.That is an absolutely shocking story of a health service that has lost its way.  That can still happen today.  He went on to say that we have a blueprint for a national diabetes strategy, but I will not go into that.Dr. Colm Costigan's main quote was, "if the Committee could do one thing for us today it would be to add political pressure to implementing the report; we do not need new reports or fudging of the issues".  Dr. Tony O'Sullivan, a GP who has diabetes, attended the meeting.  He said he noticed a 10% incidence of depression among people with diabetes, yet there is no counselling or psychological support for them.  Dr. Obada Yousif pointed out that diabetes has been recognised by the United Nations as being the only non-communicable, non-infectious disease that poses serious threats to countries and communities alike.In 2002, the estimated capital cost of a diabetes retinopathy screening unit was €1.984 million, with an ongoing annual cost of €2.5 million, which one can weigh against the annual cost of looking after 100 registered blind people of €2.4 million.  That is the cost for just 100 people; we have 14,000 people at risk of losing their eyesight from diabetes alone.  Doing this would cost a fraction of the cost of care for those people.The presentation to the committee stated:The recommendation of the group present is to provide a retinal screening unit in each HSE region, either a mobile or stationary unit, depending on the public-rural mix and geographical profile of the area.  Each regional diabetes centre should also be adequately resourced and funded, with a retinal screening unit.  There should be a centralised screening mechanism, whereby images from rural areas would be streamlined into a central station where they could be placed in the different grades of retinopathy and dealt with according to a pre-agreed priority strategy.  We also recommend an increase in the number of retinal surgeons from ten to 15 to deal with the work generated by the expected level of detection.There is a major issue here that is, unfortunately, symptomatic of where we have been going in this country.  We commission a report, get experts to join in and get the best of minds applied to the issue, and they produce an excellent report.  In this case the report's strategy is very cost-effective, but for want of €750,000 it does not happen.  There is a general realisation in the medical and broader communities that the diabetes epidemic in this country is closely correlated to the obesity epidemic.  Some 15 years ago, type 2 diabetes was always associated with people in their middle years who were obese or seriously overweight.  We now see type 2 diabetes in children, which we did not see 15 or 20 years ago, and that is directly related to obesity in children.  Again, this Government had the best of minds brought together from a broad range of people and put together an obesity taskforce which came up with 128 recommendations.  At the Oireachtas committee meeting to which I referred I asked the witnesses if they could tell me how many of those recommendations have been implemented.  Not one could be pointed out to me and I believe that is the case.  I would be happy to be contradicted but I do not believe I will be.  We must ask what happened to the €750,000 for the roll-out in 2007 and 2008.The moneys were put aside for the roll-out of the diabetic retinopathy screening programme which would save people's eyes and prevent many from going blind.  It is essential that this money be made available.  It is penny wise and pound foolish not to do so, not to mention the human suffering that occurs because of a late diagnosis of diabetes.  We are all aware of the cutbacks that must be implemented, but no matter how hard times are and how bad the economy is, such programmes give results very quickly and will save money, as had been pointed out.It is very difficult not to be confrontational about this.  I would like to take a different line, but yet again promises are made that are broken and plans for action are seen as a substitute for real action.  The Minister of State mentioned advertising and I read the report.  They were recruiting in 2008, are still recruiting in 2009 and hope to advertise soon.  We all know that from the point of advertisement, to having interviews, to appointing people — particularly consultants — can take from 12 to 18 months.  How many more people will go blind during that time due to our failure?  I ask the Minister of State for that small amount of money and to fight hard for the people with diabetes.  It is only small beer but means so much to so many people.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	241	I would like to share my time with Deputy O'Shea.  I hope this debate will do what the Irish Endocrine Society and the Diabetes Federation of Ireland hoped, namely put pressure on the Government and HSE to ensure the programme for diabetic retinopathy is rolled out in the recommended timeframe and the various recommendations of the expert advisory group are implemented.  It is a disgrace that these recommendations have not been implemented in any way.Like Deputy Reilly I was at the meeting of the health committee and he has quoted extensively from the presentation.  Everybody on the committee was very struck by the urgency of this issue and the cost-effectiveness of the recommendations.  Approximately 15% of acute beds are diabetes related and 10% of the budget is in some way related to diabetes.  As Deputy Reilly said, the roll-out of the diabetic retinopathy programme would be cost-effective if one sets the cost of the screening programme and the treatment that would arise against the cost of people who have become blind as a direct result of diabetes.  In the medium term money would be saved.I would like to focus on the Minister of State's reply and what she might tell us in it.  I found her initial contribution very disappointing because most of it was spent in describing the problem and only the last half page or so was on what is going to be done about it.  I welcome that it is intended that this €750,000 that was meant to be spent last year will be spent this year and I hope the Minister of State will give us a categorical guarantee that it will happen this year and the roll-out in the north west will go ahead.  As Deputy Reilly said, it is relatively small money.  The health service is in financial crisis and there will be cutbacks everywhere, and we will debate that next week.  However I urge the Minister of State that this relatively small amount of money, which has the potential to save money in the long term, be ring-fenced for this purpose.  I refer not only to this year's money for the north west but the money required to roll out the programme for the rest of the country over four years.We all have experience of money being set aside for such programmes as A Vision for Change and the hospice movement in the development area of the health services, and that money has gone into black holes and been spent in other areas.  I would like a guarantee from the Minister of State that there is a commitment from Government that this money will be ring-fenced.  Representatives of the HSE at the health committee told us that while they did not ring-fence funding for mental health and other areas up to last year, they had found a mechanism for ring-fencing it in the future.  If they can do that in other areas they can do it for this programme also.  I urge the Minister of State to give us that commitment in her reply.There is a real concern among those who represent the diabetes community and those who care for people diabetes that the north-west service will be put in place this year but somehow or other the rest of this roll-out will be left behind.  These programmes are vital for people who have diabetes or who may develop diabetes because they literally prevent blindness.  It is a relatively simple procedure, as Deputy Reilly and the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, outlined.This programme dates back to the St. Vincent's declaration 20 years ago, and the diabetes service development group set up in April 2001 where the health care professionals came together because there was no Government action.  Following on that, there was a Department of Health and Children working group and there was the expert advisory report published in November 2008.  Then there was the commitment to spend the money, yet we still have not seen any action.  It is vital that we make progress on this element of the prevention of complications of diabetes which is doable.I want to refer briefly to the issue of podiatry and chiropody because that is also a serious problem for people who suffer from diabetes.  Somebody who came to my clinic recently is a diabetic — who has a medical card and is on disability benefit — had been getting chiropody treatment on a monthly basis.  He has had a toe amputation and needs this chiropody service but he was told that because he is not over 65 that service will discontinue.  I tabled a parliamentary question to find out if this is the case throughout the country.  Apparently, priority in the community chiropody service is given to the over 65s and people under 65 may get it at the discretion of the service if the funding is available, but it looks as if in these difficult times that funding is being cut as well.  I want to make that case while I have the opportunity.  These are clearly people who for medical reasons need this service and who do not have the ability to pay for it.  It is an example of many of the cutbacks impacting on people.  Individuals know it is happening to them but they, and at times we, do not know that it is happening throughout the country.  I would urge that this matter be examined and that people who genuinely need these services are given them as they need them.It is clear that the retinopathy screening programme involves a saving.  According to the figures, as Deputy Reilly stated and as given to us at the committee, diabetes is the commonest cause of blindness in working age adults.  Approximately 5% to 10% of people with diabetes have sight-threatening retinopathy which requires expert ophthalmic follow-up treatment.  Using this figure it is anticipated that 14,000 to 16,000 people will develop sight-threatening retinopathy by 2010.  This is a sizeable section of the population.I again urge that today's debate be a positive measure in moving forward to ensure this programme is put in place and that it is rolled out over the next four years to the entire country.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	242	Gabhaim buíochas le mo chomhghleacaí, an Teachta O'Sullivan, urlabhraí Pháirtí an Lucht Oibre ar chúrsaí sláinte as ucht a cuid ama a roinnt liom.  Tá suim ar leith agam san ábhar atá os comhair na Dála faoi láthair.  I have a particular interest in this subject because I have diabetes.  In my case there were complications but these related not to sight, but to my nervous system.  I developed a peripheral problem in my legs — both legs were damaged and I had to spend quite some time on crutches.  I have made a worthwhile recovery since then.I was diagnosed with diabetes in late 2003 when the problem started to show in my legs.  I had a test in 1999 which showed that I was okay and some time in between the condition developed.Deputy Reilly dealt with some of the issues I meant to raise and I will not go back over those.  The issue of children as young as 11 years developing type two diabetes because of obesity is a horrific aspect of our time.  It has been put to me that all of those over 40 and over weight should be tested at least once a year to diagnose the pre-diabetes stage.  If one catches the pre-diabetes stage one can do a great deal to delay the on-set of the condition.I am struck by how incomplete and incomprehensive are the figures on the prevalence of diabetes.  Frankly, because I have diabetes and people with diabetes talk to one another, it seems there are many more people with diabetes in the country than the figures would indicate.  For instance, the Institute of Public Health estimated that at least 141,063 adults in the Republic of Ireland had diabetes, that is, 4.7% of the population.  In my view the figure is much higher.  One of the members of the diabetes expert group, Dr. Graham Roberts, an endocrinologist at Waterford Regional Hospital, stated that 15% of acute beds could be freed up by preventing the complications with diabetes.  It is a significant factor in the health system.On the issue of diabetic retinopathy with which we are dealing today, I understand that between 3% and 5% of those with diabetes develop sight-threatening retinopathy each year.  That is an astounding figure when set against a background, for instance, of the Diabetes Federation of Ireland stating that in Ireland there are 200,000 diabetics, 100,000 people in the pre-diabetic condition and approximately 50,000 undiagnosed diabetics.  This is a real problem.Getting back to the point made by Dr. Roberts, if we can prevent the range of complications, whether cardiovascular, kidney disease related or retinopathy, in the long run the small amount of money needed to roll out this programme would bring a large dividend.I do not want to delve too deeply into the entire question of diabetes today, but one cannot discuss the retinopathy issue without looking at the range of complications that arise from diabetes.  A national diabetes or pre-diabetes screening programme, which would be greatly cheaper than the retinopathy programme, although it would obviously involve testing a much wider population and in that sense would be probably more expensive, would be an investment that would keep many people out of acute hospital beds.  This is one of the best ways of reducing health spending by dealing with those who would need acute treatment in hospitals.Today's statement by the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, is heartening in as much as it indicates that the funding is available in 2009 to go ahead with the first phase of the retinopathy screening programme.  This programme has encountered difficulty previously because of a recruiting embargo.  Is there not a recruiting embargo this year?  I question whether this scheme will go ahead against the background of the €1.1 billion additional cutbacks in the HSE budget that has been announced.  I hope this is not the case because it needs to be done; it is to be rolled out over four years.  Like Deputy O'Sullivan, I ask the Minister of State to tell us in unequivocal terms if this is definitely going ahead or will it be one of the cutbacks that are about to be announced as a result of the €1.1 billion in cuts?  Will there be an embargo to prevent the recruitment to fill the eight positions that are to be advertised shortly?  Will the procurement process for the ICT elements of the programme fall foul of these cutbacks?The Minister of State's speech was heartening but I have great doubts that it will be delivered on.

To an extent, this is an unreal day in Leinster House because of the situation outside the gates.  I was uncomfortable in passing pickets because it is not something I like doing, and I cannot remember ever doing it before.  I said to those who asked me why I was coming in that I was coming in to do my job and represent my community.  Some colleagues might have differing views but it is important that we go about our business.  It is an important issue, and I acknowledge the interest of my colleagues across the floor in health matters.Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted and 20 Members being present,

#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	246	It was noted, however, that I have not mentioned Tallaght yet, so I will do that.  I psyched myself up for this debate by visiting Tallaght Hospital to see a friend this morning.  Going in there, I passed the only plaque that survives from all the openings of Tallaght Hospital under various Ministers, and that is the one stating the building was opened by Brendan Howlin, TD, Minister for Health, a very good Minister for Health.I have been interested in health issues throughout my career, including the challenges I have faced myself.  Thank God I have never had diabetes but I have had a heart problem which thankfully has passed.  Diabetes affects one in 20 people in this country and we are told that by 2025, the prevalence could be close to 8% of the population under current obesity trends.  Approximately 10% of health care spending is diabetes related, and this will increase by up to 25% in the next 20 years.  During my time on the Eastern Regional Health Authority from 1994, we were told that 7% of all health care spending in the region was diabetes related.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, is aware of those statistics.During my career as a community worker, I was appointed by a Fianna Fáil Minister to the Health Promotion Unit and such promotion work is important.  My colleagues on the other side of the House talk about expenditure and cutbacks but health promotion should not lose out in the difficulties with health spending.  Tallaght Hospital, like every other hospital, is not just about the accident and emergency ward but also deals with health promotion and this debate on diabetes highlights its importance.People with diabetes are five times more likely to need hospital admission.  If they are admitted, they are ten times more likely to suffer major medical complications compared to non-diabetics.  Diabetes has a profound impact on lifestyle, work, well-being and life expectancy.Life expectancy is reduced by approximately 20 years in people with type 1 diabetes, and up to ten years in people with type 2 diabetes.  I am told there are approximately 2,000 deaths annually from diabetes which also causes significant morbidity.  Studies have estimated that type 2 diabetes is present for an average of seven years prior to diagnosis and at this stage up to half of the people concerned may have evidence of complications linked to diabetes.In Tallaght village this morning I was asked if I was on a day off because of the pickets, but I said it was a normal day in the Dáil, raising issues and looking after constituents' interests.  I asked someone what diabetes meant to him and he replied, "Isn't that where people can unfortunately have strokes, heart disease and be subject to blindness?"  I am not being flippant about it, but that is the image people have.It is important to grasp the nettle, as Opposition colleagues, including Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, have said.  Deputy Brian O'Shea highlighted the HSE cutbacks and I did so from these benches the other night when the Ceann Comhairle's office was kind enough to give me a few minutes on the Adjournment debate.  I raised hospital care issues then and I feel strongly about the cutbacks the HSE is contemplating.  It is important for all of us to tell the HSE, the Government and the Minister of State present, that patient care must be always preserved.  There will be difficult challenges but the bottom line is that if people are sick they should be looked after at the local hospital.  In that Adjournment debate I concentrated on the challenges facing Tallaght hospital and the services currently being provided there.Some people may say that diabetes is not as important as dealing with accidents or heart attacks.  However, diabetes is a major health problem in this country and internationally, which uses up a huge amount of resources.  The Minister of State should understand that this debate is important to many people.  In the context of all the challenges the health service is currently facing, let us not forget health promotion.  Let us not forget either that diabetes, as with other health disciplines, requires that kind of attention.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	247	I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate on diabetes, given its increasing prevalence.  Approximately 250,000 people are affected by this illness and, as previous speakers have said, we should have a national diabetes strategy.  Primary, secondary and tertiary care remain generally unsupported in this country.  Deputy Reilly, who has experience in this area, pointed out that patients do not have timely access to consultant diabetologists.  In addition, diabetes multi-disciplinary teams are understaffed and under-resourced.  Other services are unavailable, including a diabetic retinopathy screening programme, while primary care for diabetes is generally unsupported.The report of the diabetes expert advisory group was completed and submitted to the HSE in September 2007.  It is crucial that this report's recommendations should be published and implemented as a priority. We also need to develop a national diabetes patient register.  The mobile diabetic retinopathy screening service in the north-west was not expanded, despite the fact that funding was set aside for such an expansion in both 2007 and 2008.  This highlights the lack of support for, and possibly indifference to, the issue of diabetes.  Deputy Reilly asked where this funding went.  There is a need to consider the roll-out of a national diabetic retinopathy screening programme.I wish to refer to the connection between diabetes and obesity.  Given my background as a physical education teacher, for a number of years I have been highlighting the link between obesity and other illnesses, including cardiovascular illnesses.  There has been an alarming increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes, which is now manifesting itself in our children.  That is directly related to increasing levels of obesity.  It is obvious that people are getting fatter and while efforts are being made to combat obesity, unfortunately they are not good enough.Deputy Reilly referred to the report of the obesity task force, which made some 126 recommendations.  Interestingly, some people without direct responsibility for Departments, put in place a number of these measures.  They have lived up to their expectations, but the Government has failed dismally.  I have put a number of questions to various Departments about implementing the recommendations of the obesity task force report, but there has been no commitment whatsoever.  There was a commitment in that report that the Department of the Taoiseach would be responsible for co-ordinating the implementation of the recommendations.  I asked the Taoiseach about this at question time but he knew nothing about it.  This is regrettable because we could have become leaders in this field.  We could still become leaders in fighting obesity, but unfortunately the will is not there.We are going through an unprecedented economic challenge, but combating obesity would cost very little, while saving us a lot of money in the future.  As things stand, we are storing up health problems for the future.  We are sitting on a medical time-bomb if we do not address the problem of obesity and its connection to diabetes.  There seems to be little or no understanding, commitment or general policy on the Government's part to tackle this matter.According to the statistics, approximately 39% of the population are overweight — that breaks down as 46% of men and 33% of women.  One in five, or 18% of the adult population, is obese.  This is an alarming statistic.  More men are affected by obesity than women.  Ireland has the fourth highest prevalence of excess weight and obesity in men in the European Union, and the seventh highest prevalence in women.  Those statistics are stark.Research shows that childhood obesity is associated with a higher chance of premature death and disability in adulthood.  Globally, in 2005, 20 million children under the age of five were overweight.  On the island of Ireland, one in ten children aged between five and 12 is overweight while a further one in ten is obese.  In total, 22% of seven to 12 year olds is overweight or obese.  The taskforce report stated up to 300,000 children could be obese in the near future as numbers increase by 10,000 per annum.  It is a crisis and must be tackled.The UK Government recently launched a major campaign against obesity.  There is a direct link between obesity and diabetes.  A study from the Health and Social Care Information Centre shows that an obese woman is almost 13 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than a woman who is not obese.  Another finding was that the prevalence of doctor diagnosed diabetes was related to increases in body mass index and raised waist circumference.  Men and women who are overweight are more likely to report doctor diagnosed diabetes, 5% of men and 3% of women, than men and women of normal weight, both 2%, while obese men and women were most likely to have doctor diagnosed diabetes, 10% and 9% respectively.  Both men and women with a raised waist circumference were more than four times as likely to have doctor diagnosed diabetes as those without a raised weight circumference.  These are the most up-to-date findings.Some years ago I did a survey on the lack of physical education in schools.  Some schools are making a real effort to combat obesity through physical education but it is not the case in all.  Tralee CBS has made great progress in this area and it should be used as a pilot project for the rest of the country's schools.There is an emerging obesity epidemic among young people.  Statistics from the UK show that by the 2050, 60% of men, 40% of women and a quarter of children under 16 could be obese.  We are looking for a cross-party consensus to address this.  It is one problem which all politicians can tackle together.  I am willing to join with the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, in addressing this issue for the good of future generations because of my background in physical education and keeping up my interest in it since I left teaching.In recessions, people tend to eat less healthy foods.  More young people, because they will not have access to healthy foods, will eat fattening and energy-dense foods which will lead to obesity problems.  In bad economic times, people tend to be more down and eat more comfort foods.  Obesity will be on the increase and linked to that will be an increase in type 2 diabetes.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	248	I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on diabetic retinopathy screening programme.Deputy Deenihan's last point is very valid.  In the last economic recession, Cadburys sales doubled as people ate more high-fat content and unnecessary foods.  The diabetic retinopathy screening programme is an important national initiative based on pioneering work carried out in the north west.  Diabetes is the single most common cause of blindness in Ireland.  It is essential the Health Service Executive takes all available measures, based on international best practice, to prevent blindness occurring in patients with diabetes.  It is also essential the programme is rolled out nationally as soon as possible.Of the €15 billion spent annually on the HSE budget, very little is spent on preventive medicine.  As Deputy Reilly stated earlier, for every €1,700 spent on an illness, €65 could have been spent on preventing it.  If we are examining ways of getting value for taxpayers' money, then more should be spent on public health awareness campaigns to advise people how to safeguard their health.  Only a fraction of the current budget is spent on such campaigns.  Those campaigns against diabetes and obesity run in the UK needed to be implemented here.  In schools, sporting and outdoor activities should be encouraged more.  It is disappointing when sports capital grants are curtailed.  Too many children these days spend too much time watching DVDs.  Sport gives good value and encourages young people to get involved and away from the television.  Alcohol abuse is another factor contributing to the rise of diabetes.  Tackling diabetes is about encouraging people to take responsibility for their health by adopting a healthy lifestyle and diet.The national diabetic retinopathy screening initiative is important in increasing awareness among people about diabetes.  However, it must be rolled out as soon as possible.  BreastCheck, for example, is only now being rolled out in south Sligo when it has been a standard screening service in Northern Ireland for the past 25 years.  Screening is money well spent for the health services.Increasing awareness of the screening programme and encouraging people to avail of it can be done through many means.  Local radio is an inexpensive way, particularly in these straitened times, to raise awareness of diabetes and preventive medicine.  It is outrageous that diabetes is the single common cause of blindness in Ireland.  It is important a national diabetes register is established, as a matter of priority, to ensure all patients can benefit from the service.  It is equally important that the national screening programme be rolled out.In the context of the HSE's budget going forward and the five-year envelope of funding for the Department, I am of the view that the best way to spend money is to create awareness.  When one considers the development of gyms throughout the country, one realises that people are extremely conscious of their health.  In the interest of expanding public health awareness, a poster campaign should be carried out in supermarkets, shopping malls, etc., in order to highlight the steps people should take to protect their health and to make known to them the initial symptoms of diabetes.  If diabetes is detected early, it will reduce the cost to the State and improve people's quality of life and their life expectancy.Diabetes has a major impact on people's lives, particularly in the context that they are obliged to inject with insulin or take other prescription drugs.  The position in America with regard to obesity is appalling.  A regulation was recently introduced in New York whereby restaurant menus must carry information relating to the fat content of each dish.  Ireland followed New York's lead when it came to introducing a ban on smoking.  It should do so again in the context of listing the fat content of dishes listed on restaurant menus.  This would increase people's awareness with regard to what they are eating.We engaged in a campaign in our schools to promote the consumption of fruit and vegetables.  In current circumstances, people are seeking value for money when they shop.  However, I am aware from experience that customers, particularly those on lower incomes, tend to purchase many foods that are not good for their health.I reiterate that diabetes is the most common cause of blindness.  In that context, it is important to establish a national register of diabetics.  It is also vital that the HSE adopt all the necessary measures, based on international best practice, to prevent blindness in those with diabetes.  Furthermore, we must focus attention on public health awareness and the problem of obesity.  The health budget amounts to some €15 billion.  How little of this money is spent promoting public health awareness or the importance of preventative medicine?There should be a major radio campaign in respect of diabetes and the problem of obesity.  In addition, we should launch a campaign in schools in order to promote healthy eating practices among children.  We should oblige people to take on board the message in respect of health awareness issues.  If, as already stated, we follow the example of New York in respect of stipulating that the fat content of each dish on a restaurant menu be listed, it would be of major assistance.General practitioners are on the front line with regard to the provision of health services.  It would be a welcome development if they were provided with a user-friendly document listing the warning signs relating to diabetes for distribution to their patients.I again welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this matter because the introduction of a screening programme for diabetic retinopathy is essential and such a programme should be rolled out nationally.  I reiterate to the Minister of State that a national register of diabetics should also be established.
#NiallBlaneyIND	unknown-#NiallBlaneyIND-party	unknown-#NiallBlaneyIND-dob	unknown-#NiallBlaneyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	249	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the retinopathy screening programme for Ireland.  Approximately one out of every 20 people in Ireland is affected by diabetes.  Of these, some 140,000 are adults.  The report to which the Minister of State referred earlier predicts that this figure is predicted to increase by a further 60,000 — or 5.6% of the population — by 2015.  By 2025, the level of prevalence may have risen to 8%.  This gives rise to major concerns on the part of many of those involved in dealing with what might be termed a crisis.  The report also estimates that approximately 10% of health care spending is diabetes-related.  This figure could increased by 25% in the next 20 years.People with diabetes are five times more likely to require hospitalisation.  If admitted to hospital, they are ten times more likely to be at risk of major medical complications than are non-diabetic patients.  Diabetes has a profound impact on lifestyle, work, well-being and life expectancy.  The life expectancy of those with type 1 diabetes usually decreases by 20 years, while for those with type 2 it is reduced by ten years.Diabetes also causes significant morbidity.  Studies estimate that type 2 diabetes is present for an average of seven years prior to diagnosis.  Up to half the population may be showing evidence of the complications of diabetes at this stage.  Diabetes gives rise to many such complications including blindness, kidney and nerve damage, the vascular complications that result from coronary heart disease, stroke and peripheral vascular disease, which is the main cause of premature death for those with diabetes.As previous speakers indicated, diabetes is the most common cause of blindness and amputations in Ireland.  Foot problems are also common among diabetic admissions to hospitals.  A number of risks exist with regard to pregnancy and the chances of losing a baby or of an infant having a congenital abnormality are increased among those with diabetes.The majority of patients, particularly those with type 2 diabetes, are used to being dealt with in a primary care setting.  The developments in this regard show that if the proper environment was in place, those with type 1 diabetes could also be dealt with in such a setting and by hospital care teams.I am pleased that work on the framework is to proceed, particularly in light of current predictions and forecasts relating to diabetes.  For reasons relating to finance and the well-being of patients, the traditional model used to deal with diabetes cannot be maintained.  I am glad, therefore, that a new model is being devised by the Minister and Minister of State and their Department.  The delivery of integrated, responsive, long-term patient care will be provided in a multidisciplinary environment in partnership with patients.  In practical terms, this will require self-management support for patients, decision support and clinical guidelines for health care professionals and changes in the way services are provided generally.Many patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes do not require hospital admission.  Such conditions can be managed in primary and community care settings.  If the appropriate support is available and agreed protocols and pathways are followed, the majority of patients can be catered for.  The central message is that we need to increase awareness about the risk that lifestyle and behaviours have on health.  This is of particular relevance given the lifestyle choices of many people here which is adding significantly to the increase in the diagnosis of diabetes.People are inclined to demand more services and funding when they learn about increased diagnosis of various conditions.  Perhaps we should take a step back and consider the causes of the problem.  The Minister has taken the correct approach to this issue.  We need to be proactive and ensure members of the public are aware of the causes of diabetes, how the condition can be prevented and, in the event that it is too late, appropriate ways of dealing with it.Diabetic retinopathy screening is not the only screening programme being rolled out by the Minister.  I was pleased to learn recently that breast cancer and cervical cancer screening programmes are also to be rolled out.  I am particularly pleased that the Minister is extending the diabetic retinopathy screening programme to the west.  Those living in the west have been correctly critical that the region has been the last to benefit from previous programmes.  I am pleased to note that funding of €750,000 has been allocated to implementing the first phase of the screening service which will be offered to all those who have diabetes.  Approximately 30,000 people over the age of 12 years are registered with the programme in west Limerick and County Donegal, which includes my constituency.The Health Service Executive is moving into the implementation phase of the roll-out of the diabetic retinopathy screening programme to the remainder of the west region based on a national framework document published in November 2008.  One of the key features of the implementation phase is the development of governance and committee structures.  I have been informed that this process is under way.It has been decided recently that the primary, community and continuing care area of the HSE will assume responsibility for the governance of the implementation phase of the programme, now that the expert advisory group has completed the planning phase.  The current status of the recruitment process is that job descriptions and recruitment forms for the eight agreed staff are with the relevant local health office.  It is expected that these posts will be advertised shortly.  This is welcome news.While I understand no funding has been expended on equipment, I am pleased to learn funding continues to be available in 2009.  The formal procurement process for the ICT requirements of the programme will, I understand, commence in the coming months.  There does not appear to be alternative means of using existing resources to extend the programme.  The HSE has made some progress in commencing and writing specifications for the ICT system but final decisions are awaited on the details of the implementation and governance structure before a procurement team can be formally established.I welcome the efforts of the HSE and relevant Ministers in the diabetic retinopathy screening programme.  The proactive approach taken on this issue will be welcomed by patients across the country.
#MaryWallace	unknown-#MaryWallace-party	unknown-#MaryWallace-dob	unknown-#MaryWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	250	I welcome Deputies' valuable contributions to the debate on the development of a retinopathy screening programme.  I concur with the point made by many Deputies that the development of a screening programme is an important preventative measure in dealing with one of the most distressing complications arising from diabetes, namely diabetic retinopathy, which can result in blindness.I assure Deputy Reilly that the Health Service Executive is in the process of implementing the programme.  The publication by the HSE of a report on this issue in November 2008 was an important step.  Deputies O'Shea and Jan O'Sullivan asked whether the programme will definitely proceed.  Local structures are being established for the implementation of the programme and the HSE has given a commitment on what will be done in 2009.  This includes a recruitment process for eight posts and the roll-out of the programme to the west.  The Department has also asked the HSE to examine extending the programme.Deputy O'Connor is correct that the publication of the framework document marks an important step in establishing a high standard, quality assured programme for diabetic retinopathy screening.  The document presents a vision of a national population based programme of retinopathy screening, offered to all those with diabetes aged 12 years and over who are registered with the programme.  The programme will be delivered locally and provided to the highest internationally comparable standards.  It promises to be reliable, comprehensive and secure in compliance with data protection legislation.Deputy O'Shea referred to hospital retinopathy services.  While retinopathy screening is also provided in hospitals across the country, this service is different from the population based call and recall programme which will be established in the north west and west areas.  The Deputy also outlined his personal experience and asked whether it was necessary to test the general population.  The expert advice available to the Department is that systematic testing for diabetes in the general population should not be carried out.  However, the Department and HSE continue to evaluate this policy.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	251	That is bad advice.  A simple urine test is sufficient.
#MaryWallace	unknown-#MaryWallace-party	unknown-#MaryWallace-dob	unknown-#MaryWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	252	Funding of €750,000 has been allocated for 2009 and a recruitment process is in train.  Several speakers referred to podiatry, while others, including Deputy Perry, raised the issue of a diabetic register.  This matter is under consideration in the HSE which is working on details.  The issue of consultant diabetic posts was also raised.  The number of posts has been increased and figures show it has increased from 24 in 2003 to 38 in 2007.  While I do not have figures for 2008, a number of additional appointments have been made in the meantime.Deputy Reilly made an important point about lifestyle, including the prevalence of overweight and obesity.  As Minister of State with special responsibility for health promotion, I am committed to the development and implementation of various initiatives aimed at addressing the lifestyle conditions which can lead to the development of certain chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes.  I am aware that Deputies are concerned about this form of the condition as it accounts for 90% of cases in Ireland.  It is considered that one of the factors leading to the increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes is the rise in overweight and obesity in our population, an issue to which several Deputies alluded.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	253	What about the obesity task force?
#MaryWallace	unknown-#MaryWallace-party	unknown-#MaryWallace-dob	unknown-#MaryWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	254	Deputy Reilly indicated the obesity task force report featured 128 recommendations.  The report made 93 recommendations, most of which have been acted upon by the Department of Health and Children or Health Service Executive.  For example, we established an action plan for implementation across various Departments and agencies, including the Irish Heart Foundation.Deputy Reilly is concerned about the number of obese children.  In January this year, I established an intersectoral group comprising representatives of all stakeholders, including experts from Departments and agencies, the food industry and relevant NGOs to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the task force on obesity and to address general lifestyle issues impacting on chronic diseases.  The group has met monthly since its establishment and a third meeting will be held in March.  I expect it to issue its first progress report by Easter, which is a short timeframe.  In recent weeks, we have already found that a substantial number of the recommendations have been implemented.  Once the first progress report has been produced, we will consider the idea of a road map.  If, following the implementation of many of the recommendations, the problem of obesity persists, we will have to look beyond the task force report.First, however, we need to establish where we are with the 93 recommendations, and we hope to have that done by Easter.  Deputy Deenihan raised the related and important issue of physical activity.  The national physical activity guidelines are nearly completed and we expect to launch them shortly.  If we look in detail at the 93 recommendations, it is interesting to see there is a great deal happening across Government Departments.  Members mentioned earlier some other areas such as the food industry.  There is no doubt, as has been said in the debate today, that the impact of overweight and obesity on diabetes and other issues is obvious to all.  Therefore, we need to know exactly where we are with the task force report — which we will know by Easter — and where we are going with regard to making a real difference in this important area.I support the various comments of Members, including Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, who said that this debate will be a positive measure in moving forward on the important issue of diabetes and the underlying issues of overweight and obesity.  I know Deputy O'Sullivan welcomed the 2009 funding for the programme.  I also emphasise, as did Deputy O'Shea, the whole issue of prevention and the concerns we have in that area.Given the current financial constraints, I must acknowledge that there will be difficulties with the continued roll-out of the programme.  However, I welcome the HSE commitment to the screening programme, and I know it is endeavouring to identify what can be done to extend the programme within the existing resources.  Deputy Niall Blaney mentioned that he was pleased about developments in his part of the country.  It was decided to continue the roll-out of the national diabetic retinopathy screening service in the HSE west area because a population-based screening programme had already been established in the former North Western Health Board.  This will provide a template for the extension of the service to the whole country, which is a positive step.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	255	I am glad to have the opportunity to report to the House on the outcome of the Deloitte review of Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann.  I commissioned the review in mid-2008 to assist me in deciding on the funding to be allocated to the two State bus companies and to provide reassurance to the Government and the taxpayer that both companies are operating efficiently and effectively.The two companies receive significant capital and current funding from the Exchequer as compensation for the additional cost of providing loss-making but socially and economically necessary services.  Since 2002, we have invested more than €230 million in capital funding in replacement buses, additional buses and other facilities.  Over the same period, a total of over €660 million has been paid towards operational costs.  The two companies will receive more than €125 million in current funding support in 2009 and it is, therefore, important that we are satisfied this funding is being used efficiently and effectively.Since I commissioned the report, the financial positions of both companies have deteriorated significantly.  While both companies were in profit up to 2007, they now face major challenges to restore their finances in the face of declining passenger numbers.  Despite an increase in the Exchequer subvention to €313 million and a fare increase of 10%, the CIE Group is facing a projected operating loss in 2009 of up to €100 million.  In response, the companies are now considering a range of measures to reduce costs and have set out plans to address these difficulties.  It is imperative that both are restored to a good operational and sound financial condition as quickly as possible, and the Deloitte report should be seen as a supporting measure in this regard.Before dealing with the report itself I wish to set it in the context of my overall approach to the strengthening of bus services.  This comprises the transformation of bus services as set out in Smarter Travel, the new transport policy framework launched on 5 February; a move, as provided for in the Dublin Transport Authority Act, to public service contracts for the provision of funding for loss-making services; the reform of the Road Transport Act 1932 with regard to bus licensing; a continuing high level of funding for public service obligation, PSO, services and the introduction of a framework to facilitate the subvention of private bus operators; and ongoing investment in bus priority and traffic management measures to improve bus flow.This report is timely given the challenges facing the two companies and will assist them in developing and implementing their cost recovery plans.  It is also timely in view of the ambitious transformation agenda for bus services set out in Smarter Travel.  The report dovetails with the vision set out in the new transport policy framework for a more comprehensive, reliable and customer-focused bus service.  Together with the move to public service contracts, this report provides a good basis for Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann to pursue the transformation programme set out in Smarter Travel.  The fundamental challenge we face is to provide services that are more attractive and better aligned with the needs of the public at a lower cost.The report by the Deloitte-led consortium reaches a number of key conclusions.  With regard to the effectiveness of bus networks, it finds that the Dublin Bus network has not been realigned for a number of years and, as a result, has become overly complex, with a significant amount of service duplication.  It concludes that there is an opportunity, through complete network redesign, to create a simplified network offering improved services with improved cost efficiency.  The consultants undertook a review of one corridor in Dublin and on the basis of a conceptual redesign identified potential operational savings of approximately €2 million on that corridor alone.  A review of the other corridors on the same basis would also be likely to deliver significant efficiency gains.  The report concludes that the current fleet size in Dublin Bus is adequate to service current demand and that the need for fleet expansion should be reviewed in light of changes in demand and improvements in efficiency.  This conclusion reflects the growth in the capacity of the fleet in recent years.  Since 2000 the capacity of the fleet — seated and standing — has grown by more than 35%, yet passenger numbers are falling.  With regard to operational efficiency, the report concludes that in the case of Dublin Bus there is scope to adjust scheduling, in the interests of improved customer service, through changes in the timetable, in the practice of "out of service" running, and in the operation of routes to garages without apparent customer demand.At the risk of over-distilling the report, the headline recommendations are that bus services in Dublin be improved through redesign of the network to provide a similar or better level of service at a lower cost, principally by simplifying the network, eliminating duplication of services, creating even headways, providing additional direct routes into and out of the city and to key employment centres, improving scheduling effectiveness and improving bus priority.  The Deloitte report recommendations will not by themselves be sufficient to ensure the bus plays its full part in providing a sustainable transport system.  Action on three other fronts — reform of the bus licensing regime, the implementation of contracts for PSO services and increased bus priority — is also required.  Progress is being made in all these areas.  Government has approved the drafting of a Public Transport Regulation Bill to replace the Road Transport Act 1932.  Work is under way on the drafting of PSO contracts for the CIE companies, and significant investment is being made in traffic management measures, including bus priority.Overall the Deloitte report sets out a series of measures which are designed to enhance the role of buses and to make the CIE bus companies more customer focused.  The report sets out the kind of reform that I want to see in Dublin Bus.  I want a simple efficient bus network that serves more customers more efficiently, easy to understand routes and timetables, improved reliability and reduced bunching of buses, additional direct routes serving the city and major employment and retail centres and better co-ordination of services through the elimination of unnecessary duplication.I am not interested in cutting bus passenger numbers or making life difficult for bus users.  The bus is and should remain the backbone of public transport in Dublin for the foreseeable future but we need major bus reform and this report sets out how that can happen.  People are looking for a fast, efficient and reliable bus service so that they can leave their cars at home.  Public transport usage along routes provided with good quality bus corridors has increased by 40% over the period under discussion.  If people know when a bus will arrive and the time required to travel to their destinations, they will use public transport.The report clearly shows that we can grow bus passenger numbers by deploying buses where and when people need them.  It also supports the actions being taken by both companies to turn around their unsustainable financial positions.  I have asked the companies to present their plans for the implementation of the recommendations in the report and I expect to receive these shortly.  I look forward to the support of all parties in the implementation of these recommendations.In conclusion, I welcome the engagement by management and unions with the Labour Relations Commission.  It is important that they discuss their difficulties around a table in order to make progress together.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	256	The Deloitte report is excellent in many ways.  It identifies the key needs of consumers and taxpayers and points out the failure of Dublin Bus in particular to provide a 21st century service.  Reliability and efficiency are critical to bus travel.  A dynamic and modern service is needed for the 21st century, as is a commitment to change in the management of traffic in the capital city.  Quality bus corridors must be developed without breaks because otherwise they cannot be effective.  We also need to address the city's congestion points.More important, after 20 years of Fianna Fáil-led Governments, we need a change in thinking and policies in the Department of Transport.  Ten years ago the Department of the Taoiseach published a document on reforming the bus market in Dublin which clearly set out the need for competition.  While Minister for Transport, the late Seamus Brennan proposed to open 25% of the bus market in Dublin to competition and choice.  Ten years later, that report continues to gather dust in the Department of Transport and nothing has changed.  Notwithstanding the Dublin Transportation Authority Act 2008, we need further legislation to reform the Road Transport Act 1932 if we are to provide for proper competition.The Deloitte report notes the lack of confidence in bus transport in Dublin, even at the height of the boom.  Between 2005 and 2007, the number of bus commuters actually decreased and the speed of buses became progressively slower.  A fundamental reappraisal is needed and we need to go beyond the glossy brochures to make radical changes to the system.I have met managers of Dublin Bus on a number of occasions and found them to be dedicated and professional.  I held at least five meetings in various parts of the city to identify the problems arising with the bus service.  Dublin Bus representatives have attended all of these meetings and have promised change.  I accept that the management of Dublin Bus is committed to change.  Dublin Bus employees also attended the meetings, including in some cases drivers who were facing the prospect of unemployment.  I acknowledge the professionalism of the workers at Dublin Bus.  During the boom years, many people went to work for Dublin Bus and a considerable number of committed and dedicated people were concerned about losing their jobs.  I will not pursue that matter further while negotiations are ongoing with the Labour Relations Commission, other than to say I hope a successful conclusion is reached which allows the 290 staff in question to continue working at Dublin Bus and avoids the proposed mothballing of 120 buses.We need to change everything in terms of bus transport.  I ask the Minister to circulate the document prepared by the Dublin Transportation Office outlining the parts of the greater Dublin area which lack access to bus transport.  The Joint Committee on Transport should meet with Dublin Bus and private transport providers to ask them how they will go about providing proper bus services for people in these areas.  Other than school bus services, no opportunity is being given to private contractors in this city.  They have suitable buses but these are not being used.  It is clear in regard to those contractors who were given licences that Dublin Bus abused its privileged position to put them out of business.  That has been proven by various documents.  Dublin Bus and the Department of Transport need to be more dynamic.  The transport committee can make a real contribution in this regard.  Committees of these Houses are often regarded as talking shops but by bringing together all the important players with the Minister we could make progress on these issues.People coming into the city face a shortage of park and ride facilities.  Every day of the week, thousands of people drive into Dublin from rural areas because they have no access to public transport.  They do not even have the option of switching to a bus on the outskirts of the city.  Park and ride facilities must be provided at strategic locations across the greater Dublin area.  I am aware that the county managers of Kildare, Meath, Wicklow and Louth are considering this issue but we need to push it.  I am not aware of any official in the Department of Transport who takes responsibility for park and ride facilities but somebody needs to be put in charge of the matter.A lengthy process must be followed before a quality bus corridor can be established.  The Minister has proposed to assign a person to examine route proposals and hold public hearings on them before decisions are made.  We must make it simple to establish a corridor even if that requires fast tracking the decision-making process.The Deloitte report identified the need for changes to operational practices within Dublin Bus.  The report, under the heading summary recommendations on page 21 states:The above programme of work represents fundamental change for the company.  It should be treated as a major change and transformation programme.That is what is needed now.  This is part of the way forward.  It is only through working together that we, Members of the Oireachtas, including Ministers and officials from the Department of Transport, in putting pressure on the unions and management of Dublin Bus will ensure that change will be achieved.The report states that €2 million can be saved through the reorganisation of bus routes in Finglas.  Obviously, changes in work practices will also be required.  Given there are on average 14 major routes a great deal more money could be saved.  While a saving of €2 million might not be possible on all routes, it is possible to achieve savings of at least €20 million through the reorganisation of these routes.  We can no longer allow a situation whereby buses are out of service.  Some 20% of the time there is no one on our buses but the driver, which makes no sense.  It is a nonsense and a complete and utter waste of resources.  We need to re-examine work practices and to ensure this is not allowed to continue.  While bus drivers have rights — I support them 100% — they should not use an out of service bus when going for their coffee break or whatever.  They should use their car or other means to do so.  That is a fundamental issue.Perhaps the Acting Chairman would indicate at this stage how much time I have left.

The bunching of buses, whereby when one is waiting for a bus up to three come together, was mentioned yesterday.  This issue can be addressed by Dublin Bus ensuring that buses run at 20 or 30 minute intervals.  This practice is an absolute waste of resources which frustrates everybody in the process.  We must create confidence in bus services.I recently visited Nantes in France and studied the transport system there.  I was so impressed by it that I went back for a second look.  The transport system there is totally integrated.  It was stated a couple of years ago in The Times magazine that the best quality of life was to be found in Nantes.  The reason for this is its integrated public transport system.  Key to that is the provision of a modern bus system.  The decision was taken in Nantes to halve the volume of traffic coming into the city.  They did this by providing two-lane rather than four-lane highways and a quality bus corridor which receives priority and is served by modern buses which have Internet access.  This allows people travelling to work in the centre of the city to work while on the bus.  We need to think outside the box and to encourage more people to use buses.Traffic congestion is an issue for us.  Let us make more exciting and more rewarding people's experience of travel by bus.  I believe we should be fast-tracking issues such as Internet access which make travel by bus worthwhile.  People will be encouraged to use buses if perhaps they can send e-mails while travelling to work, be assured they will reach their destinations on time and will not have to sit for hours in traffic.It is almost 12 years since I was first elected to Seanad Éireann.  While previously I could get from home to Leinster House within an hour, it now takes me almost an hour and a half or an hour and three-quarters to get here.  This has changed in recent weeks as a result of the recession.  While An Taisce is to be congratulated on its Green Schools project, traffic flows much more freely when the schools are closed.  I accept our climate does not always facilitate children walking to school.  However, we need to fast-track schools' initiatives in regard to transport.  We should insist that schools put in place transport plans which could be reviewed by the Department of Transport.  Issues such as how to organise school time in the context of what does and does not work could be considered.  Unless changes are made, everything will remain the same.Currently, the taxpayer is paying for everything and there is a monopoly in Dublin in terms of bus transport.  At the height of the boom, people chose to travel by car rather than bus, which did not add up.  Perhaps the Acting Chairman would again indicate how much time I have remaining.

We want a dynamic bus service in Dublin; we want competition and we want Dublin Bus to request, as it does in respect of school transport, assistance in regard to new routes and so on from private service providers.  Dublin Bus has said that this is a matter for the new Dublin Transport Authority.  It is not a matter for that body but for Dublin Bus.  While I acknowledge fully the professionalism and commitment of Dublin Bus, the current system is not working.  It does not appear as though Dublin Bus wants to grasp this nettle.  However, unless and until they do, the current situation, with which nobody is happy, will continue.

However, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, and his Green Party colleagues have been disgracefully disingenuous in many of their public comments on the Deloitte report and have plainly decided to use this new report as a stick with which to beat Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann.What is worse is that they are also attempting to use the Deloitte report as a smokescreen to cover up their appalling record on funding, maintaining and protecting public transport facilities.  While Deloitte has provided an interesting analysis of potential changes to Dublin Bus, the critical issue is that the Fianna Fáil-Green Government is intent on overseeing a massive programme of cutbacks to bus services across Ireland.The scale of the cutbacks currently proposed for Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann represent an unprecedented attack on public transport services and structures.  Bus Éireann has announced that approximately 300 jobs will be lost and 150 buses will be cut from its fleet.  It has now been confirmed that key services to be withdrawn include routes from Galway to Tralee, Galway to Lennane and Athlone to Cork.  There will also be a reduction in services on the Dublin to Ardcath, Kilkee to Ennis, Kildysert to Shannon and Tuam to Athlone routes, a reduction in euro-line services between Rosslare and Cork-Waterford and London and Sligo and a reduction in the Lough Derg district service, the Sligo town service and the Sligo-Dublin to Drumsna service.At a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport last week the CEO of Bus Éireann, Mr. Tim Hayes, told members that the axing of 150 buses includes the loss of 25 buses in Dublin, 30 in Cork, 15 in Waterford, four in Tralee, 15 in Galway, three in Athlone, four in Sligo, one in Ballina and 12 in Dundalk.  At least 120 buses are to be removed from the Dublin Bus fleet with a loss of 290 jobs.  In a briefing by Dublin Bus last week, it was confirmed that the cross city No. 172 route will be completely axed and that the 56A which runs from the city centre to Tallaght will also be cut.  It is planned that this service will now run between Crumlin and Tallaght only.Bus frequencies will also rise from on average every ten to 15 minutes to on average every 12 to 17 minutes.  Dublin Bus stated that the full programme of cuts has not yet been finalised and that there will be further revisions to bus services and frequencies in the greater Dublin area in the coming months.  However, further details are emerging on the impact of other specific routes throughout the Dublin Bus network, which starkly highlights the savage nature of the programme of public transport cutbacks.  It has been reported that routes 1, 2, 3, 19, 13, 13A, 7, 11, 11A, 45, 121 and 122 may have services cut by up to 10%.  Dozens of peak time eurobuses may also be withdrawn from the Harristown, Phibsboro, Conyngham Road, Summerhill and Clontarf garages.  These buses provide a critical backup service on routes throughout the city during morning and evening rush hours.Heavily patronised commuter routes such as the 51, 51D, 49, 15, 65 and 77 routes may now have reduced frequencies at peak times.  When the series of cutbacks was first announced, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, promised to protect peak time services as a matter of priority.  However, the withdrawal of eurobus services is at odds with the Minister's worthless commitment earlier on to protect commuters and workers who rely on the bus to get to work or school at critical morning and evening peak times.Last week, on RTE radio residents of Ballyfermot expressed their devastation at the prospect of a reduced bus service.  Ballyfermot commuters and workers have no other public transport option, given they have no access to the Luas, the DART or metro services.  The same arguments apply for proposed cuts in bus services in the Finglas area, in Ballymun and in Whitehall.  Locals in Ballyfermot highlighted how the reduction in some services, for example the 206 route, will leave local seniors, especially, bereft of a reliable and regular bus service.The nitelink service has also been cancelled from Monday to Thursday and the last weekend nitelink buses will now leave at 3 a.m. instead of 4.30 a.m. as has been the case.  This decision will have an especially negative effect on city centre pubs and clubs.  The patrons of such venues rely on public transport and these venues are already under severe financial pressure given the current economic circumstances.One newspaper estimated that as many as 1,000 scheduled journeys will be lost because of the cutbacks.  The cutbacks will devastate urban and rural communities throughout Ireland and will disproportionately hammer low income communities and families, senior citizens, children of school-going age and other vulnerable citizens who are totally reliant on the bus service.The loss of approximately 600 jobs at both companies has had a similarly devastating effect on the community of bus drivers in both companies.  My colleague, Deputy Tommy Broughan, has been inundated with calls from young bus men and women who were shocked and shattered to be handed their notice and told they are due to finish up on 28 February.  Many of these young workers were only taken on in the past year or two.  Many had left other secure employment, because they believed they had a long-term future at Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann.  Most have described to me and to my colleagues the terror they are experiencing at being unable to pay the mortgage or provide for the family now that they face unemployment in these bleak economic times.At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport, Deputy Tommy Broughan asked Mr. Joe Meagher of Dublin Bus and Mr. Tim Hayes of Bus Éireann why a voluntary redundancy scheme had not first been introduced at both companies and why new drivers were still being recruited last year, when it was clear that 2009 would be a very difficult financial year for both companies.  A voluntary severance scheme should have been considered.In essence these cutbacks make no sense socially, economically or environmentally.  They go against any efforts to get the economy back on track as they will reduce worker mobility, the attractiveness of the State for investment and the economy's competitiveness.  Cutbacks of this magnitude are also totally at odds with national transport, environmental and climate change policies of moving consumers out of cars and into public transport to reduce ever-increasing transport greenhouse gas emissions.The Labour Party has long recognised the critical role of buses in the Irish public transport system.  We have often said that buses remain the workhorse of that system.  Even the most optimistic forecasts do not envisage most of the Transport 21 projects coming on stream until after 2014.  In a departmental briefing last year, following the 2009 budget, it appeared that metro west, the Lucan Luas and the red and green line Luas link-up projects had been effectively completely abandoned by the Government.  There are also ongoing question marks over the Government's commitment to the completion of the Navan rail line, the western rail corridor and the light rail systems for Cork, Galway and Limerick.  Now, we are told by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, that all uncompleted public transport projects, apart from metro north, appear to be under grave threat of extinction.  With Transport 21 in disarray, why are the Minister and his Green Party colleagues set on decimating one of our critical remaining networks of public transport services throughout the country, namely, the bus services?  It is clear that even if the bulk of Transport 21 is completed, only buses can provide the core public transport services for commuters and workers in the interim period between now and then, that is presuming the programme is ever completed.  Buses are the fastest, easiest, cheapest and most sustainable option for getting Dublin and the rest of the country moving and for tackling congestion and car dependence.The Labour Party developed a land mark bus policy before the last general election, entitled Getting Dublin Moving.  The policy has buses at its core.  The Labour Party's long-standing policy on bus transport includes immediately adding 500 new buses to the Dublin Bus fleet; developing bus rapid transport services on key routes in Cork city and environs; fast-tracking park and ride facilities and express bus services for Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick; introducing real-time information at bus stops; implementing a €1 adult fare and a 50 cent fare for children in the greater Dublin area; replacing the travel pass with a new freedom card that would provide cheaper fares and more integration for commuters; and maintaining the Bus Éireann national network which services smaller towns and villages throughout Ireland.The Labour Party has also long campaigned for the enhancement of bus infrastructure throughout the country.  There has been some valuable advancement in the quality bus corridor network in Dublin and the green routes bus corridors in Limerick and Cork.  However, the Labour Party believes we must go much further in this regard and ensure the completion of the planned Dublin Bus quality corridors network and that the Limerick and Cork green route bus corridors should be given priority.  Expansion of the existing 13 quality bus corridors, QBCs, in Dublin must be given effect now to include the additional radial and orbital QBC projects that the quality bus network office has long proposed.On account of the Labour Party's long-standing commitment to bus transport and given the Minister's ongoing lethargy in implementing key bus policies, such as the reform of the 1932 bus licensing law, I welcome the publication of the Deloitte review of the cost and efficiency of Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann.  Undoubtedly, there are worthy proposals in the review.  However, many of these proposals were already in the pipeline and were obvious to anyone with even a cursory knowledge of how the bus network operates.  For example, the Labour Party has long advocated the introduction of one of the key proposals in the Deloitte review regarding real-time information systems.Other valuable suggestions are contained in the document, such as the introduction of a simplified network with more co-ordinated services along core routes, the provision of more direct services to key centres of population, information campaigns by both companies, timetable re-design and the introduction of immediate running times to improve reliability and reduce the potential for the bunching of buses.  The report also recommends key new technology systems such as automatic vehicle location, AVL, systems and the linking of AVL information to the traffic light management systems in Dublin, to provide further priority for buses.The Minister and his predecessors have failed to act on the bus market in general.  There have been many threats, promises and announcements of the Minister's intention to act but he has failed to do so.  Now, in a cost-cutting exercise he is squeezing the budgets of the two bus companies.  He does not seem to recognise that lessons can be learned from every other European capital.  The cities that have good public transport systems subvent the costs of the system properly.  The Green Party has been preaching this for years yet it will not take on board that lesson in government.  The average subvention rate for bus services across Europe is 50%.  Our rate is abysmally low.  The lesson is clear; it is not possible to provide public transport services on the cheap.If we want the country to be competitive and facilitate people's movement in an efficient manner and reduce our carbon footprint, the only solution is quality public transport.  That is not possible unless the Government funds it adequately.  This Minister and his predecessors have unfortunately failed to learn that lesson.

We also need to dispel the myth that there has been a massive cutback in funding to Dublin Bus.  The funding increased marginally last year but Dublin Bus faces a crisis of reduced passenger numbers, fewer people working and shopping.  To respond to that crisis it needs to reform itself radically and within a matter of months.  I am not convinced that senior management in Dublin Bus is moving fast or far enough to make these changes happen.We all have our stories and sides to those stories about bus services, but there is also a comprehensive 118 page report telling us what needs to happen.  I agree with most of its recommendations.  John Lynch, the chairman of CIE, needs to give us an implementation plan with timelines for the changes, within a matter of weeks.  Bus Éireann is relatively well managed.  It runs a tight ship but could respond better to the needs of users, whether in the towns around Cork city or other parts of the country.  I am pleased, however, that it has made many strides in recent years to reform its services.Dublin Bus needs to do more work to meet the needs of the travelling public in the 21st century.  Above all, the Dublin Bus brand needs to be renewed to attract more people onto the buses.  There was a period during the height of the economic boom when Dublin Bus attracted many new users, such as people from the immigrant population who came here to work, but in recent months buses are carrying fewer people and therefore have less income.  There needs to be a transformation.  Dublin Bus needs to get more people out of their cars and onto buses and to do that it must offer a reliable, efficient, punctual service.While much of this must come from Dublin Bus there is also an onus on local authorities.  Dublin City Council particularly should provide the bus company with the priority it needs.  Limerick city and county councils need to give the political leadership to provide bus priority on those routes.  I am saddened that my colleagues in the Fine Gael Party do not allow buses the priority they deserve in Limerick and other cities.  Deputies and councillors are not moving fast enough with change.

While this is not as easy to do as it might be with a Luas vehicle, Dublin City Council needs to give more priority to buses when it programmes traffic lights.We also need to put in place physical measures.  The bus gate in College Green is not a gate but simply a way to give buses their fair share of road space, by taking cars off the green.  It is crazy in 2009 to have four lanes of car traffic going through College Green while buses are stuck behind cars with one occupant.  It is crazy that it can take 40 minutes for a bus to get from Parnell Square to Stephen's Green.  One will not get on a bus if a short journey takes that long, one will walk or take the car because one can do other business that way.  We need leadership from all parties in the Chamber to make that bus gate happen.  That is up to the Fine Gael and Labour Deputies and councillors on Dublin City Council.

Simple things, such as mapping, need to be transformed.  The Dublin Bus map is not the kind one would carry around in one's jacket pocket.  It is difficult enough to open the map in the Dáil Chamber so one can imagine what it is like on a windy Friday morning trying to work out how to get from A to B and back.  We need pocket-sized maps, such as those issued in London that enable one to work out quickly what bus to get.  People do not go to websites or maps to choose their buses, they ask other people.  That is a failure on the part of Dublin Bus to communicate the information about how to get from A to B.Fares need to be simplified and there should be easier ways to use the bus.  The Labour Party spokesperson mentioned a €1 fare, or multiples of that, in order that one does not have to wait two or three minutes for people to take change out of their pockets while boarding a bus.  The dwell time at Luas stops is 20 seconds.  It should be the same for buses.  That would speed them up.  There should be fewer bus stops, perhaps every 300 or 400 metres instead of every 200 metres.Electronic ticketing is the real breakthrough that should happen sooner rather than later.  In London one can get a purse card free in a tube station.  One can top it up and use it on the Underground or on the bus, transferring effortlessly from one to the other.  In Dublin one can get a Luas card but it does not work on buses, or a travel 90 card from Dublin Bus, which does not work on the Luas.  No wonder people are sticking to their cars and not jumping onto the bus.  Dublin Bus will claim it needs the back office support.  We have waited 15 years for this to happen.  It is not rocket science to give people a card they can use on private or public buses, the Luas or a train.  It should happen now, and if it does not happen within the next six months, people should resign or heads should roll.  These simple changes — simpler fares, better mapping and ticketing — would transform the bus service. Very few bus shelters in the centre of Dublin have maps.  There is a map at every Luas stop.  Almost every other form of transport shows one how to get from A to B and back.  These changes need to happen soon.I have talked about the efficiency measures required to transform Dublin Bus, such as moving buses more quickly through College Green.  We need better routing that does not go around the world and back again.  I would like to straighten the 46A route, which is the pride of the fleet in many respects.  The Deloitte report shows how the Finglas routes could be transformed to provide a reliable service to customers.  There are unexpected dips in the 46A service when drivers go off duty.  Problems arise every week at the same time.We want buses to go every ten minutes on Saturdays, Fridays or Thursday evenings.  We need that kind of reliability.  While the company has made many strides over recent years to transform its service, it needs to go the extra mile to get people out of their cars and make them see the Dublin Bus brand as a watchword for reliability.  I believe it will do so.  Change has to happen at the top.  One should be able to set one's watch by the arrival times of buses.  Simple mechanisms should be in place to allow people to hop on and off buses using the same bus ticket or card.  People want it to be easier to transfer between buses.The report mentions other improvements that are needed.  It suggests that there should be less empty running of buses.  I am aware that buses on the 4A and 4B routes run empty between Harristown and Blackrock.  Why is the Donnybrook depot not used in some of those cases?  While these may seem like simple suggestions, it is not always easy to manage.  A little more desk work is required to make things happen to transform the company.  Buses have an important role in tacking climate change and traffic congestion.  If the right initiative comes from the top in Dublin Bus, we will truly be able to meet the needs of the travelling public of the 21st century.

#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	280	I am used to not having much speaking time.  I represent a constituency in the commuter belt.  Dublin Bus and the Dublin Transport Authority, when it is fully established, will have responsibility for transport services in part of my constituency.  One of the major routes between my constituency and Dublin city centre, the N81, goes through Tallaght, which is in the Acting Chairman's constituency.  If there were more bus routes on the N81, we would be able to get more buses to stop in Tallaght.I was interested to hear Deputy Cuffe's remarks.  It sounded like an application for the position of chief executive officer of the Dublin Transport Authority.  There was little to argue with in much of what he said about the need to establish an integrated transport system.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party might be in control of Dublin City Council, Limerick City Council and other councils, but I am not sure that we are causing all the problems.  I cannot say whether that is the case.The first recommendation in the Deloitte report involves the redesign of Dublin's public transport network on the basis of recent demographics.  It is extraordinary that the needs of commuter towns that have recently expanded have not been surveyed for many years.  New routes are needed on major commuter arteries to link rural towns and commuter areas.  I have raised this issue on many occasions, but I have not received an adequate response.  No mechanism is in place to modify the delivery of public services according to population needs in places like County Wicklow.  Service reductions have led to the overcrowding of vital commuter buses.  We were promised that six-carriage trains would be provided, but there are just four carriages on the trains that are currently in service.If the Government proceeds with the proposed cuts in buses and drivers and keeps new buses parked up, it will be a taking a minimalist approach to achieving cost efficiencies in Bus Éireann.  When I table parliamentary questions on the Government's strategy for delivering bus services to rural towns, I am regularly informed that the Minister does not have official responsibility for sanctioning bus routes.  I am told instead that it is an operational matter for Bus Éireann.  That is an extraordinary devolution of powers.  When a DART arrives into Greystones station, a Dublin Bus commuter bus often pulls out of the station before people have time to get on it.  Dublin Bus has told me I should raise this matter with Iarnród Éireann, but I suggest that it is far easier to readjust a bus timetable than a railway service on a single line track, such as that between Dublin and Rosslare.  It is impossible to rearrange the schedule, which is tightly organised as things stand.  The rescheduling of Dublin Bus services, which should be a simple operational matter, could de done if people were willing to do it.  We do not have to wait for the Dublin Transport Authority to be established for such simple problems can be solved.Other recommendations in the Deloitte report relate to issues like marketing and the simplification of timetables.  When I was in a city in Sweden last summer, I was able to understand a map depicting all the bus routes in the city even though I do not understand the Swedish language.  The map made everything clear — the bus and tram lines, the service times and the fares.  It should be possible to produce a simple tourist card explaining Dublin's public transport system in terms that are easy to understand.The problem is that the system is not as reliable it should be.  The space needed for bus services is congested because too many people prefer to use their cars.  People do not use the bus because it is no quicker than a car.  It is an example of the chicken and egg problem.  If we do not put in place a comprehensive transport management plan for the city and its surrounds, we will not entice people out of their cars and into public transport.  If we take buses out of service, we will certainly not transmit the right message.We need to improve the marketing of public transport services.  Mechanisms will have to be put in place to make it much more attractive for people to be in a bus, a tram or a train than in a car.  The initial pain that people might suffer will soon ease.  European cities of a similar size to Dublin do not have the same levels of traffic congestion.  Public transport is used because it is more attractive.This report is long overdue.  My main concern is that representations about the service problems in County Wicklow, which we have known about for many years, are being ignored.  Public transport plays a key role in reducing our carbon liabilities.  The Minister for Transport needs to make a major financial commitment to public transport, particularly buses.  He should be involved in the drawing up of short-term and long-term strategies.  We cannot wait for the establishment of the Dublin Transport Authority, even though that will be welcome.  I warn the Minister that he needs to work to ensure the authority does not become a "HSE on wheels", as someone has suggested it will be.  Officials from the authority should have to attend meetings of the relevant Oireachtas committee more than once a year to make the case for the authority's funding.  That case should be based on what the authority has achieved in the preceding six or 12 months and what it will do in the following six or 12 months.  Officials from all authorities of this nature should have to regularly justify the continued existence of such bodies.When an bord snip nua finishes its work, perhaps Mr. McCarthy will recommend that all the State boards that will remain in place after the process of consolidation has been completed should have to undertake the task I have mentioned.  Public officials from such authorities should have to a duty to justify their budgets in front of committees established by this House.  However, that does not mean more money will have to be spent on Dublin Bus.  It means better value for money should be achieved.It is simple.  People have to be held accountable.  It is welcome that the Dublin Transport Authority is being established, but it has to be accountable for what it achieves from its budget.  Its simple goal should be to get more people out of their cars and into public transport.  The amount of time it takes to commute into the city from outside the city, or even within the city, needs to be reduced.  That is a simple goal.  That should be what we are trying to achieve.  Any attempt to blame people will not work.  We have to try to work this out.  The present scenario does not make sense.  Some 90% of people will use public transport if it is attractive to them.  When we go on holiday, we use public transport all the time.  We do not use cars when we go on holiday to urban areas, as it is not cost effective to bring them with us or to hire them when we are there.I hope there is an overhaul of public transport services in my constituency as a result of this report.  It is important.  Commuter towns suffer when people have to get into their cars at 6 a.m. to make it into work by 8 a.m. or 9 a.m.  If one is not on the N11 at Kilmacanogue by 6.50 a.m., one might as well wait until 9 a.m.  As I have said all I need to say, I will not use the rest of the time that is available to me.  Perhaps the Acting Chairman would like me to make representations on behalf of Tallaght.

In spite of all the difficulties we have seen, I would not be keen to see the concept of compulsory redundancies brought into any branch of the public service.  However, maximum efficiency from limited resources is required, given the current background.I am happy to contribute to this debate, because I am a regular user of the Nos. 10, 30, 41E, 59 and 92 buses services of Dublin Bus when I am in the city.  I usually use them in combination with some other form of transport.  I have been an occasional user of Bus Éireann services such as those from Tipperary, Waterford, Wexford, Durrow, Cashel, Sligo, Bundoran, Killarney, Kenmare, Limerick, Listowel, Ennis and Galway.  There is a conception that if someone becomes an office holder, he or she never sees public transport for the duration of his or her time in office.  I have hardly changed my habits at all since I became a Minister of State, except that I must travel around the country much more now.

I will only get into the car if the answer is "No" for various practical reasons.  This applies equally to journeys between Tipperary and Dublin, journeys within Dublin on sitting days, or attendance at events around the country.As I use public transport so much, I greatly appreciate the public service provided, and the skill, responsibility, courtesy and friendliness of drivers who improve the quality of environment, the quality of life and choice for all of us.  Dublin has a fairly modern bus fleet, which compares well with the fleets in many other cities in other countries.  I regard the fares as very reasonable.  We finished last night at about 10.45 p.m., following which I took the DART and then took a bus.  I paid €1.60 for a three mile journey, where one would normally pay €8 or €10 for a taxi over the same distance.  There has been a significant price increase this year of about 10%, but bus fares are still very reasonable value.There were arguments in other times about the level of subsidy compared to other cities, but everyone must accept that the public finances and the capacity of the taxpayer are very constrained at the moment.  We require the best use of limited resources, and it is not tenable to allow an escalation of subsidies at a time when demand is tending to fall.Buses also provide a social service.  During the day, they are mainly occupied by pensioners who travel free of charge who may either not be able to drive for health or other reasons, or who cannot afford to run a car.  There are morning and late afternoon concessionary fares for students.  Bus Éireann contributes to the mobility that is possible with the free pass, and this covers many parts of the country that are not reached by trains.  I would like to see Bus Éireann provide services within our larger towns, and I am thinking particularly of Clonmel in this respect.  I appreciate that this might have to wait until better times, but with the growth of towns in the 20,000 to 30,000 population range, it needs to be examined.We are probably moving towards congestion charges.  All forms of tolls, especially those near cities such as the East-Link bridge or the Dublin Port Tunnel, represent a form of such charges.  However, there should be concessionary fares for people who use them every day.  For ferry services in the west of Scotland, locals often make 20 journeys in one month and they pay a fraction of the cost of a tourist who uses it once or twice.Frequency, reliability and quality are the particular characteristics of the Luas, and this is an ideal rarely achieved by other forms of public transport, although there are attempts to move in this direction.  One could predict how long it takes to get to a particular destination.  One does not have to wait for more than a limited period of time, unless it is very early in the morning or very late at night.  It is no surprise that the Luas operates without subsidy, in spite of its considerable capital cost.  The QBCs, which are largely open to taxis as well, make a very good contribution.  They are more developed in Dublin than they are in other cities, although other cities are beginning to adopt them.  One of the recommendations of the report is to provide boards which inform passengers when the next bus is arriving.Leinster House is part of the central administrative district, and it is to be noted how much public transport has improved around here.  This is relevant to matters which fall within the responsibility of the OPW and the Commission of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  How many parking spaces are needed, given the planning permission which requires a restoration of Leinster Lawn?  There is a bus stop outside Kildare Street, which is well connected with Heuston Station.  If one is going in the other direction, one must go to Dawson Street.  There are also buses that stop in Merrion Square, while the Luas is on the other side of St. Stephen's Green.  There are rail commuter services from Pearse Station.  There is no justification for people working in the House — be they Deputies, Senators, or staff — not to get here some of the time using public transport.  For various reasons, all of us need to use cars some of the time.A final issue is competition and private operators.  I have no difficulty with the fact that public transport is primarily a public service, although private operators can supplement and add to that service.  I agree with the point opposite on the need to co-ordinate better ticketing and timetables.  Once when I went to the famous Galway races from Tipperary I got a train from Ennis, which arrived at 1.25 p.m. and the Bus Éireann bus due to go to Galway at the same time was not scheduled to wait for the train.  Luckily the bus was a few minutes late.  Better co-ordination would be desirable.  Co-ordination is good but the provision of the services and the investment in the services matters.  I was struck by the uncomplimentary phrase that we do not want a HSE on wheels, and I know what the Deputy who said that was getting at.
#MichaelKennedy	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-party	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-dob	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	285	I very much welcome the opportunity to speak on this report.  I am delighted Dublin Bus has postponed the industrial dispute that was to take place on Saturday.  This weekend sees one of the city's biggest events; in addition to the Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis, the Ireland v. England rugby match will bring a considerable number of visitors and tourists.  At this stage in our public finances, when this year we will borrow over €18 billion, the public demands and expects us to have efficiencies in all our services.  I have no doubt the people who use the bus service are equally seeking that efficiency and high level of service.  In Dublin North, one of the fastest growing regions in the country, if not in Europe, those who use the bus want to get to their workplaces in a timely and efficient manner and want to get home in the evening.  Any bus service provider, whether Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann or the private operators, must put the customer first.  This report highlights that aspect, namely that it is all about giving the customers what they want — a fast, efficient service at a reasonable cost.  In the context of the cost to the State, €313 million of Government subvention, the public has a right to demand efficiencies and service.We need to encourage more people to use public transport.  Providing a good bus service is one way we will get people to leave their cars at home.  Unfortunately, I do not have the luxury of a good public bus service and that is one of the reasons I am a bit envious of the Acting Chairman, Deputy O'Connor, who has the Luas service in Tallaght and his south side colleagues who have a very good DART service.  We very much look forward to metro north coming out to Swords so Deputy O'Dowd and I can, perhaps, leave our cars on the perimeter of the M1 in Swords and travel in comfort in 20 minutes into town.  The public demands that we provide those services and if we fail to deliver an efficient bus service it is guaranteed that people will continue to use their cars.  In the long term that is not sustainable.The fact that this report has highlighted a number of inefficiencies and duplications is indicative.  There is duplication in many areas.  I noticed a letter in The Irish Times last Saturday week in which a person commented on the fact that five 46A buses from the Dún Laoghaire area were queued up behind each other on Merrion Square.  Around 6 p.m. last Sunday I was driving back from St. Vincent’s Hospital and on Clare Street there were two 46As.  Of the five buses mentioned in the letter, two had a reasonable number of passengers on board and three had no passengers.  This is the challenge Dublin Bus has to provide a service that is efficient but not duplicated, particularly when there are growing population areas.In my area of Dublin North a large number of new estates have no bus service or a less than satisfactory service.  There is a challenge for Dublin Bus to tap into that market.  It is a concern that Dublin Bus passenger numbers are down for last year.  That is very disappointing.  I throw out the challenge to Dublin Bus management to examine areas where it has a captive audience and a growing market.  All over Dublin North, south Meath, Kildare and Wicklow there are areas where it can tap in and increase its passenger numbers and revenue, which it badly needs.  I challenge Dublin Bus to examine the areas of duplication and insufficient service.The management of Bus Éireann and particularly Dublin Bus have improved but the old political maxim the Acting Chairman and I were used to, "A lot done; more to do", is very relevant.  Both companies should examine the areas where the service is not up to scratch because if they provide the service they will get people to use the bus.  This report has highlighted many areas of duplication and mentions the Finglas route.  I am slightly disappointed it did not pick many other routes.  I hope the management of Dublin Bus will look inward and see if five buses could be reduced to two with the supplementation of a Nipper bus service from the different estates in more areas than just Finglas.  In my area the concept of providing Nipper bus services to Swords, Skerries, Balbriggan or wherever would encourage people to use Dublin Bus and go to mainline trains and the DART service.The report talks about bunching, which I mentioned regarding the 46A.  Nothing is more frustrating for a passenger.  The e-mails and other communications I receive from people when they complain about the service say they see four or five buses coming one after another and then no bus for half an hour or longer.  The management must examine that situation and come up with solutions.  Providing more buses is not necessarily the answer.  The report indicated that fewer buses, if the service is integrated properly, can supply a better service.  Dublin Bus can achieve a much better result and give a better service with the existing number of buses.  The structures have been improving but I still believe there is much opportunity for the company to bring about new routes and new integration, particularly with the Nipper bus service from the outer estates into the core village areas.  Such integration can allow the company to achieve a major increase in passenger numbers and will allow the company to provide the service which its passengers demand.At a recent meetings of the Joint Committee on Transport I referred to Dublin Bus competing with Luas and other train services.  Nobody in his or her right mind will use an unreliable bus service when there is an almost guaranteed journey time with a train, which generally will turn up on time and arrive at its destination on time.  This is part of the challenge facing Dublin Bus.  It should not be competing where it cannot win but rather where it does not have opposition and where there are the passenger numbers.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	287	This has been an interesting debate judging by the extracts I saw on the monitor.  While we may differ on the approach to be taken we are all agreed on the fundamental importance of a good bus service as part of a well functioning public transport system.This Deloitte report, of itself, will not solve all of the problems.  It is an interesting report which, when we get the implementation plans from Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann, will help us considerably in terms of finding a way forward.  However, nobody is putting it forward as the one and only solution to all of the problems.Action is being taken on other fronts.  There are three actions which are fundamental to providing a good sustainable service into the future, namely, reform of the bus licensing regime, implementation of PSO contracts and increased bus priority.We have been speaking for a long time about the need for reform of the bus licensing regime.  The existing legislation is rather dated.  In the view of many, it is not geared for the challenges of today.  The main legislation is the 1932 Act which was amended by the 1958 Act.  It is recognised by everyone that if we are to provide a good modern service, the legislative framework needs to be updated and changed.  That is happening.The programme for Government recognised this and outlined a number of priorities.  The first of these was a commitment to expedite the establishment of the Dublin Transport Authority, which has been progressed last year with the enactment of the 2008 Act.  That Act establishes a new contractual structure relating to the provision of subvented bus services in the Dublin area.  It also allows private sector interests to compete for the grant of contracts to provide funded bus services.  That is new.  We have been talking about doing something like that for many years.  There have been a number of false dawns in that regard and different views on what was needed among different shades in the political spectrum, but action is being taken.  The DTA Bill has been enacted and there will be much progress on that as the months go by.The programme for Government also includes a commitment to improve bus services by reforming the bus licensing provisions of the 1932 Act to provide a level playing field for all participants, both public and private.  The Government has recently approved the drafting of a public transport regulation Bill which will contain proposals for a new regime updating the Road Transport Act 1932.  It is envisaged that the new structure will apply in respect of all commercial bus services, including those provided by Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus.That Bill will encompass provisions relating to the subvented bus market outside the Dublin area that will be consistent with the new EU Regulation No. 1370/2007 on public service obligations, PSOs, which comes into force in December next.  The framework will be broadly similar to that used in the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008.  It is intended that responsibility for bus licensing and public transport service contracts nationwide be assigned to the DTA under the Bill, which will be renamed as the national transport authority, given its national focus on these matters.The Bill is being worked on and should be published and debated here in a couple of months.  If we are lucky, we might start the debate before the summer recess.  Often legislation takes longer coming through the system than I envisage but all going well it should be before the House before the summer.The move to formal contracts with Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann relating to the compensation they get from the Exchequer towards the additional cost of loss making services provides an opportunity to specify more clearly the scale and quality of services to be provided.  The contracts will be set out in far greater detail in future.Reference was made to bus priority.  While much has happened in recent years with the provision of bus lanes, etc., which are great at getting the buses from the suburbs in towards the city, it is accepted that there are many problems in the inner city due to particular pinch points.  A bus can travel rapidly in from the suburbs but the last 500 yards can end up taking quite a time, and action will be taken on that.  There is an allocation this year of €70 million in Exchequer funding for traffic management measures, including bus priority, €50 million of which is available for the Dublin area, and we will see much progress in that regard.  The College Green bus gate has started its public consultation phase with city council.  There is also approximately €20 million available for the other main urban areas, for bus priority and park and ride projects.We hope that the local authorities can be a little more proactive on park and ride projects and bring them forward.  Major works this year will include completion of the Carrigaline and Farranree-Blackpool green routes in Cork, the completion of phase 2 of the Dublin Road green route by Limerick County Council and further bus priority measures in Claregalway and on the Dublin Road in Galway.  I would ask local authorities in urban areas to bring forward park and ride proposals.The implementation plans arising from the Deloitte report, which will be submitted fairly soon from the two companies, will address some of the issues raised, such as bunching and out-of-service running, referred to by Deputy Kennedy.  Those aspects are aggravating but they will be covered and the implementation plans should address them.Automatic vehicle location will be introduced, which will help people by telling them where buses are and allow them to plan their journey with real-time passenger information.  The DART allows passengers to see when the next train will arrive but a bus timetable, although it is well planned and well laid out, is often fiction due to traffic congestion — people do not know if they can believe it.  When there is real time information, it will help convince people the bus service is of a high quality.  The DART and Luas have reputations as good, reliable services but there is a lingering attitude that the bus is not a top of the range service.  It is difficult, however, for the bus companies to provide a service, even with bus lanes, when they do not control the full environment.  The gardaí are needed to control the traffic and the local authorities are needed to provide the roads.  If we gave real-time information, and if people could look at the bus stop and see the data updated, it would give a new perception of the service and encourage greater use and confidence in it.People mentioned integrated ticketing.  Progress is being made and will start late this year and early next year.It is often said, with a degree of truth, that the subvention to public transport here is not as good as that given in Zurich or Stockholm.  We are not as good as the best, I do not deny it, but sometimes we are not comparing like with like.  Some of these other countries that might, on the surface, get a better subvention must provide not just replacement buses but new buses.  Over recent years, the Government has bought 200 additional buses for Dublin Bus and  Bus Éireann as well as replacing several hundred others.  I am not saying we are at the top of the league for subventions but when we judge that we should compare like with like.I thank Members for their contributions.  When the implementation plans are in place they will point us in the right direction.  While this consultants' report targeted some individual routes, the main message asks Dublin Bus to look at all routes to see if it can make greater use of what it has.  Some bus services are the same as they were years ago.  A new estate would be built further out the road and two stops added to the tail of the route.  It could sharpen things up and now is the right time to improve the service and offer better value for money to the taxpayer while improving the service for the punter.

These special classes, which are to close, pre-date the 2005 general allocation model of allocating additional teacher support to schools to enable them to meet the needs of pupils with mild general learning disabilities and a number of other high incidence disabilities.  All primary schools now have in place additional teaching support for this purpose.All primary schools were allocated additional teaching resources under the general allocation model to enable them support pupils with high incidence special educational needs, including mild general learning disability, MGLD.  Schools can decide how best to use this allocation based on pupils' needs.  Most pupils with a MGLD are taught in ordinary classes with their peers and are supported by their class teacher.  The curriculum is flexible so that teachers can cater for the needs of children of different abilities.Teacher allocations to schools typically increase or decrease depending on pupil enrolment.  In the case of classes for MGLD, the normal pupil teacher ratio is 11:1.  However, my Department permits schools to retain a teaching post in respect of a class with a minimum of nine pupils.  In the case of 128 classes in 119 schools, the number of pupils dropped below the minimum enrolment number.  Therefore, these schools no longer qualify for the 128 teaching posts allocated to them.  There are currently 534 pupils enrolled in these classes.When the general allocation model was introduced, schools with additional teachers in classes for MGLD were allowed to retain those teachers.  Effectively, these schools received a double allocation.  The number of these special classes has decreased since 2005 in line with falling numbers as pupils were supported through the additional teaching allocation provided and integrated into age-appropriate mainstream classes.  All of the other primary schools in the country who do not have classes for children with MGLD cater for these pupils from within the general allocation model.

Within a week of that he said he would consider amalgamating some of them and has today refused to answer my question in regard to whether these classes will continue.

Further, there are no sound educational arguments for the decision taken two weeks ago.  The National Council for Special Education is currently compiling research in this area.

The first report stated that 900 pupils were involved.  I want now to deal with the Deputy's question, which is important.One must first take into account the manner in which we have dealt down through the years with general mild learning disability.  Special classes were established in 1989.  In 2005, we introduced the general allocation model which provided for resource and class teachers.  Mainstreaming of children with mild general learning disability has been ongoing in 3,000 schools around the country since 2005 and it has been successful.  The whole purpose of the exercise was to examine whether children with this disability would be better off if integrated with their peers.  The EPSEN Act and UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities espouse that children with a mild learning disability be integrated and educated with their peers.Deputy Hayes asked what will happen to these classes.  We examined the whole situation.  The general rule since 1989 has been that there must be an 11:1 ratio in such classes.  We became aware earlier in the year that these ratios were not being fulfilled.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	316	The primary consideration of the Government in establishing the redress scheme was to provide justice for people who had been abused in childhood while resident in institutions which operated under the supervision of the State.  The Government's decision to establish the redress scheme was made regardless of whether the religious congregations which managed the institutions would contribute to the scheme.  The State had a duty to make amends for the abuse of those in its charge.  Nonetheless, it was considered desirable that the religious congregations would make a meaningful contribution towards the compensation of victims of child abuse and the Government accordingly entered into negotiations with the congregations which culminated in agreement being reached in June 2002 on a total contribution by the congregations of €128 million.  The agreement reached with the religious congregations represented the best possible outcome in the circumstances.  The Committee of Public Accounts acknowledged that there was no capacity to coerce the congregations into any agreement and that the State was faced with a substantial contingent liability in any event.The alternative option of rejecting the offer and pursuing the congregations through the courts would have resulted in a sizable number of protracted legal proceedings with the involvement of victims in a traumatic and adversarial process, substantial costs in legal fees and with no guarantee of a favourable outcome.  There would have been substantial risks with such a course and the real possibility that the State would bear most of the cost and receive little or nothing in return.I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department does not intend to revisit or renegotiate the terms of the existing indemnity agreement or enter into any new agreement which would see the State seek further contributions from the contributing congregations.  The final agreement is achieving its original purpose of providing, in a humane and compassionate manner, redress to those who have suffered abuse with an acknowledgement of what had happened by the key parties involved.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	317	I thank the Minister for the clarity of his reply.  He must have a new answer writer in the Department.  This is in no way an attempt by the Labour Party or I to further punish the religious orders.  On the contrary, we are all indebted to them because of the contribution they have made to education.  However, my fear is that the congregations will be obliged to provide 24 hour seven day nursing care for a now ageing and declining community, the members of which do not have children of their own who could support them, and that they will be forced or obliged to sell school properties to finance this obligation.  Will the Minister approach the religious orders and suggest that the State or the community could pick up that cost, however it is to be financed?  However, at a time of rising school population we do not wish to see the closure and sale of school buildings, albeit into a declining market.  That is the motivation.  Does the Minister not agree that both he and public representatives have legal ownership of only 3% of the primary school infrastructure?  This means we have no control over the decision of a patron to decide unilaterally to sell a property.  The likelihood of that now is less than it would have been three or four years ago, but it occurred three times in my constituency.  Will the Minister revisit the position and enter into discussions with the existing owners in control of 97% of the infrastructure to draw some commitments or guarantees?  I do not wish for any of these schools to be sold.  I hope they continue to operate as schools under the existing patronage arrangements, which are more than satisfactory.  However, the fear is that if the costs increase further and we have no control over the schools, the owners may sell them and the Minister would be powerless to stop this from occurring.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	322	Apparently the matter is very complicated.  I refer to schools and ownership of schools.  The issue is important and we must address it.  The Deputy suggested that because of its ownership, the church can willy-nilly sell a school.  However, that does not take into account our lease arrangement with the church for these schools.  For an order to sell a school it must be granted leave to sell by agreement with the Department.  That clawback is in place for all the church properties.  In that sense there is no chance of the Deputy's suggestion occurring.New arrangements are in place, including the arrangement whereby the Department buys a site and leases it back to the patron and, therefore, retains total control of the situation.  The Deputy's suggestion would have serious constitutional implications.  If the church was unwilling to sell, there would be no obligation for it to do so.  It cannot sell if it does not have our agreement.  From my perspective, the whole system has worked exceptionally well.  The Deputy referred to the ageing population, but we will introduce a new patronage model.  We are seeking the agreement and co-operation of others.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	323	I respect the Chair and I will be very brief.  There is no problem with the modern arrangements or the modern leaseholds.  However, the bulk of the schools in built up areas to which I am referring predate those leasing arrangements.  In my constituency schools were unilaterally closed down and the Department told us at the time it had no lean or control over that.The Minister does not know a great deal in regard to this matter, and it is not his fault.  We do not have a proper inventory of who owns what, the terms and conditions and so on.  Therefore, the Minister's remarks are insupportable.  Ownership, control, rationalisation and maximisation of the use of the infrastructure of our schools is critically important from the point of view of the Minister for Education and Science.As a first step, I suggest the Minister should explore the possibility, not of the closure of schools, but of the orderly transfer of ownership in a reasoned way from religious teaching orders.  My question is confined specifically to religious teaching orders, which are subject to a time clause of the State.  This would ensure we safeguard the infrastructure of the schools on the one hand and respect the real needs of these declining religious teaching orders and their communities.

I respect the comments of the Deputy and I will have the matter further investigated and communicate with him.  At a time of scare resources I must consider the priorities.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	333	As the Deputy will be aware, on 12 February 2009, I made an announcement regarding 43 school projects which will receive approval from my Department to proceed to tender with a view to proceeding to construction this year.  I also announced that 25 projects would receive approval to start architectural planning, that is, they will receive approval to appoint a design team and begin work on the architectural design of their projects.The selection of the various projects to go to construction is complex and was undertaken with regard to the availability of funding and the priority of the projects.  Priority is established primarily on the basis of the projects' band-rating in accordance with the criteria for prioritising large-scale projects, details of which are published on my Department's website.  However, certain other factors are taken into account in the selection of projects.  These factors include the stage of progression through the architectural design process, that is, whether the project is technically ready to proceed to tender and construction; whether the project was previously allowed to proceed to tender but did not do so for various reasons; the need to achieve an appropriate balance of capital expenditure on a multi-annual basis between primary and post-primary building projects; the need to ensure that contractual commitments are not entered into in any particular year which might not be capable of being met in future years; the need to ensure adequate funding is available for the purchase of sites for key projects and the need to provide additional school places in rapidly developing areas to meet increasing demand while at the same time balancing this with the need to maintain investment in the improvement of existing school buildings.All of these factors have to be considered before making a final selection and this work was done over a period of time. The selection of the projects to be included on the list was finalised on 11 February 2009 and a press release issued the following day.  As is normal with a process like this, there would have been a number of initial draft lists which would have been subject to amendments prior to being finalised.  At the time the Government was considering the capital programme and subsequently decided to allocate additional resources to the school building and modernisation programme.  At all times during this process I consulted with, and was advised by, officials in my Department.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	334	I know exactly what the Minister said on 12 February.  That is not the issue.  The issue is that a document was posted on the Department's website some days in advance of that date, announcing that 41 major school building projects would proceed to tender and construction.  Underneath that was the sentence "Insert link here once list is cleared!!!"Two schools were added to the list.  What were they and why were they put on the list?  It is clear to schools around the country that politicisation of the schools building programme is at the centre of all decisions this Minister and his predecessors have got away with for the past ten years.  Schools are decided not on the basis of priority, as the Minister suggests, but on votes and a cynical attempt by the Minister to use this as a slush fund for Fianna Fáil.  We need transparency.  The Minister has been exposed because the official advice on his Department's website 24 hours before 12 February cited 41 major school projects but the actual announcement was for 43 schools.  Politics gets in the way of all decisions the Minister takes in respect of this list.

That afternoon I did an interview with RTE which was to be held over for 12 February.  I cleared the final list with my officials on 11 February and announced it officially on 12 February.  I do not know what appeared.The process involves meetings with officials who show a range of schools on the list to be brought forward but one has only a certain amount of money to spend.  A critical factor for me was how to ensure that these projects could commence in 2009 and how could I be certain that I could create jobs and would not have approvals for jobs which could not commence in 2009.  The position of the schools was critical.That list covered schools around the country.  I have given a commitment that the various stages of the school building will be put on the website.  I apologise to the House because I understood that this information would be available before Christmas.  The building unit has been extremely busy, preparing for 43 projects.  We will produce 19,000 school places this year.  Last year, we produced a record 12,000 places.  It was no mean feat and we held many meetings to ensure that the projects we undertook could commence and give gainful employment to 4,000 extra people in the construction industry.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	340	Does the Minister understand people's cynicism about this decision-making process when they hear that in November 2006 his predecessor, Deputy Hanafin, gave the green light to six of the 43 schools to which he gave the green light on 12 February?  The Minister is worse than Paul Daniels, saying "now you see it, now you do not".  This is an extraordinary situation, six of the 43 projects were re-announced three years later.The education partners and schools around the country have no confidence in the decision-making process that results in the list the Minister produces at various times during the year.  I am glad that the Minister will now give us the website, warts and all, as he promised he would do before Christmas.  The process of selecting schools must be much more open and transparent because the cynicism in the education community is well-justified when even on the Minister's admission six of the 43 schools were given the green light three years ago but nothing happened.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	341	Several schools were announced but funding was not available.  This time I had adequate funds.  I made sure that the commitments entered into would be honoured, the schools were announced and the reaction was very good.  I do not accept what the Deputy says about cynicism.  The process in the Department will be open, above board and decisions will be made on merit and need.  In 2009 the most important element was the stage the schools had reached.  Many people are disappointed.  I met many deputations from around the country.  I make it my business to visit schools to meet deputations and to hear what people have to say.  Many schools are disappointed.  I am sorry about that.  I wish I could have delivered more.This year I had two things in mind on the question of delivery, that the building could go to construction and that I would deliver jobs in a sector that was badly affected by the downturn.  We are confident that in the education sector we will create and sustain 4,000 jobs within the construction industry.  That is no mean achievement.  We will deliver a record number of school places to ensure that a good environment is created for pupils.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	342	The target set is for achievement by the year 2016 and progress will have to be judged in that time frame.  The Government's commitment to achieving the target is evident from the increased investment in this area.Annual funding for adult literacy has increased from €1 million in 1997 to over €30 million in 2008. In the same period the annual number of participants has increased from 5,000 to almost 49,000.  Targets in the national development plan have consistently been met or exceeded.  In line with commitments in Towards 2016 and the programme for Government 3,000 additional places were provided in 2007.  Due to the difficult budgetary position it has not been possible to  provide for any further increase in places.Ireland is participating in the initial development work and feasibility study for a new survey to be carried out by the OECD entitled the programme for international assessment of adult competencies, PIAAC.  This survey of adult competencies, including literacy and numeracy, is due to be completed in 2013.  Participation in the main study will be decided on the basis of the results of the development work and feasibility study and the availability of resources.  PIAAC can provide data that can be compared to the data in the last survey of adult literacy in Ireland, conducted in 1995.Several different initiatives have also been developed to tackle adult literacy.  These include the intensive tuition in adult basic education programme which provides up to six hours of tuition per week to learners, instead of the normal two hours; a family literacy pilot scheme to address poor literacy from an intergenerational family perspective; and a workplace literacy programme, the return to learning scheme, in all local authority areas for outdoor workers.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.Participants in community employment schemes can avail of intensive literacy tuition provided by the vocational education committees, VECs.  There are other special funding projects, including literacy for deaf people, for people with dyslexia and for native Irish speakers in Gaeltacht areas.  In partnership with the National Adult Literacy Agency my Department has provided funding for several successful TV series to raise awareness of adult literacy issues.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	343	I thank the Minister of State for his reply but the figures he read out indicate that there is a natural reduction in expenditure per capita on adult literacy.  We know from the 1997 OECD survey that 25% of the population is at the lowest literacy level.  The Government has indicated that there has been an improvement in the relevant figure.  It now claims that a reduced number of people — between 10% and 15% of those between the ages of 16 and 64 — are at the lowest literacy level.  How do we know we are making progress?  How can we be sure the figure has been reduced to between 10% and 15%?  There has been no national evaluation of interventions aimed at improving literacy levels.  In the absence of measurable indicators, how does the Minister of State know we are on course to achieve any of our goals?  The measurement of progress was not recommended in the White Paper of 2000 or in the national development plan.  How, therefore, can we know what has been achieved?

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	346	Deputy Burke spoke about funding.  As I said earlier, funding in this area has increased from €1 million in 1997 to more than €30 million in 2008.  The number of places has also increased significantly since 1997.  I accept that we need new data.  We are participating in the OECD survey to establish new data in this area.  It should be pointed out that the survey that established that 500,000 people were at the lowest literacy levels was compiled in the mid-1990s.  This figure is likely to have decreased considerably since then, as more than 300,000 people have availed of the literacy service in that time.  The availability of free second-level education since 1967 means that the percentage of the population that has completed second-level education is now larger than it was in the 1990s.  In the circumstances, I consider that the targets that have been set out in the various policy documents, including the national development plan, the programme for Government and the programme for social inclusion, are reasonable and may be even exceeded.  We have made substantial progress.  I have prioritised expenditure on adult literacy and lifelong learning in the context of the current difficult budgetary situation.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	347	The Minister of State claims to have prioritised adult literacy.

From which of these funds will adult literacy be funded?
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	348	The Deputy will be aware that I administer a number of adult and further education schemes, including Youthreach, the back to education initiative and the adult literacy schemes.  This country's serious and difficult financial position has meant that I have had to reduce the number of places being offered on some schemes, unfortunately, including Traveller training schemes and the back to education initiative.  I made the retention of places in adult literacy programmes an absolute priority.  The Government is giving serious consideration to matters like upskilling and lifelong learning in the context of the changed economic circumstances and the increase in unemployment.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	350	I am aware of the stipulation that has been imposed on the college referred to in the question.  The Deputy will be aware that the national reduction in apprentice recruitment has necessitated a reduction in the current level of training provision.  The problem is particularly acute in the construction trades, which have suffered a reduction in recruitment of almost 70% in the past two years.  This reduction is beginning to feed into the education sector.  A reduction in provision is necessary because apprentice numbers are declining.  Officials from the Department of Education and Science have met the principal of the college referred to by the Deputy to discuss the issues arising from the reduction in apprenticeship provision.  These issues are being considered.Nationally, some 30,188 places are available on the post-leaving certificate programme.  Most of these places are allocated to VECs on an annual basis following an application process.  It is a matter for the VECs to allocate the places to their colleges and institutions.  Each application is examined by the Department on its merits, taking into account current and previous allocations, current and previous demand and uptake, the overall number of places that are available and the overall demand from VECs.  The application process for the 2009-10 academic year is ongoing.  Any application from the VEC responsible for the college referred to in the Deputy's question will be considered on its own merits, taking into account all relevant circumstances.  The Deputy should be aware that the increase from 16:1 to 17:1 in the pupil-teacher ratio in the post-leaving certificate sector was sanctioned on the same basis as the increase from 18:1 to 19:1 in the ratio in the post-primary sector.  The identified reduction of 200 teachers in the education system in the 2009-10 school year is based on the increase in the ratio in the post-primary and post-leaving certificate sectors.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	351	I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I do not want to get into too much detail in the time available to me.  By 2010, the cancellation of courses for apprentices will affect 4.8 permanent whole-time teachers who are qualified to teach in this area.  If the Department's requirements are to be met, part-time teachers in the post-leaving certificate sector will have to be let go.  It is ridiculous that 4.8 teachers will be walking around doing nothing because certain requirements have to be met.  There is a simple way out of this.  Skills will be needed in certain sectors of the construction industry in the future.  The college referred to in my original question has identified two courses — conservation and the built environment, and sustainable construction technology and practice — that should be developed further.  The 4.8 teachers I have mentioned are capable of teaching those courses.  We need to continue to give people skills for the future.  It would be wrong if 4.8 teachers were doing nothing, simply to meet a departmental requirement, at a time when courses are being cancelled.  It is time to think differently about the training of apprentices.  I do not understand why the retraining agency, FÁS, needs to be involved in education.

The same system should apply in the case of apprentices.  Ireland is part of Europe.  If they cannot find employment in Ireland, those who have completed apprenticeships are entitled, like anybody else, to go to other parts of Europe to use their skills.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	354	As I said earlier, we have to examine the overall context in the first instance.  A cap has been imposed on the number of places in the post-leaving certificate sector as a result of the current financial position and in line with the increase in the pupil-teacher ratio.  I accept that the Deputy has made a constructive proposal.  Officials in the Department of Education and Science have met the principal of the college concerned.  These issues are being considered.  It is ultimately a matter for the local VEC.  I accept that the Department will decide how many places are allocated to each VEC.  Each VEC will allocate those places to the various colleges in its area.  Three colleges are administered by Dún Laoghaire VEC.  It is up to each college to make a case, through the VEC, for the number of places it considers it needs.  The Department will allocate places on that basis.  Applications have been received from the colleges and the VECs.  The process of receiving applications will be finalised in March.  We will notify the VECs of the position at that stage.  The question put forward by the Deputy can examined in the context of allocating places to the Dún Laoghaire VEC, and that VEC subsequently allocating places within its jurisdiction.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	355	I did not ask this question simply because of a particular problem in my own constituency.  I want to highlight a more general issue.  People with skills should be used to train others and provide them with opportunities in other parts of the construction industry.  It is time we reviewed the issue of training apprentices.  It is an educational rather than a FÁS issue.  The Minister of State should take money from FÁS, transfer it over to his Department and let it carry out the training.  Practical training can be done in-house, so there is no need to have a complicated means within which somebody becomes a carpenter, cabinet maker or block layer.  Somebody should be able to do that in college, just like in any other post-leaving certificate course or degree.  People should be given the opportunity to qualify in their skills area.We should not have a ridiculous situation whereby somebody has gone half way through his or her training but cannot continue because his or her sponsor employer has gone out of business.  That is no way to deal with education.  I thank the Minister of State for his positive indication about Dún Laoghaire but outside that, it is time to transfer funds to his Department from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to let people qualify in the same way a doctor would qualify.

The Tánaiste has made a number of announcements because of the difficult situation facing apprentices due to the current unemployment situation.  The overall point made by the Deputy is being given serious consideration at this stage, which is the need for employment activation.  My role is to co-ordinate education and training between the two Departments.  We have an upskilling co-ordination group which brings all the players together.  We are also looking at the provision of education and training and at who does what in the implementation plan for the national skills strategy.  The Deputy's proposal is being actively examined by all the major stakeholders.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	360	The schools to which the Deputy refers are among those that were judged by an independent identification process in 2005 not to have a sufficient level of disadvantage among their pupils to warrant their inclusion in DEIS, the action plan for educational inclusion.  The next identification process is scheduled to be held at the end of the current DEIS programme, which runs from 2005 to 2010.  There will not be an opportunity before this for inclusion in the current DEIS programme of supports.A review mechanism was put in place in 2006 to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in DEIS, but which regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage that was of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme.  The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.  The review was concluded and the results were notified to schools in August 2006.  The four schools in question applied for a review at that time but they were unsuccessful in qualifying for inclusion in DEIS.The schools involved retained resources, including additional capitation and a shared rural co-ordinator post under pre-existing schemes and programmes for addressing educational disadvantage.  Following the introduction of DEIS, a commitment was given, as a concessionary measure to non-DEIS schools in receipt of such resources, that they would retain a level of support in line with their size and disadvantage levels for the duration of the DEIS initiative.It is appreciated that the discontinuation of these resources will impact on the schools concerned.  However given the current volatile and challenging economic climate, difficult decisions had to be made in the 2009 budget in order to contain public sector spending.   One of these decisions was to advance the withdrawal of such supports from non-DEIS schools to the beginning of the next school year.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The main focus of social inclusion measures will be to retain resources in DEIS schools.  There is a need to focus targeted resources on the schools in most need and this approach is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General.   These are set out in his report on primary disadvantage in 2006, which recommended that my Department should focus its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.

There are positive aspects to this scheme.  It was administered by one person and the total administration cost was about €25,000 per year.  We are concerned here with the north Inishowen area of Donegal.  In my constituency of Donegal North East, 53% of young males leave school at 16.  That compares with a national figure of 35%.  That is a massive disparity.In this scheme, four national schools came together to provide support and capacity between parents and teachers, started engaging with communities, and increased the level of student participation at national school.  The results are transparent and are there to see.  This has been an outstanding success since 2001.

Not every school in the country should be classified as disadvantaged.  These particular resources were given on a concessionary basis.  All the evidence shows that we need to focus our resources to combat disadvantage.  A report by the Comptroller and Auditor General on primary disadvantage in 2006 also recommended this.  If a concession was made for those schools in Donegal, then other schools would feel aggrieved because they would be losing resources.I accept that these provisions were working well, but due to the difficult financial situation, and because of the concessionary nature of these supports, it was necessary to bring forward their withdrawal.  Ultimately, we need to focus our resources on combatting disadvantage.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	371	The project for Pobalscoil Ghaoth Dobhair involves the provision of a new physical education hall and is at an advanced stage of architectural planning.  This project has a band rating of 4.1 under my Department's prioritisation criteria for major capital projects.  Once it has been approved to go to construction, it is intended that my Department will be co-financing the project with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  There has also been local community fundraising for the project.  The next step in the process will be for this project to be approved to proceed to tender and construction when funding allows.Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.  There are four band ratings, of which band one is the highest and band four the lowest.  Band one projects, for example, include the provision of buildings where none currently exists but there is a high  demand for pupil places, while a band four project makes provision for desirable but not necessarily urgent or essential facilities, such as a library or new sports hall.Other factors taken into account in the selection of projects include the stage of progression through the architectural design process, the need to achieve an appropriate balance of capital expenditure on a multi-annual basis between primary and post-primary building projects, the need to ensure adequate funding is available for the purchase of sites for key projects and  the need to provide additional school places in rapidly developing areas to meet increasing demand while at the same time balancing this with the need to maintain investment in the improvement of existing school buildings.

The Minister has been in charge of that Department only for the last number of months and I wonder if he is aware that this campaign for a sports hall for Pobalscoil Ghaoth Dobhair has been going on for 25 years, since I came into this House.  I declare a personal interest in the school in that I am a long-serving member of the board of management.  If we added up the cost of all the parlimentary questions and Adjournment debates regarding Phobalscoil Ghaoth Dobhair over these past 25 years, there would be more than enough money to provide a sports hall.  Month after month, year after year there has been question after question by Deputies from every side of the House.Is the Minister aware that this is an all-Irish school with more than 300 pupils and that every other community and second level school in Donegal has a sports hall, and some have two?  Is the Minister aware that according to a national survey carried out by a national newspaper in recent months 100% of pupils leaving this school go to third level education and it is ranked tenth in the country?  It is a great school and achieves all that despite the fact that it has no sports hall.I have heard the Minister's answer today more times than there are beads on a rosary.  This is a unique school.  The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is providing almost €500,000 and there is a local contribution of over €100,000.  We seek only €700,000, less than 1% of the Minister's entire capital allocation this year for school building.  I ask the Minister to do the right thing.  He has a grá for the Gaeilge.  He comes from Cullen.  This is an all-Irish school, and if the Minister does nothing else, will he allow it this year?
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	373	Both Deputy McGinley and I have served here for a long time and flattery will get one everywhere most times but I fear Deputy Brian Hayes will say, "Band four", and I would be political if I gave the go-ahead for this project.  I am very conscious that this project has the involvement of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, which is prepared to provide 40% of the cost, plus €100,000 from the local community.  While I do not have funding in 2009, I will liaise with the Deputy and others to see what we can do in the future.  It is a very desirable project, I am aware that the school has an outstanding output and I will see what can be done in the Estimates for 2010 but, unfortunately, I do not have the resources to do it this year.

Would the Minister consider visiting the school?  I attest to the quality of the education there in a very peripheral part of the country.  Would he at least meet a delegation from the school over the coming months to see what progress can be made over the next while?  It is a very worthy project.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	377	I have consistently said the 2009 budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure.  These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run.  In this respect education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared.  At the time of the budget I set out the likely impact of the various measures including the projected net impact on teacher numbers in primary and post-primary schools, which was estimated at a loss of 200 posts in each sector.  The budget measures will impact on individual schools in different ways depending on whether enrolment is rising or declining and the degree to which any one school has more teachers than it is entitled to under the allocation processes.  Across the school system generally there will of course be some impact on class sizes and at post-primary level the changes may impact on the capacity of individual schools to offer as wide a range of subject choices as heretofore.In terms of the position at individual school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2008.  The annual process of seeking this enrolment data from schools took place in the autumn and the data have since been received and processed in my Department enabling the commencement of the processes by which teaching resources are allocated to schools for next September.My Department has written to the primary schools that are projected to have a net loss or gain in classroom teaching posts in September 2009.  As part of my efforts to ensure that relevant information is openly available to the public, detailed information on the opening position for primary schools is published on my Department's website.  This provisional list sets out the details on individual schools that, taken collectively, are projected to gain 128 posts and to lose 382 posts, a net reduction of 254 posts.  It is my intention to have this information updated and ultimately to set out the final position when the allocation processes are completed.Initial allocation letters have also issued to post primary schools and vocational educational committees.  All these allocations, primary and post-primary, are provisional and reflect the initial allocation position.  The final position for any one school will depend on a number of other factors such as the allocation of support teachers, additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes.The operation of redeployment arrangements also impacts on the final position, as a teacher can remain in his or her existing school where a suitable redeployment position does not exist.  The final staffing position for all schools will therefore not be known until the autumn.  At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers and any appeals to the staffing appeals board will have been considered.  The appellate process is particularly relevant at post-primary level where any specific curricular needs of the school concerned are considered.  Also at post-primary level there is no effective system-wide redeployment scheme and this can mean that schools retain teachers, though over quota.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	378	Just after the budget the Minister told the House the net effect would be the loss of 200 teachers.  He is now telling the House that the net effect on mainstream teachers will be 254.  Is that not a fact?  Is that only a minimal figure because it does not consider the reduction in English language support, special needs and home-school community liaison teachers?  There will be 1,000 redundancies in the primary sector this year when one takes the totality of those cuts across the sectors.  Will the Minister comment on that?  Earlier I asked the Minister if he can give a categorical assurance to the House that there will be no further cutbacks in education this year in the primary and post-primary sectors and I would like to hear his views on that.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	379	I still hold to the claim that 200 posts will go in the primary sector.  All the indications my Department and I have suggest that the net effect will be that 1,100 teachers will be taken out and demographics will show that 900 teachers will come into the system.  I might go through with the Deputy the various processes involved before we can come to the final result.  We will not know the absolute figures until some time in October 2009 because, as the Deputy knows, the figures that went out this week are provisional and there is the appeals process.  There are other posts to be allocated.  Resource posts are allocated on an annual basis by application.  There will be approximately 350 developing area posts.  Many other factors must be examined and will impact on the final result.  My officials and I are still happy that the net effect will be an overall reduction of 200 posts in the primary sector.

Can he give the House a categorical reassurance that there will be no further cutbacks this year in the primary and post-primary sectors?  I have asked that questions three times.

As of now, the budget position stands in terms of the funding available to me.  If the economy deteriorates further, I am not sure what impact that will have.  Please do not hold me to making prognoses.  On foot of the information available and on the basis of the budget allocation given to me, I do not envisage any changes at this point in time.My Department's estimates are calculated on the basis that approximately 900 additional posts will be needed in primary schools in September next due to demographics and the projected growth in provision for children with special education needs in schools.  That estimate is based on a reduction of 1,100 posts.  These will come from a change made to the basic staffing schedule, the reduction in the number of language support teachers, the adherence to the allocation arrangements associated with children with special education needs and the withdrawal of teacher posts which have been historically provided under previous disadvantaged schemes to non-DEIS schools.  We still maintain that there will be a reduction of 200 posts and the issues Deputy Hayes raised have been factored in.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	387	Could the Minister inform the House of comments he made about the English language support teachers?  I understand he will issue a circular to schools setting out a process through which they will know exactly how many will be lost.  He stated at budget time that he would consider on a case-by-case basis the number of English language support teachers.  This is an issue of considerable concern in schools.Am I correct that there is a redeployment scheme in the primary sector but there is no such scheme in post-primary education?  The Minister is trying to negotiate a redeployment scheme, but with no agreement on such a scheme, how can he possibly implement the loss of 200 posts in post-primary education?
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	388	On language support, I am conscious that certain schools have taken in a high number of non-Irish nationals and that in no way should we penalise those schools.  We have gone back to pre-2007 levels of language support and, as it were, cut it to two language support teachers, but where schools can show a high incidence of non-nationals who require language support, the Department will look at it.A circular letter on language support is to go out to all the schools indicating how they might qualify for additional language support.  The Department is working on that circular.  I indicated today that I hoped I would be in a position to issue that circular within the next two weeks and I will try to hold to that.Using the primary school panel we can move teachers on from one school to another——

When we were factoring in a loss of only 200 posts at second level, we took account of the fact that we would not be able to redeploy teachers in that sector.  That is why I am anxious that we proceed with redeployment issues.  We reckon there are approximately 200 teachers surplus within the second level system who are not being moved on and who could be assigned to other schools that need their professionalism.  This is in the interests of everybody.  If the redeployment scheme could be negotiated and finalised, we would be in a position to redeploy those teachers.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	391	Over the past number of years the Government has prioritised a major expansion of opportunities in adult and further education.  Between 2002 and 2008, expenditure on these areas increased by 60%, from €256 million to €414 million.  In terms of extending opportunity, this increased expenditure meant that, in 2008, over 49,000 places were provided in further education courses compared to almost 43,000 places in 2002.Budget 2009 required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure in order to control expenditure and ensure sustainability in the long term.  While the provision for further and adult education in 2009 shows a small increase on the outturn for 2008, nevertheless it will require very careful management of available resources.  Given the overall financial constraints and the various competing demands across the education sector, it is not possible to re-prioritise funding for the further education sector from within the existing budget for the Department of Education and Science.However, my Department, in conjunction with the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Social and Family Affairs and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, is working as a matter of urgency to identify innovative and creative ways to maximise provision and enhance effectiveness.  My Department is also working closely with all the stakeholders and providers in the further and adult education sector in order to address the retraining and upskilling needs of the workforce.As part of our efforts in this regard, my Department and representatives of the Irish Vocational Education Association and Institutes of Technology Ireland participate in the upskilling co-ordination group chaired by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  My Department is also liaising with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with a view to improving the co-ordination of our efforts and facilitating better co-operation and collaboration at local and regional level among the relevant education and training providers.The increase in unemployment brings with it many challenges, including that of retraining and upskilling.  In order to address these challenges in this difficult financial situation, we must continue to target and prioritise our resources to maximum effect across the education sector.  I am confident that by working closely with other Departments and agencies we can maximise the impact of our collective endeavours in meeting the challenges presented by the current economic situation.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	392	I thank the Minister of State.  I am not so sure that the reply would be different if we were in the middle of a boom.There was a good article by Professor Tom Collins in the education supplement of The Irish Times recently about the existing spare capacity within the institutes of technology, IT, and vocational education committee, VEC, sectors.  While the Minister of State has given me a standard departmental reply, for which he is not necessarily responsible because he did not write it, would he agree that we need to respond more proactively to the cascade of skilled people out of secure employment and into unemployment, which is unprecedented?If I may make this question supplementary to Question No. 20, which is about the extra places that FÁS has been mandated to obtain, the Minister of State will not get part of the FÁS budget out of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment but I ask him to enter into negotiations to see whether the spend that FÁS will put into the private sector for contractors could be directed into the VEC and IT sectors.There is spare capacity.  Professor Tom Collins speaks of it and anecdotal discussions with many of the ITs will tell the Minister of State that many course places are not taken up.  I am trying to get a new kind of approach, above and beyond the traditional one to which the Minister of State referred which has been victim of a certain cutback.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	393	I will take the last part of Deputy Quinn's question on the 51,000 additional FÁS places first.  These additional places are being provided by FÁS from within existing resources.  In delivering these places FÁS will, in addition to its own delivery of courses, contract with other bodies for provision of relevant courses.  It would be open to VECs and institutes of technology to bid for the provision of appropriate courses.  All of these organisations are working together at national and local level to ensure both the education and the training sectors respond in an optimum way to the situation we are currently facing.  FÁS and the Irish Vocational Education Association are liaising on the matter.  I accept the Irish Vocational Education Association is making similar points to the Deputy.I do not accept that I gave a standard reply but outlined that the Government attaches the greatest urgency to this situation because of the numbers being made unemployed.  There is close co-operation now through Cabinet committees to upskill and retrain the unemployed.  We are looking at creative and innovative ways to deal with that situation and I expect announcements will be made.  I recognise the article referred to by the Deputy and we are examining areas where there is duplication and spare capacity in the further education sector.

There can be plenty of flexibility in the spending of the money but there should be an assurance that the money that is within the FÁS budget will be spent within the existing public educational infrastructure which currently has spare capacity.  The track record of FÁS in recent times would cause one to doubt the efficiency of it placing contracts with third parties in the private sector.  There is an accountable infrastructure in place that is short of resources but that has the capacity.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	395	We have identified spare capacity, particularly in the institutes of technology.  We are also looking at ways that further education schemes can be expanded.  The Deputy makes a good point in that there must be greater co-operation and co-ordination on education and training even though they are split between two Departments.  As Minister of State in both Departments, my aim is to secure that co-operation and I am fighting that case to see if we can change the way we do things in the provision of education and training.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	396	Given the current trend of an increasing student population and the need to ensure maximum benefit from the financial resources available to me, I have asked the Department to examine the broad issues relating to school recognition at second level.  The application from Educate Together to be recognised as a patron body at second level will be looked at in that context.  It currently provides multi-denominational education in the primary sector.The examination will have regard to the objectives of the Education Act 1998, one of which is to promote the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents' choice having regard to the rights of patrons and the effective and efficient use of resources.  In recent times, the rapid pace of social and demographic change in Ireland is reflected in a radically altered and more diverse society from which our school communities are drawn.  Added to this, it is expected that enrolments at second level will increase significantly in the years ahead.The introduction of free post-primary education in the late 1960s and the Government's aim of providing universal second level education resulted in the emergence of two additional alternative models of post primary provision, comprehensive schools and community schools, and an adaptation of the existing VEC model, designated community colleges.  These were over and above the many voluntary secondary schools in existence.Between them, these models provide for a range of schools that are denominational, multi-denominational and non-denominational in ethos and characteristic spirit.  These schools have served and continue to serve their communities very well.At present there is no formal procedure in place for assessing applications for new post-primary schools.  The commission on school accommodation has recommended a set of criteria for assessing applications for new post primary schools.  The commission has outlined a set of procedures to be followed by patrons seeking recognition of a new school and has suggested procedures that should be followed by the Department in assessing such applications.  These recommendations are currently under consideration.The examination of the recognition process for patrons at second level will be finalised as quickly as possible and the Department will be in contact with Educate Together when it has been completed.  However, extending the existing range of patron bodies is a significant step and before proceeding further, I am anxious to ensure that the financial and other implications are fully assessed.

This application has been on the Minister's desk since December 2007.  We have been getting replies stating that it is under consideration for 14 months.  If the Minister does not want to do it, he should say so.  I believe, however, that he is in breach of the law because the Education Act recognises Educate Together as a legitimate partner in education and the Act makes no distinction between primary and post-primary education.  In excess of 10,000 children attend Educate Together primary schools but the Government is clearly attempting to frustrate the right of their parents to have the model of education they want.

The second level sector is a different kettle of fish.  The Deputy is looking for recognition as a patron body in an area that is already served by the VEC sector in a non-denominational way.  There are serious issues that must be examined within the Department.  I am anxious to decide what we will do and I will look at the issue actively.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	401	This issue is of national importance and is critical to St. Angela's College in Sligo.  I have great admiration for those who choose a career in the medical and caring professions.  It is a most noble and worthy career path and marks these individuals out as true custodians of our health and well-being.  Graduates from the general nursing programme in St. Angela's College are employed locally, regionally and nationally in both private hospitals and the HSE.  In addition, all the graduates of the intellectual disability nursing programme have secured employment in local and regional services.  I have no doubt every nursing graduate from St. Angela's College becomes an outstanding health care professional.The proposed cuts in nursing places will lead to a reduction in the number of graduates available to the health service in the region and nationwide.  The Minister's proposed cuts will mean the number of places on the bachelor of nursing science degree programme will be reduced by 310 from 1,880 to 1,570 in the forthcoming year.  The intake to St. Angela's College will be reduced from 65 to 40 places annually, a 31% reduction in nursing places offered by the college.  This reduction is one of the highest in the country, with the intellectual disability nursing programme being particularly hard hit, with a 40% reduction in places.  General nursing will suffer a 25% reduction in places and the western region, particularly St. Angela's College, is being severely hit by these cuts.Cutting the number of nurse training and education places is a short-sighted proposal.  A shortage of nurses exists at European and global level.  Cuts to undergraduate nursing numbers will make this problem worse and will have a long-term negative impact on the Irish health care system.  From recent history we know that if we cut the number of nurses in training, within a few years there will be a shortage of qualified nurses.  In response, international recruitment will be required to meet the needs of the Irish health service.  This is a more expensive solution than continuing to educate nurses and maintaining a steady nursing work-force.Education and training of nurses is an important investment in the capabilities and skills of our most valuable resource, our people.  A nursing qualification represents a practical and durable skill, and is one of the most marketable qualifications internationally.  Qualified nurses have a passport to a job anywhere in the world.  From past experience, we know that if there is a short-term surplus of nurses they can find work abroad and when demand picks up at home, many of them will come back to work in our health system.  Thus, the investment we made in the education and training of nurses reverts to us.  As we head into a period of rapidly rising unemployment, we must strive to give maximum investment to job-related education and training.  Our number one priority must be education and training for people coming out of second level this year and next.A reduction in the number of nursing places will also have a significant impact on the number of mature students entering the profession.  This will deny the health service access to a group of graduates that offers considerable practical experience to patients, service users and the nursing profession.  This is a significant factor in the current economic crisis with the increase in job losses among those with practical work experience.Do the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister for Health and Children really believe that slashing nursing education places is good for the economy, our children and our future?  If they do not believe that education and training is the way to a better economy, then it is time for them to quit as Ministers.  The country has a great opportunity to educate and train people for real jobs anywhere in the world.  The education staff, facilities and training skills are all available.  All that is needed is a student intake.  I ask the Government urgently to review and reverse the proposed reduction in the numbers of nursing places being made available nationally, and in particular at St. Angela's College, Sligo.  Given the scale of the job losses now sweeping across the country, we should be expanding the number of nursing education programmes, not reducing them.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	402	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment, which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.By way of background I should explain that, following the publication of the 2009 Estimates for public services, the Health Service Executive was tasked to deliver economy savings of €115 million.  Among many other issues, a reduction in nurse training expenditure is needed to contribute to achieving these savings.  The total cost to the health services both for undergraduate and post-registration nurse education is currently in excess of €117 million per annum.Savings of €5 million in 2009 will be achieved as follows.  First, the number of places on the undergraduate degree programme will be reduced by 310 places, from a total of 1,880 to 1,570.  The reductions will take place in all 13 higher education institutions across the country which provide this programme and will relate to general nursing, 197 places; intellectual disability nursing, 60 places; and psychiatric nursing, 53 places making a total of 310 places.  These reductions will result in savings of €1.65 million approximately in 2009 and €3.3 million per annum from 2010 onwards.  They will be effected mainly in those areas that are not experiencing nurse shortages.  The Deputy should note that while the reduction in intellectual disability places in St. Angela's College, Sligo, is 40%, the reduction for this programme nationally is25%, as I have outlined.  There will be no reductions in places on the undergraduate programmes for midwifery, 140 places, and children's and general nursing, integrated, 100 places.Second, nurses trained under the apprenticeship and diploma models undertaking part-time degree courses can apply to their employer to have their course fees paid in return for a service commitment to the public health service.  This initiative has been in operation since 2001 and should have been completed in 2005.  Its purpose was to afford serving nurses and midwives the opportunity to avail of the degree course, thereby avoiding a two-tier nursing and midwifery system.  It will no longer be available for new entrants from 1 January 2009, resulting in a saving of €2 million next year and about €3.8 million per annum from 2010 onwards.Third, further savings of €1.35 million in 2009 will be achieved by reducing places on the various post-registration courses in specialist clinical practice.These three cost saving measures will produce savings of €5 million in 2009 and €8.45 million per annum in future years.The OECD's 2008 public management review, entitled  Ireland — Towards an Integrated Public Service, noted in its case study “Reconfiguration of the Health Services”:One statistical characteristic of Ireland is its very large number of practising nurses (15.2 per 1,000), which is twice the OECD average, just below Norway (15.4) but much higher than UK (9.1) or France (7.7).  The number of nurses graduating every year is also high (14.4), above Norway (10.1), UK (8.6) or France (5.9).  This contradicts the universal perception of a "shortage" of nurses, held by health actors in Ireland who were interviewed by the OECD.  Partial explanations come from the fact that some 40% of nurses in Ireland work part-time (as compared for example with 26% in France for nurses working in hospitals).The percentage reductions in undergraduate student places take account of geographic and demographic trends in nursing placements whereby it is not always possible to fill all vacancies in the eastern region, whereas outside this region the number of graduates being produced may exceed demand.  Accordingly, the estimated one third reduction on the western seaboard should go some way towards correcting this imbalance.The percentage reductions in the 13 higher education institutes also take account of the situation whereby the removal of the full intake of the nursing degree programme — which, in some cases, forms the backbone of an institute — could cause great difficulties for the institute as a whole.Against this background it is important to note that the Minister has approved a strategic review of the nursing degree programme, which will commence this year.  Overall, the review is designed to provide a systematic analysis of what is actually being achieved by expenditure under both capital and revenue headings.  It should also provide sound evidence and a critical analysis of the preparation of nurses for practice.  The findings will provide a basis to inform decision makers on the future direction of pre-registration nursing education programmes in Ireland.
#CyprianBrady	unknown-#CyprianBrady-party	unknown-#CyprianBrady-dob	unknown-#CyprianBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	403	I spoke earlier to the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, about this matter and I understand that he has a previous commitment this evening.  I am raising the issue of the possible renewal of a bilateral adoption agreement between Ireland and Vietnam.  As we know, the whole area of adoption is a sensitive and personal one.  I have been contacted by a number of people who are at various stages of the adoption process.  At any one time there can be up to 1,500 people at different stages within that process.  This agreement was put in place quite a number of years ago with the Vietnamese who have a particular issue with young children being abandoned in their country.  In the 1970s and 1980s we had a successful refugee programme between Ireland and Vietnam.  Indeed, in my own constituency of Dublin Central we have a vibrant, well-attended community centre in Hardwicke Street for the Vietnamese population based in Dublin.  From speaking to those people, I know that they are grateful that young Vietnamese children are being adopted and get a great opportunity to live with people who are willing to bring them here and become their parents.  However, there is some delay in renewing this inter-country adoption agreement.  It is a sensitive matter and the adoption process itself is very difficult.  It is only right that the best people are selected to adopt these young children.  There are two sides to this story.  There is the couple in Ireland anxious to provide a loving home for a young child and there is also the child who is in an orphanage or institution in Vietnam.  I look forward to the Minister's update on this matter.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	404	I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleagues the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews.  Deputy Andrews spoke to me about the matter earlier and regrets he could not attend the Chamber.The mutual co-operation agreement concerning adoption with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam has been in operation for five years and will expire on 1 May  2009.  The agreement contains a clause which states that it will be automatically extended for another five-year term, unless one state notifies the other to the contrary.The Government formally notified the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in October 2008 that there would be no automatic renewal of the agreement when the five year term expires on 1 May 2009.  While Ireland's current agreement is based on Hague principles, there is a need to elaborate the agreement to reflect the standards of the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption more comprehensively.  This is in line with Ireland's own commitment to ratify the convention.  It is also considered necessary to reflect the experiences gained by both sides over the first five years of a formal relationship between the two states.  This approach is also part of the preparations for new adoption legislation in which it is proposed that a bilateral agreement will be required between Ireland and any state which has not ratified the Hague Convention.  The Socialist Republic of Vietnam has not yet ratified the convention.Following the notification, officials travelled to Vietnam in November 2008 to meet the relevant authorities dealing with inter-country adoption as well as the embassies of other governments to discuss inter-country adoption in Vietnam generally and progress towards ratification of the Hague Convention.In December 2008, following a decision on the matter, the Government advised the Vietnamese authorities that it wished to enter into discussions immediately for the purpose of negotiating a new bilateral adoption agreement to follow on from the existing one.  In order to expedite the negotiation process, Ireland offered to provide the Vietnamese authorities with the draft agreement as a basis for negotiations.  The Vietnamese authorities responded positively to Ireland's request to enter into formal negotiations and the proposal that Ireland would prepare a first draft was agreed.Work on a draft agreement requires careful and detailed consideration by several parties including the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Attorney General's office and the Adoption Board.  An initial text was prepared by the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in December and it is now at an advanced stage.  It will be finalised shortly once legal advices have been received on outstanding matters.  It is anticipated this will be forwarded to the Vietnamese authorities for their consideration in the immediate future.The issue of contingency arrangements in the case of an agreement not being reached by 1 May 2009 was raised by the Government in a December 2008 communication to the Vietnamese.  The Vietnamese authorities formally advised on proposed contingency arrangements on Friday, 13 February through the Irish Embassy in Hanoi.  The Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs subsequently prepared and circulated a public information note on the contingency plans to prospective adoptive parents through the Helping Hands Adoption Mediation Agency and the adoption support groups.These are contingency plans in the event of an agreement not being reached by 1 May 2009.  The Department of Health and Children is continuing to pursue the successful conclusion of a bilateral agreement with Vietnam as a priority.  The Government will continue to seek to revisit the contingency arrangements which have been put in place over the course of and in light of negotiations on a new agreement.The Socialist Republic of Vietnam is a sovereign state and decisions it makes regarding the internal regulation and management of the adoption of its children must be treated sensitively as is appropriate to a sovereign state.  Demands for guarantees or changes to contingency arrangements are matters which fall to be dealt with as part of the negotiation process on a bilateral basis.  At this stage, I cannot pre-empt either the Government's deliberative process as those negotiations advance.  The Department's priority is to advance the process.The work to prepare for and advise the Government on this issue and to implement the Government's decisions continues to be given the highest priority.  These are complex matters which require careful consideration.  At all times, the Government and the officials advising it, are guided by the need to respect and protect the best interests and rights of the child.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	405	The issue of Garda resources in the Inishowen area has been raised in the Donegal and national media.  This is not an argument for increased Garda resources along the Border.  As Fine Gael spokesperson on North-South co-operation, I laud the fact the Border is no longer policed as it was in the 1970s, 1980s and the 1990s.  The fading of the Border should be welcomed and encouraged by every Member.  My specific request is for increased Garda resources in a part of north-east Donegal which circulates around the fourth largest city on this island, Derry city.A spate of burglaries across Inishowen in recent weeks has caused upheaval and great anxiety in every home.  Across the area, people are installing house alarms and I have been contacted by many people who are keeping nightly neighbourhood vigils.  I have met senior Inishowen gardaí to discuss the matter.  I welcome the fact that the assistant commissioner is taking the issue seriously which was reflected in his trip to Donegal last week.  I commend the superintendent in the Inishowen district who is taking the issue seriously and the efforts made by the Garda in deployment for the short term.From speaking to many public representatives in the area, I believe it is time to examine the ethos of community policing in the area.  I will use, for illustration, a comparison between the Inishowen area and the greater Cork area.  Cork city has a population of 120,000 while Derry's is 90,000.  If suburban areas are included, Cork's figure rises to 190,000.  However, Derry's figure is distorted by the fact that it does not account for the part of east Donegal that is considered to be a suburb of Derry.  In east Cork, there are 22 gardaí based in Glanmire, a 24-hour station, Carraigtwohill has a 24-hour station and 50 gardaí are based at Cobh.  In the west, 50 gardaí are based in Gurranbraher, 16 in Blarney and 50 in Bandon.  In east Inishowen, Burnfoot has 16 gardaí, Muff, two, Carrigans, five, Newtowncunningham, four, and Carndonnagh, five.  There are no Garda stations in Quigley's Point or Killea.The Inishowen Peninsula is the most northerly part of this island.  It is geographically proximate to Derry city, which is the natural shopping centre and university town in the region.  Inishowen is part of the Catholic diocese of Derry.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in distributing Garda Síochána resources, must acknowledge this fact and, accordingly, allocate such resources as are necessary for a region which is situated adjacent to a major city with a six-figure population.I raised this matter over a five-year period when serving as a Member of Seanad Éireann.  There is still time for action to be taken in respect of it.  In light of North-South ministerial collaboration and co-operation, there is room for progress to be made.The problem I am highlighting only related to Inishowen a number of weeks ago.  In recent days, however,  it has emerged that it is becoming prevalent throughout Donegal.  This problem, which is termed "creeping crime" by some, will soon become all-island in nature.  We must be vigilant and the only way to do so is by deploying additional Garda resources in the rural areas to which I refer.  We must also engage with local communities.  I acknowledge the efforts of the assistant commissioner and the force in general in examining the nature of the community policing ethos.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	406	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform regrets that due to other business he is unable to be present to take this matter.  However, I assure the Deputy that the Minister shares his concern with regard to crime in the Inishowen area and is conscious of the distress caused by being the victim of burglary.The Minister is informed by the Garda authorities that local Garda management is aware of an increase in the number of incidents in the Buncrana Garda district to which the Deputy refers.  These incidents are under active investigation by An Garda Síochána.  Local Garda management has put in place a series of measures to prevent and reduce the frequency of such incidents and detect the perpetrators.  Additional patrols by uniform and plain clothes personnel have been put in place in the areas concerned and resources have been redeployed to assist in the identification of the suspected perpetrators of these offences.  Senior Garda management will be meeting representatives of local communities to inform them of ongoing efforts and initiatives to target this type of criminality and to urge them to report any suspicious activity occurring in the area to An Garda Síochána.  Crime prevention advice will also be provided through the local media.There are significant levels of ongoing cross-Border co-operation with the Police Service of Northern Ireland to identify crime trends and suspected offenders.  Border superintendents, including those from County Donegal, attend bimonthly crime meetings.  At local level, cross-Border crime meetings are held monthly, with regular contact taking place in respect of individual incidents and criminal activity in general.The Minister is further informed that a Garda divisional crime manager has been appointed to assist in the monitoring and analysis of crime trends in order to prepare further specific initiatives and operations to target the specific crime types.  The personnel strength of the Buncrana Garda district on 19 February 2009, the most recent date for which figures are available, was 90.  This follows the allocation of significant numbers of additional personnel to the district in recent times.  It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the force while taking all relevant matters into account.  The situation in the Inishowen area and the Buncrana Garda district will be kept under review.  Additional civilian support staff have also been assigned to the district.  This has released members of An Garda Síochána for patrolling and other duties.The Minister and the Garda Commissioner are aware of the needs of areas such as Inishowen.  On 26 January they launched a new national model of community policing.  This model builds on the success of existing good community policing practice within Ireland and aims to foster collaborative partnerships between An Garda Síochána and members of the community.  A comprehensive model of community policing ensures that enforcement will be employed not only to reduce crime, but also to reduce the fear of crime and ensure a better quality of community life for all.  In particular, a new rural community policing initiative for the Inishowen peninsula was recently established.Joint policing committees provide a forum where An Garda Síochána and local authorities — the two organisations that make the most significant contribution to preventing and tackling crime in specific areas — can come together, with the participation of Members of the Oireachtas and community and voluntary interests, on matters affecting an area.  A committee has a range of functions and monitors two broad areas.  The first of these relates to the levels and patterns of crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour in an area.  The second relates to the broader issue of the factors underlying and contributing to crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour.  A committee will subsequently advise the relevant local authority and An Garda Síochána on how they might best perform their functions, while having regard to the need to do everything feasible to improve the safety and quality of life and to prevent crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour within an area.  Following a pilot phase in 29 local authority areas, including Letterkenny, the committees are currently being rolled out to all other local authority areas.The Minister is of the view that the committees have enormous potential in the context of tackling the problems of crime, disorder and anti-social behaviour.  He wishes to assure the Deputy that he and the Garda authorities are committed to providing resources to tackle crime in Inishowen and elsewhere.

A Technical Working Group, under the direction of the Chairman of the Commission, has been established to undertake a full review of the criteria and procedures for the recognition of new primary schools.  This working group has commenced its work and it is expected that the review of procedures for recognising new primary schools will be completed and revised arrangements will be in place within a two year timeframe.  In the interim, it is not proposed to recognise any new primary schools, except in areas where the increases in pupil numbers cannot be catered for in existing schools and which require the provision of new schools.  This means that new schools will not be established for reasons unrelated to demographic growth in areas where there is already sufficient school accommodation or where increases can be catered for by extending existing school accommodation.The Forward Planning Section of my Department is in the process of identifying the areas where significant additional accommodation will be required at primary and post-primary level for 2009 and onwards.  Factors under consideration include population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places.  Having considered these factors, decisions will be taken on the means by which emerging needs will be met within an area.While the review is ongoing, it is proposed that the Department will identify the areas where new schools are required and details will be circulated to all existing Patron Bodies and it will be open to those patrons to put themselves forward as patron for any such new school.  This review does not mean that there will be a complete cessation of the school building programme outside areas of rapid growth.  This year alone, over €650 million will be spent on the school building programme. In addition to the establishment of new schools in areas of rapid population growth, the normal building programme of modernising, replacing or extending existing schools will continue.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	408	The Forward Planning Section of my Department is currently identifying areas where significant additional accommodation will be required at primary and post-primary level for 2009 and onwards.  This involves detailed consideration of factors such as population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places. As a matter of course, there is on-going liaison between my Department and local authorities to establish the location scale and pace of any proposed  major housing developments and their possible implications for school provision.As part of the Middleton Special Local Area Plan, the Local Authority has, on advice from my Department, made appropriate zonings for primary and post primary schools to meet the future educational requirements of the area.  Having analysed the demographic statistics in the Midleton area, my Department has found that there is no requirement for a new post-primary school in the short term based on current primary school enrolments.  However, my Department is keeping the situation under review, including a proposal for the future development of up to 2,500 houses in the area.  My Department is liaising with Cork County Council with regard to the timing of future developments and the decision as to when a new post-primary school will be required in Midleton will be based on the rate and pace of development and the feasibility of extending the current schools in the area.Progress on the development of additional schools together with any applications for capital funding from existing providers will be considered for progression in the context of my Department's School Building and Modernisation programme.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	409	Teacher allocations to all second level schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. In accordance with these rules each school management authority is required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. The deployment of teaching staff in the school, the range of subjects offered and ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are in the first instance a matter for the school management authorities.It must be borne in mind that the actual ratio of teachers to pupils in the post primary sector has improved greatly in recent years. The actual ratio includes a significant number of posts allocated for areas such as learning support, resource teaching, guidance counselling, non-national, Traveller provision etc. and is considered to be the more accurate and correct guide to provision at second level. The actual ratio of whole time teacher equivalents to pupils has reduced from 16:1 in the 1996/97 school year to just under 13:1  provisionally for the 2007/08 school year.Information on the numbers of the categories of appointments referred to by the Deputy is only readily available for Secondary and Community/Comprehensive schools, as the individual Vocational Education Committees are responsible for the payment of their employees.  The information recorded on the database for secondary and Community / Comprehensive schools indicates that there were 14,870 appointments to permanent posts in the 2000/2001 school year in Secondary and Community/ Comprehensive schools.  The information indicated that there were 469 Eligible Part-Time appointments and 565 fixed term wholetime appointments in that school year.In recent years the school managerial authorities have awarded contracts of indefinite duration to whole time and regular part-time teachers employed in their schools to comply with the agreed terms of the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003. In the current school year there are 1,559 holders of such contracts of indefinite duration appointments in secondary and community/ comprehensive schools.  There are 13,780 permanent appointments recorded. There are 3,335 Regular Part-Time appointments and 640 fixed term appointments.  In a school year up to 10,000 casual and non casual teachers are employed as replacements for teachers on approved leave of absences such as maternity leave and sick leave and to provide non regular part-time teaching in the schools.  The levels of teaching service provided vary substantially.In general and by agreement at Teachers Conciliation Council up to 95% of the initial teacher allocation in second-level schools is filled  by the appointment of teachers in a permanent capacity.  When deciding on the number of teaching posts, if any, which may be filled in a permanent capacity in a particular school year, the school authorities must take account of the approved teacher allocation for the school for that year, the number of permanent teachers currently employed, including those on approved leave, the overall limits as to the level of permanency as agreed from time to time and the need for flexibility to cater for the needs of all of the  pupils attending the school. The assignment of teachers to individual classes within the overall approved allocation is a matter for the authorities of the school concerned.  Therefore, it is a matter for each school authority to determine the level of permanency.  The Department does not have details on the level of permanency in individual schools or by sector.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	410	The duties and responsibilities of my Department require attendance by Ministers and officials at a range of meetings and events, in Ireland and overseas, which sometimes necessitate overnight stays in hotels.  Typically, the types of event which necessitate an overnight stay include meetings, conferences and training and development events in Ireland, EU meetings as well as those of international organisations such as the OECD, UNESCO and the Council of Europe, and specific events such as World Skills, Euro Skills and the National Skills competitions.Hotel accommodation is sourced in line with public procurement guidelines, and quotes are obtained from a number of venues with suitable facilities.  When I, or the Ministers of State at my Department, travel overseas, advice is usually sought from the local Irish diplomatic mission in relation to obtaining suitable and cost-effective accommodation for official events abroad.  My Department is very conscious of the need to keep the costs of hotel accommodation to a minimum, and direct expenditure on hotels in 2008 was down 14% on 2007 levels and 20% on 2006 levels.For the period 2004 to 2008, my Department spent the following rounded amounts on hotel accommodation:In 2004, the year of Ireland's EU Presidency, €546,000;In 2005, €235,000;In 2006, €277,000;In 2007, €259,000;In 2008, €221,000.When the Department's officers travel within Ireland and are required to stay overnight, they are normally paid a subsistence rate to cover the costs of meals and overnight accommodation. It is therefore not possible to give a specific breakdown for hotel accommodation for this type of travel. Therefore, the amounts I have given include only those payments for hotel accommodation in  respect of home travel that were billed directly to my Department.With regard to bodies under the aegis of my Department the expenditure incurred and the procurement arrangements are a matter for each agency and this information is not collated centrally by my Department.  In December 2008 I wrote to the Chairpersons of agencies under my Department's aegis to remind them of the need to ensure efficiency and effectiveness in respect of expenditure of public funds generally and in particular in relation to business travel and subsistence expenditure.  I emphasised the importance of the agencies being in a position to provide assurance, through appropriate control procedures and monitoring arrangements, that the necessary measures are in place to ensure compliance with prescribed procedures in relation to expenditure and that such procedures are documented and being implemented as required by statute, regulation or guideline as appropriate.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	411	I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 52, 53 and 58 together.There will be no pupil with a special educational need who will be without access to a special needs teacher as a result of my Department's decision to apply the normal rules which govern the appointment and retention of teachers to special classes for pupils with a mild general learning disability.  The Deputies will be aware that all primary schools have been allocated additional teaching resources to enable them support pupils with high incidence special educational needs including mild general learning disability (MGLD). All primary schools were given these additional teaching resources under the General Allocation Model of learning support/resource teaching introduced in 2005. Schools can decide how best to use this allocation based on the needs of the pupils. Most pupils with a MGLD are included in ordinary classes with their peers and are supported by their class teacher. The curriculum is flexible so that teachers can cater for the needs of children of different abilities.The Deputies will be aware that allocations to schools typically increase or decrease depending on pupil enrolment. In the case of classes for MGLD the normal pupil teacher ratio that applies is 11:1. My Department however allows for a small reduction in this number and permits schools to retain a teaching post where it has a minimum of 9 pupils in the class. In the case of 128 classes in 119 schools, the number of pupils dropped below this minimum. These schools therefore are no longer entitled to the teaching posts in these classes.  There are currently 534 pupils enrolled in these classes. It is not possible to give a precise cost of the posts concerned due to the varying salary costs of the teachers in question. However, it is estimated to be in the region of €6.8m.In 2005 when the General Allocation Model was introduced, schools with additional teachers in classes for MGLD were allowed to retain the teachers for these classes. Effectively, these schools received a double allocation. The number of these special classes has decreased over the years and schools have integrated the children into age-appropriate mainstream classes.  All of the other primary schools in the country which do not have classes for children with MGLD cater for these pupils from within the General Allocation Model.  I have requested that information concerning the names and locations of the schools is forwarded to the Deputy.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	412	I wish to advise the Deputy that there has been no change in the criteria which governs the appointment of additional resource/learning support teachers, special needs assistants or home tuition.  The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all pupils, including those with special educational needs, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post-primary school network.There are now over 19,000 staff in our schools working solely with children with special needs. This includes over 10,000 Special Needs Assistants — compared with just 300 in 1997. There are also over 8,000 resource and learning support teachers — compared with about 2,000 in 1998. More than 1,100 other teachers support children in our special schools, while hundreds more work in  special classes. As well as this significant increase in the numbers of additional teachers and SNAs directly providing appropriate education and care supports for children with special educational needs, much investment has taken place in the provision of transport, specialist school accommodation, home tuition, assistive technology and equipment.Additional teaching supports are allocated as necessary by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in line with my Department's policy to support children with special educational needs. As a result, there is no current shortfall in the number of teacher posts being allocated for children with special educational needs.  The Deputy will also be aware that additional funding has been allocated to my Department in 2009 to provide for an expansion of the National Educational Psychological service so that all schools in the country will be covered by the service. The additional funding available to NEPS, which represents a 33% increase over the 2008 allocation, will facilitate the recruitment of up to 50 further psychologists. It is envisaged that this will bring the number of NEPS psychologists by the end of 2009 above the proposed 200 incorporated in the Programme for Government.This investment will significantly enhance the capacity of our educational psychologists to directly support schools in the development and delivery of appropriate interventions for children with special educational needs. Additional funding is also being provided to the National Council for Special Education in 2009 to increase the Council's capacity in the move towards the full implementation of EPSEN. The additional funding will enable the Council to continue to improve, plan and co-ordinate the delivery of services for children with special needs.I have also provided for further investment in teacher training in this area. This will ensure that teachers are provided with opportunities to access continuing professional development so that the learning and teaching needs of all pupils with Special Educational Needs continue to be met.  I wish to assure the Deputy that the provision of appropriate educational intervention and supports for children with special educational needs continues to be a key Government priority.

These charge increases apply to the 55,000 eligible post primary and children availing of concessionary transport. The amount may be paid in full on or before the 31 July, 2009 in which case an annual ticket for the full school year will be issued. Alternatively, 50% of the annual amount due may be paid by the deadline date of 31 July, 2009, in which case a ticket valid for travel up to 22 December, 2009 will be issued. In this instance the balance due must be paid by 4th December, 2009. Upon receipt of this payment a second ticket, valid for travel up to the end of the school year in June, 2010 will be issued.Charges will continue to be waived in the case of eligible post-primary children where the family is in possession of a valid medical card or over a further 19,000 children. Eligible children attending primary schools and children with special needs or about 54,000 children will still travel free. A maximum family rate of €650 will also be applied.  The new charges from parents will still only represent about 7% of the overall allocation for school transport in 2009.

The additional places are being provided by FAS from within existing resources.   In delivering these places FÁS will, in addition to their own delivery of courses, contract with other bodies for provision of relevant courses. It will be open to VECs and Institutes of Technology to bid for the provision of appropriate courses. All of these organisations are working together at both national and local level to ensure that both the education and training sectors respond in an optimal way to the situation we are currently facing.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	416	I have already commented publicly in relation to this matter.  I have made the point that the patronage of Catholic schools in a diocese rests ex officio with the person who is Bishop of that diocese at any particular point in time.  In response to media queries as to whether I considered that the Bishop concerned should resign from his office I expressed that it was a matter for the Bishop and the church authorities.  Under the Education Act , 1998 the day to day management of primary schools, including the need to ensure that adequate child protection procedures are in place, is a matter for the Board of Management of a primary school as distinct from the Patron.My Department has issued child protection guidelines and procedures to all schools. The guidelines are based on Children First — the Department of Health & Children's national guidelines for the protection and welfare of children. The Children First guidelines make very clear the reporting and investigation mechanisms to be followed in cases of suspected child abuse wherever they occur, and the lead role of the HSE. The guidelines for schools require each board of management to designate a senior member of staff, normally the principal, as the Designated Liaison Person (DLP) for the school. The DLP acts as a liaison person with the health authorities and other agencies on child protection issues and as a resource person to any staff member who has concerns in this regard.  My Department's records indicate that there are over 120 primary schools within the diocese concerned serving approximately 18,000 pupils.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	417	Under the terms of the Indemnity Agreement reached with the Religious Congregations on the 5th June, 2002, the Congregations agreed to make a contribution of €128 million towards the cost of the Redress Scheme.  This sum was broken down as follows:Property Transfers — €76.86m;Cash Contribution — €41.14m;Provision of Counselling Services — €10.00m.In actual terms, whilst the overall figure of €128 million has not altered, the form in which it has or is to be transferred to the State has altered somewhat in terms of the property and cash contributions.  The alterations to the agreed amounts have occurred where the State agreed to accept and has since received cash in lieu of properties to the value of €10.86 million.  Hence, the breakdown of the contributions under the Indemnity Agreement is now as follows:Property Transfers — €66m;Cash Contributions — €52m;Provision of Counselling Services — €10m.As a result of the Indemnity Agreement, the Department has agreed in principle with CORI that a total of 64 properties would be accepted subject to good and marketable title and agreed valuations.  In 2008 the Department accepted and received a cash sum (€101,600.00) in lieu of a property where good and marketable title could not be established thereby reducing the number of properties to 63.  All cash contributions have been received as well as Counselling to the value of €10 million.All the 63 properties which are subject to the Indemnity Agreement, with the exception of two, are in use or available for use by the intended recipients.  Of the 63 properties, 30 are transferring to the HSE, 15 to my Department, 1 to the OPW and the remaining 17 to various voluntary bodies.   These properties were earmarked for specific use by state bodies and charitable organisations for various health, education and social purposes.  In the case of 44 of the properties, the properties have transferred to the intended recipients.At 31st December 2008, good and marketable title has been established on 20 of these properties, they have been fully transferred and there are no outstanding issues.  The total value of these properties is €26,790,575.  One of these properties, which transferred to the HSE, was subsequently sold by the HSE in 2005, a transaction to which my Department was not a party.  I can confirm that  this is the only one of the total portfolio of redress properties which has been sold.  A further 24 properties with a total value of €17,699,255 have been transferred to third parties who are in occupation and have the use of them but there are some outstanding legal formalities to satisfy the conditions of the Indemnity Agreement.Finally there are 19 properties at various stages in the legal transfer process.  Documents continue to be forwarded to the Chief State Solicitor's Office (CSSO) on an ongoing basis and until all of the required documents are received, good and marketable title cannot be fully established by the State.  The CSSO has experienced delays in processing certain cases but, in all instances, continues to correspond with the legal representatives of those concerned in an effort to iron out any difficulties being encountered.  As many of the Congregations' properties were held in complex legal structures including trusts and other legal arrangements the process of transferring these properties is complex and time consuming.  In order to accelerate the process, Department officials have met the Congregations involved to request their assistance and this has resulted in significant progress. Arising from these discussions arrangements were made with the congregations for continued bilateral communication to overcome any difficulties emerging from the process.Meetings are continuing between the Department, the Attorney General's office and the Chief State Solicitor's Office in order to finalise the legal transfer of the remaining properties.  Department officials are continuing to engage with the Religious Congregations, the HSE and various voluntary bodies in order to complete the final legal transfer of the outstanding properties.

The process will be overseen by a high level steering group, chaired by economist Dr Colin Hunt and comprising national and international expertise including academic, business, community and student interests, as well as senior government officials. It is expected that the group will complete its work before the end of the year.The process will afford a timely opportunity to review the environment for higher education and the challenges and changes that are impacting on the sector. An examination of the overall operational, governance and resourcing framework will be important elements of the strategy review. The government is investing unprecedented levels of public funding in higher education and it is appropriate to look at the effectiveness of use of current resources, identify any potential for rationalisation or change to maximise the use of those  resources and identify how any additional resource requirements can be met having particular regard to the difficult budgetary and economic climate that is in prospect in the medium term. My Department has not at this stage conducted a survey in the area referred to by the Deputy.

A number of amendments are currently being considered, arising from a review of the Bill following the Second Stage debate and further consultations since publication. I hope to have these amendments finalised with a view to progressing to Committee Stage in the current Parliamentary session.  The passage of the Bill will facilitate progress on the development of regulations for a single unified grant scheme. The Department is working closely with the IVEA and other relevant stakeholders to develop the new administrative structures required to support more efficient and effective delivery of the new scheme.

The Higher Education Grants Scheme is administered by the local authorities. The other three schemes are administered by the Vocational Education Committees.  In January each year my Department carries out a survey of the 66 local authorities and VECs in respect of the status of applications. The survey indicates, on a specified date, the number of applications received, the number of grants awarded, the number refused a grant and the status of other applications on hand. To date, 91% of the survey returns have been received in respect of applications for student grants for the academic year 2008/09.  On receipt of the outstanding forms the details will be analysed.€264m was spent on maintenance grants in respect of students attending further and higher education courses in the 2008 financial year, of which €231m related to higher education courses.  This allocation spans two academic years — the second and third recoupments of the 2007/08 academic year and the first recoupments of the 2008/09 academic year. The first recoupments of the 2008/09 academic year in respect of higher education grants amounted to €98.6m

My Department understands that student councils have been established in the  majority of post-primary schools and that the remaining schools are in the process of establishing councils. The name of each post-primary school which has established a student council is not readily available as my Department does not have a detailed audit of the position.  As part of Whole School Inspection the Inspectorate engages with the student council of the school and where there is no council they recommend that a council should be established.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	423	I would like to assure the Deputy that my Department has been very aware of the issues raised in relation to the adjustments to pay due to certain part-time teachers under the Protection of Employees (Part-Time Work) Act, 2001 and has worked closely with the school management bodies and teacher unions to ensure  that the legislation is implemented and applied to teachers in a fair and consistent manner.  My Department has already made the pay adjustments and paid arrears for the majority of part-time teachers, including substitute teachers and part-time teachers in secondary and Community/ Comprehensive schools and substitute teachers in primary schools, that are on the payrolls it directly administers. These groups of teachers are integrated into the payroll systems.The group of part-time teachers that have still to receive adjusted pay and arrears are those employed on a part-time basis by individual Boards of Management of primary schools. Currently a grant system operates, which allows the Boards to claim from my Department, the funding required to pay these teachers. The Boards of Management pay the part-time teachers directly. Under the terms of the Protection of Employees (Part-time Work) Act, 2001, qualified eligible part-time teachers are entitled to be paid salary  appropriate to their qualifications and to receive incremental credit in respect of relevant teaching service.In order to ensure that the terms of this Act could be applied to any part-time teachers paid directly by school boards, my Department took the view that the best approach was to extend the central payroll process which is in place for all other teachers in primary, secondary and community and comprehensive schools rather than persist with the practice of having boards pay them directly. This approach would ensure that the teachers concerned could get full credit for their overall service where they served part-time in more than one school.My Department collected the data necessary to place the part-time resource teachers on the centralised payroll recently.  The new payroll is being developed and will be introduced from 1 September 2009 and arrears will be paid by November 2009. It is expected that approximately one thousand additional part-time resource teachers will be paid on the  payroll when it is introduced.

Approximately 30% of the expenditure for school transport is being expended on transport, including taxis and grants (mainly escorts) for children with special needs. The provisional outturn of expenditure for school transport in 2008 is €185.725 million. This year's allocation is €196 million.The number of taxis engaged in the past years has increased from about 250 in 2004 to over 700 in 2008. Some of these taxis would be catering for more than one pupil. In addition grants were paid to over 440 families who use their private vehicles to transport children with special needs to an educational centre.  The cost of employing escorts to cater for children with special needs, whose  care requirements are such as to necessitate continuous support, has increased significantly in line with the growth in that service. At present, there are about 1,300 escorts employed at an annual cost of about €15 million.

Value for money is a key criterion in the implementation of the school building programme and competitive tendering, in line with public procurement procedures, ensures that this is achieved. As I have indicated publicly, the current decline in activity in the construction industry is an opportunity for my Department to continue to pursue value for money in the procurement and construction of school buildings. Issues relating to the acceleration of the school building programme must have regard to current financial circumstances and cannot be considered in isolation.As part of my Department's review of rental policy, it was determined that if prefabs are going to be required for more than 3 years, then purchasing them represents better value for money than renting them. Accordingly, a policy instruction was issued in 2008 to staff processing such requests to approve the purchase rather than the rental of prefabricated accommodation if a period of more than 3 years is envisaged.  In July of 2008, I introduced a further innovation which allows those schools with an urgent and pressing need for additional accommodation which is likely to last for more than 3 years, and who are being given approval for grant aid, to avail of the option of using their grants either to purchase prefabs or to construct permanent classrooms for the same amount. This avoids the need for schools to borrow money to provide such accommodation.

The review of the School Transport Scheme, including catchment boundaries, is in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government.  The review will be carried out as part of the 2009-2011 round of Value for Money Reviews recently approved by Government and, when completed, will be published and submitted to the Oireachtas Select Committee on Education and Science.

Factors under consideration include population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places.  Having considered these factors decisions will be taken on the means by which emerging needs will be met within specific areas.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	428	My Department's main interventions in Early Years have been targeted towards children who experience disadvantage or who have special needs.  The intervention programmes in place for pre-school children include Early Start, pre-schools for Travellers, the Rutland St project and an early intervention programme for children with autism.Government Investment in Early Years education is instead taking place through the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP) 2006-2010 which is the successor programme to the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006.  This programme is administered by the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  The NCIP aims to deliver a further 10,000 pre-school places by 2010.  Under the social inclusion measure of the NCIP, priority for funding for childcare facilities is given to applications with the highest focus on disadvantage.  This can be demonstrated by reference to the socio-demographic profile of the area, the parent profile of the service, and admissions and fees policies.  Groups applying for funding are also asked to state their policies on meeting the needs of children with special needs, lone parents, immigrant families, and other groups at risk of social exclusion.  Childcare facilities which demonstrate that they will support pre-school services for schools designated as disadvantaged under DEIS are prioritised.  Similarly, pre-school services involved in the integration of Traveller children are also prioritised.  Being located in a region covered by the RAPID, CLAR or DEIS programmes is also a factor in assessing and prioritising a community capital project in terms of its impact on social inclusion.My Department's role is to improve the quality of educational provision in childcare settings.  This is a key tenet set out in the White Paper ‘Ready to Learn'.  The quality improvement initiatives include:1. The publication and commencement of revised Preschool Regulations (Department of Health and Children, 2006)2. The development of Síolta, the national quality framework for early childhood education (Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education) — a comprehensive set of practice guidelines for all settings where children aged birth to six years are present.3. The development of a framework for Early Learning (National Council for Curriculum and Assessment) — designed to bring greater coherence to early educational experiences in all ECEC settings.4. The commencement of a national longitudinal research programme ‘Growing up in Ireland' — designed to provide greater insight into the lives of children in Ireland with a view to improving effectiveness of policymaking and service provision.5. Development of a National Childcare Training Strategy — designed to create an infrastructure that will encourage and support the development of a suitably qualified ECEC workforce.While the early education centre in Knockaheeny was established by Barnardos, with their partners the Bon Secours Foundation, the Centre is receiving funding through the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) under the NCIP.  The CCSS scheme has a strong focus on disadvantage.  My Department will not be setting up a separate infrastructure for Early Years centres but will continue to work within the existing infrastructure on quality improvement measures.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	429	Following the introduction of DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunities in Schools), a commitment was given, as a concessionary measure, to Non DEIS schools in receipt of resources under pre-existing schemes, including the Rural Coordinator service, that they would retain a level of support in line with their size and disadvantage levels for the duration of the DEIS Initiative.  Unfortunately, given the current volatile and challenging economic climate, difficult choices had to be made in order to contain public sector spending.  One of these decisions is the withdrawal of the Rural Co-ordinator services from all NON DEIS schools with effect from September 2009.Consequently, it has been necessary to re-cluster some DEIS schools which were sharing posts with Non DEIS schools to date.  I am pleased to advise that the DEIS school referred to by the Deputy will be included in a new cluster of schools with effect from 1 September 2009 and will continue to benefit from the services of a Rural Coordinator.  The school was advised of this new arrangement on 12 February 2009.In relation to the supports available under the DEIS programme, the following supports are available to both urban and rural DEIS schools:additional non-pay/capitation allocation based on level of disadvantage;financial allocation to support the operation of a school book rental scheme;access to the School Meals Programme;access to Home School Community Liaison or Rural Co-ordinator services  — access to planning supports.In addition to this, urban DEIS schools also benefit from:reduced class size of 20:1 in junior classes and 24:1 in senior classes (Band 1 urban schools only);allocation of administrative principal on lower enrolment and staffing figures than apply in primary schools generally;access to literacy/numeracy supports such as Reading Recovery, First Steps, Maths Recovery;access to the School Completion Programme.

It is estimated that 4.2% of all new entrants to higher education have one or more disabilities [1].  While the majority of applicants to higher education with a disability receive an offer for entry to higher education through the normal CAO route and do not require any points concessions, it is important that these students have access to the appropriate assessment service.The National Council for Special Education has responsibility for developing disability services to students in primary and secondary level education. Therefore a majority of students with a disability will have been assessed prior to entry into higher education.  Access and disability staff in higher education institutions will assist in whatever way they can to ensure that those who have not been assessed have access to the relevant services.A report from the Higher Education Authority in 2005 (Progressing the Action Plan: Funding to achieve equity of access to higher education) recommended that a model for a regionally-based service should be developed to ensure that all students enrolling in higher education have access to a needs assessment service.  Following this recommendation a project, led by Athlone Institute of  Technology, was approved funding from the Strategic Innovation Fund for the development of a Needs Assessment Centre which would cater for the assessment needs of people with disabilities.  This project is currently being implemented.In relation to the expansion of the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) the Deputy will be aware that all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through my Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA) which is administered by NEPS.  He will also be aware that I was pleased to announce recently, in the context of Budget 2009, an increase in the funding available to NEPS with which it is envisaged that up to 50 further psychologists can be appointed.  The primary focus of NEPS is on early intervention strategies to leverage maximum benefit for students, particularly those with special needs.  It is envisaged that this expansion in NEPS psychologists will be used in the first instance to ensure that a NEPS psychologist is assigned to every primary and post-primary school and that a level of enhancement of service will be afforded to Special Needs Units and schools.In addition, the NEPS service provides recommendations to the State Examinations Commission on applications for reasonable accommodations under the RACE scheme for over 3,000 Leaving Certificate students annually.[1] HEA.

Standards are not simply achieved by supplying teaching resources.  I recognise that the quality of the supports that children receive and the inclusive atmosphere cultivated in schools are important factors influencing the quality of learning obtained by newcomer children.  The Inspectorate of the Department of Education and Science is evaluating the effectiveness of provision of English as an additional language in a number of primary and post-primary schools.  This evaluation is currently underway in a number of primary and post-primary schools and is designed to:Evaluate the quality of teaching and learning of English as an additional language which students receive in mainstream education and in support contexts;Establish the quality of whole-school planning and school self-review that is undertaken to include students in the school, and to review the extent to which this planning reflects the principles of inclusion and respect for cultural diversity;Review the progress which these students are making in oral competency, literacy and numeracy;Identify good practice with regard to EAL provision in schools and seek to disseminate this good practice generally;Identify areas where the work of schools, teachers and the system of supports that the Department of Education and Science administers could be improved.The data from the evaluations in the individual schools is currently being analysed and a national composite report is being prepared by the Inspectorate. This report will, I hope, provide valuable reflections and analysis about how schools and the Department of Education and Science can improve the quality of EAL provision.  In addition, materials have been provided to schools to raise awareness of cultural diversity and to support all staff in schools in addressing this issue effectively.  The Intercultural Guidelines prepared by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment help to ensure that both primary and post-primary schools are equipped to provide a welcoming, inclusive and supporting environment for newcomer children.The assessment of the individual needs of pupils and the regular monitoring of the progress that they are making are key factors in ensuring that the school provides the most appropriate supports to the students.  To assist schools in this work, the Department of Education and Science has supplied a language assessment kit for primary level and a post-primary kit has just recently been  distributed to schools.  The Department is supporting their use through training of teachers.  Training is in place at primary level and in-service seminars are currently being delivered across the country.  Training for post-primary English language support teachers commenced this January.The Department of Education and Science recognises that we must monitor and review the educational experiences that are provided to newcomer students so that we can improve the quality and effectiveness of our provision and is, therefore, undertaking a range of research to consider the question of integration in schools.  The ESRI will shortly finalise a research report on "Managing Diversity", looking at newcomer students in primary and post-primary schools. This research is based on case study interviews and responses to questionnaires from some 1,200 primary and post-primary schools.  Ireland is also taking part in an OECD thematic review on migrant education, results from which are expected this autumn.  Together with the other key participants in the study (Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Austria and the Netherlands) the review is exploring what are the best education options for our children in an inclusive Ireland.The Department of Education and Science is also conducting a value for money review of English as an Additional Language in primary and post-primary schools.  The review is expected to be completed in autumn 2009.  The Department has consulted extensively on the development of an intercultural education strategy which is to be finalised by the end of 2009.  The research findings and the responses to the consultation process will provide the evidence based data required to prepare the strategy.  This multi-pronged approach that is being taken will help to ensure that the standard of language education and competency for migrant students in the primary and the post-primary sectors respectively are continually evaluated and improved, within available budgetary resources.

The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has developed an ICT framework which sets out a structured approach to ICT in curriculum and assessment.  The Framework sets out the types of learning appropriate for students during the period of compulsory education and provides a guide to teachers for embedding ICT across the curriculum. It is being supported by the NCCA's Action website which provides exemplars of teaching and learning in different settings and shows the classroom application of learning outcomes and demonstrations in the ICT framework.  The overall implementation of the ICT in Schools Programme is supported by the National Centre for Technology in Education, which provides for extensive training and guidance for schools on the integration of ICT into teaching and learning.The European Computer Driving Licence is a widely used private sector qualification providing basic competences in a range of functions such as word processing, spreadsheet, database, presentation, web browsing and e-mail.  The 2005 census of post-primary schools undertaken by the National Centre for Technology in Education indicates that 74% of post primary schools offered external certification in ICT, primarily using ECDL.  Other awards in ICT offered included FETAC, City and Guilds, Royal Society of Arts, Microsoft, etc.  The Evaluation Report, ICT in Schools, undertaken by my Department's Inspectorate found that some 70% of post-primary schools surveyed provided ECDL courses for their students, while 28% provided FETAC courses.

It is provided in an out of school setting and centres operate for 226 days per year.  There are around 6,500 places available nationally under the Youthreach umbrella. 3,700 of these are funded by my Department and delivered in just over 100 centres by Vocational Education Committees (VECs).  The majority of the remaining 2,800 places are funded by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and delivered in Community Training Centres by FÁS.Youthreach posts are not advertised as teaching posts and teaching qualifications are not required for employment in Youthreach centres.  Each centre must have a Co-ordinator who manages the centre and at least one Resource Person.  Resource Persons are recruited to work in Youthreach and are responsible to the centre Co-ordinator on a day to day basis for the delivery of the Youthreach programme.  Their pay and conditions were set out in a 1998 Adjudication Board determination and these were revised in 2005 as part of a Productivity Agreement.  They are required to work 35 hours per week, with direct class contact in keeping with programme needs as required by the VEC subject to a maximum of 20 hours per week.  The balance is spent on administrative duties.The duties of a Resource Person in Youthreach include: work with centre management in the planning, delivery and evaluation of appropriate responses to education and training needs; work with centre management to agree and implement a centre development plan and conduct an internal centre evaluation process; direct class contact; curriculum development and delivery; maintenance of discipline; development and monitoring of the programme; assessment and monitoring of learners' course work; conducting interviews of learners; provide locally agreed substitution cover for absent staff and supervise learners as necessary during lunch breaks and at opening and closing of the centre; general administrative duties and to deputise when necessary for the Co-ordinator.

There are 5,000 places on VTOS nationwide, funded by my Department and operated by Vocational Education Committees (VECs).  The funding allocated by my Department to VECs for the VTOS programme is for the pay of teaching staff, participant allowances and other non-pay costs and is allocated based on the number of approved places.  The VEC can then allocate those places to the various VTOS providers within its area.  In this case, my Department became aware that the number of enrolments significantly exceeded the number of approved places.  My Department contacted the relevant VEC to inform them that funding could only be provided for the number of approved places and the VEC undertook to address the matter.

Following a survey of over 900 schools across the country my Department has set up a database giving details regarding their use of prefabricated accommodation.  The information gathered does not specify whether the accommodation in individual schools is entirely made up of temporary buildings.The Deputy will be aware that demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years, with the appointment of 6,000 extra teachers in the primary sector alone since 2002.  The overall policy goal is to ensure the highest standard of permanent accommodation for all schools.  However, in the context of a rapidly increasing school population, the  necessity to put additional accommodation in place in a short time frame, and competing pressure on the capital budget available to my Department, it is necessary to make use of temporary accommodation in order to meet accommodation needs in some circumstances.It should be noted that the Department did undertake, as a pilot project, the development of an extensive inventory of building stock in County Kildare in 2002.  While this proved useful, the costs associated with not only maintaining that single Inventory but also rolling it out nationwide would have been prohibitive.  I want to assure the Deputy that my Department is not reluctant to expand the information it holds on the school building stock.  A full inventory of the stock of school accommodation across the country would undoubtedly be a useful tool in order to assist in forecasting accommodation needs into the future as well as other decision making processed.The Department's recently commissioned Geographical Information System (GIS) is being used to collate all relevant population and school enrolment data in order to identify future enrolment trends at both primary and post-primary levels from 2009 onwards.  It is envisaged that the full inventory of school building stock, when developed, would form another important layer of data to be used within the GIS system for forward planning purposes.  We are looking at ways of developing our information systems but progress will be limited by resources available both in the Planning and Building Unit and for further development of IT systems.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	443	The OECD PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment) 2006 survey of 15 years olds across 40 countries showed that Ireland's mean score in mathematics was not significantly different from the OECD average.  We ranked 16th of 30 OECD countries and 22nd of 57 countries.  There were fewer lower achievers and higher achievers than the OECD average, with the majority of pupils scoring in the mid range of achievement.  When performance levels for mathematics in 2006 are compared with those in 2000, there are no changes for Irish students. Ireland showed a high level of equity in achievement outcomes.  This is evidenced by relatively small levels of "between school" variation and comparatively good standards among lower achievers.I have recently launched a major initiative, Project Maths, designed to encourage better understanding of maths, to reinforce the practical relevance of maths to everyday life, and to ensure better continuity between primary and second level, and junior and senior cycle.  The initiative started in 2008 and is being piloted in 24 schools.  The curriculum changes will be phased in over three years and mainstreaming will begin in 2010, prefaced by a national programme of professional development for teachers beginning in 2009.Project Maths will be supported by intensive investment in professional development for teachers.  A Maths Support Team has been appointed and is currently supporting the project schools, as well as preparing for mainstream in-service development which will start in September 2009, followed by mainstream implementation starting in Sept 2010.  Some €3m has been provided for the programme in 2009 and the investment will continue over a number of years, to at least 2013, in a rolling programme of reform.I am aware of the calls for the introduction of bonus points for Higher Level Mathematics in the Leaving Certificate.  Decisions on the award of points and admission criteria for entry to higher education programmes are, under legislation, a matter for the higher education institutions.  My Department asked the Higher Education Authority to initiate a discussion across higher education institutions regarding the desirability or otherwise of awarding bonus points.  The overall view emerging was that the introduction of bonus points was unlikely to dramatically increase uptake of Higher Level Maths.  The Report of the Points Commission in 1999 considered the issue of bonus points and recommended against such an approach.Providing bonus points could reinforce the perception that Maths is a difficult subject.  It should be noted that when bonus points were removed in 1994 on foot of curricular reform, participation in Higher Level Maths increased.  We can therefore conclude that curriculum reform has more impact than points in this area. Introducing bonus points would inevitably lead to similar demands in other subjects such as science.  The education sector must cater for all students, and placing some subjects at a higher value, notwithstanding the importance of other sectors of the economy, and the abilities and interests and legitimate choices of students, could potentially be counterproductive to the overall interests of the system.

While there are currently no formal arrangements for the sharing of general resources or facilities it is open to schools to enter into local arrangements themselves e.g. in relation to pooling of existing ancillary grants so as to improve their level of secretarial or caretaker provision.  My Department remains open, of course, to considering any proposal from patrons or schools on other types of school clustering arrangements or inter-school co-operation that would result in improving the efficiency or effectiveness of existing levels of resources.

It is intended that maintenance of the Internationalisation Register, a function currently undertaken by my Department, will be handed over before the end of 2009.  In doing this, the NQAI will seek to strengthen the criteria for inclusion on the Register and ensure that such criteria complement the Authority's key functions in implementing the National Framework of Qualifications.  All stakeholders will be informed of any changes in this area and, in particular, adequate notice will be given of the introduction of strengthened criteria.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	446	The Deputy refers to the new regime for admission to medicine in the universities which came into operation this year. To be eligible to study medicine one must now attain a minimum of 480 points in the Leaving Certificate and sit a special admissions test. A combination of the Leaving Certificate CAO points and the marks in the admission test determine one's placing in the competition. Moreover, the matriculation requirements (pass in Irish, English and Mathematics) and the CAO points must be achieved in a single sitting of the Leaving Certificate examination.The admission requirements for any third level course are a matter for the relevant institution to determine independently and it would not be appropriate for the Minister to intervene in the arrangements, which in the case of medicine, was agreed by the representatives of the medical schools and approved by the Academic Councils of their respective institutions.  Part of the rationale for the new entry mechanism is to alleviate the pressure that was on those students wishing to study medicine to achieve near perfect Leaving Certificate results. One of the factors driving the high points required for courses such as medicine was the incidence of students repeating the Leaving Certificate to gain sufficient points to obtain a place.The practice had developed that once a student had met the basic matriculation requirements for medicine in one Leaving Certificate sitting they would elect to take other subjects, (sometimes perceived to be less difficult) in their repeat year, thereby increasing their chances of securing the points necessary. In any given year repeat students would obviously have an advantage over students doing the Leaving Certificate for the first time.  The new entry requirement addresses this issue and is considered to be more advantageous in general to students than those it replaces.  It is not open to the Minister to make an exception for repeat Leaving Cert students by exempting them from any of the new requirements. Such a move would also confer a fundamentally unfair advantage on such students over those sitting the Leaving Certificate for the first time in 2009.

The Government is investing unprecedented levels of public funding in higher education. In 2009 some €2 billion is being invested in our third level sector. In contributing to the achievement of national policy goals for social and economic development into the future, it can be anticipated that there will be continuing significant resource needs for the sector. It is appropriate to raise questions around how future additional resource needs can be met and in particular how our higher education institutions can be supported in their development ambitions through a widening of their non-exchequer sources of income. The introduction of a form of student contribution  is one possibility that merits debate.My Department, with the assistance of the Higher Education Authority (HEA), is at present conducting a review of policy options relating to the introduction of a form of student contribution. In this regard a range of options are being examined, including possibilities for alternative means of imposing a student contribution such as an income contingent loans system. There are many complex and competing considerations including costs that will fall to be taken into account by the Government in considering the available options. It is my intention, following completion of the review currently underway, to bring proposals to Government in relation to the available options.

Circular 0064/2008 invited applications from schools for the 2008/2009 school year.  Transition Year is optional for each school and a minority of schools do not offer Transition Year at all. In others it may be available as an optional programme for some pupils. Some schools, in deciding to offer the Programme, require all pupils to take the Programme in accordance with their curriculum provision across the school. This decision is made by the school authority.Schools providing the programme for the first time are required to register with the full-time Second Level Support Service which provides inservice training, advisory services, and website resources to support the programme. Schools have flexibility to devise their own programme within the framework of the general guidelines published by my Department.

These included the identification by the post-primary management bodies of  annual savings of €16 million on substitution costs and how these savings can be made not only in the current year and but on a continuing basis in future years.On foot of these proposals, I approved the interim arrangements for certain substitution cover in schools for the remainder of the current school year and the details are outlined in Circulars 0110/2008 and 0115/2008 which can be viewed on my Department's website.  The existing supervision/ substitution scheme continues to operate as heretofore.  It is a matter for the Board of Management of each school to ensure that all substitution cover required for the remainder of the 2008/2009 school year including cover for practical examinations is provided from the hours available under the interim arrangements and the supervision/substitution scheme.I also announced in December that in the period until the end of the school year, there will be a full review of the substitution and supervision scheme and related matters in conjunction with the school management bodies and teacher unions with a view to making up the additional expenditure and thereby ensuring that the budgetary parameters are met.  This review is now commencing.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	452	I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 to 64, inclusive, and 66 together.I very much regret the announced closure of the SR Technics operation at Dublin Airport.  My most recent meeting on the matter was on Thursday last, 19 February, with a delegation representing the Trade Union interests in the Dublin operation, who outlined their concerns.  Similar concerns have been relayed to me in the many approaches I have had from public representatives.The Government is anxious that as many jobs as possible are secured at Dublin Airport.  We would like to see the SR Technics Group do what it can to facilitate this, such as helping to promote the capabilities and skills available at the Dublin facility, agreeing to an orderly wind down of the facility to give IDA Ireland an opportunity to promote the location to interested parties, and maintaining assets and equipment at the site for at least 6 months.  There are a number of expressions of interest from different parties in possibly all or part of the business and time is needed to assess these proposals.  The Government is anxious that the facility and the workers will maintain their IAA approval status while the alternative proposals are being progressed.I am conveying these points, and the widespread concern in Ireland that every effort be made to maintain the maximum number of jobs at the facility at Dublin Airport, to SR Technics at Group level, as a follow-on to my meeting with the company on 11th February, when I was accompanied by my Secretary General and the Chief Executive of IDA.  I should add that a number of meetings had taken place between the State, its Agencies and the company in the past year.  The company had explained that it had been exploring all options for its Dublin operations, including sale to another party, but had not found it possible to proceed with any of these options.The company outlined the deterioration that had taken place in its global business since mid 2008, with contracts moving to Eastern Europe, Jordan, Turkey and Malta.  It confirmed that it was putting in place a 5 year restructuring plan and that it had already reduced its worldwide workforce by 500 in the last year.  The company stated that the recent loss of major contracts, its current business and economic forecasts, as well as its high cost-base and over capacity at Dublin airport, had made it impossible to continue a sustainable business in Dublin.  SR Technics provides line maintenance for the Aer Lingus fleet at their Dublin base.  This is a long-term contract awarded by Aer Lingus in 2008 following a competitive procurement process.  The Company had indicated that it hoped to assign this and other smaller operations to another operator, offering the potential of saving up to 200 jobs.IDA Ireland has had an ongoing relationship with the company over many years and approved a significant Training Grant package for the company in 2006 to assist the company in maximising efficiencies and improving competitiveness.  IDA also had discussions with the company in relation to its business plan and further opportunities to assist the company with additional financial incentives such as RD&I support with the emphasis on Innovation and Process Development.In the light of the announced closure of the Dublin plant, FÁS has been at the forefront in providing intervention and support to employees facing redundancy.  It is currently in contact with SR Technics Management to discuss the services available from FÁS and the potential needs of the employees.  Each response will be tailored on a case-by-case basis.  FÁS Services to Business Unit will also be involved in these consultations.  It is important to establish how best FÁS can assist the workers.  Following this initial contact, a judgement will be made in relation to the level of FÁS intervention required.As regards efforts to save some or all of the jobs involved, actual involvement by IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland in providing financial or other supports will be dependent on a company or companies submitting proposals for consideration and seeking approval for State support for an undertaking in the normal way.  In the meantime IDA Ireland are actively exploring options with interest parties.

The Tánaiste encouraged staff to pursue this issue through a determination before the Employment Appeals Tribunal and we both welcome the news that a number of staff have taken up this suggestion and would encourage all remaining eligible staff to do likewise.  Upon receipt of the EAT decision, and on the assumption that this is positive, my Department will, subject to the eligibility criteria being met, be in a position to pay the employees their statutory redundancy entitlements.  In that event, the Department will pursue the employer directly to recoup the monies paid.As regards the pursuit of complaints to the Rights Commissioner Service under the Payment of Wages Act, 1991, to which I drew attention in my response of 5 February, I am pleased also to note that a number of employees have decided to request hearings before the Rights Commissioners and I understand that a number of cases have now progressed to the hearing stage.Naturally, the Tánaiste and I are very concerned about the issues that have been raised in relation to this company.  The National Employment Rights Authority, (NERA) were recently requested to undertake an inspection at the company's premises and   although this did not yield a result in that there was no company presence in evidence, NERA is considering its further options in this regard.  In line with the type of joint inspection activity and information sharing which NERA undertakes with both the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social and Family Affairs, NERA has taken the opportunity to share information on the company with these bodies.  The Deputy may also wish to be aware that separately, and in light of the powers vested on the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE) under company law, the Tánaiste has also forwarded the matter to the ODCE for further consideration.I am satisfied that all relevant advice has been provided to staff in terms of the pursuit of all relevant avenues of redress to secure their employment rights entitlements.  Equally, the Tánaiste has undertaken follow-up action in relation to the company as outlined.

The Department of Social and Family Affairs are immediately referring to FÁS all redundant apprentices for assistance.  FÁS then through their Employment Services and Services to Business Divisions work in collaboration to provide guidance and support in sourcing a new employer and to consider further options.As an interim measure FÁS has amended the scheduling rules for off-the-job training to permit redundant apprentices to progress to their next off-the-job training, at Phase 2, Phase 4 and Phase 6, in accordance with the existing scheduling criteria.  It is expected that in excess of 1,200 redundant apprentices from all trades will receive off-the-job training this year.Redundant apprentices from all trades including the motor industry, may avail of FÁS existing specific skills training courses, which are trade related to enhance their employable skills and they can also avail of the range of trade related night courses, which are available in FÁS training centres.  Both the construction and electrical trades are the only family of trades which have specific support available to them at present in the form of the Employer Based Redundant Apprentice Rotation Scheme.  This scheme is limited to these trades as they have been most severely affected by the downturn in the construction sector and between them they account for the majority of apprentices currently in the apprenticeship system.  However, the Government and the various stakeholders will continue to consider other possible measures to assist redundant apprentices from all trades progressing their apprenticeships.

While this Department does not provide direct funding to business or start-ups it does provide funding to the various enterprise agencies.  In the absence of specific details on the nature of the plan, I have set out below the role of the County and City Enterprise Boards and that of Enterprise Ireland.  The individual concerned should, in the first instance, contact their local enterprise board, who will then advise how best to proceed further with their venture and in the event of not being able to assist them will re-direct them as appropriate.County and City Enterprise BoardsThe 35 County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) were set up in 1993 to provide support for small businesses with 10 employees or fewer (micro-enterprises) in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.  The CEBs deliver a series of Programmes to underpin this role and they can provide both financial and non-financial assistance to a project promoter.The forms of financial assistance which are available from the CEB network, subject to certain criteria, include Capital Grants, Employment Grants, and Feasibility Study Grants.  The provision of non-financial assistance can take the form of a wide range of business advice such as Programmes covering Business Management, Mentoring, E-commerce, Enterprise Education, and Women in Business networks.CEBs may provide grant assistance to micro-enterprises (10 employees maximum) in the start-up and expansion phases in manufacturing, tourism and services, provided the promoter can demonstrate that the project:is commercially viable;will not displace jobs elsewhere in the economy;will focus upon new initiatives in fields where they can best fill gaps rather than duplicate provision;will involve the creation of sustainable employment;requires grant assistance to enable the project to develop. However, Boards are required to give priority to enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector, which over time can develop into strong export entities and graduate to the Enterprise Ireland portfolio.Enterprise IrelandEnterprise Ireland has primary responsibility for Irish companies in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors.  It supports companies employing 10 or more people and start-up companies which have the potential to employ 10 or more people and reach or exceed €1m in exports over three years.  Encouraging and supporting innovation-led high potential start-up companies (HPSUs) with an export focus is a key priority for Enterprise Ireland and is fundamental to building the next generation of world-class Irish companies.  Enterprise Ireland offers a wide range of services, including financial and non-financial supports to companies with a business strategy that encompasses all elements required for business success.BASIS WebsiteFor information on the types of assistance available to businesses in Ireland the Deputy may also wish to contact the BASIS (Business Access to State Information and Services) Initiative (www.basis.ie) (Tel No: 01-6312787), which is administered by this Department.  The aim of the BASIS website is to deliver information on Government services to business.

The individual in question should contact her local FÁS employment office and avail of this service so that she may possibly source an employer who requires an apprentice painter.In addition any company that recruits this individual as an apprentice may also benefit from the FÁS bursary, which exists for employers who recruit female apprentices.  In order to encourage the participation of women in apprenticeship, FAS offers a bursary to encourage an increased level of recruitment by employers of female apprentices.  The bursary provides a total grant of €2,666.45 to each employer who recruits a female apprentice.  The aim of the bursary is to provide an incentive to employers to train and employ female apprentices.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	462	I understand that the Deputy is referring to the situation whereby penalties are imposed on customers with loans repayable at a fixed rate of interest who switch to variable rates.  The choice of mortgage product ultimately rests with the consumer in light of the terms and conditions that their lending institution offers. The decision of borrowers is influenced by factors such as their personal preferences and their own assessment of the relative merits of fixed and variable rate mortgages.  Generally mortgages are for long periods. To some consumers a fixed interest rate on a mortgage offers peace of mind in that the borrower benefits from certainty regarding the cost of their mortgage, does not need to be concerned with changes in mortgage interest rates and accordingly he or she can budget more confidently.As the Deputy will be aware, interest rates charged by banks generally vary in line with the base rate fixed by the European Central Bank (ECB) from time to time. Where a bank offers a fixed rate over a certain period it incurs additional costs in obtaining fixed or other funding in respect of the loan over the period. The additional costs will reflect both the market view in relation to future trends in interest rates for the period and the fact that longer term deposits generally attract higher interest rates than short term. In addition, where a consumer changes from a fixed interest rate contract to a variable rate contract before the end of the term for which the interest rate was fixed, there is an associated cost to the lender.In circumstances that lenders were prohibited from passing on this cost to borrowers switching to variable rates, this cost could increase the price and reduce the availability of fixed rate mortgages.  The Minister has no function in setting interest rates for banks covered by the guarantee scheme and I do not propose to introduce additional requirements as suggested.

The deduction applies to all remuneration, whether pensionable or otherwise.

The definition of a "public service pension scheme" is set out in section 1 of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill 2009.Officers appointed prior to 6 April 1995 do not pay explicit employee contributions in respect of their main scheme benefits. Those who only pay the 1.5% contribution to the spouses and children's scheme, receive approximately 5% less in their salary and their pension benefits are adjusted accordingly. It is reasonable in the circumstances that the new pension related deduction be applied to all public servants who enjoy the benefits of a public service pension — in terms of the enhanced terms and the greater security than the generality of private sector pensions.  The graduated approach to the payment was introduced to ameliorate somewhat the impact on the lower paid public servants.The draft Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill 2009 provides that no additional benefit is conferred by the pension related deduction.  It also provides for deductions to be repaid to those who leave the public service with no preserved pension benefit, i.e. with fewer than two years' service.  It would not be appropriate for me to discuss the content of legal advice received in the course of development of policy and preparation of draft legislation. I am happy that the legislation provides a fair and reasonable approach, given the difficult circumstances currently.

The question of whether a person is in receipt of a medical card is not relevant. The graduated approach to the payment is to ameliorate somewhat the impact on lower paid public servants.One must take the totality of the public service pension arrangements into account, including retirement lump sum and security when compared to the private sector.  In addition, the Government have sought to mitigate the effects on less well paid public servants through the tapering of the percentage reduction, to the greatest extent possible commensurate with the requirement to achieve savings of almost €1.35bn from the pension deduction.  The rate of deduction is 3% of remuneration on the first €15,000, 6% on the next €5,000 and 10% on the balance.

This tax did not apply to bona fide non-resident accounts and by seeking to simply apply a foreign address to an account it was sought to have these accounts designated as non-resident and thereby avoid the liability to DIRT. However, as the beneficial owners of the accounts were Irish residents DIRT should have been paid on these accounts.This issue has been examined in some detail by this House, the PAC and the Comptroller & Auditor General. The Revenue Commissioners have also carried out a detailed investigation into this matter and have to date recovered €864m for the Exchequer, of which €225m was paid by financial institutions for the non-operation of DIRT with the balance of €639m relating to taxpayers who had untaxed funds associated with these accounts.  The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that no evidence was seen by them in the course of the DIRT look-back audit programme that would support an investigation of an official of a financial institution with a view to prosecution.

Subsequently, I met a wide range of representatives from the betting industry where the problems faced by the sector, including those arising from the Budgetary changes, were discussed.  The Finance (No. 2) Act 2008 provides that the betting duty rate will be increased from 1% to 2% on 1 May 2009.  The Act also provides that, as happens in the case of other business expenses, betting duty paid by a bookmaker on bets made on or after 1 January 2009 will be allowed as a deduction in computing the amount of profits or losses of the bookmaking business for Income Tax or Corporation Tax purposes.  As I stated during the Finance Bill process, I intend to look at an overhaul of the betting tax regime for next year's Budget and Finance Bill.

He applied for a Tax Clearance Certificate on 12 January 2009 and he was informed that it could not be granted because he had not filed his 2007 Income Tax return (which was due to be filed on/before 31 October 2008).  He filed the necessary return on 5 February 2009 and this gave rise to a tax liability of €278.30 for 2007 which he has not yet paid.  Upon payment of his outstanding 2007 liability, a Tax Clearance Certificate will issue to him without delay.

While Ireland's current agreement is based on Hague principles, there is a need to elaborate the Agreement to reflect the standards of the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption more comprehensively. This is in line with Ireland's own commitment to ratify the Hague Convention. It is also relevant to reflect the experiences gained by both sides over the first five years of a formal relationship between the two States.This approach is also part of the preparations for new adoption legislation in which it is proposed that a bilateral agreement will be required between Ireland and any State which has not ratified the Hague Convention. The Socialist Republic of Vietnam has not yet ratified the Convention.  Officials travelled to Vietnam in November, 2008 to meet with the relevant authorities dealing with intercountry adoption as well as the embassies of other governments to discuss intercountry adoption in Vietnam and progress towards ratification more generally.In December 2008, following a Government decision on the matter, the Irish Government issued a formal request to the Vietnamese Authorities advising that the Government wished to enter into discussions immediately for the purpose of negotiating a new bilateral adoption Agreement to follow on from the existing Agreement. In order to expedite the negotiation process, Ireland offered to provide the Vietnamese Authorities with the text of a draft agreement as a basis for negotiations. The Vietnamese authorities responded positively to Ireland's request to enter into formal negotiations and the proposal that Ireland would prepare a first draft.Work on a draft agreement requires careful and detailed consideration by a number of parties including the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Attorney General's Office and the Adoption Board. An initial text was prepared by my Office in December and the draft is now at an advanced stage. It will be finalised shortly once legal advices have been received on outstanding matters. It is anticipated that this will be forwarded to the Vietnamese Authorities for their consideration in the immediate future.The issue of contingency arrangements in the case of an Agreement not being reached by 1 May, 2009 was raised by the Government in a December 2008 communication to the Vietnamese. The Vietnamese authorities formally advised on proposed contingency arrangements on Friday, 13 February, through the Irish Embassy in Hanoi. My Office subsequently prepared and circulated a public information note on the contingency plans to prospective adoptive parents through the Helping Hands Adoption Mediation Agency and the adoption support groups. I want to emphasise  that these are contingency plans in the event of an Agreement not being reached by 1 May 2009. My officials and I are continuing to pursue the successful conclusion of a bilateral agreement with Vietnam as a priority. The Irish government will continue to seek to re-visit the contingency arrangements which have been put in place over the course of and in light of negotiations on a new agreement.I feel obliged to remind the House that the Socialist Republic of Vietnam is a sovereign state and decisions it makes regarding the internal regulation and management of the adoption of its children must be treated sensitively as appropriate to a sovereign state. I respectfully suggest that demands for guarantees or changes to contingency arrangements are matters which fall to be dealt with as part of the negotiation process on a bilateral basis. At this stage,  I cannot pre-empt either Governments' deliberative process as those negotiations advance. My priority is to advance the process and avoid debate outside of that process which could  potentially jeopardise or interfere with discussions with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.I can assure the Deputies that the work to prepare for and advise the Government on this issue and to implement the Government's decisions has been given, and continues to be given the highest priority.  These are complex matters which require careful consideration. At all times, the Government, and I, and the officials advising us, are guided by the need to respect and protect the best interests and rights of the child.

These contracts reflect the agreed outcome of negotiations between my Department and the GP representative body, the Irish Medical Organisation.  Both contract types contain provisions relating to the  retirement age.  The Capitation contract  provides that GPs who entered into contracts on the date of its commencement could hold the contract up to age 70 and that all subsequent GP contractors could hold the contract up to age 65.  The Fee per Item contract terminates upon the GP reaching 70 years of age.General Practitioners being self-employed contractors may, subject to continued registration with the Medical Council, continue to practise and to treat private patients following retirement from the GMS Scheme.  In the context of a  review of the contractual arrangements for the provision of services under the GMS Scheme and other publicly funded schemes, I have asked my Department, in conjunction with the HSE, to examine provisions relating to the age at which GPs must cease to hold contracts.

Funding expanded from €35.5m in 2004 to €52m in 2008. While this funding has allowed for some expansion in the sector including the roll out of a number of sections of the Youth Work Act, 2001 and actions cited in the National Youth Work Development Plan, there has been a growing emphasis on consolidation of services.It is intended that the 2009 Youth Affairs budget of over €48m will continue to focus on supporting existing youth programmes and services for young people including those with fewer opportunities. I have met with the National Youth Council of Ireland (NYCI), which represents some 50 youth organisations, and am aware of the valuable work carried out by the youth work sector, including its strong volunteer base, both in the particular areas referred to by the Deputies as well as across the country.   I wish to assure the Deputies that every effort will be made to minimise the impact of the reduction in funding available to the youth sector and to preserve and maintain existing provision in so far as is possible.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	476	Tackling Health Care Associated Infections (HCAIs), including MRSA, continues to be a priority for the Government and the Health Service Executive (HSE).  HCAIs are not a new phenomenon and have always been a potential complication of medical treatment, especially in hospitals.  This is the case worldwide.  It should be noted that if a patient is diagnosed with a bloodstream infection at a given hospital, it does not indicate that the infection was acquired at that hospital.  Many bloodstream infections are acquired in the community but only diagnosed upon admission to hospital.  Also a patient may have acquired the infection in one hospital but the infection may be diagnosed on transfer to another hospital.A new National Surveillance System has been established by the HSE to collect data and provide information on a quarterly basis to monitor HCAIs in our health system.  This data has been compiled and published for 2006, 2007 and the first 3 quarters of 2008.  There follows in table format an extract of the relevant information for the Deputy, taken from the recent reports of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre.  The table gives the number of MRSA cases by acute public hospital for 2007 and the first 9 months of 2008.  Most of the variation in reported numbers of S. aureus bloodstream infections between hospitals can be explained by differences in hospital size, activity and patient populations.  At present there is no way to adjust the data to allow for these differences and hence direct comparisons between hospitals are not possible.The overall proportion of MRSA was lower in 2007 (38.5%) compared to 2006 (42.4%) and the most recent figures show that MRSA infections for the first nine months of 2008 have fallen by 3.8% compared with the same period in 2007 and 7.2% when compared with 2006.  Other measures taken to reduce the incidence of HCAIs generally include the appointment of additional infection control staff, education campaigns for healthcare staff and the general public around the prudent use of antibiotics and the use of designated private beds for isolation purposes where required for patients who contract HCAIs.  In addition, new environmental building guidelines to inform infection control policy in all new builds and refurbishments have recently been published by the HSE.  I am satisfied that significant steps are being taken to reduce the rates of HCAIs generally and to treat them promptly when they occur.Acute Public HospitalTotal number of isolates of MRSA 2007Total number of isolates of MRSA First 3 quarters of 2008Adelaide, Meath and National Children’s Hospital, Tallaght, Dublin1822Bantry General Hospital81Beaumont Hospital (including St. Joseph’s Hospital, Raheny), Dublin5037Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital, Dublin00Cavan General Hospital91Children’s University Hospital, Temple Street, Dublin00Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, Dublin145Coombe Women’s Hospital, Dublin21Cork University Hospitala3916Galway University HospitalscN/A35Erinville Hospital, CorkaN/AKerry General Hospital, Tralee1613Letterkenny General Hospital, Donegal1315Lourdes Orthopaedic Hospital, Kilcreene00Louth County Hospital, Dundalk13Mallow General Hospital, Co.

All interest to be repaid since 2005 is retained in the Patient Private Property Fund as unallocated income and is available for distribution. The HSE is currently reviewing the cost implications of making these payments.  The HSE is also finalising a proposal to repay any interest owed as a result of interest retained by former Health Boards prior to 2005. While retained interest in respect of some of this period is in the PPP fund, the cost implications of any proposal are also being reviewed. When agreed, the HSE will then be in a position to commence making any necessary repayments.The 2008 National PPP accounts are currently being prepared and audited. When complete these accounts will be laid before the Oireachtas. As at 31st December 2007 the HSE managed €153.3m in PPP funds on behalf of clients. It is expected that the value of PPP funds held at 31st December 2008 will be approx. €200m.  The HSE levies a charge for the operation of the PPP accounts maintained at the PPPA Central Unit, Tullamore. The charge commenced in November 2008. The charge is set at 20% of interest earned on invested funds and is levied weekly in arrears. The HSE's authority to levy this charge is derived from the introduction of the Health (Repayment Scheme) (Charges for administering Patients' Private Property Accounts) Regulations 2007. There is no charge for any PPP accounts held locally at Care Centres. The total charge levied in 2008 amounted to €133,037.During 2008, interest of €4.167m was earned on invested PPP funds managed by the PPPA Central Unit. This interest is assigned directly to client PPP accounts each week. Audited figures for interest earned on other invested PPP funds during 2008 are not yet available. During 2007, total interest of €4.612m was earned on behalf of clients.

The matter will be dealt with by the E.U. under the 2005 European Union Ecodesign of Energy-Using Products Directive. This Directive is under the remit of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.The European Commission's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) investigated the claim that symptoms of several diseases may be aggravated in the presence of energy saving lamps, mainly Compact Fluorescent Lamps or CFLs. The Committee did identify Ultra Violet or UV/blue light radiation as a potential  risk factor for the aggravation of light-sensitive symptoms in some patients with certain chronic diseases. It further stated that it had been observed that some single-envelope CFLs emit UVB and traces of UVC radiation. Under extreme conditions — i.e  prolonged exposures at distances of under 20 centimetres — these CFLs may lead to UV exposures approaching the workplace limit set to protect workers from skin and retinal damage. The SCENIHR notes that the use of double-envelope energy saving bulbs or similar technology would largely or entirely mitigate both the risk of approaching these workplace limits and the risk of aggravating the symptoms of light-sensitive individuals.As part of the regulatory process mentioned above, the European Commission will take into account the health and safety of the user in setting the energy efficiency requirement for household lamps. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will consult with my Department regarding any health issues arising.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	487	The Health Act 2008 provided for the removal of the automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons aged 70 and over.  A new and very much simplified system of assessment for eligibility was introduced in respect of persons aged 70 and over, based on gross income rather than net income, as applies otherwise for means-testing of eligibility for medical cards.  The simplified approach taken for persons aged 70 and over who held a medical card prior to 31st December 2008 is close to a self-assessment system. In introducing the measures, I emphasised my belief in the honesty and integrity of the vast majority of older persons in our society.There are measures in the legislation that allow for the sharing of data between State agencies and the Health Service Executive (HSE) to allow the HSE to verify in any particular case if the person has income, as declared, under the gross income limit.  Long-standing provisions of the Health Act 1970, as amended, continue to apply. For instance, there is a requirement for a person to notify the HSE of any change in his/her circumstances which would render him/her ineligible for services. In addition, when a person has obtained a service and it is later ascertained that he/she was not entitled to the service, the HSE may charge the individual for any services provided to him/her for the period for which he/she had no entitlement.  The Health Act 2008 provides that the HSE shall provide any necessary supports to any person aged 70 or over in the making of an application for a medical card where, by reason of any incapacity, such person requests such assistance.

The PRA replaces the Registrar of Deeds and Titles as the registering authority in relation to property registration in Ireland and, subject to the above Act, is independent in the performance of its functions.  The Deputy will be aware of the service to TDs and Senators which provides information on the current status of applications which was introduced in May 2006.  The service provides a speedier, more efficient and more cost effective alternative to submitting Parliamentary Questions.  It is operated by the PRA and is available all year round.  I understand that the PRA has now provided the Deputy with the information requested.

Therefore the figure for Orders effected vis-à-vis Orders signed in a specific year is a “live” figure and subject to ongoing up-dating.

In the prison setting PE affords prisoners the opportunity to take control of one aspect of their daily life — their physical well-being — with the potential knock-on effect of increasing their motivation and confidence to tackle other identified issues such as substance abuse, taking up educational or workshop opportunities.  It is also recognised that physical education, sport and recreation also play a significant role in the management of prison life by providing positive outlets for energy.

Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 6 June 2008, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him. He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e. why he should not be deported.His case was then examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended, on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to representations submitted on his behalf by his legal representative for permission to remain in the State. On 4 February 2009, I refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of him. Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring the person concerned to present himself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on Tuesday 10 March 2009 in order to make travel arrangements for his removal from the State.I am satisfied that the application made for temporary leave to remain in the State together with all refoulement issues, were fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport him is justified.  The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.

Notice of this Order was served by registered letter dated 20 May 2005 requiring the person concerned to present himself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) on 7 June 2005 in order to make travel arrangements for his deportation from the State.The person concerned initiated Judicial Review Proceedings challenging the Deportation Order.  These Proceedings were determined on 28 February 2006 with the outcome being that the Judicial Review Leave Application was refused by the High Court. On 26 January 2007, the person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (Statutory Instrument No. 518 of 2006). This application was not considered because the person concerned, as a person subject to a Deportation Order, did not have an automatic entitlement to make an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State. This decision was challenged in the High Court by the person concerned, on 22 March 2007, through the medium of Judicial Review Proceedings.On 5 November 2007 the legal representative of the person concerned was notified by Officials in my Department of the recent High Court judgments which held that the Minister had a discretion under Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (Statutory Instrument No. 518 of 2006) to accept and consider an application for Subsidiary Protection from persons who did not have an automatic right to apply and, in light of this, the legal representative of the person concerned was invited, on their client's behalf, to make an application under Regulation 4(2) of the aforementioned Regulations.An application under Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (Statutory Instrument No. 518 of 2006) was subsequently received on behalf of the person concerned.  Following consideration of this application, the person concerned was notified, in writing, that the Minister had decided not to exercise his discretion to accept and consider the Subsidiary Protection application.   He was further notified that, in light of this decision, the Garda National Immigration Bureau had been requested to proceed with the enforcement of the Deportation Order.On 27 August 2008 an application to revoke the Deportation Order, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 (11) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), was received in my Department on behalf of the person concerned. This application is under consideration in my Department at present.  When a decision has been made on this application, this decision, and the consequences of the decision, will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.

On the 6th October 2008 the application was refused. A letter was issued to the persons concerned by General Immigration Division on 4th December 2008 but no reply was received.  On 24th February 2009, the Immigration Division issued notices of intention to deport to the persons in question. In the notice letters, the persons concerned have been advised that they are entitled to make written representations to me setting out reasons as to why they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.

The Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner made a determination that the asylum application of the person concerned be ‘deemed to be withdrawn' as she did not attend at that Office within five working days of her arrival in the State nor did she notify that Office of her address in the State at that time.  The person concerned subsequently claimed asylum in the United Kingdom using another identity. Arising from the UK asylum application, a request was received from the UK authorities, on 18 March 2005, that this State ‘take back' the person concerned in accordance with Article 16(1)(c) of the Dublin II Regulation [Council Regulation (EC) No. 343/2003] on the basis that an earlier asylum application had been made in this State. Ireland agreed to accept responsibility and the person concerned was formally transferred to Ireland by the UK authorities.In accordance with Section 17(1A) of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 26 July 2005, re-issued on 10 August 2005, that, based on the recommendation of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, the Minister had decided to refuse her a declaration as a refugee.  In addition she was notified that, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.

The Deputy might wish to note that the person concerned also sought to be re-admitted to the asylum process in accordance with the provisions of Section 17(7) of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended).  Following consideration of this application, a decision was taken to refuse the application and this decision was notified to the person concerned by letter dated 29 July 2005.

His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  The person concerned was informed by letter dated 22 January 2003 that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him and afforded him three options in accordance with Section 3(3)(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a Deportation Order or to submit, within 15 working days, written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.His case was examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to representations submitted on his behalf for permission to remain in the State. On 12 July 2004 one of my predecessors refused permission to remain temporarily in the State and instead signed a Deportation Order in respect of him. Notice of this order was served by registered post requiring the person concerned to present himself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13-14 Burgh Quay on Tuesday 10 August 2004 in order to make travel arrangements for his removal from the State. He failed to comply with his reporting requirements and was classified as evading his deportation.By letter dated 26 August 2008, the legal representative of the person concerned lodged an application for Subsidiary Protection pursuant to the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 — Statutory Instrument No. 518 of 2006. By letter dated 10 September 2008 the legal representative of the person concerned was invited to make an application under Regulation 4(2) of the aforesaid Regulations setting out any new facts or circumstances relevant to the person concerned, or his country of origin, which had arisen since the original decision to deport was made and which related to a possible entitlement to Subsidiary Protection. A condition of this letter was that any representations were subject to a deadline of 10 working days from the date of the letter.No representations were received within the specified timeline and a decision was taken to issue a further letter dated 28 October 2008 requesting the lodgement of representations and, on that occasion, affording a timeline of 5 working days for the receipt of same. As no representations were forthcoming, a final letter dated 4 December 2008 issued to the legal representative of the person concerned advising that the GNIB had been informed to proceed with the enforcement of the Deportation Order.  The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.  The enforcement of the Deportation Order is an operational matter for the GNIB.

The daughter of the person concerned wrote to the Immigration Division of my Department on 7 October 2008 seeking, on behalf of her father, an extension of his permission to remain in the State.  Following consideration of this request, my Department decided that her father's circumstances did not warrant an extension of his C-Visit Visa period and this position was conveyed in writing to the daughter of the person concerned by letter dated 12 January 2009.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 18 February 2009, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him, as he was a person whose deportation would, in the opinion of the Minister, be conducive to the common good.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  The 15 working day period referred to expires on 12 March 2009.  It is open to the person concerned to submit representations within that period.  In any event, a final decision on the case will not be made prior to the expiry of the 15 working day period referred to.

Irish citizens require a visa to enter Yemen and the information on the process is available on the website of the Yemeni Embassy http://www.yemenembassy.org.uk/ in London, including the application form.  The website indicates that it usually takes 5 working days to process an application and that it can be arranged by post.I would recommend that the person in question applies for a visa through the website.  In the event of any further difficulty I would urge him to make contact with the Consular Division of the Department (01 4780822) to provide further assistance.  I would strongly recommend to tourists that they obtain their visas before departing on holiday, so that they can be confident there won't be any difficulties following their arrival.  As the Deputy will be aware my Department encourages Irish citizens travelling to remote locations to register their contact details on the Departmental on-line travel registration facility, www.dfa.ie and also that as a citizen of an EU Member State and where there is no resident Irish mission he/she is entitled to seek consular assistance from any other EU mission in that country.  I would greatly appreciate if the Deputy could communicate that information to the person mentioned by him.

The Scheme does not provide for training to assist in reskilling, nor is it intended to.My Department also manages the LEADER element of the Rural Development Programme, which is implemented throughout the country by Local Action Groups.  This includes funding towards training activities in rural areas.  While such training does not cover mainstream vocational education or training geared to the general labour market, it does support training for rural communities in implementing the Programme's various measures. In addition, the Programme offers support to farm families in diversifying into non-agricultural activities.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	537	This issue was the subject of a High Court judgement concerning the rights of a person, who has undergone gender reassignment surgery, to recognition of her acquired gender.  On foot of a High Court judgment, delivered on 19 October 2007, the judge made a declaration, pursuant to Section 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003, that Sections 25, 63 and 64 of the Civil Registration Act 2004 are incompatible with the obligations of the State under the European Convention on Human Rights by reason of their failure to respect the private life of the Applicant, as required by Article 8 of the Convention, in that there are no provisions which would enable the acquired gender identity of the Applicant to be legally recognised in this jurisdiction.This is the first time that the High Court has made a declaration of incompatibility with the European Convention on Human Rights in respect of a provision of Irish law.  As such, the High Court judgement is very significant and raises complex and far-reaching issues, not merely for this case but for future cases under the European Convention on Human Rights Act.  The judgment has implications for a wide range of legislative and policy areas including taxation, social welfare, pensions, family law, criminal law, equality, employment, sport, financial services, health, education and so on.  As the judgment is the subject of an appeal to the Supreme Court, it is not considered appropriate for me to comment in detail at this time, other than to say that I am keeping the matter under review.

His payment is based on a personal rate of €204.30 and a qualified adult allowance of €135.60 less weekly means of €305.00, derived from benefit from his partner's insurable employment.  He has appealed this decision and his case has been forwarded to the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office for determination.  Under Social Welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	539	Workers are insured under the Social Welfare Acts as either employed or self-employed contributors.  All workers, both employed and self-employed, are obliged to pay PRSI contributions as a percentage of their personal reckonable income.  The range of benefits and pensions to which different groups of workers may establish entitlement reflects the risks associated with the nature of their work.  This in turn reflects the rate of contribution payable.  Self-employed persons aged between 16 and 66 years are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 3% and are consequently eligible for a narrower range of benefits than general employees who, together with their employers, pay a total social insurance contribution of 14.05%, excluding levies, under the full-rate PRSI Class A.  These contributions provide entitlement to a range of contingency-based payments under various social insurance schemes.PRSI Class S contributors are entitled to the following payments:the Widow's or Widower's (Contributory) Pension;the Guardian's Payment (Contributory);the State Pension (Contributory);Maternity Benefit;Adoptive Benefit, andthe Bereavement Grant.Self-employed workers are not insured against short-term benefits such as illness and jobseeker's payments — these are only available to persons covered by PRSI Classes A, E, H and P.  This reflects the need for coverage for various contingencies, the rate of contributions that self-employed persons pay, the practicalities of administering and controlling access to short-term payments, and the annualised system of contributions that these same persons enjoy.  A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within a social insurance context is common in other European social protection systems.Whilst it is not possible for Class S contributors to pay additional PRSI in order to extend cover for short-term benefits, they may however apply for the means-tested Jobseeker's Allowance.  Their means would be taken as any net profit that they will earn in the coming 12 months.  While their income from the previous twelve months is used as an indication in estimating their likely future earnings, it is not simply assumed that the previous year's earnings will be received in the coming year. Instead, account is taken of the potential for significant upward or downward variations in income from one year to the next.

It is designed to support people who would not otherwise be able to return to the workforce for financial reasons.  There are two strands to the scheme, the back to work allowance (BTWA) for persons who take up employment and the back to work enterprise allowance (BTWEA) for persons who become self employed.In order to be eligible for the receipt of back to work enterprise allowance the applicant must be in receipt of a qualifying payment for a specific length of time immediately prior to commencing employment.  A recipient is allowed to keep a portion of their social welfare payment for 4 years without having to pay tax or PRSI on it.  To qualify, a person must be setting up a business that a Partnership Company or a Department Facilitator has approved in writing and in the case of a persons getting Jobseekers Benefit or Jobseekers Allowance they must be in receipt of a payment for at least 2 years.The requirement to be in receipt of a relevant social welfare payment for a minimum period has always been a feature of the scheme.  The Department's locally based Facilitator's provide information on options available to people trying to set up their own business.  Facilitators can be contacted through the Social Welfare Local Offices network.  The Department will continue to monitor the effectiveness of the back to work scheme to ensure that it continues to assist those furthest from the labour market.

The yearly value of property and capital is assessed on a notional basis.  In the case of property, the market value is established and any outstanding mortgages on that property are deducted before assessment.  The first €20,000 of combined capital and property is then disregarded (€50,000 in the case of disability allowance and €5,000 in the case of supplementary welfare allowance), and the balance is assessed by reference to a formula.  The value of property such as the family home, land farmed by the person as well as commercial premises used in the course of the business of the claimant is not assessed.  Any changes to the current arrangements would have to be considered in a Budgetary context and in the light of available resources.

As in previous years, it will be a matter for each local authority to decide on the specific level of funding to be directed towards each of the schemes, from within the combined allocation notified to them by my Department, and to manage the operation of the schemes in their areas from within this allocation.The schemes are funded by 80% recoupment available from my Department together with a 20% contribution from the resources of the local authority.  The old Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grant Schemes are funded by 67% recoupment available from my Department together with a 33% contribution from the resources of the local authority.  Total expenditure in respect of the Housing Adaptation Grants for Older People and People with a Disability and the Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grant Schemes, in 2008, amounted to €94.9 million.  The total amounts recouped by my Department to each local authority in respect of each grant scheme in 2008 are outlined in the attached table.The total estimated demand by local authorities for the operation of the Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability in 2009 is approximately €147m.

A public consultation process has been completed, and account is being taken of submissions received from the public and key stakeholders.  While there is already a wide range of measures in place to deal with noise from a variety of sources, I intend that the new legislation will take a more integrated approach to noise pollution.  There will be a greater emphasis on codes of practice for construction, commercial and domestic situations.  Local authorities will have stronger enforcement powers to deal with nuisances from particular noise sources such as continuously sounding alarms, and I also see the need to extend the powers of the Garda Síochána in certain circumstances.  There will, in addition, be measures to increase awareness of noise nuisance and of how it can be remedied.I am also examining the role mediation may have in the case of neighbours in dispute over high noise levels.  However, currently, under an inexpensive simplified procedure in the district court, any person may seek an order to have noise causing annoyance abated. The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation. A guide to these noise regulations including the simplified procedure can be downloaded from the following web address:http://www.environ.ie/en/Environment/NoiseIssuesConsultationPaper/PublicationsDocuments/ FileDownLoad,1319,en.pdf

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	562	The arrangements for REPS 4 are derived from new EU Regulations governing the current rural development programming period.  The provisions of these Regulations are different in significant respects from those governing the previous period.  In addition, and notwithstanding the fact that no such criticisms had been voiced during numerous previous audits, auditors from both the European Commission and the European Court of Auditors commented adversely in early 2008 on a number of aspects of my Department's procedures for processing REPS applications.In the light of the provisions of the new Regulations and the auditors' comments, it was necessary to make significant changes to my Department's procedures.  In particular, it was necessary to develop systems for exhaustive checks on all applications including farm plans.  Under the new Regulations, the first part of each year's payment, which is 75%, can be made only when all administrative checks on all 2008 applications for REPS 4 and the Single Payment Scheme are completed. These include checks on areas and on the plan details.Many REPS 4 plans have been prepared using eREPS, the electronic planning system approved and funded by my Department.  The information on these plans is in computerised format and it was necessary to develop an appropriate computer based control system for checking these plans. This was a lengthy process and the system was only available from late autumn.  However a substantial minority of plans submitted were not prepared using eREPS.  Administrative checks on these have to be done manually and are extremely time-consuming.  An effect of industrial action in my Department's local offices last year was that this process was delayed.  In these circumstances my Department sought some flexibility from the European Commission which would have allowed payment of those REPS 4 cases which had been fully cleared, but the Commission were not prepared to allow this.  The first payments for 2008 REPS 4 applications issued in the last week of January to those whose applications required no correction following the administrative checks.  Further payments continue to be made as applications are cleared.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	569	New rules restricting fishing vessels' days at sea in the Irish Sea and the waters to the northwest of Ireland and Scotland have been introduced as part of the EU's revised Cod Recovery Plan.  The plan has introduced a new system of effort management that sets effort ceilings (expressed in kilowatt-days) for groups of vessels or fleet segments.  The management of these ceilings has been devolved to the national level.  Member States have received annual allocations of fishing effort for the areas covered by the Plan, which include the Irish Sea (ICES area VIIa) and the waters to the northwest of Ireland and Scotland (ICES area VIa).  The effort allocation levels were established by the EU Fisheries Council on the basis of an EU Commission proposal.  They were calculated by averaging the fishing activity levels of each Member State in the areas during a reference period of 2004-2006 or 2005-2007 and then reducing that effort by 25%.  This methodology means there is now limited fishing effort available for all Community vessels, including Irish vessels, fishing in the designated areas.Under the plan, each Member State is required to introduce a licensing regime to manage its effort allocations.  Any vessel longer than 10 metres overall must have an authorisation from its Member State in order to operate in one of the designated areas using the fishing gears covered by the plan.  Member States can decide on the method of allocating their national pools of fishing effort, which are broken down by fishing gear type.  Following consultations with representatives of the Irish fishing industry, a pilot system of authorisations and allocations of fishing effort was introduced for the period from 1 February to 30 April 2009.The pilot scheme used the following approach to allocate fishing effort in areas VIa and VIIa to Irish vessels for the pilot management period of 1 February to 30 April 2009:The track records of vessels operating in VIa and VIIa during the reference period of 2005-2008 were assessed to determine their eligibility to receive an authorisation to fish and an allocation of days-at-sea under the pilot scheme.  Each vessel's "best year" of fishing days in the areas during the reference period was used to establish its track record.Distribution bands were established for each of the specified gear types to facilitate the allocation of days-at-sea to vessels based on their track records with those gears.  Each vessel's level of track record with a gear type fit into one of the distribution bands for that gear type.  The vessel then was allocated the number days-at-sea for that gear which were associated with that distribution band.The days-at-sea allocations for the first management period (1 February to 30 April 2009) were given on a pro-rata basis for each gear type based on Irish vessels' traditional fishing pattern with the gears in the area during that those months (e.g., if the months were traditionally very busy for a gear type, a higher portion of days-at-sea were allocated for that gear).The allocations for vessels using beam trawls for the period 1 February to 30 April were determined on this basis.  I appreciate that the introduction of these new conservation measures are a challenge and I have established a Steering Group involving the Federation of Irish Fishermen (FIF), the Department and agencies to provide support to the industry in relation to the practical implementation of these new measures.  The effort allocations already made were done on a pilot basis only and I am happy to make amendments where proposed by the Federation of Irish Fishermen (FIF) within the legal framework that has been established.

The Strategic Plan for the Development of the Forestry Sector in Ireland ‘Growing for the Future,' sets a target for forest cover of 17% of the total land area to be achieved by 2035.  Over the period of the National Development Plan, 2007 to 2013, the short-term objective is to grow annual planting to 10,000 hectares per annum. While the average rate of planting over the last three years was 7,000 hectares per year, almost 110,000 hectares of new forests have been planted under my Department's Afforestation Scheme over the past 10 years.  At the end of 2008 the national forest estate comprised of approximately 730,000 hectares, or 10.5% of the land area of the country.Planting of trees is supported by my Department through the current suite of Afforestation Grant and Premium Schemes. The establishment grant covers 100% of the planting costs, while the annual forestry premium is payable to farmers for 20 years. Both the grant and premium rates have been reviewed in recent times and increased to make the scheme more attractive.  The expansion of Ireland's forest estate has been a policy objective of successive Irish Governments and this Government is committed to maintaining that policy.

The Minister for Health & Children has overall responsibility for the general food labelling legislation.  Under the general labelling Directive (2000/13/EC), the place of origin of the foodstuff must be given only if its absence might mislead the consumer to a material degree.   The European Commission is currently undertaking a major review of all food labelling legislation. In this context the Commission has prepared draft revised labelling regulations and these are being discussed at Council Working Party level in Brussels.  These draft regulations will be submitted to the EU Council of Health Ministers during 2009.Notwithstanding the outcome of the current review on origin labelling my Department had taken steps to try to introduce origin labelling for meats other than beef, which is already subject to specific legislation since September 2000.  It should be noted that there are EU Regulations, which provide for the labelling of unprocessed poultry meat at retail level. The Regulations require such poultry meat to be labelled with the information regarding class, price, condition, registered number of slaughterhouse or cutting plant and, where imported from a Third Country, an indication of country of origin.My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children, drafted regulations that would require the country of origin to be indicated on pigmeat, poultry and sheepmeat. This was notified to the EU Commission in December 2007 as required by legislation.  The Commission was not prepared to adopt the draft regulations in their present format on the grounds that the proposed legislation is not in compliance with EU food labelling regulations.  The Commission's main contention is that only harmonised rules with EU-wide applicability may be applied to food labelling other than in exceptional circumstances.   In March, the EU Commission delivered a negative opinion on the regulations but afforded Ireland an opportunity to provide further information in support of them. In the meantime, the Department provided additional details including the current misleading labelling practices and evidence of consumers' desire for country of origin labelling. However the EU Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health formally adopted the negative opinion in December 2008.We will continue to pursue this issue at EU level in the context of the current review. It should also be noted that products carrying the Bord Bia quality assurance label provide consumers with assurance on product origin.

This includes over 10,000 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) — compared with just 300 in 1997. As the Deputy will be aware, applications for SNA support may be considered by the National Council for Special Education where a pupil has a significant medical need for such assistance and where there are identified care needs arising from a diagnosed disability.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.SNAs and teachers have separate yet complementary roles. SNAs provide care support to pupils with special educational needs who have been assessed as having such needs while teachers deliver education to the pupils. I have no plans, at present, to extend the SNA role to that of a para-educator. The Deputy is also aware that a Value for Money and Policy Review of the Special Needs Assistant scheme is currently being undertaken by my Department. The Value for Money and Policy Review Initiative is part of a framework introduced to secure improved value for money from public expenditure. The objectives of the review are to analyse Exchequer spending in a systematic manner and to provide a basis on which more informed policy decisions can be made. It is one of a range of modernisation initiatives aimed at moving public sector management away from the traditional focus on inputs to concentrate on the achievement of outcomes. To support the overall process, the review will include engagement with parent representatives, schools, education partners and other representative groups. It is expected that the review will be completed by the end of 2009.

Accordingly, they must be assessed under the prescribed terms of the HEG Scheme relevant to their year of entry.  As the candidate did not meet the nationality requirement prescribed under the relevant Scheme, he/she is ineligible for  higher education grant assistance.

The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements. Even with the budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.I fully accept that these decisions are not of themselves desirable and that they can only be justified by the imperative of securing the future economic stability of the country. I have called for co-operation from all the education partners in meeting the challenges facing us both as an education community and as a country.

The schedule is a transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and fairly and know where they stand.Under a system that allocates additional teachers at different step points under a common schedule it is a fact of life that one single pupil change in enrolment can cause a school to lose or gain a teacher. In recent years when improvements were being  made to the staffing schedule it was also the case that there were winners and losers depending on individual enrolment profiles. If I were to change the staffing schedule to allow the schools that are due to lose a teacher to retain that teaching post I would be treating them differently from other schools with the exact same number on the rolls and I do not propose to do so.I have a responsibility to ensure that whatever the overall level of allocation the system for allocating teachers to schools is transparent and fair where everyone knows where they stand and each school knows that it is getting the same number of mainstream class teachers as the school up the road with similar enrolment. The system should not create anomalies or operate on the basis that one or more schools should be treated differently to others.The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedule. The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.

The schedule is a transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and fairly and know where they stand.The staffing schedule also makes provision for schools that are projecting significantly increased enrolments for September 2009 through the allocation of what are known as "developing posts". These classroom teaching posts are allocated to schools based on projected enrolments for September 2009 rather than on past enrolments for September 2008 which is the case for most schools.  This allocation process for developing posts takes places during the Spring and Summer period when schools apply to the Department based on their projected enrolments for September 2009. The developing posts are allocated on a provisional basis initially and are confirmed following receipt from the school of actual enrolments in September 2009.The school which the Deputy has referred to are projecting an enrolment of 188 pupils for 1 September 2009 which is in excess of the required 179 pupils necessary for the appointment of a sixth mainstream teacher on developing grounds for the coming school year.  My officials have been in touch with the school in this regard and I understand that provisional sanction for a developing post will issue to the school.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2009-02-26 00:00:00	Prelude	587	I propose to take Questions Nos. 215, 223 and 224 together.Under the current National Development Plan (2007-2013), a total of almost €4.5bn, the largest investment in the history of the State, has been allocated to the school building programme. This investment will build on the achievements of the last National Development Plan 2000-2006, when an aggregate total of well over €2.6 billion was invested in upgrading the existing school infrastructure and providing new school accommodation at both first level and second level.The original allocation for school building in 2009 of €581m has recently been increased by €75m. It represents a significant investment in the school building and modernisation programme. As the Deputy will appreciate, the climate within which the 2009 Budget has been framed is very different to that of recent years. The Government has been faced with very difficult choices across all areas of public spending. This level of funding for the building programme, at a time of great pressure on public finances, is a sign of the very real commitment of this Government to investing in school infrastructure and will permit the continuation of progress in the overall improvement of school accommodation.Currently in my Department's school building and modernisation programme, there are 74 major projects at stage 3 (55 at primary and 19 at post primary level) which have been approved to proceed to tender and construction but are not yet on site. These projects include the 10 which I announced in January of this year and the 43 which I announced earlier this month. There are currently 28 major projects in construction (20 at primary and 8 at post primary level).  As well as delivering additional school places to meet the needs of a rapidly increasing school going population and improving existing school infrastructure this programme funded investment in site purchases, the annual minor works grant to all primary schools, the asbestos and radon remediation programmes, science and technology initiatives, emergency works and grants for the purchase of furniture and equipment. It is also my intention to have a Summer Works Scheme in 2009.The Deputy will be aware that demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly over the last number of years, with the appointment of 6,000 extra teachers in the primary sector alone since 2002. It will continue to be necessary for prefabricated accommodation to be provided because competing priorities mean that it will not always be possible to have a permanent accommodation solution in place in a short timeframe.  My Department will continue to provide funding for such prefabricated accommodation.  In July of last year I introduced a further innovation which allows those schools with an urgent and pressing need for additional accommodation and who are being given approval for grant aid to avail of the option of using their grants either to purchase prefabs or to construct permanent classrooms for the same amount.

These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared.  At the time of the budget I set out the likely impact of the various measures including the projected net impact on teacher numbers in primary and post-primary schools which was estimated at a loss of 200 posts in each sector.My Department has written to the primary schools that are projected to have a net loss or gain in classroom teaching posts in September, 2009.  As part of my efforts to ensure that relevant information is openly available to the public detailed information on the opening position for primary schools is now published on my Department's website.  This provisional list sets out the details on individual schools that, taken collectively, are projected to gain 128 posts and to lose 382 posts — a net reduction of 254 posts. It is my intention to have this information updated and ultimately to set out the final position when the allocation processes are completed.  Initial allocation letters have also issued to Post Primary Schools and Vocational Educational Committees. All the above allocations, primary and post-primary are provisional at this stage and reflect the initial allocation position.The operation of redeployment arrangements also impacts on the final position as a teacher can remain in his or her existing school where a suitable redeployment position does not exist. The final staffing position for all schools will therefore not be known until the autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers and any appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.  The appellate process is particularly relevant at post-primary level where any  specific curricular needs of the school concerned are considered. Also at post-primary there is no effective system wide redeployment scheme at present and this can mean that schools retain teachers, though over quota.

The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that all pupils, including those with special educational needs, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post-primary school network.  There are now over 19,000 staff in our schools working solely with children with special needs. This includes over 10,000 Special Needs Assistants — compared with just 300 in 1997. There are also over 8,000 resource and learning support teachers — compared with about 2,000 in 1998. More than 1,100 other teachers support children in our special schools, while hundreds more work in special classes.As well as this significant increase in the numbers of additional teachers and SNAs directly providing appropriate education and care supports for children with special educational needs, much investment has taken place in the provision of transport, specialist school accommodation, home tuition, assistive technology and equipment. Additional teaching supports are allocated as necessary by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) in line with my Department's policy to support children with special educational needs. As a result, there is no current shortfall in the number of teacher posts being allocated for children with special educational needs.The Deputy will also be aware that additional funding has been allocated to my Department in 2009 to provide for an expansion of the National Educational Psychological service so that all schools in the country will be covered by the service. The additional funding available to NEPS, which represents a 33% increase over the 2008 allocation, will facilitate the recruitment of up to 50 further psychologists. It is envisaged that this will bring the number of NEPS psychologists by the end of 2009 above the proposed 200 incorporated in the Programme for Government.  This investment will significantly enhance the capacity of our educational psychologists to directly support schools in the development and delivery of appropriate interventions for children with special educational needs.Additional funding is also being provided to the National Council for Special Education in 2009 to increase the Council's capacity in the move towards the full implementation of EPSEN. The additional funding will enable the Council to continue to improve, plan and co-ordinate the delivery of services for children with special needs.  I have also provided for further investment in teacher training in this area. This will ensure that teachers are provided with opportunities to access continuing professional development so that the learning and teaching needs of all pupils with Special Educational Needs continue to be met.  I wish to assure the Deputy that the provision of appropriate educational intervention and supports for children with special educational needs continues to be a key Government priority.

These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure could not be totally spared. At the time of the budget I set out the likely impact of the various measures including the projected net impact on teacher numbers in primary and post-primary schools which was estimated at a loss of 200 posts in each sector.The budget measures will impact on individual schools in different ways depending on whether enrolment is rising or declining and the degree to which any one school has more teachers than it is entitled to under the allocation processes. Across the school system generally there will of course be some impact on class sizes and at post-primary level the changes may impact on the  capacity of individual schools to offer as wide a range of subject choices as heretofore.  In terms of the position at individual school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2008. The annual process of seeking this enrolment data from schools took place in the autumn and the data has since been received and processed in my Department enabling the commencement of the processes by which teaching resources are allocated to schools for the school year that begins next September.My Department has written to the primary schools that are projected to have a net loss or gain in classroom teaching posts in September, 2009. As part of my efforts to ensure that relevant information is openly available to the public detailed information on the opening position for primary schools is now published on my Department's website. This provisional list sets out the details on individual schools that, taken collectively, are projected to gain 128 posts and to lose 382 posts — a net reduction of 254 posts. It is my intention to have this information updated and ultimately to set out the final position when the allocation processes are completed.Initial allocation letters have also issued to Post Primary Schools and Vocational Educational Committees. All the above allocations, primary and post-primary are provisional at this stage and reflect the initial allocation position. The final position for any one school will depend on a number of other factors such as the allocation of support teachers, additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes. The operation of redeployment arrangements also impacts on the final position as a teacher can remain in his or her existing school where a suitable redeployment position does not exist.The final staffing position for all schools will therefore not be known until the autumn. At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers and any appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered. The appellate process is particularly relevant at post-primary level where any specific curricular needs of the school concerned are considered. Also at post-primary level there is no effective system wide redeployment scheme at present and this can mean that schools retain teachers, though over quota.
