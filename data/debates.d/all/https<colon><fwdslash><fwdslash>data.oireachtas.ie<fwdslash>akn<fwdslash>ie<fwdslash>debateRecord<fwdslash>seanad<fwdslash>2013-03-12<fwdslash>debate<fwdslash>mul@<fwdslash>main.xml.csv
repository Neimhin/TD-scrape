The protest was attended by a number of people because there is great concern that the front desk will be closed and transferred to Naas, where all queries regarding TB and other issues that arises in respect of the services will be dealt with. These services are invaluable to the farmers of County Roscommon and surrounding areas and include, for instance, paperwork for EU payments, animal passports, issues relating to TB testing and so on. There is no substitute for face-to-face contact in these matters as the help of experienced local staff is invaluable and often can prevent small issues escalating into big problems. I strongly believe the downgrading of this busy and effective service would have negative consequences for the farming community of County Roscommon and urge the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to maintain the facility at its current level. I also appeal to the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, to get involved in this campaign and to use its powers and exert its influence. The farming community contributes more to the IFA than to the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association and the former should use its clout to prevent a downgrading of services. If the Minister is not available, the Leader should get the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, to come into the House to consider the blow to the people of north County Roscommon on the announcement this morning that the Garda headquarters in Boyle, County Roscommon will be closed between the hours of 6 p.m. and 10 a.m.

No one would wish for this to happen in any community but I note in particular that Boyle is the capital of north Roscommon. In addition, the stations at Cootehall, Loughglynn and Tarmonbarry have been closed.All those local Garda stations have closed but a regional Garda station has been amalgamated with Castlerea. This is a major blow to the constituency. I cannot understand why the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, has a desire to remove a service such as the courthouse in Boyle and other services from County Roscommon. I appeal to him on the matter at this stage. I hope the Fine Gael Deputy elected for Roscommon will at long last use his influence to try to prevent the further downgrading of the county.

It is a screening programme for six rare genetic diseases and more recently also for cystic fibrosis. The results of the heel prick tests on newborns are kept on Guthrie cards in Temple Street Children’s Hospital. I understand that the results from 1984 to 2002 are currently kept there but recently the Government announced that they would be destroyed. The reason I raise the issue today is that parents have two more weeks to seek to retain the records of their newborn child. The deadline is 31 March. The Data Protection Commissioner ruled some years ago that it was in breach of data protection laws that the screening cards would be retained.

It does seem appalling that the cards are to be destroyed. The critical issue at this point is to inform people of their right to intervene between now and 31 March. The HSE needs to do more to inform parents of the need to ensure that their children’s cards are retained if they wish to do so, by 31 March.

I would like very much if we could have a debate at an early opportunity about last week’s decision in the High Court on the issue of surrogacy. Others have referred to the matter in this House, including Senator Norris. It is one of those areas where we should not wait to see what the Government comes forward with but because this is a very sensitive and complex issue we as a Seanad should examine the issue ourselves. There are many different issues to be considered. I am concerned about the emotional minefield that is involved in surrogacy. I am very concerned about the way the rights of children are treated in this case. I am also concerned about the commercialisation of women, and particularly the use of power and the relative economic disadvantage between those who “commission” children, to use that word, and those who act as surrogates. Many countries such as France and Austria have banned surrogacy and egg donation outright. They were right to do so. It has also been banned in countries such as Italy, Norway and Germany. The European Court of Human Rights has upheld their right to prohibit surrogacy in their laws. The mood music, in so far as there is any from Government, is that it would legislate to permit surrogacy in some way. We should have a debate on the issue rather than accept Government intentions as a fait accompli. There are major human issues involved, in particular issues relating to children’s right to their identity and to know who their parents are, and as far as possible to be brought up by their parents.This is a children's rights and human rights issue and we should debate it soon. I also support the calls made in this House last week by Senator Hayden for a debate on the funding of fee paying schools. Frankly, I do not understand the begrudgery that exists about the right of parents to subvent the education of their children to a basic minimum level of funding for that education by way of the payment of teachers. Already it is the case that private fee paying schools have higher pupil-teacher ratios. The McCarthy report urges that the pupil-teacher ratio be 28:1. In fact, that is saying that anyone who dares subvent their children's education by the payment of fees must go it alone completely. That amounts to a form of bullying by the State and it discourages something we should encourage, the desire that some parents have when they have the resources to contribute to their children's education. I support extra funding for children in disadvantaged schools so we can also enable them in the pursuit of excellence but the one-size-fits-all policy is not to be encouraged. I regret the fact that Sinn Féin has activated a petition in the Northern Assembly to block a very sensible amendment that would ensure whatever procedures that are to be permitted would be undertaken on the NHS. I am talking about abortion. We have the bizarre situation that this move by Sinn Féin effectively facilitates an abortion privateer in the form of the Marie Stopes Clinic, which even by the standards of abortion providers, does not have a good reputation. This is a cynical move by Sinn Féin and it is time the party stopped speaking out of both sides of its mouth, saying it is anti-abortion while doing everything to facilitate its provision.

I saw comments by Louise Phelan, the Irish head of PayPal, where she said that young graduates are completely unprepared for work, not hungry enough to succeed in today's environment, and that they have a sense of entitlement, expecting everything to be handed to them on a plate. She said they have great graduates working in PayPal but others arrive with a sense of entitlement, unprepared for the workplace in which they are to operate. We all wonder why this is. Is it because during the property bubble everything seemed so much easier and everyone seemed to succeed? Ms Phelan talked about Ireland being a great place in which to do business but worries that the younger generation is woefully unprepared for the workplace. We must have a debate with the Minister on how multinational companies view Ireland, our graduates and their preparedness for work. If Ms Phelan's feelings are shared by other multinational companies, we should be seriously worried about future investment. We must discuss this with the Minister as a matter of urgency. I would ask the Leader to facilitate that debate in the coming weeks.

For those who do not know it, Dursey Island is one of the most remote and isolated parts of the country. It was the last place the people who sailed from Cobh saw as they left Ireland on the RMS Titanic before the ill-fated ship hit the iceberg.A small number of people still live on this island, while many other islanders who moved to the mainland continue to have farms or land on the island. Their only access is the cable car which was built some 35 years ago. We were informed a few days ago that, for insurance reasons, the cable car would be repaired and would not operate for two or three weeks. I am also reliably informed that the cost of upgrading the cable car to make it safe would be in the region of €1 million. The people of the isolated island of Dursey and those who use the cable car daily must receive fair play and fair treatment. We hear about rights for the diaspora and so forth but we must also look after our own people living in remote areas with the threat of being cut off. Dursey Sound, the stretch of water between Dursey Island and the mainland at the end of the Beara Peninsula, is extremely treacherous. While there is a pier, dangerous currents mean it is not safe to make the crossing, especially with animals, for as many as 200 days of the year. I do not wish to be parochial but I believe I must make this appeal on behalf of those who have been fighting this battle for the past two years. Everyone, whether he or she is from Dublin 4, Dursey Island or west Cork, should enjoy the same rights. The people affected have a cloud of uncertainty hanging over them and are seeking nothing more than fair play. They are entitled to access the island and use their lands and houses. The common practice of bringing cattle, sheep and other farm animals back and forth on the cable car is being hindered, which is a form of discrimination against the people of the island. I ask the Leader to consider arranging a debate on this matter or, alternatively, to have the appropriate Minister provide me with a detailed statement on the future of the Dursey Island cable car.
#MaryMoran	unknown-#MaryMoran-party	unknown-#MaryMoran-dob	unknown-#MaryMoran-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-12 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	24	I raise concerns about conditions in children's hospitals as we await the construction of the new national children's hospital in Dublin. On a recent stay in a Dublin children's hospital with my son, I was horrified to see the conditions to which parents and children are subjected. Although the nursing care provided was second to none and the nurses were fantastic, I was alarmed at the cramped conditions in the hospital. Patients share tiny rooms with two beds which are suitable for only one bed. Extremely sick children are accommodated in rooms while their parents sleep on floors with less than 12 in. of space available to them. This is totally unacceptable in 2013. During my visit, no one had privacy and when a doctor wished to speak to a family, the other family sharing the room had to leave. I also saw nurses step over parents to check on patients. With regard to the parental accommodation available at the hospital, which I checked out, while I was grateful the hospital had accommodation available for parents, it was seriously deficient for parents who must stay in it for any length of time or who are unfamiliar with Dublin or have no other contacts in the city. The facilities for parents to wash and shower were, I regret to say, absolutely appalling. The ceiling of the shower that I saw was covered in black mould. I took a photograph to show to the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly. Notwithstanding the state of the economy, conditions in our children's hospitals should not be allowed to slip while we wait for a new children's hospital.  Some €39 million has been spent on planning and designing a new children's hospital on the now defunct Mater Hospital site. It would cost a tiny fraction of this sum to improve parental accommodation in the hospital I visited. We owe it to children and their parents to provide the best possible supports when children are in hospital as this is a time when parents and children are very vulnerable.

I was concerned that someone had written in a book of comments for parents the following comment: "Thank you for giving me the opportunity to be near my child." The child in question was particularly sick and being near one's child should not be considered something for which parents should be grateful. Parents have a right to look after our sick children when they are in hospital. Our children deserve the best when they are at their most vulnerable. I read recently a comment by the Minister for Health that the new children's hospital will be a beacon of light for everyone in paediatric care.I read recently that the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, said the new children's hospital will be a beacon of light for all of us in paediatric care. It is now envisaged that the hospital will not be built until 2018. I call on the Minister to come to the House to assure us that the standards in our existing hospital will be maintained while we await the building of the new one.

One is entitled "CAO shake-up to take heat out of points race". The CAO is simply a device by which a scarce number of university places are allocated among people about to sit the leaving certificate examination, and that is all it is. The article states, "The initial step will be a dramatic reduction in the number of courses available to [new] CAO applicants". As with so much in education these days, this provision comes courtesy of six quangos, a virtual alphabet soup including IUA, IOTI, SEC, HEA and NCCA. I am sure there are more in the wings. The bodies are against specialised courses and want to reduce the number of options on the basis that it will reduce stress. There are so many non sequiturs that it is hard to know where to begin. Points are a good guide to how students perform, and a lack of points is a good guide to suggesting who will not be able to cope with third level. The CAO is inexpensive and is certainly preferable to interviews, letter writing or representations, as we know in a society that is so wedded to clientelism. The degrees meet the standards of international external examiners. We should not present false dawns to people who are studying hard for their examinations. We wish them every success. So much does not hang together in the three pages of the Irish Independent that one would be worried if any students were taken away from their studies by bothering with it. A lack of points is an indicator that life will be difficult. Getting points is, of course, difficult, but the number of places we are trying to allocate at third level is lower than the number of applicants. The CAO, founded by a former Provost of Trinity College, Mr. Bill Watts, is the equitable way to do that. I sometimes believe less emphasis on bureaucracy and more on what happens in the classroom is an example that Irish university heads should follow.

The commitment to a property tax is a commitment that the current Government inherited from its predecessor. I hate to see people opposing a measure they introduced themselves. I tried to make this point yesterday but want to reinforce it today. There should not be any confusion on this matter. Information is widespread. Since yesterday, we have the relevant information on the www.revenue.ie website, and there is a property price register. There are so many different ways of checking what a property is worth that there can be no doubt whatsoever. One does not have to accept the listed value as the tax is self-assessed. One will know the trends in one's area and there will be comparative data available.

Arís, tá sé ag déanamh mí-chur síos ar an méid atá á dhéanamh ag Sinn Féin ó Thuaidh agus ó Dheas. Is trua é nár fhan sé leis an bhfreagra a chlos. I wish to put on record that Senator Mullins has misrepresented the Sinn Féin policy once more from his lofty pedestal. It is a shame he did not stay to hear the retort to that. It is to be hoped that it will be possible at some stage to discuss the issue. I have great time for my esteemed colleague, Senator Paul Coghlan, who has just spoken, but I wonder what planet he is living on after seeing some of the newspaper reports of recent days. Figures published by the Commission for Energy Regulation show the number of houses that are connected to gas and electricity meters. They also show that 2,479 domestic customers had their gas supply cut off between July and September last year. In addition, 4,181 households had electricity disconnected in the third quarter of 2012. Over the past two years, gas and electricity prices have risen by an average of 30%, with further increases likely later this year. A total of 6,572 homes had their gas supply cut off in the first nine months of 2012, more than the total for the previous year. Similarly, 12,854 households had their electricity supply cut off in the first three quarters of 2012, in addition to the almost 17,800 customers disconnected during 2011. The issue about the property tax is not how it should be collected but about the people who do not have the ability to pay.

The City of Dublin VEC and SUSI must clarify some issues that are cropping up in the offices of many Members. There is one that arises in Donegal, where many of the people go to college across the Border. A number of them were told that their fees and maintenance grant were covered, but a week or even three or four months later they were told they were not covered. In one case I am dealing with, the girl concerned intended to study pharmacy in Belfast. She was told that her fees would not be covered but that she would get her maintenance grant. However, a week later she got another letter stating she would not get her maintenance grant. This is a feature of SUSI and the Minister must address it. The only explanation I can offer is that the people who are processing the SUSI applications have not been properly briefed on the issue of fees across the Border. Obviously, 90% to 95% of the applications they deal with relate to colleges in the South. However, we have documentary evidence that people are being told in a letter received one week that they have a maintenance grant and possibly fees covered, but the following week they receive a letter stating the opposite. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House to outline the training procedure the City of Dublin VEC undertook to establish who is and is not entitled to fees.

What has characterised the Government in this regard since the general election two years ago has been inaction and indifference. When we first proposed the Family Home Bill in this House in July 2011, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, proclaimed how the code of conduct on mortgage arrears was working exceptionally well and that there was no need for such legislation, and those were his exact words. Following that, we produced the Debt Settlement and Mortgage Resolution Office Bill in October 2011. We then produced the Regulation of Debt Management and Advisors Bill in May 2012 but all we have had from the Government is the Personal Insolvency Act which the Minister hopes will be up and running by July. Senator Ó Clochartaigh highlighted some of the rises in costs for families, including energy costs and so on. The shambles of the property tax and what is expected of people in terms of valuing their houses is further compounded by the fact that we were able to rush through legislation for a property tax but it has taken us two and a half years to bring in personal insolvency legislation which puts the banks completely in control. Will the Leader ask the Taoiseach if he trusts the banks to deal in an honest and a fair way with the mortgage crisis, which has been going on for so many years? Some 182,000 mortgages are in arrears out of a total of 942,000 mortgages. All we have seen is complete inaction. What is truly lying at the heart-----

Senator Rónán Mullen raised the surrogacy issue. There is now a High Court judgment. In fairness, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, set out in a memorandum guidelines on dealing with some aspects of surrogacy. People are travelling to places as far away as Ukraine, India and the United States for surrogacy. We need to deal with this. I agree with Senator Mullen that we should have a debate. It is not a matter we should allow to be kicked around for the next 20 years in the way others were left following the judgment in the X case. No doubt the Minister will deal with this matter in a calculated way to ensure that we put in place the appropriate legislation to deal with this complex and difficult area. There is a High Court judgment. Let us have a debate and look at putting in place the proper structure of legislation to deal with this issue. I ask that the Leader ask the Minister to come to the House for that debate on this area at the earliest possible date.

It was, therefore, with a certain amount of surprise, despite the history of these matters, that he described the Marie Stopes Clinic as abortion privateers. I am not 100% sure how that fits into calm, serious and respectful debate, but no doubt it is a predictor for what will happen. The clinic has been going for a long time. It has international respect. Senator Mullen raised this in the context of Sinn Féin exercising its constitutional and parliamentary rights in the North of Ireland to put a petition. I attended the meeting that was organised there, rather curiously, by the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP. At this tea and bun session, when I counted, there were 16 men and three women present, which I thought was quite interesting, and a letter was flourished from the Reverend Dr. Ian Paisley. I asked a number of questions, including whether this was the Dr. Paisley who had so signally failed to save Ulster from sodomy. They did not answer the question that is referred to, rather unfortunately, in the letter I also received today from the Supreme Knight of Columbanus, who appears to be completely against allowing this regrettable procedure to take place in circumstances where the young woman has been the victim of rape or incest, or whether what she is carrying is a nerveless, brainless, headless piece of tissue, which is a matter that was referred to in a most dignified and tragic letter by a young woman some years ago. It is obscene for these persons to try to force the situation on them.

Can we have a calm, serious and respectful debate on the issue of abortion? I agree with my colleagues, including Senator MacSharry, on the question of evictions. It is probably unconstitutional. I am in the curious position of having taken an action against the State where it agreed with all the evidence that I presented but stated it could not grant me relief because of the Christian nature of the State. That is a legal judgment of the High Court, also certified by the Supreme Court, and yet we are throwing people out on the side of the road. We are told that our actions as legislators and as a State must be Christian, but we are firing out old age pensioners and we talk about moral hazard for individuals.

After I spoke last week on this question of eviction, which I regard as an obscenity, I gather that the Secretary General of the Department of Finance appeared to suggest that there were not enough evictions. I cannot think of anything more half-baked. Apart from the moral issue, if one evicts all of these borrowers - there are tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of them - one will destroy the very market one is trying to reflate.

There is a serious issue related to the buy-to-let mortgage market. The Minister for Finance has made it clear that he does not see the buy-to-let mortgage market as one that needs to be protected. He has indicated that they should be repossessed. One in every five people live in a buy-to-let property. They live in the rental sector. There could be serious issues for ordinary people and families, and people with children, if we do not handle the matter carefully. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to attend and ask him to specifically address the issue. 
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-12 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	124	I concur with the concerns expressed by Senator Rónán Mullen. I am also concerned that the Sinn Féin Party decided to make a petition of concern. I spoke to its leader and other MLA members of Sinn Féin to avert it happening. The petition is a misuse of a good provision that was included in the agreements. The petition of concern was included in order that no community could find itself totally out-voted by another. This is not such an issue because it transcends politics and parties. I regret that it has happened but accept that it is democracy. I also accept that the party is entitled to adopt whatever position it wishes. I urge people here who may not be as familiar with some of the activities of the Marie Stopes Clinics to talk to people, even those on the pro-choice side, who are critical of Marie Stopes and have serious misgivings about some of its modus operandi. I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to come to the House. I appreciate, and I have always acknowledged here, that we are going through a difficult fiscal and economic situation and that the Government must make unpopular decisions. When Fianna Fáil was in power it made unpopular decisions by cutting public service pay and social welfare to spread the burden across all of society. I am highly critical of what is happening now. I want the Minister to come here to discuss the housing grants for the disabled and the elderly. My county council has been almost cut in half and I am sure that the same has occurred in other areas. Many constituents have made representations to me for housing grants. Some of the people are elderly and live in homes that need repairs which they cannot afford and the same applies to the disabled. In one instance, a father and son cannot access a stairway to their bedrooms and only use their livingroom. Such people will be deprived of essential grants.

The cuts are a false economy. The cost of retaining people in their homes is a fraction of the cost of being taken into the care of the HSE. I appeal for the Minister to reverse his decisions. Savings are about options and choices but the choices being made by the Government are far from sensible.

This sends a strong message to students, parents and society at large about the seriousness of some of these issues. Last week, I delivered a speech to the European economic and social committee in Brussels in which I proposed the idea that empowerment through education is a more effective tool than centralised policing. In this regard, we can get too carried away and point the finger too much at the various social media networks.  In the story to which I referred, 28 young lives, plus the life of a teacher, were impacted upon and have been needlessly interrupted. There are two main problems, as I see it. One is a societal problem of how we will deal with bullying and how we can stand up to bullies - and that is not just on the Internet. The second is a technological problem of how we can employ methods to tackle online bullies. As regards both these problems, I believe that empowerment through education could have a beneficial role. It would empower young people to break from the herd, click the report button and have the content removed, thus ensuring that the juvenile actions of one person do not spoil the lives of many others.  Unfortunately, bullying has always occurred and cyberbullying is just another form of it. The issue of eradicating bullying remains as difficult as ever and new technology merely provides another dynamic. The bully is no longer the obvious boy or girl in the classroom because social networking facilitates any individual in the privacy of his or her own home to partake in bullying that is much more difficult to police. We need to empower and educate young people to work online without fear of the same negative behaviour that we can all encounter in ordinary life.  On previous occasions, the Leader has been asked to facilitate a debate on this matter. We could usefully have one in the near future.

When the EU directive on public procurement came through it seemed sensible that we should accept it wholeheartedly, but the effect it is having on a large number of smaller Irish businesses is huge. Can we take a balance into account when we automatically accept EU directives? There is a need to do something in this regard. I met a group of business people here the other day whose businesses are likely to go just because of one decision. It may well be that the State and taxpayers benefit from having an EU directive on public procurement which says that we must buy the cheapest or best no matter where. However, if such a directive affects so many jobs in so many areas, we should re-examine the matter. One of the proposals that is being made on the contents of beverages concerns some sort of limit on the sugar content of soft drinks. This concerns measures to control obesity. Two days ago, the New York Supreme Court found that a ban that Mayor Bloomberg had put into operation to ban the sale of jumbo soft drinks was illegal. Consequently, the city was unable to enforce it. That decision may mean that the indoor smoking ban in New York is also illegal. I am mentioning this matter because we have been so competent and capable here in taking steps to ban smoking, and I would hate to find that such measures cannot be enforced in future.  I wish to add a few words in memory of two people who died in recent days. One was Mr. Enda Marren who was on the national executive of Fine Gael for many years. He was never a Member of this House but he certainly played a large part in this country's public affairs and the benefits accruing therefrom.

However, I am most disturbed about the price of hotel rooms in this city for the weekend, for which "Rip-off Republic" has returned in its glory. Hotel rooms not a stone's throw from this Chamber have increased their prices six and sevenfold and over the coming weekend, a hotel room one would get for €50 under normal circumstances will cost €350 a night. Some hotel rooms in this city will cost €600 and €700 per night over the St. Patrick's weekend. This is a disgrace given all the work being done to promote tourism in this country and to encourage people to return here because one will now get value for money in a new economic climate. Unfortunately, however, the greed has returned and in advance of the bank holiday weekend, I appeal to those hotels that have increased their room rates by six and sevenfold to cop onto themselves, realise they are doing enormous damage to the credibility of this city and country and bring back rates to a more realistic level. No one objects to paying a certain premium at peak times but people certainly object to being ripped off. This is undermining both the great work being done by the many organisations promoting this country internationally and the efforts of The Gathering.

This is happening on an issue currently and the fact it is about the right to life rather than economics, political structures or tourism should not be the cause for anger and alarm. I am delighted to have travelled to Stormont to meet political figures up there to discuss that very issue. Were the DUP to come down here, Members should feel happy about that.

I would not like the message to go back to them that simply because they came down here to discuss the right to life, in one of our Houses of Parliament, Members took the opportunity to in some way misrepresent that visit. Were Members to so do, it would have an impact on future relationships as well. I am very disappointed with Sinn Féin. I have always have been quite outspoken in this Chamber to make sure its members got their rights both within this House and within the political structures. I also praised Sinn Féin for its work on the Good Friday agreement. I am disappointed with Sinn Féin that it would activate the petition of concern because if one understands the system as it operates in the North, this amounts to a veto. In a way, it is sad this happened. Moreover, it may even be misrepresenting Sinn Féin's own position but the difficulty is that with the party operating on both sides of the Border, it possibly has different approaches to different issues.

It is an absolute shame and cannot be justified that hotels in this city, or in any other city in the country, are able to increase the price of hotel accommodation by as much as 500% and 600%, as outlined by Senator Conway. It is total and utter robbery in this the year of The Gathering and will do enormous damage to the tourism industry for the benefit of a few over a specific weekend.

I remind him that, as he well knows, the hours of opening of the Garda headquarters is a matter for the Garda Commissioner. He also inquired about the agricultural offices in Roscommon.I will inquire of the Minister but if the Senator put that down as an Adjournment matter, he would get the exact answer he is seeking. Senator Bacik asked about Guthrie cards, which have been mentioned on the Order of Business on several occasions. I agree there is a need for the HSE to inform parents of their rights. I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister and will try to secure more information for parents and the public. Senator Mullen called for a debate on surrogacy and the recent court case. The judgment is ground-breaking and the wisest counsel at this stage is to study it carefully and reflect on its implications. The Minister for Justice and Equality is preparing a new Bill that will address certain aspects of the law on surrogacy and hopes to publish the family relationships and children Bill later this year. Senator Mullins raised the comments made by Ms Louise Phelan, the CEO of PayPal, about the attitude of some of our young people. We will have a debate on the jobs action plan in the near future and he can address those remarks to the Minister then. Senator O'Donovan asked about the cable car to Dursey Island. Fewer than ten people live on the island but the cable car is of paramount importance for those people. The Senator mentioned to me that he would table this as an Adjournment matter if we did not get a proper reply from the Minister so I will ask the Minister to take that matter if we cannot elicit sufficient information. Senator Moran raised the conditions in the children's hospital, particularly the lack of space and facilities for both children and parents. The Minister and everyone else would agree there is a need to maintain good standards in all children's hospitals until the new children's hospital is built. I will relay her comments to the Minister. Senator Barrett asked about the CAO and said it is an equitable system. We should have a debate on it soon so we can discuss the recent proposals with the Minister. Senator Paul Coghlan raised the property tax, and a number of other questions were asked about it. Fianna Fáil is cynically hypocritical on this issue. Its deceitful approach to the property tax is that when in government, before the arrival of the troika, in its national recovery plan, published in November 2010, it planned to introduce a property tax in 2012 and to raise €530 million from it in 2013.

Senator Hayden called for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, to come before the House for a debate on mortgage arrears and debt. The Minister has debated the issue with us previously and I am sure he will discuss it with us again, especially with regard to buy-to-let mortgages. The Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, also came to the House recently for a debate on housing. I will try to arrange to have the Minister for Finance come before us to address the issue the Senator raises.  Senator Walsh called for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, to come to the House to discuss housing aid for the elderly. I note the points the Senator made in that regard. The Minister will be in the House in a matter of minutes.  Senator Noone raised cyberbullying, another issue on which the House has had several debates. I note the point she made regarding 28 students who were suspended from a school recently. I heard the principal of the school in question interviewed on radio this morning. He spoke in a calm, reasonable and respectful manner and his contribution made a great deal of sense. I concur with the Senator that empowerment through education is the way forward on this issue.  Senator Quinn raised the EU directive on public procurement. I am aware that this directive is presenting difficulties for some small businesses and several owners of small companies have approached me about the issue. We should try to have the Minister of State with responsibility for public procurement, Deputy Brian Hayes, before the House for a discussion of the issue. I also note Senator Quinn's comments on the problems being experienced in New York in enforcing legislation on alcohol. I join the Senator and Cathaoirleach in expressing sympathy to the families of Enda Marren and the former Ceann Comhairle, John O'Connell. Senators Conway, Brennan and Wilson referred to hotel prices and the fact that many hotels are increasing prices six and seven-fold. This year, the year of The Gathering, I join those Members in saying it is an absolute disgrace for hotels to be putting up prices by that amount. We all agree that where there is volume, hotels must increase their charges, but not to the extent in question. The hotels responsible should rethink what they are doing because their charging of exorbitant prices will do the country irreparable damage, especially in the year of The Gathering, in which we are hoping to promote tourism and attract tourists to the country. Senator Ó Murchú expressed disappointment with Sinn Féin on its decision to activate a petition of concern in Northern Ireland. This matter was also raised by Senator Mullen. I have answered Senator Brennan's questions on property tax, the universal social charge, the children's allowance and cuts to the benefits for the blind and disabled. Everybody realises that the previous Government initiated cuts in these areas.

I seek clarification from the Minister, Deputy Hogan, on this. Fine Gael committed prior to the last general election to reducing the number of Deputies by 20. In a previous debate in this House, the Minister stated the reason for the reduction from 166 to 158 was that a constitutional amendment would be required if a reduction of 20 were to be facilitated. The Government has made it quite clear that it is willing to hold a number of referenda and it has already done so. It has no difficulty in proposing to hold a referendum on whether this House should remain in existence without referring the matter to the Constitutional Convention for debate. Why is the Government not prepared to put an amendment before the people to reduce the number of Deputies by 20, as committed to by the Minister prior to the last general election, aided and abetted by the Labour Party in its electoral manifesto?

I have done it in this House on many occasions with regard to political reform and local government reform. If there was no policy change regarding the number of people per Member in each Dáil constituency, the number of Deputies after the next general election would be 170. I put forward a range. The lowest number, without effecting constitutional change, was 153 and the range extended to 160. The commission independently decided on 158. It had the option of deciding on 153, if it had wished to do so. If it had proceeded on that basis, it would have been a net reduction of 17.

It also means that County Cavan is being carved up. West and south Cavan are being put into the newly-formed Sligo-Leitrim constituency, disenfranchising over 13,000 people in County Cavan. South Donegal will be cut off from the rest of County Donegal and put into the same new Sligo-Leitrim constituency. That is not acceptable. While I welcome the fact that Leitrim is once again united as a county for Dáil election purposes, this should not have been at the cost of the people of Cavan and south Donegal. In addition, the name "Sligo-Leitrim" does not give ownership to the people of south and west Cavan and south Donegal who are affected by this carve-up. For those reasons, I oppose this section.

We set out the terms of reference for the commission. It independently examined all the issues involved, particularly the distribution of electorate per Member. The number of the electorate per Member will be 29,040 at the next Dáil election, assuming this legislation is passed. What we are doing is consistent with established practice since the first independent commission was established and reported in 1980. The specification of constituencies is the core of this Bill. In my constituency, I would love to have the eastern part of Carlow back in Carlow-Kilkenny, but that is the way the chips fall, as it were, in terms of numbers per Member. It is certainly an inconvenience for the people of Cavan that they were not kept together as a county, considering the affinity all people in Ireland have with county boundaries, but the people of Leitrim had to go through the same purgatory in a political sense on the last occasion. Their county was divided in two. They are the swings and roundabouts of trying to match electorate numbers with elected Members in line with the Constitution and the requirement to have these constituencies in place for the next general election. I am sorry that I am unable to accommodate the Senator's sentiments. To do so would again invite the notion that I would interfere in an independent process.

It obviously did not adhere to this.Of the 40 constituencies which will come into existence if this Bill is passed, 22 will breach county boundaries. Surely a better job should have been done in that regard. On the naming of the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim, was any effort made to recognise the fact that more than 13,000 Cavan people and 7,000 Donegal people will be in this newly formed constituency?
#SeanDBarrett	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-12 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	216	I welcome the Minister. I regret any reduction in the number of Deputies because when we were trying to resolve the problems of the country between 2008 and 2010, reducing the number of backbenchers would not have made any difference. We have much bigger problems of lobbying, the control of banks and so on. I would not have added to the democratic deficit but I accept what the Minister is doing. In this section, the total reduction of Deputies is eight out of 166, or 4.8%. However, in Ulster, the parts for which we have responsibility, two of the 11 Deputies will go. There will be five Deputies for Donegal rather than six and four for Cavan-Monaghan rather than five. That is an 18% hit so the way the commission did its work was nearly four times more damaging to the three Ulster counties than it was to the country as a whole. I appreciate what the Minister said about its neutrality and independence but the fact Ulster did particularly badly this time might be borne in mind the next time. The way the cookie crumbled was bad for Donegal, Monaghan and Cavan, but that is how it worked out. The province of Ulster had the fastest increase in population in the last intercensal period. The population of the three Ulster counties went up by 10.1%, in Connacht by 7.5%, Munster by 6% and in Leinster by 9%. It is strange that the province with the fastest increase in population lost, proportionately, the most Deputies. That is a pity as the Parliament should reflect the population movements. The burden fell unduly on those three counties.

In the context of section 3, I raise the issue of the naming of the constituencies. My colleague, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, raised the issue of the renaming of Dublin South East as Dublin Bay South in the Dáil. I know the Minister gave him a full answer there but I thought it was worth raising it again in this House given that it is the constituency in which I reside. I reside in a part of the constituency which is very far from the bay - over in the west side, in the Portobello area. To call that area part of Dublin Bay South has little resonance for the people there. It is something we have raised numerous times at meetings in our constituency. I promised Deputy Kevin Humphreys I would raise it again in this House, knowing he already raised with the Minister.

If he really wants a debate on the merger in Waterford, I can have that with him but I want to stick to section 3. I agree with the arguments the speaker from Fianna Fáil made. We are against the reduction in the number of Deputies just for the sake of having a reduction in numbers. Essentially, this is about saving money. We made the point already that a raft of allowances paid to Oireachtas Members could be reduced or abolished which would save money without the need to reduce the number of Members of the Oireachtas. The Minister was not here for all of the Second Stage contributions last week. Understandably, he is busy. In his absence, I made the point that merely reducing the number of TDs, abolishing the Seanad, merging - as he put it - the local authorities, for example, Waterford, reducing the number of councillors and reducing the number of local authorities is all subtraction. Cutting the numbers is the broad thrust of what the Minister has given us but he has not really dealt with the reforms, in terms of where the real problems are. One of the big problems is that the Executive has far too much power. A small group of people have far too much power. The Government is to abolish the Seanad with the loss of 60 legislators, have fewer in the Dáil, have less scrutiny, have less oversight, and then reduce the number of local authorities as well. That is the main reason I cannot support this section and the legislation. The terms of reference of the Constituency Commission lent themselves to some of the strange constituencies with which we have ended up. One Senator put it well last week when he stated that some TDs would be dealing with multiple local authorities, in some cases, four different local authorities, because of the changes being made. It makes no sense whatsoever to pull small fragments of counties into different constituencies, for example, parts of east Carlow into Wicklow, part of south Tipperary into west Waterford, part of east Meath into Louth and parts of west Meath into Meath West. Strange configurations and changes have been made, and then more profound ones of which we know in the Border counties, all because of the terms of reference with which my party does not agree. My party would have preferred to see a move to have increased seat constituencies, for example, six-seat constituencies. That would achieve greater proportionality and there was an opportunity to do so in some constituencies. It is one of the positives at which the Minister has looked in the case of local government reform. There will be five, six and seven-seat wards, and perhaps even bigger, in local authorities and that will be good for proportionality and ensuring there is diversity in representation. We need that at national level as well. My party will support the Fianna Fáil amendment and opposing the section for the reasons I outlined.

It is not the big issue. In Donegal, for example, we have lost part to Sligo-Leitrim. There were two three-seaters and Donegal South-West ended up almost in Inishowen, which is the most northerly part of Ireland. The people of St. Johnston - next door to Inishowen and where the border parish of Carrigans is in Inishowen - were being represented by three TDs who, with respect, were 70 miles away whereas the local TDs in the other constituency were ten or 12 miles away. In certain areas, the realignment will help. The fact that almost 90% of Donegal is now one constituency gives the people throughout the county a choice as to whom to vote for. An area such as the Finn Valley was split in two and kicked around politically for the past 30 or 40 years, and that has been regularised. Sinn Féin is one of the opponents of political reform in the local authorities in Northern Ireland where they are reducing the number of local authorities from 26 to 11. It is one of the parties that has proposed this and is standing by it. One cannot say one does not want political reform or reducing the number of local authorities in the South when one has the power not to do so in Northern Ireland but is doing so. If one listens to Radio Ulster or RTE, one gets two different stories. The people must be aware of how constituencies are formatted.

There is no such thing as counties in the Constitution so the terms of reference were laid down in line with what the Constituency Commission created. There are always swings and roundabouts. Senator Barrett said that there will be a much heavier diminution of representation for the Border areas. He presumes that the three Deputies I named who represent Sligo-North Leitrim will then unrepresent them, so to speak. It all boils down to population so the distribution of votes will always be difficult, particularly when the number of Deputies is reduced. An increase in the number of Deputies would solve a lot more problems. In this case it was always going to be difficult to avoid breaching county boundaries, particularly when changing to the new national average of 29,040 people per representative. On the next occasion Senator Barrett can make a submission to the commission to address some of the issues regarding the Border counties about which he feels strongly.

As I said in the other House, if I changed the name of a constituency, it would be deemed that I had interfered with the independence of the commission and the right of its learned people. The commission panel comprises very independent people. If I change the name of a constituency, a Senator could also say that I had interfered with the independence of the commission's report in some way. I do not want to interfere with it. Senator Harte addressed some of the issues about local government that were raised by Senator Cullinane. Local government is different depending on which side of the Border one is on. Senator Cullinane should demonstrate more consistency and less conspiratorial action regarding these matters. I am not abolishing the Seanad. The people of Ireland will decide it they wish to change the Oireachtas and it is not my sole remit to do so. Every citizen will have an opportunity to have their say in whether they agree or disagree with the proposition in due course. That is the ultimate situation. I hope that I have responded to all of the issues raised by the Senators.

During the Second Stage debate I made a point about the carving up of the Cavan and Donegal electoral region. I reiterate that whoever is lucky to represent the people of the constituency will have to deal with four county councils and at least three HSE areas. The point has been well made by Senator Barrett that a 25% reduction in the number of seats will have to be endured by the people of Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal. The cut will impact on the three Border counties of Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan. I do not accept that the proposal is fair and I hope that the Minister does not accept that it is fair.I do not doubt the independence of Constituency Commission, but the result will depend on the starting point. To achieve a constituency that allows for the reunification of Leitrim, which I very much welcome, they chose to carve up parts of my county of Cavan and parts of County Donegal. I do not think that is acceptable. The membership of the independent Constituency Commission should be broadened in the future to include somebody with some practical knowledge of public representation. Anybody who would sign off on this Frankenstein constituency of Sligo-Leitrim has absolutely no practical political knowledge.

The very least the Constituency Commission could have done was to try to come up with a name that encompasses all the constituent parts of the new constituency, as it is certainly not just confined to representing people from Sligo and Leitrim.

When I said it would be used in a sinister way, it will be used in a sinister way by people within the Unionist constituency who will seize on what has been said. I think the Minister will regret saying it for those reasons, but that is a matter for himself. The Minister can stand over what he says. The central premise of what the Minister is doing is to save money. If that is the case why has he not looked at other ways to save money rather than reducing the number of elected Deputies? One can save money easily by abolishing a raft of allowances and reducing pay. It is disingenuous to assert the Government is not abolishing the Seanad, and state the people will. Of course the people will have their say. I am sure that when the posters go up, there will be Fine Gael posters calling for a "yes" vote. The Minister may be able to tell me differently but I would imagine, given he is proposing to hold a referendum to abolish the Seanad, without looking at reform of the Seanad, that he will be supporting its abolition. It is a bit disingenuous to say it is the will of the people.It would be different if the people had an opportunity to vote for a reformed Seanad, but they are not being given that opportunity. A simple proposition to abolish the Seanad will be put to the people in the referendum. Reform of the Seanad could have been considered, but instead the Government went for the simple option to abolish the Seanad. I think it is about saving money without coming up with alternatives. I did not realise that we could deal with the name of the constituencies, as I thought this would be dealt with separately. I apologise for my late arrival. I support my colleagues who commented on the name of the constituencies. I am aware that a number of the Minister's colleagues in this House have also supported this, mainly in relation to Galway West taking in parts of south Mayo and naming the constituency Galway West-Mayo South. It might be more problematic for the Frankenstein constituencies because of the number of counties encompassed by them. It is important that the people from County Mayo who are now to become a part of this new constituency will be recognised. Recognition is of significant importance. The fact that they will not be recognised in the name of the constituency will be an issue for them and the Members elected to represent that constituency. It can be compared to the approach of Pontius Pilate of washing one's hands of any responsibility. Members of the Seanad may think they cannot do anything in this House. Of course we can. We can accept the amendments that are tabled in good faith. I do not accept the Minister's arguments on the premise for these changes and in respect of the limitations on changing the names of the constituencies.

I was listening to my colleague, Senator Cullinane, who I think has a point. When a decision is made to put an issue before the people, there is a certain implication that there is a desired outcome. Whether one has a referendum on an issue, such as gay marriage or the abolition of the Seanad or the reduction of judges' pay, the very decision to put an issue before the people involves the identification of it as an issue on which there ought to be a decision. That in itself implies a value judgment. My question relates to the decision to allow the people have a say on whether the Seanad will exist into the future, which as we all know can only be taken by a referendum. Given the initial commitment to reduce the number of Deputies by 20, and not by eight as is proposed in the Bill, what is the reason for that decision? Senator Cullinane said one can cut salaries and expenses and, in addition, reform the Dáil by cutting the number of Deputies. It is certainly arguable that compared with other countries of a much larger population we have a higher ratio of Deputies to members of the population. It has been advanced by Government that the reason the number of Deputies is to be cut by eight and not by 20 is that it would require a constitutional change to cut the number of Deputies by any more than eight because the Constitution provides that there must be a Deputy for every 30,000 and no more than one Deputy for every 20,000 people. If it is possible to ask the people to determine the future of the Seanad by way of a referendum, why was it not also possible to follow through on the promise to cut the number of Deputies by 20 simply by availing of the referendum means which the Government is already contemplating in the context of election reform?

That would be the appropriate time. That is the reason why, however. If there was no change in the proportion of the electorate to Members, as we have now, we would have 170 Members in the Dáil on the next occasion. We have gone to the limit of what we are allowed to do constitutionally - that is, to 29,040 per Member of the Dáil on the next occasion. We might have gone down from 158 Members closer to 153 to allow for that, but some latitude is given to the Electoral Commission to get over some of the difficulties that have been mentioned in the course of this debate. Notwithstanding that, in the context of reducing the number of Deputies, the commission found it difficult not to breach as many county boundaries. As Senator Wilson rightly pointed out, 21 were breached on this occasion. His own county and County Donegal were badly affected, but there is no easy way of doing it when one is distributing population under that criteria per elected Member, in line with the terms of reference, while remaining within the limits of the constitutional requirement.

Is my memory right in that regard? If so, would that not be a rather nonsensical argument given that it was contemplated to have a referendum to allow for the abolition of the Seanad?

We had a considerable population movement from Meath into Louth on the last occasion - twice as much as Mayo South going into Galway - and it did not change the name. It is still Louth. Senator Quinn would know that better than anyone. I accept that one of the difficulties is to create the appropriate names. I did not subscribe to some of the names that came through the Electoral Commission. One of our Cabinet members said the names of one or two of them were more like a television soap than being representative of where the constituencies were actually located. Deputy Kevin Humphreys referred to one of them. However, if I were to change any word of this independent commission's proposals, people here would say that I was intervening, if even in a minor way. That would open up a debate on changing the boundaries of the commission. It could also lead to other suggestions being made that we were not operating in a spirit of total independence about these matters, including the names of these constituencies.

We have moved away from some of the problems we had in the 1960s and 1970s on all sides of the House, concerning boundaries being predicated in advance. There was no such thing as an independent Electoral Commission then and they were drawn up by the Department and Ministers of all parties. It is great that the former Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, was in a position to bring forward the independent review of constituencies which has occurred since 1980. It was an innovative solution to a major problem in which the political classes have a strong vested interest.

I am sure parts of Dublin are confusing for Dubliners, such as Dublin North-East and others. The same applies to Donegal, Sligo and Cavan. Perhaps consideration should be given to this matter. I am sure it would be a source of amusement if people were asked to name constituencies after famous people from those areas or famous events that occurred there. People's imaginations may already be running wild in that respect.The Minister may consider changing the names of some areas in future. In that case, while one may be crossing county boundaries, the constituency could be named Breifne. Would Senator Wilson be happy with that?

I have no doubt, however, that Cavan will be united after the next revision because we are going to mount a campaign from now on until we are reunited. Would the Minister consider appointing somebody with practical knowledge of politics to the next Electoral Commission? The independent commission's structure has been in existence for over 30 years. Surely it is time that its membership should be examined. I think somebody with practical experience of politics should be on the commission because there is no way that anyone with that experience would have signed off on such a carve-up. I have no doubt about that. The Minister referred earlier to Deputy Heather Humphreys.

He can imagine the conversation the Taoiseach had with me concerning Mayo when he discovered it was the first time in the history of the State that a Taoiseach's constituency was losing one seat.

Prior to this, the axes 3 and 4 rural development programme, RDP, measures were co-funded at a rate of 55% by the EU with the remaining 45% coming from national Exchequer sources. The 2011 agreement reduced the national Exchequer input to 15% on a net basis for 2012 and 2013 without a concomitant increase in the amount of funding to be provided by the EU. This resulted in a reduction in the overall programme complement from €427 million to approximately €314 million on the basis of the programme achieving full spend by the end of 2013. In this context the original project allocations given to each local development company, LDC, contracted to deliver the Leader elements of the RDP, including the allocation for Gaeltacht areas, required readjustment. The Department is currently carrying out an exercise to determine the level of project commitments across all LDCs and all RDP measures to complete the rebalancing of the programme in as equitable a way as possible. In addition, given the levels of spending by the LDCs from 2009 to date, it is highly unlikely that full spend will be achieved by the end of 2013. The co-funding rate will revert to 55% for all expenditure beyond the end of this year and as a consequence, the overall programme requirement will also change. Until such time as the rebalancing exercise as outlined has been satisfactorily completed, it is not possible to be definitive regarding amounts of funding available for project commitments under axes 3 and 4 of the RDP. I do, however, expect this exercise to be completed shortly. Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta, the LDC contracted to deliver Leader funding to Gaeltacht areas in 2009, went into liquidation in September 2011. Since then, the Department has been working with the liquidators and other stakeholders to ensure the winding-up process was conducted in an efficient and effective manner. While this took some time and is still ongoing, almost all Gaeltacht areas now have access to Leader funding through the LDC in the geographically contiguous area. My Department is working with these LDCs to determine the fairest and most equitable way to distribute funds to Gaeltacht areas, including the consideration of the provision of a separate allocation for these areas in the future. Such decisions must also be made in the context of the review process outlined above and final decisions on Leader allocations for all rural areas, including Gaeltacht areas, will not be available until this is complete.

#DennisODonovan	unknown-#DennisODonovan-party	unknown-#DennisODonovan-dob	unknown-#DennisODonovan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-12 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	295	This matter pertains to Summercove national school, the school roll number of which is 18829J. In a nutshell, this is a very old school that was built in 1909 and in May 1998, its board of management made an application for a new school building on the advice of a senior official of the Office of Public Works, OPW, because it had outgrown its original purpose. On 7 December 1999, a report was made by a school inspector to the effect that the school should move to a new site. Subsequently, the then Minister for Education and Science, who I believe was Deputy Micheál Martin, indicated that a new school for Summercove, Kinsale, was a priority. In September 2004, the OPW placed a notice in the public press seeking a suitable site for a new school for Summercove. Various proposed sites were submitted and one such site was located directly across the road from the existing school.However, the local landowner was not prepared to sell or dispose of that site. In March 2007, the individual put forward a proposal that he would sell a site at Summercove crossroads for the purpose of a new school. The site was examined by a senior architect from the Office of Public Works, OPW, who gave a favourable report on this issue. The then board of management submitted a planning application under planning reference 0711917 to Cork County Council. Unfortunately, in a decision made in December 2007, the county council refused the aforementioned outline application on the basis that the site at Summercove crossroads, Ardbrack, Kinsale, was not zoned for educational purposes. This was an absolute cop-out by the county council and a dereliction of its social duties to provide planning. In April 2009, an Adjournment debate took place in the Seanad in which my former colleague, Deputy McCarthy, and I participated. I stated the school in question originally was built as a two-teacher school with a small number of pupils. However, over the past 25 years or more, the population of Summercove has increased and at present, 212 pupils attend the school. At the time of that debate, one of the school's prefabs was 26 years old and the Minister conceded it was the oldest prefab in Ireland. A second prefab was 20 years old, while a third was ten years old. The 26-year old prefab was subsequently replaced by the Department of Education and Skills. At that time, the Department had been paying rent of €53,000 per annum for prefabs and while I believe this may have been resolved subsequently, it indicates the ludicrous situation that was allowed to develop. In 2011, the school's board of management had a meeting with the county manager to ascertain whether the planning process could be advanced and eventually, after two planning applications, the board of management in its frustration found it had come up against a brick wall. It had considerable difficulty in getting planning and despite numerous efforts by me in the past and by previous Ministers, this planning permission was not granted. I understand the existing Summercove school building was examined by departmental professionals from its technical section on Friday, 18 January 2013 and as a result, it appears as though the Minister now has decided to remove the construction of a new school for Summercove from the building priority list, while citing the fact that no planning permission exists. Although I have no axe to grind with the Minister of State, I believe this again is a sort of cop-out because the need is so great. The Minister and his senior officials, in conjunction with those in the OPW who are trying to acquire the site, as well as officials of Cork County Council, should have worked together to provide or obtain a new site. I understand the farmer involved had offered two different options. Some of the grounds on which Cork County Council turned down the site were superfluous and not real or genuine. I will make this point carefully because I do not wish to point and have never pointed a derogatory finger at any official of Cork County Council, the OPW or the Department of Education and Skills. However, it appears to me and increasingly to the teachers in the school - who received an awful kick in the backside because of this decision - its management board, which has done tremendous hard work behind the scenes, the parents and more particularly the pupils, as though there has been collusion of sorts between all the various agencies. This school, which has developed rapidly, is a wonderful school and the Minister of State may not be aware it has the second highest academic record of any school in the whole of Munster, being 10% above the average. This is the reason that over the past 25 years, it has expanded from being a small school to one which probably now has ten or 12 teachers. There has been an announcement concerning the possible construction of a new school in the heart of Kinsale, where there are issues with traffic problems. While I wish that project good luck, it would be wrong to ignore the plight of the pupils and teachers who are living in atrociously difficult conditions. I hope the Minister of State will have good news for me from the senior Minister in the Department, Deputy Quinn, that he will reverse the decision and instead of removing the project from the building list, he will redouble his efforts to ensure a site is obtained, planning permission is expedited and construction of the new school will be included in the new programme encompassing the period from 2013 to 2018. I would be highly upset to be obliged to return to my constituents, particularly the parents, children, hard-working teachers and those involved in the board of management, to state the plan, about which they were complaining to me in 2003, is now likely to go beyond 2020 with no hope of a resolution.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14706	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-12 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	296	I am responding to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn. I thank the Senator for raising the matter as it provides me with the opportunity to clarify the current position on a proposed new school building for Summercove national school. The school has applied to the Department for large-scale capital funding for a new school building. The school is currently located on a half acre site and an alternative greenfield site is required for a new school In the context of the co-operation by the Department of Education and Skills with local authorities in identifying suitable sites for schools, the Department has worked with both the Office of Public Works and the local authority over a number of years in an effort to identify suitable sites for the construction of permanent accommodation for the school. The Senator might find it helpful if I set out the context within which decisions relating to meeting the demographic challenge facing the education system in the coming years are made. Total enrolment in both primary and post-primary schools is expected to grow by almost 70,000 by 2018 - more than 45,000 at primary level and 25,000 at post-primary level. To ensure that every child has access to a physical school place, it is vital that there is sufficient school accommodation available to cater for these pupil enrolments. The delivery of building projects to meet the increasing demographic demands will be the main focus for capital investment over the duration of the five-year plan, particularly in those areas where it has been identified that most demographic growth will be concentrated. In this regard, Kinsale has not been identified as an area of significant demographic growth. Pupil enrolment projections for Kinsale indicate that enrolments will remain relatively stable for the foreseeable future. Officials from the Department's building unit met with Summercove school authorities in January 2013, as Senator O'Donovan explained, to explore the options that might be open to the school to improve its existing accommodation. Subsequently, a member of the Department's technical staff visited the school to examine the possibility of addressing the school's most urgent needs. However, the option of providing some permanent accommodation to replace the school's temporary accommodation and to address traffic management on the site does not appear possible due to the restricted nature of the site. The Department accepts therefore that a new site is required. However, given the need to meet demographic growth, the delivery of new schools, together with extension projects to meet future demand will be the main focus of the Department's budget for the coming years. In this regard, it is not possible to indicate at this point when a building project for the school will be progressed. I thank the Senator for allowing me the opportunity to outline the position.

However, I wish to express my deep dissatisfaction at what has happened in Kinsale, in particular in Summercove, because whatever about demographics the school was identified as early as 1999 as being deserving of a new school which had been fought for at the time. I referred to the fact that certain delays arose in the meantime due to planning and other issues. I do not put all the blame at the doorstep of the Minister. It is not good enough for the 212 children who are being schooled in third-world accommodation and the teachers who have to deal with the situation on a daily basis. Usually I would get some satisfaction from a response but that is not the case today. I do not attribute any blame to the Minister of State but the response is not good enough and it will not be tolerated by the teachers, pupils, parents and those in the community who have looked forward to a new school for the bones of 20 years. It is a huge knock-back for them. There does not appear to be any light at the end of the tunnel. The Minister, Deputy Quinn, has overlooked the serious, specific and special needs of Summercove for the past 15 to 20 years.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14706	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-12 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	298	I appreciate where Senator O’Donovan is coming from.It does me no good to say that a school in my own county cannot have a definitive timeframe for the provision of a new school. The Government is faced with Hobson's choice at the moment because demographics do come into play. We are now faced with a situation in this country where there are pockets in metropolitan and urban areas where school places will not be available in the future. One must make provision in constrained economic times to allow for the necessity of people to be able to go to school. That is the Hobson’s choice that faces us. I am willing to speak to the Minister, Deputy Quinn, about the issue again. I am aware of the history of the case, dating back to 1999, and some of the difficulties that arose between some of the State agencies involved. It is not possible at this stage to state exactly when a new school will be built. One could argue that we are putting it on the long finger. I accept the point that has been made against the Government but it must prioritise those areas where school places will not be available and make provision for them.

I wish to ask the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation whether plans are in place to provide stronger legislation to prevent multinational retailers inflating their Irish prices in comparison to their UK prices. It is my belief that the price discrepancies are fundamentally unfair and poor corporate practice. In both the short and long term, they are damaging to our economy, as each euro that is taken out of circulation in terms of disposable income is, in effect, a euro that will not be spent elsewhere. That is in addition to the obvious difficulties created for retailers who are losing out on business to the UK in circumstances where the same product can be bought at a much lesser price there even with the cost of transporting it. There is a knock-on effect for jobs in this country. I am in favour of open markets and competition and yet with such consistent price increases across so many retailers in this country relative to the UK, increases which cannot simply be discounted by a disparity in labour costs or freight costs, I cannot help but wonder whether competition is working as fully and effectively as it should. I have written to the Consumer Association of Ireland and to the various retailers who were originally highlighted by a journalist who did some good work for The Sunday Business Post approximately two weeks ago on the issue. As yet, I have received no reply. There is no compulsion on them to reply to me. This is a serious problem which is worthy of the Minister’s time and attention. I would be grateful to hear whether there are plans to deal with the problem.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14706	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-12 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	300	I thank the Senator for raising this matter. The question posed by her as to whether there are any plans to introduce legislation to tackle higher prices charged by traders in this jurisdiction as compared with prices charged in the neighbouring UK jurisdiction seems to presume that price control measures can protect consumers from what may be perceived as high or unjustified prices. In so far as the general issue of tackling high prices is concerned, price control measures are not an effective means of reducing prices. During the 1970s and 1980s price control was used as one of the primary tools for combating increasing consumer prices and inflation. Various analyses of that period have shown that price control was an ineffective way of tackling high prices, as in many instances maximum prices prescribed for goods very quickly became minimum prices with the result that inflation during that period rose close to 20%. In addition to failing to tackle high prices, price control also effectively acted as a disincentive to businesses becoming more efficient and further prevented justified price rises arising from legitimate cost increases incurred by business. It was for that reason that the Consumer Protection Act 2007 essentially repealed the legislation which allowed for price control and there are no plans to revisit the matter. As regards differentials in prices for goods in this jurisdiction when compared with prices in the neighbouring UK jurisdiction, there can be legitimate reasons for prices to differ, such as exchange rate movements, different distributional costs, etc. Notwithstanding this, I do not doubt there may be instances where the level of the differential in prices charged for the same goods in the two jurisdictions cannot be justified by reasons such as exchange rate movements. In such instances, it is important that consumers use their discretion. I read the article to which the Senator refers and it is interesting to note a comment made by Mr. Mark Gould of MG Consulting who states: Everyone is on the web, you can see what a retailer is charging in Britain versus the Republic, so why everyone hasn't responded to that transparency I don't really understand. Retailers that get caught on this only have themselves to blame. We all have access to the Internet and consumers can exercise their power. Their price sensitivity can determine purchasing behaviour, particularly as it relates to conspicuous consumption. In contrast to the price control era of the 1970s and the 1980s, Government policy in the area of prices has been focused on the promotion of competition and consumer awareness, given that freely functioning competitive markets are more effective at setting fair prices. In so far as promoting greater consumer awareness of prices is concerned, the Consumer Protection Act 2007 specifically mandates the National Consumer Agency to promote public awareness and conduct public information campaigns on issues such as prices. The agency has been very active in raising awareness of prices in a number of different areas. Evidence available to it shows that consumers are becoming more price conscious and changing their shopping habits to achieve better value for their money. It is the case, therefore, that competition and price awareness among consumers are more effective tools to tackle high prices than the price control policies of the past. As regards general price trends, the consumer price index published by the Central Statistics Office shows that prices in Ireland rose by 1.2% in the 12 months to January 2013, whereas the corresponding index in the UK, the retail prices index, shows that prices there increased by 3.3% in the same period. At the European level, the harmonised index of consumer prices, which is the accepted measure for comparing price trends across the European Union, shows that prices in Ireland increased by 1.7% in 2012 as compared with an increase of 2.3% across the Union and 2.7% in the United Kingdom in the same period. I am firmly of the view that consumers, by exercising the power they command, are better placed to ensure they get a fair deal than any legislative intervention that would seek to regulate the prices traders charge for goods and services. Accordingly, by informing themselves as to the different offerings in the marketplace and being strategic in their shopping decisions, consumers can help to ensure they achieve the best value for their money, which is all the more important in the current economic climate.

Many of the points he makes are well considered. I am perhaps showing my age when I assure him that price comparisons between the UK and Ireland in the 1970s and 1980s were not on my radar at the time. I will contact the National Consumer Agency to ask that it increase its efforts to improve public awareness of price differentials. If it has the funding to do so, it should conduct public information campaigns on the issue. I agree with the Minister of State that the Government cannot be expected to cater for every circumstances that arises. If the view he expressed on price fixing is accurate, I would not encourage this approach. I thank him for his full response.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14706	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-12 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	302	I note the article in The Sunday Business Post of 24 February states that a shift dress on sale in the Monsoon chain is priced at £129 in Britain, which converts to just under €150, whereas the Irish price is €199. The word "shift" in Cork parlance has completely different connotations. Perhaps the Senator will enlighten me on the matter afterwards.

I seek clarification concerning the payment to farmers of grants under the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS. When will these payments be made? A large number of farmers in my local area, for example, in Athenry, Loughrea, Gort, Tuam and Kinvara, have been waiting for an unacceptably long time to have payments furnished to them. I understand farmers in the Galway East constituency are not alone and that numbers awaiting payment run into the thousands. Most of those affected are in an uncertain position and it is a source of frustration to them that payments are being held up for reasons that are not clear. The farmers in question have co-operated fully with the conditions of the scheme and are to be commended on the patience they have shown thus far. Farmers require certainty, however, regarding when payments will be made, given that in the current times they must manage tight farm budgets. I am aware that administrative problems arose in the AEOS 2 scheme but the matters were resolved after some time had elapsed. It is clear that more targeted action must be taken to prevent a repeat of these problems. It is vital that farmers receive their AEOS 2 payments immediately and that all payments are made without undue delay. Farm incomes have declined significantly in recent years and in the current times the option of subsidising their income by securing off-farm employment is no longer available. For this reason, the types of financial supports provided under the agri-environment options scheme are vital for ensuring the continuing success of local community focused farms. In the circumstances, I ask the Minister of State to confirm when the payments will be made and seek an assurance from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine that he will undertake to ensure all payments will be made in a timely manner in future. I look forward to the Minister of State's response. 
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14706	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-12 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	306	I thank Senator Higgins for raising this matter and convey the Minister's regrets that he cannot attend this debate in person. To set the context, the position is that payments by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine under the agri-environment options scheme, or AEOS as it is commonly known, are well advanced at this stage. Before discussing the details, I emphasise the commitment of the Minister and Government to the agri-environment schemes, namely, AEOS and the rural environmental protection scheme, as operated by the Department. The schemes put environmentally friendly farming to the forefront and recognise the vital role farmers play in delivering public goods in protecting the environment and natural heritage for the benefit of society as a whole. This commitment is evident in the fact that despite serious budgetary pressures facing his Department, the Minister opened AEOS to new applicants last year. In this regard, an additional €20 million was made available annually for five years to fund new applications under the scheme. This ongoing commitment is also evident in the fact that more than €750 million was spent by the Department on agri-environment schemes in the past three years alone, with a further €200 million available in 2013 under both REPS and AEOS. There are currently almost 30,000 participants in REPS and their contracts will continue until expiry of the five year contract period in each case. The successor to REPS, the agri-environment options scheme, is a more targeted agri-environment scheme for which funding is provided from modulation funds under the Common Agricultural Policy health check. As Senators will be aware, AEOS specifically targets three challenges that have been assigned the highest priority at European Union level as needing urgent action. The format of the scheme is a menu type approach, as distinct from the whole farm approach adopted under REPS. It consists of actions which can be demonstrably linked to the three important challenges targeted. There are approximately 15,000 participants in AEOS 1 and 2, which were opened to new participants in 2010 and 2011, respectively. The EU regulations governing the scheme and other area based schemes require that a full and comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the land parcel identification system, is completed before any payment can issue. Previous EU audits have made it clear that compliance with the regulations must be strictly adhered to and all checks must be passed and eligibility conditions met before payment issues. This means payment cannot be released until all aspects of a farmer's application are in order, all outstanding documentation provided and all queries resolved. These requirements are a significant administrative challenge, albeit one that the Department has successfully addressed.  The current position regarding payments under AEOS is that under AEOS 1, all outstanding payments due in respect of both 2010 and 2011 have been finalised.Of the 7,500 participants remaining in that scheme, nearly 6,500 have received payment in respect of 2012. The remaining cases are being cleared on an ongoing basis as queries are resolved. There are 6,250 approved participants in AEOS 2, 5,300 of whom have received a payment in respect of 2011. The outstanding cases are being finalised as outstanding queries are received. Applicants have been informed of these outstanding queries and payments are being made on an ongoing basis as responses are received. Last year saw the first full-year payment for AEOS 2 applicants. In order to activate payment where non-productive capital investments were selected, a valid capital investment claim form was required. The high level of queries and farmer delays in submitting valid claims has resulted in a lower than expected level of 2012 payments under AEOS 2. In all, 2,500 have received payment at this stage. There are a large number of queries arising. To deal with the outstanding queries, additional resources have been directed to this area with the intention of clearing the backlog as soon as possible. The majority of the outstanding payments relate to applicants who chose a capital investment option, such as the planting of trees or hedgerows, on their AEOS contract. Under the scheme, payment for these options commences in 2012. In order to be paid for 2012, farmers must have submitted valid receipts. Approximately 1,000 farmers have not submitted any claim form to date and of those who did, a very high percentage had queries which require further contact with the farmer. For these farmers, no part of their 2012 payment can be issued until they submit their receipts and the outstanding issues are resolved with them. The Department has contacted farmers who have not submitted claim forms at least twice, including where possible by phone, and is now dealing with replies received and outstanding queries. Where applicants have received correspondence in this regard, they should respond as soon as possible. On the basis of responses received from letters that have issued and the phone calls made by officials in the Department, the Minister aims to ensure that all outstanding cases are resolved in the shortest time possible. As I have mentioned, AEOS 3 was opened to applications at the end of 2012. The funding of €20 million per annum that the Minister has provided will allow for approximately 4,000 new participants to be approved. The Department is currently processing the applications with a view to issuing approvals in the next few weeks. It is expected that payments will commence towards the end of the year. I reaffirm the Government's commitment to the agri-environment schemes. The Minister is at all times conscious of the importance of the payments to farmer's incomes. He asked me to convey that he will ensure that his Department continues to make every effort to expedite all payments under these schemes.
#LorraineHiggins	unknown-#LorraineHiggins-party	unknown-#LorraineHiggins-dob	unknown-#LorraineHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-12 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	307	I thank the Minister of State for his response. It would be helpful if the Minister, Deputy Coveney, were here. Agriculture is his specific responsibility and there were a few points I wanted to put to him. I accept that if applications are not fully completed, it is very difficult to pay out. The reality is that quite a number of farmers have completed their application forms properly and would have expected to have been paid out in a timely manner. It would be extremely helpful to farmers, particularly those in my constituency, if the Minister indicated a timeframe, in terms of weeks or months, in which farmers will be paid. Ultimately, they have financial and other commitments, and they have creditors whom they are expected to pay, just like anybody else. They are totally reliant on schemes such as the AEOS to assist them in that regard. I acknowledge and welcome the additional resources provided by the Minister to ensure payments will be made. I ask the Minister of State to pass on my thanks to the Minister in that regard. I urge the Minister to indicate a timeframe in which the payments will be made and to make a public statement on the matter.

To be helpful, I will make sure to speak to the Minister on the issues she has outlined in respect of her constituency. A legitimate question arises if no queries arose regarding individual farmers' applications and if the files still have not been dealt with expeditiously. I will certainly relate this to the Minister.
