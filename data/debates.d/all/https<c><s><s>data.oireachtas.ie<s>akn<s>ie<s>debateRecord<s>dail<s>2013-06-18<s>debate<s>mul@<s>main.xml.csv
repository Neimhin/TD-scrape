I have been in correspondence with the family on the matter and officials from my office met with them as recently as 16 May. The family have supplied me with information in relation to their concerns. This information has been examined by officials in my Department and I have now sought further legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General. When this advice is received, I will be in a position to consider the matter further.

I acknowledge that he takes a personal interest in this particularly sensitive matter. We are discussing an incident in which two members of the Air Corps, Cadet David Jevens and Capt. Derek Furniss, lost their lives. I do not in any way wish to add to the deep distress that the families of both men continue to experience. It is none the less a fact that the Jevens family, in particular, remain seriously concerned about the accident and the events leading up to it. As the Minister will be aware, the family is deeply distressed and concerned after spending countless hours studying the documentation, the regulations and the procedures that surround military courts of inquiry and the air accident investigation unit. The family is raising issues that, if found to be correct, are of fundamental importance to the Air Corps. I believe the Minister realises the significance and sensitivity of the issue and I appeal to him to meet the family at the earliest opportunity in order to address the issues arising. If it is possible to put the minds of family members at rest in respect of these issues, I ask him to do so and, if it is not possible, whatever investigations may be required should be instigated.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	2	As the Deputy will be aware, three separate investigations have been conducted into this tragic accident. The first was conducted by the air accident investigation unit of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, which published its report on 24 January 2012. The second was held with the coroner's inquest in May 2012. The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death in respect of the individual in question. The third investigation was by a military court of inquiry, which was convened on 26 July 2012 and produced its report on 17 January 2013. The air accident investigation unit found that the probable cause of the accident was spatial disorientation of the instructor pilot in conditions of poor visibility, resulting in a controlled flight into terrain. The court of inquiry's findings are in agreement that the accident was caused by the spatial disorientation of the instructor who was piloting the aircraft in conditions of poor visibility. The coroner's inquest returned a verdict of accidental death in respect of cadet pilot Jevens and an open verdict in respect of the instructor pilot. All of the reports indicate that the cadet bore no responsibility of any kind for the accident. I am aware of the concerns expressed by the Jevens family but it appears for some reason that the family retains a view that someone believes this tragedy was in some way the fault of Cadet Jevens. Three reports have made it absolutely clear that it was not his fault. I would dearly like to set the minds of family members at rest in that regard. In the context of the more recent issues raised, I am obtaining advice thereon and having done so will duly respond.

However, far from the matter being resolved, the family continues to identify what it sees as serious problems with safety measures and the conduct of the various inquiries to which the Minister referred. I fear that if much more time is lost between now and when he meets the family, this problem will be further exacerbated. I welcome his indication that he would meet the family and ask him to do so at his earliest convenience.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	4	I emphasise that there is no question of any nature of Cadet Jevens being responsible for the events that occurred. I dearly wish that the family understood and fully accepted that there is no issue in that context. In the context of the various safety recommendations of the air accident investigation unit, I am advised that all seven safety recommendations have been acted upon or implemented. Owing to the nature of some of the recommendations, work remains ongoing in two specific areas. These relate to the recommendation concerning external input into the Air Corps safety management system and the recommendation on implementation of flight data monitoring. The position in respect of the former is that the Air Corps has accepted the suggestion of inclusion of external input into the safety management system auditing process and identified a suitable expert to visit the Air Corps in this regard. It is anticipated that the safety management system review will be completed in 2013. The position in respect of flight data monitoring is that a study on this matter has been completed and steps have been taken to commence implementation of recommendations made on equipping all aircraft in the fleet with flight data monitoring. Based on the reports that were published, neither of these matters was an issue that resulted in the tragic events that occurred. It is clear and without doubt from all of the reports that the accident was a consequence of the training pilot or instructor pilot suffering spatial disorientation in conditions of poor visibility, resulting in a controlled flight into terrain. That was the reason for this event. As I stated, the Department will continue to try to provide to the family any further information of relevance we can and we will do what we can to set their minds at rest. In so far as there are any suggestions of any nature of any legal issues in respect of which the family have concern, I will deal with such matters based on the best advice available to me.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	5	Malaria is a serious disease that kills approximately 1 million people per annum in sub-Saharan Africa alone. It is a serious threat to any military force operating in the area. The anti-malaria regime in place in the Defence Forces, including the use of lariam, has worked. In the decade of deployment to sub-Saharan Africa by the Defence Forces, not a single member of the Defence Forces has died from malaria and there are only three documented cases of personnel contracting the disease. The Irish Medicines Board, IMB, is the statutory body that regulates medicines available in Ireland. I am advised that the three anti-malarial medications licensed by the IMB, namely, lariam, malarone and doxycycline, can all have significant side effects. To assert that any one of these products is automatically a more effective or safer alternative to the others is a grossly misleading over-simplification. Each of the three drugs has been used by the Defence Forces, depending on individual circumstances, including the type of malaria in the destination, the duration of travel, etc. I am further advised that the Defence Forces are fully aware of the range of reported side effects attaching to all anti-malarial medications. Protocols are in place to control the risk of side effects in individuals.  Lariam is one of the most effective medications for protection against the type of malaria prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa. I have had the various allegations surrounding the use of lariam investigated thoroughly and I have obtained the advice of leading medical experts who concur with the prescribing practices followed by the Defence Forces. I am advised that the allegation of a link between lariam and suicide or suicide ideation has been examined. Of 156 non-service related deaths among members of the Defence Forces in the period from January 2000 to December 2010, 25 were apparently from self-inflicted injuries, although only one is recorded by a coroner as suicide. Of these 25 deaths, lariam had never been prescribed in 16 cases. Of the remaining nine cases, given the limited period of time during which lariam remains in the bloodstream, according to our expert advice, it is extremely unlikely that the product could have been a contributory factor in practically all of these cases. There is no evidence in any of the coroners' inquests linking any deaths to lariam.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	Perhaps I might finish this sentence as it might be of assistance to the Deputy. The death rate in the Defence Forces from self-inflicted injuries in the period 2000 to 2010, when lariam was being prescribed, was 0.24%. The death rate from self-inflicted injuries in the period 1989 to 1999, when lariam was not being prescribed, was 0.32%, which is higher than the death rate in the period when lariam was being prescribed.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 Lariam must remain in the formulary of medication prescribed by the medical corps for Defence Forces personnel on appropriate overseas missions, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa, to ensure that our military personnel can have effective protection from the very serious risks posed by this highly dangerous disease.
#PadraigMacLochlainn	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-party	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-dob	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	Obviously, the Minister and his departmental officials are determined to defend the use of lariam and he has provided statistics which is fair enough. Why did the United States Government, which has one of the largest defence forces in the world, stop using lariam if everything the Minister has said about there being no concern over its use is accurate?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	The answer is very simple. I understand the United States forces stopped using the medication owing to concerns about inadvertent prescribing to soldiers who should not take it. In this regard I am advised that the US authorities undertook mass administration of lariam for soldiers serving in areas subject to malaria without any individual screening of personnel. That is the difference between what the Defence Forces in this State do and what was occurring in the United States. The recommendation and protocols that apply here require the screening of each member of the Defence Forces with regard to the taking of lariam, to identify whether there are any contraindications that could give rise to an issue of concern. Lariam is prescribed for a period of time prior to members of the Defence Forces going abroad on a mission in order to identify any reaction that might occur. The Defence Forces here do not mass prescribe, but follow all the instructions issued by the Irish Medicines Board in order to fully screen out personnel who may potentially have an adverse reaction to the medication. That is the crucial difference between us and the United States defence forces. In this context it is important to emphasise that this is about ensuring that members of our Defence Forces on UN missions do not contract malaria, which is crucial because one should never forget that malaria kills.

Mental health screening is very precarious. Many people do not acknowledge that they have mental health difficulties until a certain stage in their lives. That particular screening is fraught with difficulties. Can the Minister confirm that the use of lariam is not cost related and is absolutely based on the best possible medical protection that can be given to members of the Defence Forces?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	The decision to prescribe lariam is not based on cost but based on it being the appropriate medication to prescribe to provide protection against malaria for members of the Defence Forces going to particular regions. I remind the Deputy that the Irish Medicines Board is the statutory authority with responsibility for the quality, safety and efficacy of medicines for use in Ireland. That applies to all medicines and not just lariam. It does not have a special role simply with regard to the Defence Forces. For any prescription medicines that the Deputy, I or any other Member of this House might take, we are reliant on the best advices and expertise of the Irish Medicines Board. Following approval and use of a medicine, the IMB monitors the type and frequency of any reported side effects. As product usage increases more information on safety profile becomes available. Further decisions and recommendations regarding its use are made by the IMB and its international counterparts. The Defence Forces comply fully with IMB guidelines on the prescription of medicines for members of the Defence Forces. Defence Forces policy is firstly to screen personnel for medical suitability and fitness to serve abroad.Fitness to serve abroad is defined by medical classification code. Personnel who do not achieve the specific code are deemed to be medically unfit for overseas service. This automatically rules them out. I assure the Deputy that this is an issue of which I was aware before I came into office, it is an issue about which I have regularly asked questions and it is one I am monitoring carefully. It is of great importance that our Defence Forces have the best possible medical information available to them and that we operate within that context and on the best advice of the Irish Medicines Board. This is what we will continue to do. In so far as any issue could arise, the Deputy can be assured I will ensure that any issue that does arise is fully addressed.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	The individual referred to by the Deputy as a whistleblower sent a letter dated 22 April 2010 to the then Minister for Defence, Mr. Tony Killeen. The letter, which contained a number of allegations pertaining to serving and former Defence Forces personnel, was brought to the attention of the military authorities. The letter was referred to the military authorities without providing personal details for the whistleblower as the letter had specifically requested that the home address of the whistleblower would not be given to the Irish Army. The letter indicated that the author had verbally received his information from another party and through sight of documents held in that other party's possession. I am advised by the military authorities that in July 2010, military police investigators met with the other party in the presence of his legal team and some of the allegations contained in the letter were discussed. The whistleblower appeared to be a third party to the matters in question with no personal involvement in any of the alleged activities and had specifically requested that home address details would not be given to the military authorities. Accordingly, it was not considered appropriate for military police personnel to interview him. The investigation, when completed, found no evidence to support the suggestion that Defence Forces equipment was utilised in any of the alleged activities, nor was there any evidence found of any illegal arms purchase or sales. In addition, the investigation undertaken by the military authorities found that Defence Forces regulations were not breached.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	I am given to understand that the whistleblower in question was asked by the director of a private security company, Confidential Investigations Athlone, to work for the company in the Seychelles in respect of the recovery of a €25 million security contract which he had lost to former employees, including former and serving Irish soldiers. As the Minister is aware, this relates to the claim that arms were being bought on the black market in South Africa and shipped to a special forces unit in the Seychelles to train and arm same. I understand that the former Minister with responsibility for justice, Michael McDowell, was working with Confidential Investigations Athlone on this issue because the company believed it was being double-crossed by former employees. It is somewhat unusual that shortly after the investigation the Chief of Staff updated the Defence Forces policy on off-duty employment. The Defence Forces must have seen something that was not completely in order. Does the Minister agree that the testimony of a whistleblower would be critical to an investigation of this order? The Minister has referred to the person in question as a third party and that may be so. I cannot say for certain how much validity there is in the case, but I found it odd that a person who brought the information into the public domain and who informed the Defence Forces about it was not interviewed. Does the Minister not believe that would be a good idea?

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	As the Deputy is aware, these are matters that go back prior to my time in office.If a person provides information that appears to be hearsay from a third party, if the person who provides the information is not involved in it, and if the person whom the Deputy apparently describes as a whistleblower - anyone who has information about anything - provides the information on the condition that no one is told who they are, that they are not interviewed and they do not talk to anyone, I cannot understand how the Deputy can complain that the person who gave the information and requested that their identity would not be revealed and said that they would not talk to anybody could now complain that no one talked to them. If an issue or allegation is being made by a company operating in this State of illegality and improper conduct on the part of a member or members of the Defence Forces, the company should put the allegation in writing and send it to me and I will have it investigated, as opposed to people going through circuitous routes. There is no need for people to be anonymous. If there is a serious allegation that someone has behaved illegally, that something illegal has happened relating to the Defence Forces, the person making the allegation should set out the factual basis for the allegation. If I am furnished with the information, I will have the matter investigated. However, if the matter involves the purchase of weapons in the Seychelles, the information I am given - assuming it is the incident I am advised the Deputy is addressing and we are both talking about the same incident - is that weapons were purchased legitimately by the Seychelles Government. I am further advised that no members of the Defence Forces behaved illegally or unlawfully.

I will put the Minister’s offer to him. I know the incident did not happen on the Minister’s watch. It happened long before his time. I will put it to the individual concerned that the Minister has offered to examine whatever evidence he supplies.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	19	Pursuant to the Red Cross Act of 1938, the Irish Red Cross Society was established by Government order in 1939 as an independent charitable body corporate with full power to manage and administer its own affairs. Since 1939, the relevant establishment order had undergone piecemeal changes only but, in April of last year, I received Government approval to make substantial changes to the 1939 order. These represented the most wide-ranging and fundamental set of changes to have occurred since the establishment of the society. One of the key changes made was a substantial reduction in the number of Government nominees to the society’s general assembly, from not less than one third of its composition to not more than 10%. The legislation was also amended to provide that the chairperson of the society is now elected by the society itself, in accordance with its own rules and constitution, rather than by the President. In tandem with the Government’s initiative in amending the legislation, the society itself made a number of very progressive changes to its constitution and rules. I believe the society now has in place a 21st century corporate governance framework that meets the rigorous standards set for good governance internationally by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, IFRC, and the International Committee of the Red Cross, ICRC. There is clearly a strong impetus for change within the society itself, and while a lot of important initiatives have been taken place over the past two years, these have tended, necessarily, to be focused on governance reform, the overhaul of the society’s financial management systems and reporting processes, and a revision of its operating policies and procedures. I am pleased to note this work is substantially complete and the attention of the society has turned to addressing other strategic challenges such as the development of a resilient and reliable funding base, more dynamic management of resources and the development of organisational structures that will enable the society to deliver its services more effectively to its beneficiaries, at home and abroad.I am satisfied this phase of the society’s reform is now gathering momentum and I understand the board of directors has recently set progress milestones for itself to ensure these reforms remain on course for completion by the middle of next year. Finally, it is important that I also mention the commitment made in the programme for Government for the initiation of a detailed legal review of the basis, structures and governance of the Red Cross in Ireland to improve its functioning in the light of changing circumstances. I can confirm that my Department has commenced work on the review and I anticipate this will result in a Red Cross Act amendment Bill during the lifetime of this Government.

I am a little concerned that the legislation to reform the Red Cross is delayed until next year. I believe the Minister is talking about its publication in what effectively will be the fourth year of the Government's term in office. It has been leapt over by the Defence Forces (Second World War Amnesty and Immunity) Bill, which was not even mentioned in the programme for Government. Perhaps that indicates the Minister's own personal preferences. As for the governance issues, I am conscious when raising such matters that all Members are proud of the work the Irish Red Cross Society has done since its establishment in 1939. However, the issue of governance has been raised in this House frequently, including by my colleague, Deputy Finian McGrath, and it was raised many times with the Minister's predecessor. Can I put it to the Minister that the treasurer of the organisation, appointed only in May 2012, has recently resigned? There are some suggestions, which I hope the Minister can refute, that the treasurer resigned because he was not satisfied with the current governance arrangements.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	22	In the context of the treasurer, his resignation is a matter for the society itself. I understand the society hopes to be in a position to elect a new honorary treasurer at its forthcoming general assembly meeting, which is taking place on Saturday, 29 June next. In accordance with the society's rules and constitution, the election of the treasurer is a matter for the society's general assembly. The last occasion on which this body met was on 9 February last, too soon after the treasurer's resignation, which occurred on 5 February last. I have no hand or part of any description in anything to do with the resignation of the treasurer.
#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	I do not suggest the Minister had anything to do with this. However, I suggest that if one does not know the reason the treasurer resigned and if it is the case that there is some continuing concern about the governance arrangements within the Red Cross, this should be of great concern to the Minister. The Chartered Accountants Regulatory Board was quite critical about the auditing of the Irish Red Cross Society and referred to breaches of procedure and failure to comply with international standards on auditing. I am sure the Minister is concerned about these matters and I would not brush aside, in the way he has, the resignation of the treasurer because it continues an undesirable situation in which the governance of the Red Cross continues to be questioned at a time when one wishes the public to have full and absolute confidence in the Red Cross organisation. I am sure the Minister would agree with me on that matter.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	24	The Deputy of course would be aware the governance difficulties in the Red Cross occurred during the lengthy period in office not of my immediate predecessor, former Deputy Killeen, who was only briefly in the Department of Defence, but under the watch of Deputy O'Dea, who did not seem to do a whole heap about it.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	27	-----the early weeks of my period in office. I am not aware of any governance issues that gave rise to the resignation of the treasurer. People resign from positions of responsibility in voluntary organisations for all sorts of reasons and it would be most unfortunate were the Deputy, by a loose comment, to damage the reputation of the Red Cross by suggesting there is a difficulty of which I am unaware. If the Deputy is aware of some current governance difficulty, he is welcome to share it with me but I should draw to the Deputy's attention that the changes the society made to its rules and constitution during my period of office were approved unanimously by the joint statutes commission of the International Committee of the Red Cross, as well as the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent societies.As a consequence of the changes made, the Head of Governance Support at the international federation wrote to the Irish Red Cross congratulating the society "for its continued efforts in revising its legal base" and confirmed that the changes the society had made are in conformity with the requirements of Geneva's Guidance for National Societies Statutes. It also confirmed "that the revised draft constitution has at this stage rightly addressed the areas that are important for a well-functioning national society". I draw to the Deputy's attention that those events occurred subsequent to my becoming Minister for Defence and following my meeting with members of the Irish Red Cross so as to ensure that governance difficulties were addressed.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	28	I agreed to an interview with NATO Review on 21 March this year. The question I was asked regarding Ireland’s neutrality was how important it is for a militarily neutral country like Ireland to be in partnership with an organisation like NATO. In response to this question I referred to the fact that although we are a neutral country, our traditional stance on neutrality bears no relevance to the fight against terrorism or cyber security issues which are real threats for Ireland and the European Union today. In relation to the issue of neutrality, Ireland’s policy of military neutrality is defined by non-participation in a military alliance or mutual-defence arrangements. Ireland's military neutrality is particular to its own unique history and geopolitical position and is not affected by participation in Partnership for Peace. Ireland’s membership of Partnership for Peace since 1999 is consistent with our traditional foreign policy approach and objectives such as the protection of human rights, support for development and arms control measures and our overall security policy, including non-membership of military alliances. There is no mutual defence commitment involved and the partnership provides a voluntary framework for security co-operation. The principles of the Partnership for Peace are anchored in the United Nations and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe charters, and are consistent with Ireland’s foreign policy goals, particularly the peaceful resolution of conflicts.

Our people are very proud of it, have endorsed it and wish to see it continue but it is active neutrality. Ireland has been one of the highest per capita contributors to overseas aid in the world. That has been our tradition. Our tradition in the missionaries is one of active participation in assistance to the developing world. We have made a real contribution to conflict resolution. As I speak, people are assisting the process in Colombia in a real way, learning from the lessons here in Ireland. It has happened in Sri Lanka also and will happen in many other countries. We have a proud tradition of blue helmet peacekeeping operations. We have an active, participative role. We do not sit on the fence. We play to our historical strengths. We are not a country that colonised other countries. We were colonised, and that gives us real strength and credibility in playing a role in conflict resolution. That is the context. The concern is that we have had the Beyond Neutrality document from Gay Mitchell, from the Minister's party. We have had these comments from the Minister. Can the Minister confirm decisively that the Fine Gael Party, and the Minister as Minister for Defence, stand by and are proud of our position of neutrality and wish to move forward on that basis?

I recognise the importance of us being members of Partnership for Peace and I do not have a problem of any description with our military neutrality, but I will reiterate and repeat every time anyone asks me that I am not neutral when it comes to terrorism and people being blown apart. I am not neutral when it comes to cyber security issues and ensuring that people are protected against individuals who engage in cyber crime and seek to disrupt not just companies and individuals, but states. I regard our involvement in Partnership for Peace as of importance. Unfortunately, Sinn Féin, a body that had a great belief in military engagement until relatively recently, has a particular perspective on these issues.Partnership for Peace was established in January 1994 as a means of outreach to the new democracies in central and eastern Europe and as a way to promote stability and strengthen relationships through the promotion of practical co-operation. It is a very important grouping. It has since been joined by states that wish to become NATO members and those that do not. Partnership for Peace includes the neutral and non-aligned states of Finland, Sweden, Austria and Switzerland. Russia is also a member, something of which some members of Sinn Féin in its earlier guise would have approved. They were never quite neutral over Russia. Some of them thought what Russia did in most parts of the world was a reasonably good thing. We have been a member of Partnership for Peace since December 1999, and in that time, Dáil Éireann has approved a presentation document setting out overall priorities for Ireland's participation, the foremost being co-operation in peacekeeping. I am pleased that our engagement in Partnership for Peace has ensured the Defence Forces operate at the highest level, allowing for interaction with other members of Partnership for Peace in UN peacekeeping missions. It is particularly in the interests of this State, using our expertise in peacekeeping, that we maintain that relationship.

We enjoy it when he is on form. The Minister is well aware of the concerns about NATO. A substantial number of the more prominent NATO countries have a colonial history in North Africa and the Middle East. NATO was supposed to have been dismantled after the Cold War. It is a relic of that time and is no longer necessary. The United Nations and the EU are in place to deal with conflict resolution. I am not asking for the Minister's personal view, I am asking for the Government position. Does it stand over our long-held and proud tradition of active, participative neutrality, playing to our strengths, to protect human rights, help developing nations and, where necessary, to be involved in peacekeeping and conflict resolution?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	32	The Deputy should be reasonably clear by now that the answer is "yes". I become concerned when neutrality is used as a flag to suggest we should not engage in peacekeeping, or that we should be neutral when it comes to terrorism and people being blown apart. I will never be neutral about that. Neutrality can be a convenient flag on occasions to avoid making moral judgments that should be made in the international arena. Do I support our not being formally part of some military alliance intent on invading some other state? Of course I do, but it is important that we do not regard NATO as irrelevant. Close co-operation between NATO and the UN and its agencies is an important element in the development of what is known as an international comprehensive approach to crisis management and to UN operations. In that context, the UN relies on regional groupings to facilitate putting together peacekeeping missions and operations. NATO in that context is a crucial element. UN Security Council resolutions have provided the mandate for NATO operations in the western Balkans and Afghanistan, and we participated in NATO-led operations in those areas. More recently, NATO operations to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under attack in Libya in 2011 were carried out under the remit of UN Security Council Resolution No. 1973. NATO also provided support to UN-sponsored operations, including logistical assistance to the African Union's UN-endorsed peacekeeping operations in Darfur, Sudan and Somalia, support for UN disaster relief operations in Pakistan following the dreadful earthquake in 2005, and escorted merchant ships carrying World Food Programme humanitarian supplies off the coast of Somalia. NATO has reformulated itself into a very important body in dealing with peacekeeping and humanitarian relief across the world. Our link to that is through Partnership for Peace.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	34	Since the coming into force of the Lisbon treaty, the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Baroness Catherine Ashton, conducts the Union's common foreign and security policy assisted by the European External Action Service. The EU's common security and defence policy forms an integral part of the Union's common foreign and security policy. In the area of common security and defence policy, the role of the Presidency is now centred on supporting the High Representative and the European External Action Service in this regard. This arrangement provides Ireland with a significant opportunity to influence the common security and defence policy agenda. As part of Ireland's Presidency of the European Council 2013, I prioritised a number of areas to progress during our Presidency. These priorities included preparations for the European Council meeting in December 2013, which will discuss security and defence issues and which comprised a meeting of Heads of State, continued development of EU common security and defence policy, enhancing EU-UN relations, EU co-operation in the area of maritime security and surveillance, addressing the impact of the financial crisis on defence through pooling and sharing, and support for jobs, growth and innovation through focusing on the role of small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, in fostering innovation in the security sector. In relation to progress made during the Presidency, the key event was the informal meeting of Defence Ministers held in Dublin Castle in February last. At my invitation, the UN Under-Secretary General in the department of peacekeeping operations attended the meeting. This was the first time that the UN was represented at a meeting of EU Defence Ministers. The Secretary General of NATO, on his first formal visit to Ireland, also attended the meeting. A range of issues were discussed, including the upcoming European Council on defence, Mali, the Horn of Africa and partnerships between the EU and the United Nations. Three very successful seminars have also been held in Ireland. The first seminar was on the topic of co-operation between regional organisations and the United Nations in the area of crisis management, peace support and peace enforcement operations. The second seminar dealt with the issue of maritime security and surveillance and the third seminar dealt with the upcoming European Council meeting on defence to be held in December 2013.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 A further seminar was held in Brussels in conjunction with the European Defence Agency on countering the threat from improvised explosive devices, IEDs. A second seminar will also be held in Brussels later this week, which will be hosted by the Irish Presidency, in association with the Estonian Ministry of Defence and the European Defence Agency. This seminar will deal with the issue of cyber-security co-operation in the European Union and advance the debate on European Union member states' preparedness to face cyber threats at national level and across the EU as a whole. The outcomes of all seminars held to date have been very positive and these seminars have stimulated debate and advanced the work of the EU institutions in these areas. The defence priorities have centred on how Ireland and the Union as a whole can contribute to international peace and security and the enhancement of the EU's common security and defence policy, which are central to ensuring the security and safety of our citizens.

Indeed, he made a number of interesting speeches in the course of the past six months which we all would do well to study in detail. I have two issues. The Minister made major mention of the importance of improving EU-UN relations. How would he indicate the progress he has achieved in that area? In the area of common security and defence policy and the agenda in that regard, what are the specifics the Minister would claim to have put on the agenda in the course of the past six months and how have those specifics been advanced?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	36	In the context of EU-UN relations, one of the issues on which we wanted to focus particularly is the need for EU states to provide greater participation in UN missions and to ensure there are the necessary resources across the European Union to facilitate appropriate missions being undertaken, and that resources are used wisely and acquired in co-operation. One of the issues with regard to the United Nations is that whereas the European Union contributes substantial funding to UN missions, the numbers participating from the defence forces across the EU in UN missions are remarkably small. One of the reasons for one of the seminars we held was to bring together the UN, NATO and EU Defence Ministers and top level members of the defence family across the European Union to focus greatly on how Europe can better engage in peacekeeping, conflict resolution and humanitarian missions, how we can facilitate a faster reaction when necessary, and how, in the context of using resources, there can be a greater use by way of pooling and sharing in the acquisition of resources and greater compatibilities, even when it comes to simple communication equipment that might be utilised by EU member states working in partnership in particular missions. Substantial progress has been made in advancing these issues and in creating an agenda of interest.On Thursday this week there will be the first ever top-level conference on cyber security, bringing together top-level officials in both the defence and justice area at EU level. It is happening under the Irish Presidency in Brussels so as to provide for greater co-operation and co-ordination in dealing with cyber security issues across the justice and defence sectors. That is instead of each sector operating in isolation.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	37	The primary responsibility for the maintenance of law and order rests with An Garda Síochána. The Defence Forces, pursuant to the role of rendering aid to the civil power, assist An Garda Síochána when requested. The explosive ordnance disposal, EOD, teams respond when a request is made by An Garda Síochána for assistance in dealing with a suspect device or for the removal of old ordnance. The number of times that the EOD teams have been deployed in the years 2011, 2012 and to date in 2013 is as follows. In 2011, there were 237 call-outs, with the number of viable improvised explosive devices, IEDs, dealt with at 70; in 2011 there were 209 call-outs, with the number of viable improvised explosive devices dealt with at 96; and in 2013 to date, there were 119 call-outs, with the number of viable improvised explosive devices dealt with at 46. Apart from IEDs, other types of call-outs would include hoaxes, false alarms, post-blast analysis, dealing with unstable chemicals and conventional munitions destruction of old historical artillery shells. Incidents in 2013 to date have been in the main IEDs and dealing with finds of old munitions, as well as unstable chemicals in laboratories. All EOD call-outs are treated as viable devices until post-operation analysis.

I believe he would join with me in commending the explosive ordnance disposal teams of the Defence Forces on their outstanding courage and bravery, as well as their technical ability as outlined by the Minister. I presume that in recent days those teams have been standing by. The Minister has mentioned what the teams deal with and in my constituency in the past couple of months, the EODs were called to a number of suspect devices by An Garda Síochána. Is the Minister happy that the resources available to EODs are sufficient? In Fort Lee in Virginia in the US, there is a 40 week course for engineers in the area. Is he satisfied with the level of technical education available to our very brave soldiers in the area? Is he aware of the number of personnel involved in teams? The terrible Boston tragedy some months ago reminded us how terrible these kinds of dastardly events can be, as well as the kind of harm that can be done to the public. Is the Minister concerned by reports indicating a number of Internet sites - he has already mentioned cybersecurity - where bomb-making materials and expertise is evident? Does he have plans, in conjunction with other EU defence Ministers, to address the problem?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	39	To take the Deputy's last question first, there are a number of sites on the web providing substantial detail on how to make bombs. It is a continuing and difficult issue and I can see it from both sides in my role as Minister for Justice and Equality and dealing with counter-terrorism. One cannot police every website in the world and information is currently readily available.It is an issue of which the security forces, both the police and Defence Forces, are aware. Unfortunately the reality is that we live in a world where someone who wants to manufacture a form of improvised explosive device can learn very easily how to do that.  Having said that, it is right that I praise the brave members of the Defence Forces who are called out regularly to neutralise improvised explosive devices. They do it with extraordinary skill and bravery. They have and will continue to have any equipment they require in this area and they have excellent training. Indeed, members of our Defence Forces are recognised globally as having substantial expertise in this area and they have used that expertise to train others in different parts of the world in how to neutralise improvised explosive devices. In response to the specific question from the Deputy, there are currently five EODTs located throughout the country. Teams are based in Costume Barracks in Athlone, Collins Barracks in Cork, Cathal Brugha Barracks in Rathmines, Gormanstown in County Meath and at the Defence Forces Training in the Curragh, in support of Dublin Airport. The Defence Forces maintain the capacity to stand up additional teams if required. A team typically consists of three personnel, made up of one officer, one NCO and one driver. A team is also always accompanied by a security team, which travels with the EODT to provide protection. This is an area in which, unfortunately, we were forced by events that occurred on this island over many years to develop a substantial level of skill and expertise. It is one of the great skills that vests within our Defence Forces.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	40	There are currently two medals that mark the service of personnel with either the Permanent Defence Force or the Reserve Defence Force. The medal known as the "Service Medal” may be awarded to an officer, non-commissioned officer or private of the Permanent Defence Force or a member of the Army nursing or chaplaincy services who possesses the qualifying criteria for the award. In addition, in 1961, the "Service Medal - Reserve Defence Force” , formerly known as the "Service Medal FCA" and "An Slua Muirí" was introduced for members and former members of the Reserve who meet the qualifying criteria laid down. The awarding of either of these medals to qualifying personnel reflects the service given by those personnel to either the Permanent Defence Force or the Reserve Defence Force, as the case may be and, by extension, to the wider public, during the periods for which they served.  While acknowledging the significant role of all Defence Forces personnel to the security of the State throughout the period of the Troubles, I am satisfied that these medals meet the need of marking service of personnel with either the Permanent Defence Force or the Reserve Defence Force and I have no plans to introduce additional medals.
#DerekKeating	unknown-#DerekKeating-party	unknown-#DerekKeating-dob	unknown-#DerekKeating-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	41	I thank the Minister for his reply. I grew up on a daily diet of the Troubles on television, radio and in the print media. I welcome the move away from terrorism; away from the killing, mayhem and other illegal activities that took place over those unhappy decades. Such activities were carried out by a number of groups including the IRA and supporters of that organisation, including Sinn Féin, members of which have been elected to this House. I had hoped that the Minister would recognise a need to remember and distinguish those members of the Irish Defence Forces who throughout the 1970s, 1980s and even the 1990s, protected our Border, defused bombs, assisted the Garda with State security and carried out many other acts of bravery. The Minister will agree that the Irish Army is recognised throughout the world as a highly professional, brave and dedicated troupe of men and women who have served this country with great honour. During those troubled times, they provided the State with a service that warrants the term "hero". It is in that spirit that I tabled this question, to seek some recognition through a service medal. The fact that the G8 summit is taking place on our island is a remarkable sign of confidence from the eight world leaders of the powerful nations that the island of Ireland is now a safe, peaceful and suitable place to visit and enjoy. Who would have thought ten or 20 years ago this would happen? It is in this spirit the members of the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force who played their part should be awarded with special recognition. I recognise the Minister's report and I am disappointed. Will the Minister consider this and consult the Chief of Staff to seek his view on recognising the very special period during the troubled times we had and the very special brave and honourable way a small group of people in our nation played a major part in securing safety on the island?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	42	Other than the service medal, and the service medal for the Reserve Defence Force, other medals are awarded to members of the Defence Forces. I do not know whether the Deputy is aware of this. Military medals are bestowed in recognition of specific acts or service which can vary in significance from routine duty to bravery and valour. The following medals have been awarded to personnel who have served in the Defence Forces since 31 July 1924: emergency service medal, good conduct medal, military medal for gallantry, distinguished service medal, UN peacekeeper's medal and the military star. A series of medals are and have been given in various circumstances. When I was last in the Lebanon with members of our Defence Forces I was very proud to be present when they were given their UN service medal for peacekeeping in southern Lebanon. A variety of medals are made available to members of the Defence Forces in various circumstances. I have no plans for any additional medals at present.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	43	The total number of personnel who left the Permanent Defence Force in the period 2010 to 2012 is 2,066, broken down as follows: 534 personnel left in 2010, of which 53 were officers; 729 personnel left in 2011, of which 72 were officers; and 803 personnel left in 2012, of which 70 were officers. The total number of personnel who left the Reserve Defence Force in the period 2010 to 2012 is 4,012, broken down as follows: 2,182 personnel left in 2010, of which 49 were officers; 1,161 personnel left in 2011, of which 47 were officers; and 669 personnel left in 2012, of which 59 were officers. Personnel leave the Defence Forces on a voluntary basis for a variety of reasons including having completed the requisite years of service or having reached the maximum age limit. In addition, there are occasions when personnel are compelled to retire due to medical or disciplinary issues.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	44	The position is that under the terms of the Defence (Amendment) Act 1990 the Defence Forces representative associations are prohibited from being associated with or affiliated to any trade unions, or any other body without the consent of the Minister. Accordingly, the representative association PDFORRA cannot be affiliated to ICTU at present. A similar arrangement applies to the Garda Síochána representative associations. The basis for the prohibition is that it would be inappropriate to apply the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 to members of the Defence Forces. The taking of any form of industrial action is felt to be irreconcilable with military service. As has been done in the past, the Defence Forces may be called on to contribute to maintaining vital services in times of industrial action. The potential for serious difficulties could arise in these circumstances if the associations were associated with or affiliated to ICTU. A number of mechanisms have been put in place through the Defence Forces conciliation and arbitration scheme to compensate for the prohibition on affiliation to ICTU. These provide the representative associations with structures and processes which enable them to make representations and negotiate on behalf of their members.In addition, a framework exists that facilitates the associations engaging with the official side in talks parallel to those taking place between ICTU and the official side at national level. This parallel process was successfully operated in respect of the most recent rounds of discussions, facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission on an extension to the Public Service Agreement 2010–14, which concluded last month. I am satisfied with the present arrangements in place and have no plans to make any changes.
#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	I understand that the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, wrote to the Minister recently seeking associate membership of ICTU. In PDFORRA's correspondence, it points out that, with the Minister's permission, it has joined the Irish Conference of Professional Service Associations and has also been allowed to affiliate to the European Federation of Employees in Public Services. It should at least be possible to explore allowing PDFORRA to take up associate membership of ICTU. One is conscious that a strike of public servants or a national strike would require members of the Defence Forces to be called upon, but one could not, nor would not, countenance a situation in which their membership of ICTU would give rise to their refusal. That is not what is envisaged. I am also conscious that the International Labour Organisation, ILO, has pointed out that Article 5 of its Labour Relations (Public Services) Convention 1978, convention No. 151, provides that organisations such as PDFORRA "shall enjoy complete independence from public authorities". Ireland could be viewed as being in contravention of this article, given the Department of Defence's refusal to allow listed personnel to join organisations like ICTU. I would welcome any further comment from the Minister.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	46	The Deputy may be aware that PDFORRA requested on a number of occasions - in 2002, 2009 and 2012 - to become either affiliated to or to take up associate membership of ICTU. These requests from PDFORRA raised significant challenges requiring mature consideration. Ireland has always been at the forefront in Europe in accepting defence forces into industrial relations mechanisms. The system in place in the Defence Forces continues to operate well and I believe that Defence Forces personnel have achieved significant benefits down the years through the existing process. Personnel are the critical resources of the Defence Forces. Consideration of a request for associate membership of ICTU requires us to consider the potential conflicts and divided loyalties that may well arise where the Government decides to deploy the Defence Forces in a situation of industrial unrest. In such circumstances, it is impossible to escape the unique position of the Defence Forces and, indeed, the Garda Síochána in the State. It is important that the Defence Forces can deal with matters appropriately in the context of performing their crucial role in the State.
#SeanOFearghaillFF	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-party	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-dob	unknown-#SeanOFearghaillFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	47	I am aware that previous Ministers refused this request, but it is an anomaly and an anachronism that organisations such as PDFORRA cannot be represented to some extent in pay negotiations. The idea that they could be represented by their employer, who is their paymaster, is nonsensical. The loyalty, solidarity and support of the Defence Forces, as represented through PDFORRA and the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, are beyond question. There is no doubt in my mind, as I am sure there is no doubt in the Minister's mind, that there would be no set of circumstances in which these organisations would seek to put the security of the State or the wishes of the Minister of the day under threat or challenge.

The request for associate membership of ICTU is a reasonable one. In the recent Croke Park II and Haddington Road negotiations, there was a disquiet among members of the security forces regarding the State's major economic developments and the fact that such important servants of the State were not given a direct input into the decisions being taken on their futures.The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has attempted to shape a way forward for the economic future of the country. Looking back at history, it is clear the right to collective bargaining is a fundamental civil right. The Minister might remember I tried to have that vindicated in this House on a number of occasions, when both he and I were on the backbenches. It is right that he consider this for PDFORRA.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	It is very important, when there are discussions relating to terms and conditions of employment, such as occurred recently and which led to the Haddington Road agreement, that the representative bodies, be they from the Defence Forces side or the Garda side, feel they can be fully engaged. The parallel process that took place facilitated that. However, I have stated I am happy to look at how that process can be improved. We should not always assume existing structures are as perfect as they might be. I am very happy to see whether things can be changed in a way in which there might be a perception of greater engagement. I wish to praise the different representative bodies in dealing with what were known as the Croke Park II discussions, subsequently the Haddington Road discussions. The Defence Forces representative bodies dealt very carefully and very committedly with those matters. Quite rightly, they sought to protect the position of their members but they also engaged constructively to assist and identify how crucial savings could be made. When it came to the Haddington Road agreement, the Garda representative bodies similarly engaged constructively. I am aware Deputy Ó Fearghaíl is pushing me to do something his party has never agreed to do at any time it was in government throughout the history of the State. It is always interesting to try-----

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	55	I will conclude on this for Deputy Broughan. It is important to note the first objective of the ICTU constitution is: "to uphold the democratic character and structure of the trade union movement, to maintain the right and freedom of association, the right of workers to organise and negotiate" - all of which are of great importance - "and all such rights as are necessary to the performance of trade union function, in particular the right to strike". As has happened in the past, the Defence Forces can be called upon at any time to aid the civil authority. The potential for serious difficulties could arise in such circumstances, if PDFORRA were associated with ICTU, as clear conflicts of objects and policies could and, I believe, would arise. This is a complex issue and we must recognise that both the Defence Forces and An Garda Síochána play a specific and particular role in the State.

His visit was conducted in the context of Ireland’s Presidency of the Council of the European Union as part of the 18 month Trio programme of Ireland, Lithuania and Greece. The visit afforded the Chief of Staff the opportunity to call on the Lithuanian Ministry of National Defence, where he met the Minister of National Defence, Juozas Olekas, and senior military staff. Ireland’s experience in hosting the Presidency of the Council of the European Union was discussed to facilitate preparations for the handover to Lithuania in July 2013. This will be the first occasion Lithuania will host the Presidency. The Chief of Staff briefed the Lithuanian delegation on the defence issues I prioritised for our Presidency and the progress made in these areas. The outcome of the meetings and seminars held during the Irish Presidency, which were utilised as an opportunity to progress the development of the common security and defence policy agenda, were also discussed. During the visit, joint areas of interest, including Ireland’s overseas engagements in missions and Ireland's and Lithuania’s involvement in the European defence agencies' maritime surveillance project, were also discussed. Lithuania also expressed an interest in hearing about Ireland’s expertise in countering improvised explosive devices. During the official visit, tours and briefs of the headquarters of the Lithuanian land force, air force and navy, search and rescue units and various other elements of the Lithuanian armed forces were undertaken.

We know the Minister is mad to get Ireland into NATO. Should we be concerned?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	61	This is part of the Deputy's party's daily hang-up. We have dealt with it at great length before. Since 1999, Ireland has been part of Partnership for Peace, together with other neutral states in Europe. This body plays a hugely important role in UN peacekeeping and humanitarian missions, something we have in common with Lithuania. The Lithuanian Minister, whom I know, is looking forward to Lithuania taking over the Presidency in some ten days' time. One of the things we have been doing, certainly in the area of defence and also on the justice side, in the weeks leading into that country's Presidency is co-ordinating issues it will take over from us. As we are now in our seventh Presidency and this is Lithuania's first Presidency, we are providing every backup and assistance we can. Lithuania is anxious that its Presidency be a success and that it can progress issues that have been addressed during the course of our Presidency. It was a very worthwhile visit by the Chief of Staff to Lithuania and it is most important that visits of this nature take place.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	62	As the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, will realise, the Irish seafood industry is critical to rural coastal communities, providing 11,500 jobs in such peripheral areas. Some 2,100 fishing vessels throughout the country are dependent on the industry. That industry and those people are dependent on an effective Common Fisheries Policy to sustain their livelihoods and their communities. Last week I met representatives of the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation and the Irish Fishermen's Organisation, IFO. I met both organisations together and was surprised that they were angry, annoyed, disillusioned and disappointed in the Minister in regard to the outcome of the Common Fisheries Policy review, in particular with regard to the lack of consultation between the Minister and them in the past while in the lead-up to the agreement which was ultimately reached. They felt they had not been consulted in any cohesive way on the current round of negotiations, the outcome of which has, in their words, "the potential to place the majority of our members out of business". That was a different kind of picture and perspective I received last Friday from the horse's mouth, from those who work in the industry. Afterwards, there was a presentation of press releases and a general media treatment of the deal. In particular, the representatives believe the discard compromise is unworkable from the point of view of the Irish whitefish industry, given the mixed nature of the fisheries in which the majority of whitefish vessels operate.The implications for rural coastal communities would be adverse, particularly in places like Castletownbere, Union Hall and Baltimore. The Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation has also been highly critical of the proposal. Why did the Minister fail to persuade his colleagues to directly enshrine the Hague preferences in the deal? I am aware that Pat the Cope Gallagher, MEP tabled an amendment at the trilogue to include the Hague preferences in the recitals, which means they are now subject to annual negotiations when it comes to the allocation of quotas. However, while due regard will now have to be paid to the preferences, they were not directly included in the deal itself. Four young fishermen who accompanied the group told me that young Irish people will no longer go into fishing. They would prefer to emigrate than fish in Ireland. They pointed out that crews now comprise Filipinos, Egyptians and eastern Europeans. What does that say about the absence of an overall plan for the development of a sustainable fishing industry? I was left with that thought as I departed west Cork last Friday and I ask the Minister about the lack of consultation, the workability of discards - I know the policy is being phased in over ten years - the Hague preferences and the future for young people in fishing.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	63	I thank Deputy Martin for raising this issue because I have spent considerable time during the Irish Presidency on brokering a deal with the European Parliament, the Commission and other member states which would radically reform the way in which Europe's fishing fleet fishes, link science in a real way with the calculation of quotas and total allowable catches each year and ensure we are fishing stocks as commercially as we can in terms of maximising catches while at the same time protecting stocks. I am a strong defender of the CFP reform we have agreed and so too is Deputy Martin's colleague from County Donegal, Pat the Cope Gallagher, MEP who voted this morning in favour of this reform at the PECH committee of the European Parliament. The vote was 20 to one in favour of the reform and the only MEP to vote against it was from the far left who was never going to vote for it in any event. For the first time ever the Spanish fishing industry, which has the largest commercial fleet in the European Union, the Spanish Government and the Green Party in the Parliament, which is the strongest advocate of NGO concerns about sustainability, are all in favour of a CFP reform that Deputy Martin suggests is a bad deal.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	65	I suggest the Deputy should examine the detail of the reform. I would always like more consultation with the fishing industry. It is true that it has been a while since I toured many of the fisheries harbours and I will do so again over the summer months. It is untrue to say that I do not have ongoing contact with fisheries organisations, whether from the south and west, Killybegs, the south and east or the Irish Sea. We meet regularly. We meet in Brussels, Luxembourg or Dublin in advance of almost every Council meeting dealing with fisheries issues. I cannot be accused of being a Minister who is not easy to contact. On the substantive reform of CFP and ending the discarding of fish, we currently have an indefensible situation whereby between 400,000 tonnes and 500,000 tonnes of dead fish are dumped in Irish waters annually because fishing vessels do not have quotas to land them. We are ending that procedure by putting in place the flexibility to allow fishing fleets to operate in a way that makes commercial and practical sense. We have had significant input from the fishing industry. This is why, after political agreement was reached on CFP reform, Sean O'Donoghue and others came home and sold it. In the coming weeks we will put in place a stakeholders' group led by fishermen to draw up an implementation plan for the discards ban, or the obligation to land as it is known. Fishermen will be directly involved in the implementation of this radical reform. It makes sense for them because it will build up stocks and it makes sense for the stocks themselves that Irish waters remain fertile grounds for fishing.

I am only relaying what the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation and this man who employs 23 people have said to me. They said the Minister was a great disappointment. This is what is being said.

Fishermen do not feel positive at present. They have no sense of the practical workability and implications of the discard policy, particularly in regard to the whitefish industry. I spoke to Pat the Cope Gallagher, MEP who managed to table an amendment insisting that due regard be paid to the Hague preferences. He was very disappointed that the Hague preferences - he said this to me one hour ago - were not enshrined in the new agreement.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	77	He has articulated his main criticism, namely, the absence of the Hague preferences from the treaty itself. That is a fair criticism and the Minister would acknowledge it in another forum. The key point is that many people in the fishing industry say it is time that we had a Minister dedicated to the marine, fisheries and natural resources. They feel the absence of such a figure.

For 13 years, Deputy Martin's Government did not have such a Minister. As we now have a senior Minister in this area, this Government ensured a bigger quota last year than was the case for a decade. The quota for this year will again be bigger. The marine sector has been more active in the past two years than in the preceding two decades.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	86	That is absolute rubbish.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	90	We now have an integrated maritime plan for Ireland. We have just concluded an Atlantic strategy under the Irish Presidency, which is a first. We now have a partnership with the United States and Canada. We have a Commissioner who has done a phenomenal job in generating interest in the potential for marine resources as an economic stimulus in the European Union and Ireland in particular. It is totally untrue to say that because I have been busy since January in my dual responsibilities of agriculture and fisheries and the marine, we have not delivered for either fishermen or the marine. Quite the opposite has been the case. I suggest that Deputy Martin should speak to more fishermen, many of whom are concerned about the radical nature of this reform but all of whom accept that it is not before time that we are doing something significant about ending discards in terms of EU policy. I recognise that we will face challenges in implementing the policy, but we will deal with it over the next five to ten years and as a result of it we will be able to catch more fish and have a stronger and growing industry.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	91	That is not what they are saying.

#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	94	As the Minister is probably aware, Cork City Council last month became the first council to support a motion seeking the establishment of an all-Ireland national suicide authority. The impact of suicide across the island is dreadful. In 2011 alone, more than 1,000 citizens died as a consequence of suicide. Every town, village and community and virtually every family has been affected by this tragic crisis. The number of road deaths in 2011 stood at 245. Despite the major gap between the number of deaths caused by suicide and the number of road traffic fatalities, suicide prevention does not secure the same level of investment and resources as road safety. An island-wide national emergency is occurring in respect of suicide and it requires an island-wide emergency national response. The Minister will agree that suicide prevention is under-resourced. Recently, in his home city of Cork, a minor who presented at Mercy University Hospital seeking assistance for mental health issues had to remain in the accident and emergency department as there was no bed available in the child and adolescent unit in Bessborough, Blackrock. The young girl had to stay in the accident and emergency department for four full days before being eventually transferred to the adult psychiatric services in St. Michael's unit where she remained for two weeks. Does the Minister agree that this is completely unacceptable, mental health services are under-resourced and the matter must be addressed immediately? Does he also agree that the national crisis requires a national, all-Ireland response?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	95	I agree with almost all the points the Deputy raises. Mental health provision in the health service has been grossly underfunded in the past. I spent three years on the former Southern Health Board's mental services committee, as it was known at the time. Until recently, there was a significant deficit in terms of funding and expenditure in this area. The programme for Government included a commitment to a special additional allocation to mental health services of €35 million last year and this year, respectively, primarily to strengthen community health teams in adult and child mental health services and further develop suicide prevention initiatives. The majority of the recommendations of ReachOut, the national plan of action on suicide prevention, have been implemented. The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Alex White, will shortly bring proposals to Government on alcohol misuse which, as the Deputy will be aware, is frequently linked to mental health and suicide. I agree with the Deputy that mental health services have been wrongly neglected in respect of funding and prioritisation. The position is changing under this Government, not before time, and we will continue to prioritise the mental health sector. For example, in January last, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, launched guidance on mental health and suicide prevention for post-primary schools. The Deputy is correct to continue to raise this issue because it is one on which the Government needs to be pressed. I assure him, however, that we are more than aware that we must catch up in the area of mental health services. We are acting on this issue by increasing expenditure and launching new initiatives to try to address the matter. On the question of whether an all-island approach is required, the honest answer is that I do not know whether conversations on this issue have taken place on a cross-Border basis. I will, however, ask the Minister to revert to the Deputy directly on the matter.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	96	That the Minister agrees with me on the points I raised is welcome. I would also welcome any additional resources the Government were to invest, if that is the correct word, or spend in the field of suicide prevention. Last month, the 3Ts charity - Turn The Tide on Suicide - published a report entitled, Suicide in Ireland 2003-2008, which made for grim reading. Every Deputy should take the time to read this document, which revealed the startling fact that one child under 18 years dies by suicide every 18 days. Moreover, the State has the fourth highest youth suicide rate in Europe and the figure is increasing. Despite this, the appropriate services do not appear to be available when required, including in the case to which I referred. The Minister agreed with me that the current position is unacceptable. Given that the current suicide strategy concludes in 2014, will the Minister ask his colleague, the Minister for Health, to accelerate the provision of a new strategy to ensure there is no gap in service provision or strategy in the coming years?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	97	Absolutely. That is the reason the Government prioritised this area in contrast to the previous Government by introducing new initiatives and increasing expenditure on mental health services despite facing difficult budgetary challenges. We must continue to prioritise this area. Developments over the past four or five years have placed extreme pressure on many families and young people, especially young men, resulting in higher levels of stress and mental illness and an increase in the number of suicides. The Government has a significant responsibility, when many families are continuing to experience difficulty, to provide structures, support, staffing and finance in this area. We need modern initiatives to assist our understanding of suicide and suicide prevention and we must put anything learned from such initiatives into effect. We have competent Ministers to perform this task, in particular, the Ministers of State, Deputies Alex White and Kathleen Lynch. I am confident the Cabinet will continue to prioritise this area. I would appreciate if the Deputy would forward details of the case to which he referred. While the circumstances he described appear to be unacceptable, I would like to have more background details to allow me to fully understand the position.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	98	Nearly 3,000 men will be diagnosed with prostrate cancer this year. Ireland has the highest incidence of the disease in Europe. Diagnosis is primarily done by means of a PSA blood test, physical examination or biopsy. A major study published by the University of London last week indicates that as many of half of the men who develop prostate cancer in the United Kingdom may have been wrongly given the all-clear as a result of the inaccurate diagnosis of standard biopsies. The research recommends that patients suspected of having prostate cancer undergo an MRI scan prior to a biopsy being carried out. Health economists calculate that the use of an MRI scan would result in one quarter of men suspected of having prostate cancer being given the all-clear without having to undergo the invasive diagnostic procedure. Not only would the use of MRI technology, as recommended by the University of London, detect more cases of prostate cancer, but it would also lead to fewer false positive outcomes and spare hundreds of men unnecessary and painful surgery, which can have distressing side-effects, including incontinence and impotence. Is the Government aware that there may be serious problems with the screening process for prostate cancer? Is it aware that prostate cancer receives approximately one sixth of the funding allocated to common female cancers? In the past six years, investment in research for prostate cancer diagnosis amounted to €62 per diagnosis as compared to €477 per ovarian cancer diagnosis, €453 per cervical cancer diagnosis and €288 for breast cancer diagnosis. I ask the Government to give a commitment to commission an investigation into this major imbalance? Will the Minister ask the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, to examine the possibility of introducing MRI screening for men suspected of having prostate cancer prior to a biopsy taking place? I would be interested in the cost-benefit analysis based on the estimated amount of a biopsy deemed unnecessary as a result of an MRI scan. The Minister might ask why I am asking this on Leaders' Questions.

I am limited in what I can say owing to my knowledge in this area. However, if the University of London has produced a report that exposes weaknesses in the screening system for prostate cancer in Ireland, that is a serious issue and of course we need to look into it. I give the Deputy a commitment that I will speak to the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, and ask him to give the Deputy a comprehensive response. To be fair to him and to many patients, we should not raise fears among people until the Department of Health has had an opportunity to respond comprehensively to the concerns the Deputy has raised. Many men go through a screening process and unfortunately, as the Deputy has outlined, a significant number have prostate cancer that needs to be treated. If by using MRI scanning prior to a biopsy we can improve the accuracy and if that can be done in a way that is practical and makes sense, then obviously we should consider it. I should leave it to the Minister for Health to respond in a more comprehensive way to the Deputy's question.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	108	I am not sure if the Minister is aware there is a high risk of sepsis from the biopsies that take place. I am somewhat taken aback that we have not up to now issued any statement on a comprehensive study undertaken by a hospital that is recognised across Europe as being to the forefront of dealing with prostate cancer. There are 141 male Deputies and based on statistics, 17 or 18 of us can expect to be told we have prostate cancer at some time in our lives. If the University of London report holds true, and outdated and inaccurate diagnosis techniques are responsible for many errors, surely we should deal with this immediately. I appeal to the Minister to look at this study by a renowned oncologist in that university, which categorically states that almost half of the diagnosis of cancer based on PSA scanning biopsies etc. have now proved inaccurate. I am not a medical man - maybe what they are suggesting is inaccurate but I do not believe it is. We cannot wait too long given that every day of the week a man in Ireland is diagnosed with prostate cancer.

The information requested by the Deputy regarding the number of small and medium enterprises which do not have access to fibre-based broadband across the State is not available. The CSO collects data on six different types of connections to the Internet for enterprises, as required by Eurostat under regulation, namely dial-up modem, broadband connection, DSL broadband, other fixed internet connection, mobile broadband using at least 3G technology, and other mobile broadband connection. As such, the data collected do not make a distinction between fibre and non-fibre broadband. The table to be circulated with the Official Report outlines the findings of the types of connections to the Internet for small and medium-sized enterprises in the State in 2012. Enterprises may also have multiple connection types to the Internet. The survey on e-commerce and ICT used to compile these data is a sample of enterprises with ten or more employees. The survey does not cover what the CSO term as micro-enterprises, which are those enterprises employing fewer than ten persons. For the purposes of the survey, the CSO classifies small enterprises as those having between ten and 49 employees and classify medium-sized enterprises as those having between 50 and 249 employees. The most recent survey on e-commerce and ICT was the 2012 survey which was published in December 2012. The 2013 survey is due to be published in December 2013.Small-sized EnterprisesMedium-sized EnterprisesCombined Small & MediumDial-up Modem15.3% 15.3% 15.3%Broadband connection89.6%96.0%90.7%DSL Broadband74.4% 78.0%75.0%Other fixed internetconnection25.8%48.8%29.5%Mobile broadband using at least 3G technology43.1%62.4%46.3%Other mobile broadband connection20.1%35.6%22.7%

Poor quality and expensive rural broadband is inhibiting Ireland's recovery. I ask the Minister of State to request the CSO to carry out a survey of whether access is via fibre or by other means. If we had that we could at least deal with the question properly because fibre-based broadband is superior to other broadband supply. Last week, the Government took on board some of the Sinn Féin proposals on using the National Pensions Reserve Fund as a stimulus. Three years ago we suggested that part of that money be used to deal with the roll out of broadband throughout the country. We suggested that €2 billion be used to roll out next-generation broadband, which would obviously be concentrated on fibre. This would take us out of our position at the bottom of the league in Europe and in OECD countries. Will the Government take on board the Sinn Féin approach and invest in fibre-based broadband infrastructure to assist small and medium-sized enterprises and homes in general in accessing this much-needed technology? The future recovery of many of these companies needs to be based on that facility through the use of the stimulus package that is at long last coming on board with investment from the National Pensions Reserve Fund on something that will pay dividends to Ireland. We should invest properly in next-generation broadband.

The national broadband plan was launched by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, on 30 August 2012.The targets include having 70 megabytes to 100 megabytes for at least 50% of the population, with the majority having access to the latter, to be delivered by 2015 through the commercial sector. Further, at least 40 megabytes per second, and, in many cases, much faster speeds for a least a further 20% of the population and potentially to 35% of people in smaller towns and villages will be delivered through a combination of commercial and State investment. There will be an absolute minimum of 30 megabytes per second available to all irrespective of location in the State. Several actions are also outlined in the plan including investment by the telecommunications industry and implementation of State-led investment in areas where the commercial sector will not provide high-speed broadband. In other words, where it is not being provided commercially, the State will look at investing in that area. Other actions include the publication of a national digital strategy aimed at stimulating businesses and consumer demand, a review of radio spectrum policy and regulation to clarify the role of the State-owned assets infrastructure in the deployment of broadband services and the removal of barriers, including planning issues and road opening, which can impede investment. The investment in broadband is significant from companies, including Eircom, which bring fibre to the cabinet in my constituency. This means there will be significant increases in fibre to the cabinet. This means the copper wire will continue to run from one's home to the telecommunications cabinet but there will be a significant increase in broadband in many homes throughout the country, depending on the distance from one's home to the cabinet. UPC is spending approximately €500 million on improving Internet connectivity throughout the country. There have been significant developments in private investment and more are expected. We are not at the bottom of the league in Europe. I can provide the statistics if the Deputy seeks further detail, but we are in fact doing well. According to EUROSTAT, in 2011 throughout the 27 EU countries, some 94% of all enterprises with ten or more employees had access to the Internet, with 94% of small enterprises, that is, those with between ten and 49 employees had access. Some 99% of medium-sized enterprises, that is, those with up to 249 employees, had access, while 100% of large enterprises, that is, those with greater than 250 employees had access. In Ireland in 2012 up to 94% of all enterprises with ten or more employees had access to the Internet, while 93% of small enterprises had access and 98% of medium-sized enterprises had access. Fully 100% of large enterprises had access to the Internet. Notwithstanding all the issues we have, we are doing remarkably well and the national broadband plan and strategy is in place and is being funded. Private and commercial companies are also investing and participating in this plan.

If the private sector is investing, it is for a good reason. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, referred to some figures. I will offer some further figures and perhaps the Minister of State can deny them or explain why there is a difference between them and the Forfás Cost of Doing Business in Ireland 2012 report, which compared the cost of broadband in various countries and found that the average price in Ireland was 7% higher than the OECD average and 27% higher than the euro area average. Ireland's Competitiveness Scorecard 2012, also published by Forfás, indicated that Ireland ranked poorly in terms of fibre connections and that it significantly lags behind other countries in terms of upgrading broadband access. There may have been a change since the report was produced but the report also stated that Ireland had only 0.5% fibre connection compared to Japan, where there is 61% connectivity, and South Korea, which has 57% connectivity, while the OECD average is 10.3%. The figures appear to contradict each other. We all look forward to the realisation of the 2015 strategy, but by 2015 we will still need substantially greater investment than that which has already been proposed by private companies. This is where State funding needs to set in, especially once we move beyond the eastern coast. In rural areas there are small companies in small villages that are not getting proper access to fibre-based connections. State funding would make the future of these companies more feasible or at least allow them to complete on a level playing field with other companies located in some parts of this city and which have the best possible access. However, even in the city there are pockets that do not have the proper speeds required for doing business.

Three things arise for me: price, speed and availability. These are matters of major concern, as has already been highlighted by Deputy Ó Snodaigh. Can the Minister of State give us an indication of how the plan announced by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, in 2012 differs substantially from the previous metropolitan area networks, MANs, programme or does it differ significantly from it? Is the Minister of State optimistic that the type of roll-out of e-fibre we need to see in the coming months and years will take place expeditiously? Is the Minister of State satisfied that the agencies that should be involved and that should be in the foreground of assisting the Government, us and the commercial agencies in this process, including local authorities, for example, are not putting impediments in the way of the fast roll-out of e-fibre throughout the country?

In several places in the west, for example, and in other parts of the country the MANs were never lit up. This was because while the fibre might have been in the community there was no connectivity back through the country to Dublin or no proper connections. This meant it was in the ground and deemed to be a stranded asset and no one could actually use it, or, if one sought to use it, one would have had to pay up to between €6,000 and €10,000 per business connection. The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources have been active in respect of what they call lighting up the MANs. A significant number of MANs have been lit. In other words, they are active and are being used. We can get the Deputy the figures after the discussion today. The second issue related to the question of business investment. If companies are in competition with each other then costs will come down. Let us consider the offers for mobile telephone, fixed landline or broadband connections. There is a good deal more competition now and it has been led by private investment. When businesses see an opportunity they will invest. It is in areas where no one will invest that State investment should be particularly considered. In communities where in the past there was no service it is incumbent on the State to ensure there is no regional or local variations in that respect. Reference was made to jobs and enterprises and the Deputy provided several statistics. In terms of the percentage of all enterprises with ten or more employees with a mobile broadband connection to the Internet Ireland ranked 13th in the European Union. For enterprises with between ten and 49 employees Ireland ranked 13th for mobile broadband and for enterprises between 50 and 249 employees in terms of mobile broadband Ireland ranked 10th. Therefore in terms of mobile broadband we are well connected. The other important point raised by the Deputy related to NewERA, the Fine Gael programme under which we campaigned during the general election and the Irish strategic infrastructure fund. One of the areas where there will be significant investment is broadband. NewERA will be working with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in this regard. I expect there will be significant developments in respect of getting more efficient and faster broadband for more people, homes and businesses throughout the country. There is a table I can ask to have circulated showing where Ireland ranks in respect of the different types of broadband connections, if that is helpful.

Data released in March by the Higher Education Authority showed the greatest increase in those entering third level are from families with jobs that tend to be better paid. The findings also show a drop in college entry from people from less wealthy backgrounds. That is unsurprising but it is worrying. In my area there is particular concern not only about third level education but also second level. It has been found that Traveller children are dropping out of education at a very early age once again, despite the cycle having been broken. The same is true of those who in recent years were encouraged to continue until the leaving certificate and, thankfully, due to grants, were able to continue on to third level. We find that there has been a drift backwards. What steps could be taken to ensure statistics are updated continually because the gap between each census is a long one? How could we address the issue, other than relying on the Higher Education Authority? Could we take other steps to ensure that data from the colleges are analysed every year by the Central Statistics Office to confirm or deny the recent trend, which is reverting back to where we were before the boom?

As Deputy Ó Snodaigh correctly pointed out, a lot more people from a home with greater income or professional status are studying in post-secondary school education. Improvements have been made to ensure students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds get into college. One of the main factors, going back a long time, was free education, which levelled the playing field for everyone. The grant system for third level was extremely helpful in helping students from disadvantaged communities to get into college. Although the non-manual group was the largest group in the country among the age group provided, it accounted for the second largest group of students in absolute numbers, with 24,662. However, 33% of persons in the non-manual group were students compared with, for example, 77% of those in the employers and managers group. The number of those studying was highest for those aged 19, with increasing percentages of those with a degree or higher as one moves up the age groups. Of those studying aged 23, nearly half had a degree or higher qualification, with higher professionals and farmers having more persons holding a degree or higher than those holding no degree.

That will have dire consequences unless it is addressed. There are a number of reasons for the decline in the number of people from lower income socioeconomic groups going to college. One reason is less disposable income. The statistics bear that out. The Minister of State referred to students from the socioeconomic category of non-skilled or manual being less likely to go to university. In some cases it is due to lack of hope and the desire to emigrate. Traveller groups and the long-term unemployed are other groups of concern in that regard. Representation was made to me by a 21 year old woman who is going into her third year in college. She will be totally dependent for the duration of the summer on her parents who are unemployed. She has no access to any income. The difficulty she faces is trying to survive and to hold on to go back to college. She is from Ballyfermot, one of the areas that has had the lowest third level attainment for many years, and the cycle there was starting to be broken. She is trying to find a solution. The maintenance grant stops at the end of the university term. There is no encouragement for her other than the desire to continue to educate herself. She must try, like everyone else who is unemployed, to find a job. Some method must be found to address the competing demands on a young woman such as I outlined whose course of study would benefit community and society in terms of preventative therapies for children at risk, to which I referred earlier, and to help combat suicide. She was wondering whether she could afford to go back to college because she will have to spend three if not four months without any income. That is an illustration of the competing demands. In the past, at least one parent in a household might have been working and could have sustained a student during the summer, but the more the Government cuts, the less disposable income is available to families and the more likely it is that there will be a greater degree of drop-out from people among that cohort in society who are unemployed or in disadvantaged communities. Does the Minister of State have statistics on the number of students who drop out of college and their socioeconomic breakdown?

It was incumbent on the office to answer the question asked but it would be happy to provide further information. I agree that we must ensure particular supports are available to disadvantaged groups and minorities in society who have traditionally not participated fully in education.In my constituency, an integrated Traveller programme for the county will be launched shortly, to which we have all been invited. It is very important for Members to be aware of this point of view for and, on behalf of groups of which the Deputy speaks, to be part of the progress they wish to make and to assist and help them in every possible way, given the difficult circumstances many of them are in.

It is good that on occasions such as this, Members have an opportunity to discuss what are the real impacts of the changes on the education system. I commend the Minister of State on his acknowledgement that successive Governments over the years have focused seriously on the area of educational disadvantage, in the realisation of what could be done were this challenge to be tackled. Equally, notwithstanding the pressures the Government is under at present, all Members must ensure the area of educational disadvantage is prioritised and they must consider the impact policies are having. There is no doubt but that the curtailment of the guidance service is having an impact, particularly on those who are less well off. Student fees have an impact, albeit perhaps not as much on those who are really disadvantaged as their eligibility for grants is pretty evident fairly early on. However, the speed at which the grants are being processed by the new agency was a problem last year and I believe everyone will agree to hope it will not be a problem in the current year. Larger classes are a problem, particularly for children who have learning difficulties and who come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Moreover, difficulties are being encountered and problems are arising nationwide with the Youthreach programme and with the vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS, and I will concentrate on the former. In areas of particularly high levels of youth unemployment, Youthreach provides an opportunity to deal with it in a constructive and positive way. Moreover, all Members have found the outcomes from the Youthreach programme predominately have been successful. The schemes have had a great level of success and many of them have encouraged their students to go on to third level education of some form. The point I am trying to make is notwithstanding the difficulties the Government and the Department of Education Skills are under, one must consider critically the real progress that was made in recent decades. Moreover, a superhuman effort must be made to ensure that, to paraphrase an old saying, we are not cent wise but euro foolish in respect of what is being done in this regard. It must be realised that were Ireland to continue to invest in people who are going into the education system from those sectors of society that are experiencing real difficulties by maintaining them therein and keeping them there into second and third level education - whatever the format of third level education might be - it would serve society's interests and would do a great deal to enhance the personal satisfaction the individual person will have, as well as the way in which he or she will be able to live his or her life into the future. While I acknowledge the Minister of State is committed in respect of this area, it is a subject the Government must consider afresh.

Moreover, the outcome from a significant investment in preschool, particularly for disadvantaged communities, is extremely significant. I understand the academic and research evidence shows that where this happens, and there has been significant investment in Ireland in preschool year, this has a significant outcome in bringing up that cohort of people to be the same as any other community. The Government and obviously the Minister for Education and Skills will be very interested in the comments made in this Chamber and I will make sure they are brought to his attention. However, if one can invest in preschool, one gets quality education for those who obviously would not normally be in a position to benefit therefrom. This is the key to the issue and is where significant progress will be made in the years ahead.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	126	I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 5, inclusive, together. The programme for Government sets out an ambitious Oireachtas reform agenda, which includes a referendum on the abolition of the Seanad, the enhancing of the Oireachtas committee system and the reform of Dáil Éireann. A restricted use of the guillotine and a minimum period of time between each stage of a Bill’s progress through the Dáil, except in exceptional circumstances, are both part of this reform agenda. While it is impossible to abolish the use of a guillotine or fix minimum periods of time before stages of a Bill in every case, it is the absolute intention over the lifetime of the Government that both the use of the guillotine and the accelerated passage of legislation increasingly will be less of a feature of the work of the Oireachtas. The Government Chief Whip, the Minister of State, Deputy Paul Kehoe, along with Dáil Whips from all the political parties and the Technical Group, the Ceann Comhairle, the chair of the working group of committee chairs and officials in Leinster House have been involved in developing the second phase of Dáil and Oireachtas committee reforms. The Dáil Reform Sub-Committee of the Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privileges has discussed detailed reform proposals which will expand the role of the committee system, allow for an improved Topical Issue system and expand the amount of debate time allocated to legislation in the Dáil. The Government Chief Whip proposes to bring forward this second phase of Dáil reform in the coming months with the new procedures in place by later this year. The process of Oireachtas reform is ongoing and following the introduction of the second phase of Dáil reforms, consultation on further Oireachtas reforms will take place involving all the Dáil Whips. The Government has already made progress in a number of areas of Oireachtas reform. In July 2011, after four months in office, the Government introduced the first phase of Oireachtas reform with a package of Dáil reforms that included an additional Leaders' Questions session, taken by the Tánaiste, on Thursdays, the introduction of Topical Issue debates, Friday sittings to give Deputies the opportunity to introduce their own Bills, thereby enhancing the legislative role of Deputies, and a procedure to allow Deputies raise issues regarding replies to parliamentary questions with the Ceann Comhairle. Moreover, in 2011, a new Oireachtas committee system was established that introduced a number of programme for Government reforms designed to enhance the committee system. First, the number of Oireachtas committees was reduced from 25 to 16. Second, Bills can now be referred to Oireachtas committees before publication in order that they are involved at an early stage in the development of legislation and, third, a Joint Committee on Investigations, Oversight and Petitions, chaired by a member of the Opposition, was established. In June 2012, the Oireachtas committee system was further re-structured with the establishment of an Oireachtas committee on jobs to focus solely on this area of Government priority, the establishment of an Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine to deal with the increased workload in this area in light of changes to the Common Agricultural Policy and the merger of the role of Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement with that of the Irish Co-Chair of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly. The programme for Government has committed to increasing the number of Dáil sitting days by 50%. The Government already has reduced the length of Dáil breaks at Christmas, at Easter, after bank holidays and during the summer and has introduced regular Friday sitting. A comparison of sitting days between 2008, the first full year in office of the previous Government, and 2012, the first full year in office of this Government, shows an increase from 96 sitting days in 2008 to 123 in 2012. On 5 June, in line with the programme for Government, a Bill was published to allow for the holding of a referendum in the autumn on the abolition of the Seanad. As part of that announcement a set of Dáil reform proposals was outlined, which included reforms that are desired for the move to a unicameral - one chamber - system. These include expanding the current system of sending heads of a Bill to committee for consideration before the Bill is published; the introduction of a new pre-enactment Stage to allow for extra consideration and scrutiny: each Bill will be referred back to the committee that considered it at pre-legislative and Committee Stages for a final examination after Report Stage before the Bill is passed by the House; Ministers will come before the relevant select committee within 12 months of the enactment of a Bill to discuss and review the functioning of the law and to allow for a debate from members and stakeholders as to whether the legislation is fulfilling its intended purpose; the establishment of a new Oireachtas committee system with 14 Dáil committees: four strategic committees on issues of major strategic and political importance including the Committee of Public Accounts, Finance and EU scrutiny, seven sectoral committees to shadow Government Departments, and three thematic committees which will focus on specific issues such as the Ombudsman and petitions, the Good Friday Agreement and Members' interests. It is envisaged that each committee will have 12 members and will invite external experts to provide specialist input to its work; the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Bill will enable Oireachtas committees to undertake parliamentary inquires into certain matters of major public importance. A separate administrative system will ensure they function smoothly; and the d'Hondt system will distribute chairs of Oireachtas committees on a proportional and equitable basis across parties.

I will refrain from saying anything about the Seanad because we will have a debate on that in the course of the week. I have to admit that over a period there has been some active engagement between the Government Whip and the assistant Whip and the Labour Whip, Deputy Ó Snodaigh, Deputy Catherine Murphy and myself. I read some weeks ago on the front page of The Irish Times that the Chief Whip had stated it was the Opposition Whips who were holding up progress on reform. We were glad to be told by the Chief Whip subsequently that this was a misrepresentation of his position and that he acknowledged that the Opposition was not doing that. I acknowledge also that in the introduction of the Topical Issue debate some significant progress has been made but I will come back to that because the topical issues are not everything they are cracked up to be.  I accept that the Friday sittings, which provide an opportunity to address Private Members' business, is a positive development but if we were to say that Friday sittings of themselves constituted radical reform of the Dáil, we would be fooling ourselves on a number of fronts, not least because it is a specific sitting aimed at dealing with an item of Private Members' business which is dealt with in the space of two hours, with a quorum of ten Members present, and where the normal business of the day is not to be transacted. When we consider extending the sittings of the Dáil to include Fridays we will have to have a debate related to what went on at the Constitutional Convention recently when it discussed the need to involve people in politics who are not currently finding politics attractive, and not least the need to attract women into politics. In the course of the fairly lengthy debate that took place at the Constitutional Convention one of the issues that arose was that our work practices are not attractive to people, particularly those charged with raising families. It should not be only women who are raising families. I am sure many fathers would want the opportunity to spend more time with their children but if the Government's idea of reform is that the Dáil will sit for four days per week and that on some occasions it will sit from 9 a.m. or 10 a.m. until 10 p.m. or 12 midnight and at the same time try to encourage more people to become involved in politics, I do not see that happening. Something will have to give. The Topical Issue debates got off to a great start but recently we have found that the Ministers charged with responsibility to come into the House to address the topical issues do not turn up. Some Ministers are very good at turning up but others are appalling, given that they rarely attend. On many occasions we find that the topical issues, which are selected by the Ceann Comhairle, are dealt with by Ministers of State who have no hand, act or part in the process under deliberation. They come in here and virtually apologise to the Member raising the particular matter because they will read out the prepared script but they are not in a position to address the concerns the Deputy has outlined.  Those are the two great areas of reform the Government is championing mid-way through its term of office. As I said, I am resisting the temptation to get involved in any debate about the Seanad but we are expected to believe that following on from that huge reform, as it is described, we will have huge reform. For example, we will make the committees more effective. The Government had to come back with a proposal to change the structure of the committees, as amended in the aftermath of the last general election, because it found that the procedures it put in place did not work and that the committees were being less effective rather than more effective. I do not know where the Government is going in terms of its current proposal to take a third bite of the cherry, so to speak, and examine committee reform. We have particular difficulties with the issue of guillotining. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, was in the Chamber earlier and in answering every question he told us what the previous Government had done. I will put up my hands and say there were far too many guillotines in the past but the Minister of State, the Taoiseach and the Government came to power with a programme for Government that promised far fewer guillotines. The reality is that we have far more because 57% of the 90 Bills brought before the House by the Minister of State's Government have been the subject of guillotine. What gives us all displeasure is that the guillotines tended to not always be necessary because we ran out of speakers before the point in time was reached. In other instances they were about areas of particular importance where the need to tease out legislation in great detail was obvious. Dozens of amendments to Bills have been left undiscussed. It could be claimed that we are not fulfilling our parliamentary duty when amendments put before the House are brushed aside because the Government has decided that a guillotine will be applied. The other issue is the two weeks between each Stage of a Bill except in exceptional circumstances. Again, that has been abused. We have not seen it happening in terms of many of the Bills that have been brought before us. Exceptional circumstances will arise where it will not be possible but it is happening far too frequently, and particular difficulties arise. That is not the fault of the Minister of State. He is charged with getting NewERA off the ground and therefore this is not his particular responsibility but for those whose responsibility it is, the type of progress promised is not being realised. The reform that has been championed on so many occasions is not being seen, and some of the reform will have the effect of making politics a far less attractive career for people than it is even at present.

Regarding the sitting days, I gave the Deputy the comparison. Taking 2008 as the previous Government's last full year, and 2011 under this Government, the fact is that we are sitting much more often than was the case under the Deputy's Government. Obviously, times were difficult for the previous Government in terms of the economy. The additional Leaders' Questions session on a Thursday is clearly established and is for the benefit of democracy.The Deputy referred to the introduction of Topical Issue debates and I agree it is a problem if the Minister is not present. The Deputy has the issue of concern to him selected, the Ceann Comhairle selects it in the proper way but the Minister is not there. I understand there are discussions under way that will allow for an option where if the Minister cannot make it, the Deputy can insist the Minister responds in a given period of time, such as within a week or two weeks, so there will be accountability from the line Minister back to the Deputy if his or her issue is selected. The Friday sittings of the Dáil are very important. This is the first time in any Parliament since the foundation of the State that time has been given to backbenchers to put a Bill before the Ceann Comhairle, which is then selected for debate. That gives much greater power to elected Members who are not on the front bench for any party to introduce legislation that is important to him or her.

When there is a dispute, as I used to have when I was in opposition, with a Minister about the answer to parliamentary questions, there will now be a process where there will be transparency about what happened and the Deputy can discuss all those issues with the Ceann Comhairle. Are we sitting more often? Yes. Is more legislation coming through? Yes. Is there a commitment to reduce the use of the guillotine? There certainly is. I agree with the Deputy entirely on that. The work of the Joint Committee on Health and Children and the very important debate on the protection of maternal life will be the benchmark for how we will do things. An idea will go to committee, the committee will discuss it and it will then come back here. That will give the committee a much more important role than it had in any Administration until now. Committee reports are currently launched in the AV room and the media might or might not turn up. The proposal now is that these reports will be debated in the Dáil, giving the committee reports more power and status. Those are significant changes. The key issue is to secure consensus on all sides for change. Bills come into being when a Minister makes a commitment to introduce legislation in a particular area. Notwithstanding that commitment, which might have been in a programme for Government, the preparation of the Bill can take some time, longer than was thought perhaps, because of complex legal issues identified by the Attorney General. Part of the process must be that where a commitment is given to introduce legislation, there must be a clear timetable. A Minister will not be able to say he or she will do work of legislative importance without having done the preliminary work. Sometimes a Minister promises to deal with a Bill by September but it has not been done by the following June. The Bill is then introduced just before a recess and is lashed through the Oireachtas. That whole process is wrong. If the process is working properly, there will be due consideration before a Minister says anything about legislation. There will be a timetable for publication and greater clarity and accountability. If we can achieve consensus on all sides on changes, which is what Whips' meetings are all about, we will have a better Parliament that is more accountable, more attractive and doing more business. I take the point about hours. We may be moving to extending some of our days to earlier times in the morning so there are many issues in the melting pot for consideration. People ask if Deputies and Ministers ever see their families and that is important. We must have more family friendly hours in here and some of the changes that have been made and some that will be made will be helpful in that regard.

The problem is that outside of the few changes that have happened, there has been a lot of talk on Dáil reform but we have not got down to the business of major change. The original criticism of the Adjournment matters is the very same criticism people make of the Topical Issue system, other than the fact they are at a different time of the day. The Ministers in question are often not the people answering the issues so it has fallen back into the same routine that brought it into disrepute previously, where Ministers read from a script and cannot engage because they are not the line Minister. The guillotine is a key area. It is fine to say it will change; we were told that when the revolution in democracy was being announced. We may be in emergency circumstances now but some of the legislation that has been guillotined is not urgent. I am still waiting to find out the urgency in passing the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill last week. The Thirty-second Amendment of the Constitution (Abolition of Seanad Éireann) Bill is the same. The only reason it is being rushed is because the Government picked a timeframe but that is a moveable feast because timetables are adjusted on many issues. I argued with the last Government and this Government about the use of the heads of Bills. The Joint Committee on Health and Children was mentioned as a yardstick but it should be the case for every Bill, other than emergency Bills that must be produced overnight, that the heads of a Bill that have passed Cabinet should be published to allow the committee to do its work. That will give greater urgency to the committee work, along with greater focus. It is a problem in committees that some of the members do not turn up. I do not know how to address that when committees are not given due consideration and support by all Members of the Houses. How often have we had to sit at committees, waiting for a quorum so we can start a meeting and get to grips with legislation or other business? I am one of those who believes there should be more committees because the best work is done by this House in committee, particularly on legislation, albeit it is ignored unless some huge statement or controversy occurs. The committees are ignored by the media, including those who do "Oireachtas Report". The hard work of being a Deputy is often ignored. I am not blowing my own trumpet; I have seen those who have sat at committee for a whole day and it is not for the love of the media. It is because it was what they were elected to do. Last year, the Minister for Social Protection, during the guillotined debate on the Social Welfare Bill, gave a commitment that the explanatory memorandum would be published in both Irish and English. She argued that she could not produce the legislation in Irish and English at the same time but said she would try to get the Government to produce explanatory memoranda bilingually. It is not beyond the capacity of the Government to do that and it would allow Members of the House to carry out their business in both official languages.

The debate between the Whips will continue and suggestions that were made will be passed on to the Chief Whip.The point is to make the Oireachtas more accountable and to make Ministers more accountable, both in committee and in the Dáil. On the timetable for legislation, if it is clear when it is published and, given the nature of it, that some pieces of legislation will be exceptional, one will know exactly what is going to happen, when the Stages will be taken, the role of the Committee and the importance of the interaction with the legislation. I can remember in the past, in the previous Government, that a long Bill, perhaps with 120 pages, would have been introduced to the House on a Monday and be dispatched by the following Wednesday. Nobody even had time to read it, never mind understand what was in it. I doubt if the Minister knew because sometimes one gets dozens of amendments coming in, even on Report Stage. Inefficiency is at the heart of that. The good aspect was that we trusted the Civil Service and the legal advisers on what was in that legislation. Notwithstanding that we did not have due time in the Oireachtas to deal with it, there was a significant element of trust, which is a strong plus in terms of the advice we receive. There needs to be greater scrutiny of legislation and greater scrutiny of Ministers. That is good and positive for democracy and this Government is ensuring that.

I accept that when the Chief Whip and all the other Whips meet we can work out an agreement. We can come up with proposals. However, the Chief Whip is a creature of Government and the difficulty is that when he goes back to the Government he has to do what the Government tells him. Clearly, the Government tells him to talk about reform but under no circumstances to deliver any reform. The Minister of State spoke about the deliberations of the Joint Committee on Health and Children over the six days that it met on the heads of the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Bill. Great credit is due to Deputy Buttimer for the manner in which he conducted the hearings. People came in, they had their say, there was dignity, there was mutual respect on all sides but at the end of the day what was said at the inquiry had no impact, good, bad or indifferent, on the legislation that was produced.

If the public is aware that they are discussing legislation day in, day out for weeks on end but if, in effect, at the end of the day there is no amendments to the legislation, then one wonders what is the exercise about at all. It all comes back to a Government that is determined to implement its agenda, which includes putting out a positive spin on a host of matters and then doing its own thing.

Having sat here in two previous Dála looking over at the serried ranks of Fianna Fáil as they were then, the uniqueness of the Fianna Fáil seats was there were only two of them who were not a Minister, a junior Minister, a Chairman, a convenor, a Vice Chairman or whatever - all on the public purse and in some way doing Oireachtas business as they saw it. That has utterly and radically changed. All of that has gone now or significantly changed. This Oireachtas is far more efficient than previous Oireachtais. With respect, we cannot take a lecture from Deputy Ó Fearghaíl. The previous history stands for itself and the arguments of Governments in the past are clear. Returning to the point I was making, change by consensus, the Whips sitting together and coming up with an agreement across all parties of the House, will lead to greater efficiency, better performance, more accountable Ministers and better debated Oireachtas issues. It is clear what the Government, particularly the Chief Whip, has announced so far.

The programme states:Care of Older People and Community CareInvestment in the supply of more and better care for older people in the community and in residential settings will be a priority of this Government.Additional funding will be provided each year for the care of older people.This funding will go to more residential places, more home care packages and the delivery of more home help and other professional community care services.The Fair Deal system of financing nursing home care will be reviewed [in order to create additional supports to enable] people to stay in their own homes.Will the Minister outline when those commitments will be followed-up and fulfilled? Instead of additional funding for home helps, there have been 1 million home help hours cut. There has been less funding for residential places and fewer home care packages. The fair deal is being reviewed, but only with a view to increasing the charge on estates, from 15% to 22.5%. As Age Action Ireland stated, that is a clear attempt by the Government to take more value from the estates of older persons and it will hit their families harder. Also, the contribution on the nursing home support scheme is increasing, from 5% to 7.5%.When will the Health (Amendment) Bill, which encompasses those two changes, come to this House? Will the Minister indicate if the Government is prepared to row back on the provisions of the Bill and fulfil the commitments outlined in the programme for Government on the care of older people and community care? Will he indicate when the integrated care agency will be established by the Minister for Health?

Both of those would be welcome and if they were contained in the legislative programme. I encourage the Minister to fast-track those policies. Will they be included in a new legislative programme? The previous Government and this Government have promised major legislation to deal with pensions and the pensions industry. Such a Bill does not seem to be contained in the legislative programme and I wonder when we will be able to get the heads of such a Bill at least. The gender recognition Bill was promised for earlier this year and it is now scheduled for next year. There was an indication to the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection that the heads of the Bill would be published and available for discussion in July this year. Will the Minister indicate when the heads of the Bill will be available for discussion in the committee? Much fanfare accompanied last year's decision to locate the national paediatric hospital in the St. James's Hospital campus. When will the national paediatric hospital development board establishment order (amendment) Bill be published in order that we can have some certainty around plans to locate that hospital in the campus? As of yet, there is no board, planning permission or funding in place to proceed with that development or the possible development of a national maternity hospital on the site.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	156	My understanding is that the heads of the national paediatric hospital Bill are being worked on and it will be published later this year. The heads of the gender recognition Bill are currently being drafted and although I cannot give an exact date for the legislation, I expect we will see it this year. There is no Bill listed relating to pensions but my understanding is that the Minister, Deputy Burton, is working on legislation relating to pensions. The Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill has finished in this House and is going to the Seanad tomorrow, so there will be an opportunity for the Deputy's party colleagues to raise questions on the Bill if they wish to do so.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	157	There is a widespread belief in the public that we need radical democratic reform, which was promised by the Government. I will repeat the question I asked earlier of how the Government can tally a commitment to radical democratic reform of these Houses and democracy in the country with the imposition of a guillotine on the Bill dealing with the abolition of the Seanad, which is being debated this week. It will be guillotined and pushed through in just one week while we need a wide-ranging and thorough debate on democratic reform in the country. Will the Minister explain this? We are all aware of the need in this country to shift to renewable energies very quickly for environmental and other reasons. The Minister may have noted significant coverage of the issue of applications for big wind energy projects. Given the questions on the environmental aspects, the economic benefit to the State, the efficiency of wind energy and the many other concerns of people, when will the foreshore and marine area development Bill be brought forward? When will the promised offshore renewable energy development plan be published? The Minister knows that there are several very controversial and large wind energy projects, not least the plan for 145 turbines in Dublin Bay. We need to know the legislative framework in which these applications will be assessed with the participation of the public.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	158	I agree with the Deputy on the need for radical reform of how our democracy operates and this Government is determined to carry that out. We have already done a number of things, including ending corporate donations, introducing gender quotas and a proposal to abolish the Seanad and change the function of the Dáil to make it more efficient and downsize it. We have significantly reduced the cost of running this House and the Government in general, including ministerial expenses and so on. That effort will continue through the life of this Government, and a major part of it is the proposal to have a referendum asking the people for their verdict on whether we need two Houses in this Parliament. In my view, we do not. My understanding is that no guillotine is proposed on that legislation until Thursday, so we should see how the debate goes between now and then and how many speakers wish to contribute. There is no decision to close the debate until Thursday at the earliest and we are sitting late this evening to facilitate as many speakers as possible. We have some really ambitious thinking in Ireland with regard to wind projects, not only in how we produce renewable energy for our own grid but also in an ambition to export large volumes of green energy into the UK, which will pay for that energy. There is already a memorandum of understanding in place for the UK to import green energy from Ireland, which can be subsidised and come from projects in various parts of Ireland that have been through a robust foreshore process. I and many others are excited by that project and we strongly support it.

I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, to the House. I was here this time last year raising a similar issue and thankfully the difficulties were addressed for the parents and children in question. Unfortunately, we are back again this year with new parents and new children facing the same concerns. I acknowledge that under the HSE national service plan 2013, €4 million was made available to meet the needs of those leaving school and of rehabilitative training, which is welcome. However, according to information I have received, that sum will not be enough. HSE west has been allocated €932,000 of the €4 million. In Galway, the allocation is €210,000 but an additional €600,000 will be needed to deal with the number of children coming on stream this year. There are about 80 children in Galway, 46 of whom will need additional resources and of these, the Brothers of Charity have 19. The Brothers have endured five years of cuts and rationalisation. They have eaten into their own reserves and have been very prudent in recent years. Those reserves are now gone. At this stage they have stated that they will not be able to take in any new service users and if they do, it will be at the expense of services to existing users. This is not acceptable. There are safety concerns involved too as the Brothers feel it would not be safe to take in additional children. It is also worth noting that this is the first year that children in the Ábalta special school in Galway will be coming on stream. Many of these children have high-level needs and some have a requirement for 24/7 care. Will new resources be made available, in addition to the €4 million that has already been allocated, to ensure that these children and their parents have peace of mind and to ensure there will be services available to them in September?
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	181	I wish to draw the attention of the Minister of State to a very severe, extreme and unusual case of a family in crisis. The case centres on a young man with severe autism. His mother has cancer and two of his siblings have special needs. The difficulty is that there is a mandatory court order relating to this case which expires on 28 June. This is an emergency situation. The family is clearly in crisis and is seeking support. I am hoping the Minister of State has something in her file to indicate that they will get the support they need. I want reassurances that a plan will be put in place for this young man. He weighs 18 stone and is 6 ft. 3 in tall. He has enormous difficulties. In other circumstances, he would probably be in a residential setting but his family does not want that. They want to keep him at home but considerable resources are needed to do this. The circumstances are unusual and we must give as much support to the family as possible. The young lad was allowed to stay in school for an extra year and the family have asked if the setting could be the same. Aside from this specific case, we need to think in terms of a transitional period for children like this, particularly those with severe autism. We need to develop transitional services so that the move from school is not so abrupt for these children. I hope that this case might trigger changes within the Department in this context.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	182	The Minister of State knows as well as I do that there is a problem regarding the transition of students with special needs from school. We have both attended meetings where there has been criticism of the transfer of students from primary to post-primary, where the process of integration must be started all over again. We are also both aware of the fact that the HSE is completely reconfiguring the provision of some of its services and this is affecting children from special schools. I know I am speaking to someone who knows more about this than most and the Minister for State has spoken many times about the importance of the mapping of services. I am critical of the Department of Education and Skills because it is not working cohesively with the Department of Health when it comes to children with special needs and the provision of services for them. There seems to be a breakdown in communication. I would be interested to know how much communication is taking place between both Departments. It is critical in dealing with children with special needs, particularly those with autism, that a continuation of services is maintained. Such children really need a sense of continuity in terms of the provision of services. I ask that both Departments would put more emphasis on ensuring that dialogue and communication in this regard is ongoing.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	183	I thank the Deputies for the manner in which they have raised this issue. They have made rational, reasonable arguments, which I appreciate. I take on board what Deputy Crowe has said about a family that is clearly in distress. They are anxious not only about their own future, but also that of their son. Too often it is the case that people's anxieties are not taken into account. I am pleased to take this opportunity to outline, on behalf of the Minister for Health, the position regarding the matter raised by the Deputies. I should say at the outset that the Government does not comment on individual cases - I am sure Deputy Crowe was expecting that - but our policy is to enable young people with disabilities to live independent lives to the greatest extent possible. I recognise the importance of life-skills training and day services to people with disabilities who are leaving the education system and every effort is being made, within available resources, to provide services to all 2013 school leavers. Day services for adults with disabilities provide a network of support for over 25,000 people who have a wide spectrum of need, ranging from those with severe and profound disabilities who may need long-term specialist service provision, to people with lower support needs and greater potential for community participation and inclusion. The HSE, through its occupational guidance service, works with schools, service providers, service users and families to identify the needs of young people with disabilities who are due to complete their second level education. The aim is to address the needs of individuals in the following ways: through health-funded rehabilitative or life skills training, health-funded day services, FÁS-funded vocational training or an extension to education placement for a specified time. Service providers and the HSE are working closely together to identify how the needs of those individuals who require day services or training places in 2013 can be responded to within available resources.I have asked to be kept informed of progress on a weekly basis. The demand for services for school leavers continues to grow. The HSE expects that more than 700 school leavers require new day services or life-skills training in 2013. Although the 2013 allocation for disability services has been reduced by 1.2%, the HSE's national service plan includes an additional €4 million to provide appropriate services for school leavers and rehabilitative training graduates in 2013. This funding is being allocated to each HSE region based on its percentage of population. Even with the additional funding, the provision of the required level of new services will be challenging in the context of the overall budgetary position and the moratorium on staff recruitment. In addition, the physical capacity to provide further services may not be present in all agencies and we are very conscious of this. While the HSE makes every effort to provide day services or training places to school leavers with special needs, this has always been dependant on the availability and location of appropriate places coupled with the needs of the individual school leaver. However, the voluntary sector and the HSE are committed to the best use of available resources in a creative and flexible manner, so as to be as responsive as possible to the needs of this cohort. In respect of the particular young person referred to by the Deputies, I am informed the HSE is working with the local service provider to assess how the needs of this young man may be best accommodated. I understand he will require an extensive support package and a proposal has been made by the service provider to the HSE for consideration. This proposal, which is costed at €117,000 per year, will be considered in the overall context of the individual's needs and the needs of other school leavers in the area. No decision has yet been made in this regard but the HSE has assured me a day service will be provided for the young man in question in September with the location and type of service yet to be agreed. We will always have this issue year in year out but we are determined it will not come about as a result of crisis every year. We should know how many people will leave every year and what are their needs and we should be planning on a year by year basis. It will not always be the same type of service. Some day when we have a little more time perhaps I will speak to the Deputies about what Genio did last year to find places which are different, more community-based and more inclusive. These did not suit everyone but they suited 79 people. This is the type of thinking we need to bring about including, as Deputy O'Brien rightly stated, the whole of Government approach we also need to bring to all of this.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	184	I thank the Minister of State for her response and I appreciate the ongoing work taking place on this issue and the work Genio has done for many years. The additional €4 million provided under the HSE service plan is welcome but it is not adequate. I appreciate the Minister of State and the HSE are liaising and negotiating with service providers but they need to ensure at this stage they will have services for the children. Yesterday the parent of a child with autism stated it is crucial for the child to have a transition period for any new placement well in advance of September. As of now there is nowhere to transition to because of a lack of planning and insufficient funding for school leavers with special needs. I appreciate the Minister of State said this will be an issue every year, but the parents acknowledge the HSE knows the numbers involved every year and as we are now in the middle of June they are concerned they still have this level of uncertainty. Will the Minister of State through the HSE and the service providers continue to do everything to ensure these children have a placement in September?

I understand a care plan was being worked out at Christmas. The difficulty with this is the cost involved. Many children with extreme autism or extreme needs are in a residential setting. In some cases four nurses and four carers may be involved. The family believes it is blessed and not cursed. Many people listening to this at home will wonder how the family copes. There is a responsibility on us as public representatives to support such families. His mother wants to keep him in the home. His medical prognosis for the future is not good because of the medication. I have never seen such medication as I did in a press in this house. The woman in question has three children with severe needs. Her husband is not well and clearly she is not well either. She will have an operation shortly for her cancer. We are speaking about a very unusual case. I hope this care package will become operative and the family will be supported.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	186	Leaving aside funding and budgets there are other issues on which we can be pro-active and the Minister of State touched on one. We need to plan further in advance. We know how many school leavers we will have and in what area of the State they live. We know what type of services are available. We need to put more emphasis on long-term planning. I urge the Department, the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills to ensure this happens. If it does not happen we will continually deal with crisis after crisis and nobody wants to see this. I do not believe any Deputy wants to see this year after year. Will the Minister of State take this on board and see whether there are ways we can improve how we plan for school leavers?
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	187	The €4 million is in the context of the economic situation in which we find ourselves and the enormous budget we spend on disability. As Deputy O'Brien rightly stated, it is about pulling it all together and genuinely taking a serious look at how we bring all of it together under one roof. We would definitely have better outcomes as a result. It is not about saving money, it is about getting a better outcome. With regard to the budget, I managed to secure a cut of only 1.2% when everything else was being cut by 4% or 5%. We discussed this at length with those who operate in the disability sector and they have been doing a tremendous job in recent years under difficult circumstances. They told me if we could manage to keep the overall cut low they could manage much of what needs to be done, but this can only continue for a certain length of time. As I stated in my reply, even if we had €10 million to spend this year on school leavers, which we do not, I am not certain there is capacity in the organisations themselves to take on all of these people. We need to take a serious look at this. In response to Deputy O'Brien, we have managed to map all of what is available and this is a significant first step in how we reconfigure the service, but the service does need to be reconfigured.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	188	I thank the Ceann Comhairle and his office for the opportunity to raise this most important issue. It is based on a case in the Louth constituency where both spouses are undergoing treatment for cancer in the same hospital. It is hardly necessary for me to outline in detail the trauma and stress this brings on a family. A medical card application is in the system and under consideration, but no final or definitive decision has been made because of a concern that the income is marginally above what will allow them to qualify.The regular process of applying for a medical card and the completion and submission of supporting documentation can be stressful and traumatic for families that are in difficult health situations. While I do not want to be negative, the cancer may be terminal for one or both of the spouses. One can only imagine the stress imposed on the family when, while undergoing chemotherapy, these people must hunt down the financial documents and other information that are necessary to bring a successful conclusion to their applications. We need to consider the special circumstances that obtain, not only for the family I have in mind, but for other families across the country. We need to streamline contact arrangements so that a designated person in the medical card section in Finglas can deal specifically with inquiries and submissions of information. It is important that families and public representatives have an opportunity to communicate directly via telephone with the official dealing with their cases. E-mail is fine in its own way, but contact via telephone is necessary to ensure that all of the information is available as required. Some time ago, our spokesman on health, Deputy Kelleher, advocated in the House the possibility of issuing time-bound medical cards to cancer patients upon diagnosis, irrespective of income. It would not be an open-ended medical card, but it could be reviewed after a specific period and renewed, if that is what the circumstances dictate. Serious financial hardships are imposed on families whose members are in and out of hospital for treatment or must stay in hospital for long periods. They have mortgages, some of their members may be in third or second level education and others may be ill. In many instances, the families' circumstances are dire. We must examine the system. I appreciate that processing medical cards is demanding work, as people are under severe financial stress and are anxious to have medical card cover. In the circumstances that I have just outlined, however, a special processing arrangement is required. It is fine to claim that a committee or panel will examine the details, but criticising the officials involved is unsatisfactory. The arrangements are also unsatisfactory and need to be addressed urgently.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	189	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. Under the provisions of the Health Act 1970, the assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants. There is no automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons with a specific illness, including cancer. The income thresholds apply to all applications and there are no variations on these where an applicant or family member has a specific illness. The net weekly income limits for a married couple for a standard medical card are €266.50 and €298.00 for persons aged up to 65 years and aged 66 years or over, respectively. The net income limits apply after tax, PRSI, rent or mortgage payments, child care costs and travel to work costs are taken into account. A different system operates for persons aged 70 years and older. Assessment for a medical card is based on gross weekly income, which is €1,200 in the case of a married couple, well above the limit for people aged 66 years or under. Under the legislation, there is provision for discretion by the HSE to grant a medical card where a person's income exceeds the income guidelines. The HSE takes a person's social and medical issues into account in determining whether "undue hardship" exists for a person in providing a health service for himself or herself or his or her dependants. The HSE set up a clinical panel to assist in the processing of applications for such discretionary medical cards where there are difficult personal circumstances. This approach recognises the need to have in place a standard process for considering applications in respect of people who, while over the income guidelines, require discretionary assessments on the basis of illness, such as cancer, or undue financial hardship. The HSE has an effective system in place for the provision of emergency medical cards for patients who are terminally ill or are seriously ill and in urgent need of medical care that they cannot afford. These are issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letters of confirmation of the condition from their doctors or medical consultants. With the exception of terminally ill patients, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on grounds of means or undue hardship and will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card. As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual with a limited eligibility period of six months, which is what the Deputy is seeking. For persons with a terminal illness, no means test applies. Once the terminal illness is verified, patients are given an emergency medical card for six months. Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate escalation routes to ensure that the person gets the card as quickly as possible.

My experience in pursuing cases differs somewhat from the situation set out in her response. We must examine this problem. We need a special arrangement and a clear understanding for families in traumatic and stressful situations. The patients' priority is chemotherapy and they hope that they will recover over time. They should not need to worry about supplying supporting documentation to the HSE. We need to remove this stressful element from the equation. I do not suggest that open-ended cards should be granted. Cards should be granted for specific periods to allow for reviews of the circumstances involved. Will the Minister of State ask the section of the HSE that deals with medical cards to examine its arrangements for processing applications?
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	191	I will be brief. The Minister of State with responsibility for this matter, Deputy White, the Minister for Health and I asked that that be done at a meeting we attended in the past month or two. I take Deputy Kirk's comments on board, but stress is inevitable in the circumstances that he outlined. It is a by-product of being extremely unwell. However, we could never move to a situation in which someone would be issued a medical card just on the basis of a telephone call. Confirmation of the condition by a medical consultant or doctor is required. The application could be made at a later stage. This is as much as one could possibly hope for in such circumstances. It would not be possible to grant a card on the basis of a telephone call alone.

#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	194	I wish to raise with the Minister of State the possibility of using the Finance Act, in particular the Living City initiative contained within the Act, as a blueprint for the regeneration of towns and villages throughout the country. I acknowledge that this initiative was limited to the cities of Limerick and Waterford. It was most welcome but I also welcome the announcement which succeeded it at the end of last week concerning the new economic and spatial plan for Limerick 2030, which will involve a €250 million plan. This is very good news for both Limerick and the entire mid-west region of Clare, Kerry and north Tipperary which badly needs a new, reinvigorated, regional capital. I return to the Living City initiative which recognises that historical city centres have suffered from the relocation of family homes and businesses to the suburbs, something that is obvious to any visitor to Limerick. However, this neglect of city centres was exacerbated by the reckless planning that marked the Celtic tiger era and the decade which preceded its lift-off. That sort of neglect and the exodus of family homes and businesses from city centres is not limited to cities but is evident also in both larger and smaller towns throughout the country that were once historical market towns. I will focus on County Clare because it is the constituency I know best but this problem is not in any way unique to that county and is something we can see all through the country. One need barely leave Limerick to see it but can take the road either to O'Briens Bridge or Broadford, both of which are old historic villages. The first was linked to the canal and transport but since the Shannon schemes it has effectively lapsed. If one drives up the main street one sees a number of fronts that, although they are not of great, important, international, architectural significance, very much reflect the Irish vernacular. The same is true of Broadford. We see small shop fronts and former family homes, where the tradition was for people to have a store or a pub and live above it. Now, neither the store nor the pub is occupied and nobody is living above. The same is true right across the country. That is not to say these towns and villages have been sitting around doing nothing, watching the decay continue without seeking to arrest it. In Clare, as throughout the country I presume, there are a number of important innovations taking place whereby communities are seeking to address their problems and fight back to give life again to their town centres. In Kilkee there was a recently published draft of a town improvement and economic development plan for 2013-24. Killaloe has just published a tidy towns and environmental improvement strategy, and Scariff likewise. This is happening right across County Clare and is mirrored everywhere. However, the fundamental reality is that no matter what plans communities come up with it is very difficult, especially in the current environment, to finance those plans. What was particularly innovative about the Living City initiative was that it provided tax incentives to people to reinvigorate those historic centres. It is important to bear in mind this was a different measure to the one brought in by the previous Government during the Celtic tiger years in that it was not developer-led. Then, a great number of properties were developed without any end use in mind. The Living City initiative was occupier-led. People who owned these buildings sought to return them to their historical use, thereby reinvigorating towns and villages throughout the country.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	195	I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue. I agree with him concerning the very significant announcement made in Limerick city at the tail end of last week about boosting that great city which, if one looks at the statistics as I did in preparation for this debate, has the highest overall rate of unemployment, including male unemployment, of each of the five gateway cities. There is a particular problem here that must be addressed. As the Deputy noted, the objective of the announcement made by the Minister for Finance in the Finance Act was to produce an incentive which is not developer-led, which encourages people not only to live in these great homes but also to produce 10% of the costs up-front, both for refurbishment purposes and to prove their bona fides. We are not going back to some kind of grandiose, entirely developer-led, tax incentive scheme where developers take no risk whatsoever. As the Deputy is well aware, a tax break or incentive is a form of subsidy which the general taxpayer has to make available. We have to use the scheme in a very focused way that encourages the regeneration and redevelopment of our great cities, in particular where there is either a difficulty in retail areas or, as in this case, where there are the great Georgian houses that are such a central feature of Waterford and Limerick cities. We see this very much as a pilot scheme, as the Minister stated in the course of his remarks on Second and Committee Stages of the Finance Bill. He has made it clear he will look on this designation for other parts of the country and I can confirm to the Deputy there have already been submissions for a form of redesignation in other parts. That will obviously be a matter for the Minister in consultation with Cabinet colleagues in advance of any further Finance Bill. We need to learn the lessons of the past decade and a half where much of this work was developer-led, as the Deputy noted, and did not lead to any great advancement or additionality for our cities. On the contrary, it led to poor quality build, over use of apartments and a bad use of resources. To reiterate, this form of incentive was effectively a form of subsidy. I very much hope we can proceed on an incremental basis in this regard. Whether this will be extended to other areas, such as the Deputy referred to, is a matter for the Minister. We will have an open mind and the policy will be reviewed on a constant basis in terms of the actual Finance Bill. My understanding is that Pobal, the State agency with responsibility for building up capacity in local communities and sending out statistics about levels of deprivation, has a very clear scoring methodology in its work. It has a myriad of measurements for deprivation. It would seem to me that in any further advancements or extensions of this scheme to areas throughout the country by way of tax incentives we should be mindful of the statistics and the evidence. We should be mindful of where the greatest rates of unemployment and deprivation lie and apply these tax breaks and incentives in a sparing but exact way towards that problem. Obviously, I did not read the supplied speech.
#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	196	I am glad the Minister of State did not do so, given its content. I do not in any way advocate a return to section 23 - the Department might well have concerns about that. Many people would, because to return to that section would merely be to go back to what was wrong without having learned anything. What was introduced in the Living City initiative was very targeted, as the Minister of State noted. It was not a blanket scheme. The Minister of State mentioned the great Georgian homes of Ireland. In addition, there are the merchant houses that used to mark every town and village in the country, which have now fallen into decay. They are a very important part of the streetscape of practically every town and village in Ireland. They usually have very fine slate roofs, slates that are in many instances falling off those roofs and posing a danger to passersby. I very much welcome the Minister of State's proposal that objective criteria for deprivation and other factors be put in place but there is another criterion, namely, heritage value, whether architectural or historical. Every local authority in Ireland has a heritage officer, and in many instances a heritage section employing architects. It would not and should not be beyond county councils to draw up a list of the key buildings that exist in practically every town and village.In many instances these merchant homes which contained a family living over a shop or bar dating from the Victorian period, or sometimes earlier, have fallen into decay as the families moved into fine bungalows in the suburbs and left the main street to decay. While I do not advocate a return of section 23, a case can be made for tax incentives to reinvigorate smaller towns and villages.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	197	The Deputy's argument is well made and we have received submissions along the lines he described. I understand the Act defines a Georgian house as a building constructed between 1714 and 1830. He could argue that his market house, which was a centre of commerce during that period, might be covered by that definition. We have received submissions from interested parties on extending the Georgian house incentives to markets and other buildings. The Minister is considering these submissions and has an open mind on the matter although, needless to say, he does not want to extend the scheme so wide that it would allow a repeat of the kind of nonsense we saw in the past. Equally, however, if a broader definition could help regeneration in the areas to which the Deputy referred, including in particular historic market towns, this is something he will consider.
#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	198	I thank the Minister for Social Protection for coming to the House to take this Topical Issue matter. The greatest scourge that the country and the economy face are the 190,000 people who have been unemployed for 12 months or more. For some time I have been concerned about the number of measures the Government is taking to address this problem. I first submitted my proposal, called A Ticket to Work, more than 18 months ago. The proposal is modelled on similar schemes implemented in the United States of America and would give a voucher worth approximately €200 to unemployed individuals, which is the equivalent of what they would receive in unemployment benefit. This voucher could be passed on to an employer in return for employment. I am involved in the west Cork jobs initiative and am fortunate to work with 12 employers. We have done considerable research on this scheme, including a survey of the attitude of employers towards it. Eight out of ten employers considered it favourably and expressed an interest in taking people off the live register in return for voucher style contributions towards the cost of employing them. The amount paid would be in the region of 50% of the cost. When I first submitted this proposal to one of the Minister's colleagues 18 months ago and I met departmental officials to discuss it, I was told that a similar scheme was already in place, namely, the Revenue assist scheme. However, only 350 people avail of the that scheme per annum. I am not a genius at mathematics but at that rate it would take up to 542 years to deal with the 190,000 long-term unemployed. It is clear that the Government needs to take more action. Our record in helping the long-term unemployed is less than stellar and desperate situations require radical action. I submitted the A Ticket to Work proposal to the Minister and the Secretary General of her Department, as well as to the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Economic Management Council. I am aware from discussions at various levels of a proposal to introduce a JobsPlus scheme, which essentially mirrors the spirit of the scheme I have proposed. However, I am concerned that we are half way through the lifetime of this Government. We cannot afford to get it wrong. There are approximately 85,000 SMEs employing 700,000 people in this country. My research indicates that eight out of ten SMEs favour the scheme but even if only one in every two took it up, it would go a long way to giving jobs to the 36,000 persons aged between 20 and 40 who have been unemployed for 12 months or more. For such a scheme to be successful, it must be focused on the unemployed person rather than the SME. The Government's proposals to date are admirable but we must refocus our efforts towards the unemployed person by giving him or her the licence and, with it, the opportunity to approach an employer with a voucher worth 50% of his or her salary. If we target the unemployed we will have a better chance of persuading people to be more active in seeking suitable employers and the scheme will sell itself. Communication is also very important. The name "JobsPlus" is along the lines of JobBridge and would simply cause difficulties with employers. I would prefer to name the scheme A Ticket to Work or a Passport to Work. I hope the Minister takes my suggestions on board.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	199	I thank Deputy Jim Daly for raising this important matter. Support for job creation is central to Government policy at all times, and particularly in times of high unemployment. The employer job PRSI scheme and the Revenue job assist scheme are aimed at incentivising employers. As the Deputy has pointed out, neither of these schemes achieved a high level of utilisation. Both schemes were designed primarily to incentivise job creation with the secondary objective of targeting recruitment of those on the live register. As the Deputy has rightly pointed out, take up has been disappointingly low. In 2012 for example, the employer job PRSI scheme was awarded in respect of only 1,072 employees with fewer than 900 businesses applying. The numbers were even lower in 2011, with 923 employees benefiting. Since coming into office, the Government has been engaged in a persistent and focused series of reviews of all programme and schemes aimed at supporting employment and the unemployed. We have worked to identify improved practices that allow for greater quality outputs. The job assist and PRSI exemption scheme were commonly criticised for being complicated, suffered the perception of having burdensome administrative practices and were viewed as difficult to access. A recent IBEC survey of employers' sentiment indicated this perception predominantly obtained among employers who had not applied for the schemes, while feedback from employers who benefited from them was positive. Irrespective about whether such accusations are true, the existing schemes did not attract sufficient support and called for a fresh view to be taken. I compliment the Deputy on his own work in bringing forward new proposals. The Government has decided that a new simplified incentive scheme should be developed. JobsPlus is therefore being introduced on a pilot basis with effect from early July and will replace the existing schemes. JobsPlus has been included as one of the disruptive measures in the action plan for jobs 2013. The plan outlines seven high impact reforms with highly ambitious deadlines. In line with what the Deputy has set out in his proposals for A Ticket to Work, JobsPlus is to provide a simple, easily accessible and understood cash based incentive to get employers to recruit full-time permanent employees from the live register. As it is cash based, it will aid a business's cash flow by providing a steady flow of payments each month for two years. If a business recruits a person who has been unemployed for 24 months from the live register, the employer will receive a cash grant of €10,000 over two years. If a business recruits a person who has been unemployed for between 12 and 24 months, the employer will receive a cash grant of €7,500 over two years. The initial budget allocation for this scheme is €21.25 million over three years. If given a chance, and if we can convince business owners and employers to engage, JobsPlus will be successful but we need real engagement and a better connection than we have had heretofore with employers both nationally and locally. Key among our tasks is to target and convince the decision makers within businesses to take notice of the incentives on offer and to look to those they previously may not have considered for employment. I welcome the Deputy's work in this area and I will be interested in his engagement in monitoring the roll-out and implementation of the JobsPlus during this pilot phase.
#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	200	I thank the Minister for her response. The JobsPlus scheme is a welcome and positive step forward by the Government. In February 2012, responding to a query I raised with him about this issue, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, stated he was considering including in the Action Plan for Jobs a coupon style scheme along the lines I have suggested. The JobsPlus scheme is being targeted at small and medium sized enterprises. From my extensive research into this issue with the west Cork jobs initiative, in which 12 local employers are involved, I believe the decision to tailor the scheme towards employers rather than employees will mean it will not attract the level of engagement required from employers. The Department and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation should reorientate JobsPlus towards unemployed persons by empowering them by means of coupons. I have been informed by officials that it would be difficult to provide unemployed people with coupons because the live register frequently changes. The circumstances of people who have been unemployed for 12 months or more are by and large static and, therefore, unlikely to chop and change. This provides scope to offer the long-term unemployed a coupon which would empower them to seek a match among employers. Such an approach would achieve results much more quickly than giving employers responsibility to find a match among the unemployed because employers are too busy doing what they do best, namely, protecting existing jobs, to seek out people on the live register. A second difficulty with the JobsPlus scheme is its title. While this may appear to be a minor issue, the term "JobsPlus" is difficult. We must empower people who are sitting at home watching the evening news on television. It would be much more productive to describe the scheme in terms of a "ticket", "passport" or "coupon" to work. I implore the Minister to use her good offices to review the two aspects of the proposed scheme that I have highlighted.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	201	I thank Deputy Jim Daly for the work he has done and the thought he has given to how the Government can improve incentives and target people who are long-term unemployed. We expect to launch JobsPlus in early July and we will see how the scheme goes. I had an opportunity, as part of the roll-out of the Pathways to Work scheme, to visit eight or nine major locations with a departmental roadshow. Up to 2,500 employers and human resources specialists visited these public events. Many employers who are seeking to recruit staff do not consider people who are unemployed for positions because they want to recruit people who are in work or coming new to the labour market. A gap on a curriculum vitae indicating that someone has been out of work, through no fault of the person in question, raises queries and questions. If potential recruits are available who have not been out of work, they tend to be preferred. We must overcome this problem, which is one of the reasons I developed JobBridge. It is interesting that more than 18,000 people, including 6,000 people currently on the scheme, have availed of a JobBridge internship. Indecon International Economic Consultants did a study of the scheme and found that within five months of completing JobBridge, 60% of participants had moved into employment. We have a job to do in convincing employers and human resource specialists that people who are on the live register are a major resource and need to be given a fair opportunity. The JobsPlus initiative will offer employers direct cash incentives. Employers who take on a person who has been unemployed for between one and two years will receive €7,500 over two years, while those who employ a person who has been unemployed for more than two years will receive €10,000 over two years. These are significant cash incentives, particularly if the employer is taking on somebody on a relatively low wage. As I stated, the scheme will be launched in early July and I will bear in mind the proposals the Deputy made for further incentivising persons who are unemployed and employers.

The prison does not have in-cell sanitation and lacks the basic infrastructure required of a modern prison. The poor conditions have been strongly criticised by the Inspector of Prisons and Council of Europe Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, CPT. The Inspector of Prisons is of the view that the maximum capacity of the prison should be 146 prisoners. However, the prison has typically accommodated 270 or more prisoners. Very early in my appointment as Minister, I visited Cork Prison and saw at first-hand the chronic overcrowding and inadequate physical infrastructure. The main purpose of the new prison facility is to replace the substandard prison accommodation in Cork and provide a modem prison facility designed on the principle of rehabilitation and resettlement. The construction of the new prison will eliminate the practice of prisoners having to slop out and provide adequate accommodation for prisoners in accordance with our national and international obligations. It will also provide the infrastructure necessary for the education and rehabilitation of prisoners. Building on the site adjacent to the existing prison will ensure value for money for the taxpayer. The new prison will provide approximately 275 spaces for prisoners based on double cell occupancy. The prison will have a peak accommodation capacity for 310 prisoners which will only be reached in emergency circumstances. All the cells will have integral toilets and showers. Development consent for the new prison is being sought under Part 4 of the Prisons Act 2007, which sets out a special procedure that may be applied to major prison developments. Part 4 provides a transparent mechanism for the Oireachtas to grant development consent by means of a resolution approved by each House and confirmed by an Act. The confirming Bill will be published after the resolutions have been approved. In June 2012, I issued a direction that Part 4 of the Act is to apply to the proposed prison development in Cork. In November 2012, public notice was given of the proposed prison development and observations and submissions were invited. A rapporteur, Mr. James Farrelly, prepared a report identifying the main issues raised and summarising the submissions and observations received. Twelve submissions, including a detailed submission from Cork City Council, and several petitions were received. There is no provision under the legislation for the rapporteur to comment on the validity or otherwise of submissions made, nor is there any provision for him to make recommendations. I have laid before the Houses the documents required by the legislation, which include the environmental impact assessment, visual representations of the exterior of the development and the rapporteur's report. I also took the opportunity to lay a document setting out my observations on the environmental impact assessment and the rapporteur's report. The resolution lists the main measures taken to avoid, reduce or offset any possible significant adverse effects of the development on the environment and sets out the conditions to be complied with in the construction of the prison. Visually conditioned concrete with a light-coloured finish will be used on the sections of the perimeter wall most visible to the public. To address a specific concern about the impact on residential property adjacent to the site, the height of the wall around the horticultural area at the northern end of the site will be reduced to approximately 5.2 m. The existing prison in Cork is the only closed prison in the State without a prison standard perimeter wall. As the new prison will have such a wall and an outer cordon sanitaire secured by a 2.5 m fence, security risks will be significantly reduced. The need to prevent drugs or contraband being thrown into the prison from outside has been carefully considered in the prison design.As regards privacy issues, the CCTV system will be restricted to prevent viewing into neighbouring residential property and obscured glazing will be used in all windows overlooking such property. The Irish Prison Service and the principal contractor will liaise closely with An Garda Síochána, Cork City Council and other interested parties in preparing a traffic management plan to minimise the impact of construction traffic on local residents and businesses. To reduce noise and dust during the construction period, the perimeter wall will be constructed before construction of the prison buildings begins. The Irish Prison Service will draw up a good-neighbour policy to provide a framework under which the concerns of local residents can be dealt with. The Irish Prison Service project manager will act as liaison officer and will set up a local consultation group to address any issues that arise during the construction period. Construction of the new prison is expected to commence in October 2013 and be completed in early 2016. This resolution was discussed by the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality on Wednesday, 12 June. All parties are represented on the committee and I understand that many of the committee members have visited Cork Prison and seen the conditions there. The committee was strongly in favour of the development of the new prison in Cork. As action is urgently required to address the chronic overcrowding and inadequate conditions in Cork Prison, I hope the resolution and the confirming Bill will be passed by both Houses before the summer recess so that tendering for the construction of the new prison can proceed.

We welcome the principle of building a new prison in Cork given that, as highlighted by many organisations, the conditions were inhumane and inadequate for the prison population. Clearly those conditions go against what we are trying to do with regard to prisoner education so that they can come back into the community rehabilitated. Overcrowding and slopping out is completely unacceptable in this day and age, and it has been condemned on numerous occasions. That is not to take away from the efforts staff have made in trying to deal with this, but the numbers of prisoners going through Cork Prison makes a mockery of what we are trying to achieve in terms of having decent dignified accommodation for prisoners, regardless of the reasons for their incarceration, so that when they come out they can make a contribution to broader society. I welcome the commitment to this development. Of course, it is still proposed to have double occupancy cells, which should be revisited. While I understand there are extreme pressures on finances, every effort should be made to try to accommodate prisoners in single occupancy cells where practicable. The development of this prison on Rathmore Road in Cork should include at least some single occupancy cells. Having been there and having met many families, I recognise it is critical to have proper visiting facilities for families visiting loved ones in prison. An element of dignity and respect needs to be afforded to people when they go into prisons. While I understand the need for security and I support every measure to ensure drugs and contraband are not smuggled in by family members and people visiting prisoners, with technological advances in surveillance, etc. it should be possible to allow visiting in a dignified and human manner.

Residents have made submissions to the rapporteur and there have been broader consultations with the community. There is already a prison on the Rathmore Road with military barracks adjoining it. Any development must take into account the impact it will have on residents, including during the construction phase. It will be a large construction site for many years. As construction is set to commence in 2013 and end in 2016, there could be three years of heavy construction work in a residential area. I urge the Minister to use his good offices to ensure there is a good-neighbour policy and the liaison officer genuinely engages with the local residents, the local authority and An Garda Síochána to ensure there is a proper traffic management system and that other issues of concern are dealt with during construction. I understand the pressures on contractors when building, including working late hours etc., but they need to be cognisant that this is located in a residential community. The structure will have an impact on residents in Brandon Crescent and elsewhere and I hope the liaison officer and the good-neighbour policy will work efficiently to ensure the needs of residents are met to the greatest possible extent while constructing a facility that is necessary to ensure prisoners have an element of dignity while incarcerated. We do not oppose the motion and the confirming Bill under Part 4 of the Prisons Act 2007. We understand the need for security. When people are talking about prisons, all we can talk about are the outer cordons as such being aesthetically attractive and not excessively impacting on neighbourhoods and communities. For all those reasons, I urge the Minister to do what he can to ensure it is seen as a positive development for those serving time in prison and for family members visiting them. We do not place sufficient emphasis on that critical aspect. At the end of the day, many families are heartbroken to have a loved one incarcerated in prison and often they blame themselves. The dignity and respect for families visiting prisoners must be included in this plan, accepting the need for security.

As I pointed out then, I was part of the committee delegation that visited Cork Prison last year. The governor made it clear from the outset that the prison is not up to standard and does not comply with the requirements of a civilised society. When people are in prison, we want to rehabilitate them and have the environment that allows that to happen. On that basis, the new prison is welcome and the sooner it is built, the better. However, since last week's committee meeting there has been very strong criticism from the Irish Penal Reform Trust and individuals such as Fr. Peter McVerry about the proposal for shared cells. It is very welcome that slopping out will cease. At the moment almost all the cells in Cork Prison require slopping out, which is a very demeaning practice. However, the practical difficulties with shared cells are obviously that somebody has to use the toilet in front of another human being. If we are trying to rehabilitate prisoners and take them away from the life they had led to being fully equipped to act as a participating citizen, having to use a toilet in front of another person is a bad way to start. There are also issues with prisoners trying to come off drugs. Unfortunately, many people who have been imprisoned are addicted to drugs. A prisoner may be in a cell with another who is not coming off drugs. There are practical reasons and also reasons of dignity for moving away from multiple occupancy cells. Sinn Féin wants to support the motion but before wrapping up the debate, I want the Minister to give an assurance that he will do everything to look at those plans again and see if amendments can be made because we want to move forward. The redevelopment of Mountjoy Prison has been very welcome and it now has single occupancy cells. Already apparently the impact has been extremely positive. Our committee prepared the penal reform report which has been submitted to the Minister for consideration. It is an excellent report completed by our rapporteur, Senator Bacik, and agreed unanimously. It contains a vision for decarceration with a target of reducing prisoner numbers by a third.The report includes looking at community service, restorative justice and alternatives to imprisonment for people who are convicted of minor offences. Naturally, there is a need for people who are a threat to society and who are violent to continue to be imprisoned. We need to see a tailored plan for prisoners and to have an exit strategy for people when they are imprisoned that will take them through the process and that will ensure they are genuinely rehabilitated. We examined other issues. At the moment if a man is in prison and if he keeps his head down and does not engage in any real reform of himself as a person he will get 25% remission almost automatically. The sub-committee on penal reform has argued that there should be tangible rehabilitation on a tailor-made basis with a personal plan. In response the incentive could be one third remission for prisoners within the system. We want to see value for money. We are paying approximately €65,000 for every prisoner locked up each year. It is costing us a fortune and the long-term benefits are not evident. The five-point plan from the sub-committee, which was an all-party proposal given to the Minister, is a real template for progress. I urge the Minister in that spirit to examine the plans for the prison in Cork again. Let us move on as we mean to go along. We want to rehabilitate prisoners. In 2013, in what we hope is a civilised State, is it really appropriate that people have to use the toilet in front of others? It is altogether demeaning and totally unacceptable for what is a new prison being built here and now. I urge the Minister to address the concerns of the brilliant people who work in partnership with us, including Fr. Peter McVerry and those in the Irish Penal Reform Trust, who we all respect in the House as making a constructive contribution to penal reform the State. It is not about easy solutions for people who find themselves in crime. This is not about easy alternatives but hard ones. I recognise that the Minister is enthusiastic about restorative justice. When a person must stand in front of his victims and take ownership of what he has done and do the right thing and when a person has to do community service in his community for what are not serious crimes but crimes nonetheless, it is a case of painful and difficult choices, but they cost the taxpayer less and we get a better result. In the context of penal reform and of a new vision for how we run our criminal justice system and our prisons, let us progress on the right basis. I appeal to Minister to do everything he can to address the issue of double occupancy. The Minister should also reassure the NGOs with whom we are partners in this regard and he should do so today.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	209	I wish to share time with Deputy Wallace. There is much that is positive in this development but there is a "but". It relates to the number of reports, rules and recommendations relating to single-cell occupancy. European prison rule 18.1 on accommodation states that it "shall respect human dignity and, as far as possible, privacy, and meet the requirements of health and hygiene". It further states that prisoners "shall normally be accommodated during the night in individual cells except where it is preferable for them to share sleeping accommodation" and that if they are sharing it should be with prisoners who are suitable to each other. The Whitaker report from 1985 is critical of our penal system. The report set out basic living conditions and states, "Normally (and always where a prisoner so desires) private sleeping accommodation in a single cell" should be provided. In 1985 almost all prisoners were in single cells but today some 60% of prisoners are sharing cells. The former governor of Mountjoy Prison, John Lonergan, also stressed the importance of single-cell accommodation and the need for personal space. In 1994 the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform referred to providing additional places to eliminate doubling up. When the Minister announced the plan for this prison he said it would eliminate the practice of prisoners having to slop out. He also make a point about adequate and suitable accommodation. That was taken to mean that there would be a commitment to single-cell accommodation, which equates to international best practice. Allied to single-cell occupancy is the issue of personal hygiene. It is welcome that the new building will mean an end to slopping out in the prison in Cork because of in-cell sanitation. However unless the section is walled off there will be no privacy when it comes to using the toilet. I understand that people are in prison because they have done wrong and we are not suggesting hotel accommodation, but it is an insult to human dignity to expect a person to use the toilet in front of another person. In November 2011 the Minister reported that there were 1,885 prisoners using the toilet in the presence of others. We do not carry out normal human activities such as eating, studying, reading and watching television in the same place as we use the toilet. Sharing creates other problems, including an increase in violence and intimidation. I am heartbroken when I see young men from Dublin 1 and Dublin 7, who contribute greatly to the prison population, go in drug-free but come out addicted to drugs because of who they had to share cells with. I share the concerns of those in the Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice and their disappointment that this plan includes provision for doubling up. They see it as a retrograde step and a breach of international best practice.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	210	We are all familiar with the fact that John Lonergan and Peter McVerry have been consistent in letting us know that the majority of people in prisons come from a small number of disadvantaged communities. Most of those who experience poverty and deprivation do not turn to crime, but I suggest that if we are serious about reducing crime then the social deprivation and addiction problems that underlie much criminal behaviour is a good place to start. Likewise to reduce crime, the focus of imprisonment should be on rehabilitation given that the statistics indicate that one in two leaving prison will be back within four years. There is no doubt that the conditions will be far better than they were, as the Minister has stated. Nevertheless, it is concerning that people such as those in the Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice have challenged the Minister's claim that the prison would provide adequate and suitable accommodation for all prisoners. They have pointed out that a failure to provide single-cell accommodation in the new prison will be in direct breach of article 18.5 of the European prison rules drawn up by the Council of Europe, of which Ireland is a founding member state. This cannot be considered to be in accordance with international best practice. Fr. McVerry has said that cell sharing should not be the norm in prison and that in many cases it results in increased intimidation and violence and leads to non-drug users being introduced to drug use. He has further noted that even without such extreme consequences enforced sharing can represent a cramped and oppressive living environment, especially in light of the fact that in Ireland out-of-cell time is at best between six or seven hours per day. Fr. McVerry has pointed out that things have improved. For example, the atmosphere in Mountjoy Prison has improved dramatically since it has moved to single occupancy and that has made a significant difference. Mr. Liam Herrick of the Irish Penal Reform Trust hit the nail on head when he said that instead of increasing capacity at Cork Prison we need what he has described as an "increased use of rigorous community-based alternatives, investment in probation and community services, an overall reduction of the use of imprisonment for less serious offences, and better reintegration supports before and after release to support a reduction in re-offending". For those interested in how prisons work I recommend a documentary just launched by Eugene Jarecki called "The House I Live In". It is described as a deep look inside America's criminal justice system and it is fascinating and educational.

I note Deputy Kelleher's comments about conditions being inhumane and inadequate and that there is a need for proper visiting facilities and a need for dignity and respect for persons visiting prisons. Of course, for 14 years his party was in government and ignored Cork Prison. The conditions there were a disgrace when I visited it.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	213	I have the height of respect for the prison officers and the governor working there. They are doing an extraordinary job in difficult circumstances. In circumstances where we have little funding available to us, I managed to secure funding to effectively replace the existing prison because in its current form, occupied by persons sentenced, there is nothing we can do with it. It is our objective to provide a better and modern prison facility. It will have full family-friendly visiting facilities. The development must take account of the impact the building will have on residents in the area, which is why the outer perimeter wall is to be constructed first so as to try to delimit the impact on those residing in the area.We have a prison already in Cork. The new prison is being built essentially adjacent to the existing prison and there will be greater security provision for those who are there. In an ideal world I would like a prison to be constructed which provided only for single-cell occupancy. The problem is that the perfect is the enemy of the possible. It was little short of a miracle that I was able to secure funding for the construction of the prison in current financial circumstances. The funding was secured because of my view as to the complete inadequacy of the current facility. There will be in-cell sanitation, which is important. The construction of the prison will provide for a modern facility with all of the additional, necessary facilities that come with that to try to contribute to the well-being of prisoners and to reduce recidivism. The construction of the prison in Cork is not a be-all and end-all by any stretch of the imagination. It is part of my objective that we adopt a different approach in dealing with prisoners. I accept what some Deputies have said, namely, that we should try to bring about a reduction in the number of the prison population while at the same time ensure that people who are sentenced properly serve those sentences and that the public is not put at risk. If a prisoner was to be released early and there is a serious incident because a misjudgement has been made, Deputies on the Opposition side of the House will jump up and down to lay the blame for that event when it occurs. What we require in this area is a comprehensive approach. We need an approach which involves looking at a whole range of alternative disposals for dealing with prisoners. We are adapting our prison policies in those areas. We now have a scheme whereby prisoners serving medium-range sentences who pose no risk to the community, who have behaved well in prison and are willing to engage in community service, are taking up community service and being released early to the benefit of the community, saving money for taxpayers and relieving the pressure on the prison system. That was something we introduced. This is a very important development. It is very important that we improve our prison facilities. It is of crucial importance that we change the approach adopted in years gone by which has produced far too great a number returning to criminality within a relatively short period of being released from prison terms. We must continue to deal with the issue of drugs. In the context of the changes that have been made in the past two years, far fewer drugs are getting within the prison system. The new prison is specifically designed to try to ensure that the problem does not develop with a new prison system. This is a very important development in the right direction. I have the greatest respect for the Irish Penal Reform Trust and for Fr. McVerry and the work he does but in the context of the numbers with which we currently deal it was a question of either building this prison, a modern, new facility with in-cell sanitation, or alternatively the funding would not be available for something practically double the size if we were to provide exclusively for single-cell occupancy. This prison does envisage single-cell occupancy for some prisoners as part of the prison plan. In the context of the continuing development of prison policy, looking at alternative ways of dealing with prisoners in the context of the community service amendment legislation that we passed in 2012 - the District Court uses it to a greater extent so instead of prisoners being sentenced to short periods in prison they are doing community service - we can constructively reduce numbers while ensuring that there is a consequence of relevance to those who engage in criminality. We can also reduce our expenditure on the prison system by diverting individuals into community service who can contribute to the community in a beneficial way. Of course there is a role for restorative justice, a range of different mechanisms are available. The directors of the Prison Service and of the Probation Service are working very carefully together. There is a joint policy plan to bring about huge reform and change in ethos and approach, to provide a comprehensive approach to reduce recidivism and to provide better opportunities for those who are in prison so as to ensure when they leave prison that there is a different life open to them to that which resulted in them being sentenced in the first place. The construction of the prison in Cork is just one brick in the wall of the policies we are implementing to humanise our penal system and penal policy.

They will deal with the type of issue which Deputy Wallace or Deputy O’Sullivan raised about an individual who might be drug-addicted who needs to come off drugs and to provide for single-cell occupancy in those circumstances or other circumstances where that might be necessary. For example, one might have a prisoner on protection or in need of protection. If we reduce the number of prisoners, what are currently designed as double-occupancy cells might in future become single-occupancy cells. What has been achieved in Mountjoy Prison in the past two years is extraordinary. When I came into office the belief was that one could not provide in-cell sanitation in Mountjoy and that one could not provide for the huge amount of restoration and change that has occurred. A revolution is taking place within that prison to the benefit not just simply of prisoners but of the wider community as well.

#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	219	With the Taoiseach and most people in this country I fully appreciate the need to reform our political system so that we can give full expression to our democracy. I do not subscribe to the view that ours is the worst political system but neither is it the best that it can be and when it was really put to the test no one can deny that it massively failed the people in neither preventing nor even anticipating the economic bust that has visited such hardship on all of our people. It is that failure that has underpinned the consensus around the need for reform of our politics and probably for radical change. What is not so clear, though, is how that should happen and what form it should take. That is my sole reservation about an early decision on the abolition of the Seanad without a much wider debate about our politics. It might be that the abolition of the Seanad is part of what is required to make our system more robust but currently, without knowing what might replace it or what other reforms might come in tandem with abolition it is not clear to me how politics, our political process or the national welfare will be improved by the abolition of the Seanad. The danger I see is that in the absence of the Seanad with all its flaws – it has many – and with a weakened or reduced Dáil at the same time as retaining the strong Executive, we will have less democracy, accountability and less potential to deliver for our people. I see that as a real danger. We have a large Government majority currently and that may be a feature of Governments in the future and the potential for scrutiny of Government action is already seriously diminished. Our system is characterised by a strong executive arm regardless of whether there is a majority. I understand the need for that but the strength and power must be tempered and balanced by a system that holds the Government to account and does so in a transparent and effective way. If reform is our aim I do not see how a smaller Dáil and no Seanad can achieve that. I do not dispute the need for reform but before we throw out the baby with the bathwater the question must be asked about what political system we want and what is required to achieve it. The Taoiseach has said he intends to strengthen the committee system, which is a good thing, but there must be a debate about what that means. I am a long time in the House and I have seen change to the committee system.However, the most recent change to the committee system has removed the Committee Stage of the debate on a Bill from this Chamber. This part of the debate, which most people will agree to be the most crucial, has been relegated instead to a basement in the adjoining building out of the public eye. Moreover, the power to table amendments is confined just to the handful of committee members. I believe this constitutes a diminution of democracy and not a reform. While I believe it was introduced as a reform, it is neither an enhancement nor a reform of our politics. I understand the Taoiseach mentioned there would be 12 members in the new committees that it is proposed to establish. However, given there is a tradition in this House that Government Members do not submit amendments, it really means the power to submit amendments would be confined to approximately five Members of the entire Dáil and I wonder about that. The proposal for pre-legislative and post-legislative scrutiny by the committee is a very good one. However, the downside - and there always is a downside - is that having a small handful of Deputies checking on themselves is not always the best way to scrutinise something. Even when one is proofreading something, unless one sees the mistake the first time one will not see it the second or third times. Consequently, that problem of scrutiny with a mere 12 members arises again, as having a small, limited pool of expertise and limited experience will be damaging, particularly when the Bill is complex or technical or both. My fear is the committees will be strengthened at the expense of the Dáil Chamber itself. I refer to one advantage and indeed the original reasoning behind the vocational or sectoral nominations to the Seanad was to tap into a range of specific skills and expertise that might not be produced through the random election process to the Dáil. I absolutely agree this vocational system no longer reflects the range of vocations or sectors and I do not believe it is relevant today. It certainly does not reflect the academia of today. However, the principle of bringing in other expertise is a good one and were that to be lost now, one must consider how it is to be replaced. It could be done through a reformed Seanad or perhaps it could be achieved by moving the Seanad or the Dáil or both to a list system, in which people with a particular range of experiences could be selected onto those lists. Incidentally, I agree the current electorate for the Seanad for both the sectoral and university panels is ludicrously out of date and undemocratic and any reformed Seanad, were the public to decide it should be kept, should be based on a completely different system. On the other hand, it should not be one that replicates precisely elections to the Dáil because if we are to achieve the necessary oversight and an alternative source of scrutiny, it will be necessary to move from sole reliance on the party system. Moreover, no discussion of a new politics can take place without real consideration of the multi-seat constituencies and consideration given to the possibility of changing that either to single-seat constituencies or to a list system or to both. I acknowledge this would be a much harder bullet to bite than the abolition of the Seanad but no one can deny that Ireland's electoral system and the multi-seat constituency in particular has a detrimental effect on its governance. The point has been made that other countries - and the smaller Nordic countries specifically were mentioned - only have a unicameral system, and that is absolutely true. However, I have done a fair amount of study in the past on Denmark's political system in particular and its governance is almost entirely locally based. They operate a rigid system of subsidiarity and have various levels of local government in which no service is provided at a level above that absolutely necessary to deliver it. The result is that Denmark's national parliament has a limited role in the governance of the country. It is confined purely to national issues, such as national taxation, obviously, national and international transport routes and foreign affairs. Even were we to reform our local government system, we are light years from such a system and in fact are moving in the other direction towards bigger local authorities rather than smaller ones. I welcome the reforms that are taking place at local level and note one such reform mentioned is the ability to vary the property tax by 15%, which then is collected and dispensed by national government. I do not consider that to be a revolutionary change. In Denmark, local taxes, determined and collected locally, provide health, education and policing services, as well as all those other services we regard as being local services. Consequently, I am not completely convinced that comparing the Nordic countries, because they have a unicameral system, with the proposed system for Ireland is entirely valid. However, Ireland must reshape its political system. This must be done in a coherent way by establishing at the outset what it is we wish to achieve and by identifying all the elements of our system that require change. I believe we need change beyond simply cutting out the Seanad but I have worries about using a piecemeal method of change. For instance, we are introducing gender quotas, about which much has been said. It is another measure I do not entirely support but the idea behind it is to increase female participation, which I do support. However, the sitting arrangements are working against encouraging female participation. In fact, they work against men participating as well, as the practice simply is anti-family. Practices such as sitting until midnight, short notice sittings and cancelling breaks all make it extremely difficult for parents to plan childminding and to organise their lives. Consequently, if one really seeks to have more women in this House, one must consider the organisation of the Dáil in its entirety. The Whips already have spoken about the need to plan legislation in order that it allows for measured scrutiny, an end to guillotines and certainly an end to situations in which amendments to the Bill as presented on Second Stage must be submitted before the Second Stage debate has even been held. As I noted, our politics must be reformed and I acknowledge there is a perceived need and a temptation - probably too much of a temptation in difficult times - to streamline everything, even our democracy. However, abolishing the Seanad is a fairly dramatic and far-reaching move on which to embark without a clear and coherent overall vision of how scrutiny can be ensured and how the democratic deficit will be compensated for. Consequently, while I certainly am not wedded to the concept of a Seanad, certainly not as it operates at present, I urge caution until we know where we are going. Ultimately, the people will decide and it is worth remembering the public voted in a referendum in 1979 to extend the university panels but no legislative effect ever was given to that vote. There is a certain irony in going back to consult the people again to abolish it completely, having failed to implement the previous decision. I welcome the opportunity this Bill gives to provide the people with the chance to decide in the first instance. Primarily, it gives us an opportunity to have a broad-ranging debate on our political process, which is long overdue.
#AlanFarrell	unknown-#AlanFarrell-party	unknown-#AlanFarrell-dob	unknown-#AlanFarrell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	220	I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, for his presence. The proposed 32nd amendment to the Constitution provides the opportunity for the people to have their say on this debate. Given the current Government's commitment to have this discussion and this referendum in 2009, followed by its inclusion in the election manifesto of a number of parties, I see no difficulty in putting this question to the people to ascertain what the response will be. However, I have a number of reservations about the manner in which this debate is taking place and on the basis of the discussion. For instance, my colleague has just alluded to this point and I cannot help but think this is putting the cart before the horse somewhat, as the debate is not being held on what it is proposed to put in place of the Seanad or the alterations to the behaviour of the Dáil or the Oireachtas in general. Surely that should have been a debate to have been held followed by a discussion on whether the referendum was called for in the first place. That said, it is a commitment the Government has given and, as I noted, it was included in a number of election manifestos, including those of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and, I understand, the Labour Party. Moreover, it is front and centre in the programme for Government. Since 1936, the Seanad really has been a political football. I refer to the reform agenda initiated by de Valera in 1936, which provided for 11 appointees by the then Taoiseach. This was to deal with the issue of the majority of the Government, which up to that point did not exist - certainly not in the Free State Seanad in any event.The result was that it diluted the opportunity for the Seanad to have a meaningful say in the legislative process, effectively creating a second House that was a mini-version of the Dáil. In other jurisdictions the role of the second House is to have a say in and even veto legislation if it believes it will not add anything to life in that particular jurisdiction, whereas in Ireland it can only delay it, almost delaying the inevitable. I refer to the method of election. I found an interesting reference to the effect that the vocational system used to nominate candidates for the Seanad was inspired by the Roman Catholic social teachings of the 1930s and in particular the 1931 papal encyclical, which was news to me. I further read that apparently it has socialist overtures. Given their abject failure across the world, that is a great example of something that should not be left without reform. In May 2011, an article in The Sunday Business Post with regard to the Seanad stated: "University representation is a system so bizarre that it is rivalled only by the hereditary peerages in the British House of Lords as an anachronism in modern democracies." That sums up the reason we should be looking at reforming the method of election in terms of the individuals who are permitted to put themselves forward for election to the Seanad rather than the straight question of whether we should have one in the first place. I preface my remarks by saying that this discussion is not about any individual Senator past or current. The difficulty is with the panel structure in that we give a vote to an elite within society. College educated individuals within the small number of universities which have a vote in Seanad elections can be considered an elite, and certainly a minority, but the candidates themselves do not have to come from the same minorities. We have a rather peculiar scenario, therefore, where a certain number of individuals within society elect individuals both for political reasons as well as in terms of former classmates or whatever. That no longer has a place in society. A 75 year old system that has not been reformed despite ten reports since 1936 and 12 reports in total since 1919 shows that this issue has been treated like a political football and kicked down the road in the hope that someone eventually would take responsibility for it. On that basis, I understand the reason the Taoiseach has chosen to put this to the people for the final say on the matter. As I outlined earlier, the purpose of the Seanad was to see legislation dealt with on an expertise basis in that individuals would bring their particular expertise to the table for discussion in an attempt to add to legislation. It was not simply to throw it out for political reasons but to attempt to understand what an item of legislation was trying to achieve and make it more fit for purpose. Again, that has not been the case and it is a rare event that Seanad amendments are accepted because it is done on the party Whip system, which does not take those matters into consideration. As has been seen by the number of individuals who have come out in the weeks and months since this debate started, there is a genuine appetite on the part of the sitting Senators to reform the Seanad. However, they do so in a vacuum because ultimately they do not decide the scope of the Seanad. Invariably, that is decided in the Department of the Taoiseach, and while they may have the best will in the world to attempt to amend the operation of the Seanad by introducing different sitting times, as was done in the Dáil and as alluded to by the previous speaker, Deputy Olivia Mitchell, often it has not worked to the benefit of the House or the people. The previous two Governments had no reform agenda with regard to the Seanad. A little over two years ago, it favoured putting the question to the people. I do not need to read into the record the 2011 Fianna Fáil manifesto but I take issue with the fact that Fianna Fáil has changed its tune and is attempting to say it was saying something different in its manifesto. Ink does not lie, and I have it before me. That speaks for itself. Another individual who has been particularly vehement in his dislike of the decision of the Taoiseach to put this to the people is Michael McDowell, who is on record as saying the Seanad is like a cross between a political convalescent home and a crèche and is used as an ante-room to Dáil Éireann to house would-be newcomers, temporary absentees and as a consolation prize for those who have lost their seats, yet in recent weeks he has come out with the terrific soundbite that it is a power grab by the Government. That is a major indictment of that individual, but I will move on from personal criticisms. This is not an affront to democracy, which was stated by Members of the Opposition. It is an opportunity to exercise democracy in a decision that ultimately comes down to the individual person, the ballot paper and a pen. They get to decide whether this constitutional amendment is passed. The referendum will give the public an opportunity to have its say in respect of democracy and is a good measure of public opinion as to whether the people believe the Seanad is worth reforming. This debate should be about what we are proposing to put in place of the Seanad because the people will demand that in the coming months. I hope the date for the referendum will be set before the summer recess or shortly thereafter to allow us make our decision as to the way we, as individuals, will vote. I support the decision to put this issue to the people and I hope we will have a robust debate about the price of democracy in this particular instance.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	221	Before the Deputy who spoke before me leaves the House, I wish to refer to the university Senators. Before independence and up to 1937, there were Teachtaí Dála and MPs. It was something we inherited from the British. They were elected to the House of Commons when the Dáil was set up in 1919. There were Senators from the National University of Ireland, NUI, and from Trinity College. That continued until 1937 when, rightly in my view because they do not have any place in this Chamber, it was decided that no longer would university representatives elected by graduates sit in the Dáil. One might ask why they did not abolish those seats. The logic of the situation is that we are talking about the late 1930s when it would be easy for people in the minority community in the South and people in the majority community in the North to say that the simple abolition of those seats effectively was taking seats from the Unionist minority, who in many cases also happened to be a religious minority in the State at the time. In terms of the reluctance in more recent years to effect change once we got a referendum, on many occasions I argued that we should grasp the nettle and at least open the franchise, as is now possible, to all university graduates. There was a certain reluctance, in the context of the peace process, to be seen to do anything that was not favourable to Trinity, but I agree with the Deputy that it is time for change. When people laugh at what was done in the past, it is important that they first examine the historical record and the rather unusual circumstances in which this arose in the first place, which was because they were sitting in this Dáil up to 1937.This proposal and the way it has been put forward has all the hallmarks of a rush of blood to the head. It is bad enough to have one rush of blood to the head, but to have two in a row seems to be a mistake. The first rush of blood to the head was the announcement by the Taoiseach at a dinner that he would abolish the Seanad. The second was to come forward with this proposal without thinking out the complexities involved and the possible unintended consequences. The Taoiseach is the longest serving Member in this House. I would have thought he would have realised that when legislation that involves such monumental change is rushed, before having endless debate about it, it is likely he will not wind up with the result he is looking for. It is a pity we did not have a discussion about this, particularly in the Constitutional Convention that is looking at the electoral system. An interesting debate is going on in the House and Government Members have been frank in their views, which are varied and interesting, but when we look at the totality of the debate, we must ask if we are going anywhere in a coherent fashion and whether we have examined the consequences of anything. I was interested in Deputy Olivia Mitchell's remarks about this place being family unfriendly. We are now proposing four day sittings. She, as a Dublin Deputy, complained about sittings that last until midnight. If there are four day sittings, many Deputies will leave their houses on a Monday morning and return home on a Friday evening, and many of them from the furthest parts of the country will not get home in the meantime. For any family person, that is in no way a family-friendly situation. It is easy for conventions to make proposals and there have been suggestions of making Dáil constituencies even bigger. It takes longer to drive from one end of my constituency to the other than it does to drive from the edge of the constituency to Dublin. We also know that the more seats there are in a constituency, the more chances there will be more than one person elected from the party in that constituency and a greater possibility of being taken out by another party member if we do not keep watching everything on the ground. The bigger the constituencies and the bigger the numbers, the more people will be tied to constituency work day in, day out. There are many issues to be debated. One issue I do not hear debated is the role of Parliament. Cén fáth go bhfuil an tOireachtas ann? What are we doing here? The Oireachtas is a forum for public debate where issues of concern to ordinary citizens are raised and debated. I also think we carry out a specialist function. We are meant to be the people who scrutinise legislation. No legislation is meant to be passed into law without a detailed analysis by us of every word in the legislation. This is where the media representation of what happens here is at variance with the reality. The media will highlight the row every day, so if the Chamber is full and there is a heated argument, the media will highlight that. If, however, we are in a committee teasing out legislation in a reflective and co-operative fashion, Government and Opposition, if we are doing that tedious work of improving every section of that Bill, the media does not highlight that. Why would they when it is boring? It is important, however, that we understand that just because something is mundane or appears boring, that does not mean it is not important. I pay tribute to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine for the way he handled the Animal Health and Welfare Bill. He did not take a view that he had the majority, which he clearly did, and he accepted amendment after amendment to the Bill. He listened to the arguments and if he could not accept the amendment but thought there was some substance to it, he came back on Report Stage with an amendment that took on board the principle. If we want reform in this House, the most fundamental reform we could all introduce would be the idea that we could accept arguments of the Opposition when they are valid and explain any reasons an amendment cannot be accepted. Time and again when we do not scrutinise the legislation properly and when a case is thrown out by the courts because someone has found a loophole we did not find when going through the Houses, everyone then jumps up and down and asks why we did not do our job and see the flaw in the legislation. A law was passed that a driver must keep a warning triangle in the cab of a truck at all times. There was an accident when the truck was parked and a person ran into it. The lorry driver was prosecuted on the basis that he was not displaying the triangle behind the truck to warn the oncoming car of the danger. The barrister noticed the law said the triangle had to be in the cab of the truck at all times and he made the logical argument that he could not take the triangle out of the cab and put it behind the lorry because he would be breaking law because he no longer had a triangle in the cab. I think of all the famous cases involving the drink driving laws, where people drove a coach and four through that sort of minor error. Last year, when we debated the Water Services Bill, there was a proposal that if a person was prosecuted, his name would be made public. I remember raising the issue with the Minister, and he accepted that only if there was a conviction should a person's name become public, and if that person was prosecuted and found innocent, his name should not be publicised. That is what we are supposed to be doing. It is boring and mundane but at the end of the day, it is only when things go wrong in the courts that we realise the importance of the work we do. If I apply to a Department for a grant, in most cases I am offered an appeal. If I am still unhappy I can go to the Ombudsman. We accept the idea of three different people looking at the same proposition under the same law and rules to see if the adjudication is right or if errors have been made. Peer review has become prevalent when looking at the work of experts. We are saying here, however, that one review of legislation that is much more complex and with many sections will be sufficient. The role of the Seanad is not to veto legislation. The role of the Seanad is to be part of the iterative process, which should be an interactive process with Ministers to tease out the legislation and, by persuasion, to make amendments. It is significant that, for one reason or another, during the term of this Oireachtas - we count it by Dáileanna even though it is the Oireachtas - 529 amendments have been made in the Seanad. Whereas the popular approach is all about the votes and the big head-on debates, in fact, much of the best work of this is done by persuasion. Unfortunately, the next issue to which we should address our minds in abolishing the Seanad with the Dáil operating as it does is that 57% of legislation introduced into this House is guillotined. I am not normally overly upset about guillotines on Second Stage, but I have an aversion to them on Committee or Report Stage. I am not saying that there is never a rule for a guillotine because we can need emergency legislation in this House, but if one was even considering getting rid of the second House, one would need to change the Constitution in order that no legislation could be guillotined on Committee or Report Stage in this House without two thirds of the Dáil agreeing. My purpose for that is that it would force all of us to ensure the proper scrutiny of legislation. I am sure in his time as a Minister, Deputy Varadkar, like me, always found that when he examined the legislation, unless it was a two-line Bill, there were issues he needed to amend, of which some could be as small as a comma but others which could be much more substantial than that. The Taoiseach has mentioned a fifth Stage and I would be interested to see that fleshed out. If the Government is to continue to succumb to the temptation - there is no legal or constitutional barrier to doing so - of guillotining Committee and Report Stages, I cannot really see what a fifth Stage will add in the House, and having gone through the Bill I am not sure how the same persons going through the same Bill again would bring the same thing to the Bill that a different set of eyes looking at the Bill would bring to it. It is important that we would persuade the Taoiseach, even if he really believes the Seanad should be abolished, to hold back on that until we have had a proper debate about all the unintended consequences that might arise. There is another issue. It is a mundane and practical issue, but it is an issue nonetheless. In the new Dáil, there will be 158 Deputies. Out of those, we will take the Ceann Comhairle and all the Ministers and Ministers of State, and the fact that at times there might be Deputies who for good reasons cannot fully attend to parliamentary duties, and I am left with approximately 120 Deputies available for ordinary committee work. As somebody who has been very involved in committees where we have been non-partisan since this Dáil came together, I must say that fantastic work goes on in committees. Under the chairmanship of Deputy Andrew Doyle, the Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine produced a considerable report on the oil and gas sector, and we got cohesion between all the political parties and the Independents on that report on a matter on which there would never be a meeting of minds. Recently, we have been doing detailed work on the issue of the dominance of the supermarkets in farm prices and how to address that imbalance which is also a big ticket item on the European agenda. Obviously, we have debated the Common Agricultural Policy. We have debated many different matters and each committee is doing this. The pool of available members is approximately 180 when one throws in the Seanad. There are 20 committees, excluding sub-committees, which most committees have, and select committees. The committee of which I am a member meets for two or three hours every Tuesday and often meets on a Thursday as well, either in plenary or sub-committee form. If everybody is on one committee and I reduce the number available from the current 180 to 120, I am left with six members for each committee.

There will be plenty of time over the coming months to debate this issue. We need a rational and detailed debate. It is time we stopped running down this House.

As the late Dr. Garret FitzGerald did, it is possible for a Taoiseach to pick two members of the public who have never stood for election, appoint them as part of his or her 11 nominees to the Seanad and put them straight into Cabinet. In other words, it is possible for the Taoiseach to include in his 15 members of Cabinet two members of the public who he thinks will never stand for election, either for the Seanad or the Dáil, but would add hugely to the Cabinet. It is interesting, when there has been so much debate about how great it would be to do so, that the Government is slamming the door on that possibility and making it constitutionally impossible. I look forward to a much more detailed debate on this over the coming months. The proposal is badly thought out. I have not been persuaded by anything that has happened that anyone has come up with a way that would ensure proper scrutiny of legislation, the mundane day-to-day job that will always be the primary purpose of a Legislature.

I thank the Whip for allowing me to speak on the issue and I rise to support the Bill, as the change to abolish the Seanad should be made. Our political system is old-fashioned and no longer fit for purpose. We need fewer politicians but more democracy, and during recent years, many people in this country have made very significant and painful sacrifices, doing more with less, and it should be no different for those of us who are politicians. It is important to see this reform in context, and it is not happening on its own. It is part of the new politics agenda we are pursuing as a Government and it is one of the points in the five point plan that we put before the people at the last election. The involves a new and reformed Dáil and very big changes in local government that are now happening. It also involves more open and ethical government, which I will touch on later. The evidence suggests that we should all agree that we do not need a Seanad or second chamber, as there are many countries and democracies around the world that manage to get by with one house of parliament. There are 29 European countries, including Norway, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Luxembourg and many of the new democracies in central and eastern Europe that only have one chamber and seem to manage very well. Outside Europe, countries such as New Zealand and Israel have unicameral parliaments and many small island countries comparable to Ireland, such as Cyprus, Iceland and Malta, have single chamber parliaments. Having held the European Presidency of the transport council for the past six months, I have asked other Ministers in informal conversations how it works for them with one house and it seems to work fine. None is contemplating the introduction of a second house and the process seems to work very well in terms of parliamentary scrutiny and performance. Countries with a second chamber tend to be large and federal, such as Germany, where people are elected from states and not just with a direct mandate from the people. In some countries the bicameral system works very badly, and in Italy, for example, the second chamber has almost the same power as the lower house. As they have similar powers, the houses are often in conflict with each other, making good governance very difficult. Luxembourg is a very small but successful country and it uses an equivalent to our Council of State in a different way, as it reviews all legislation for flaws and constitutionality. That is how it achieves a second opinion without having an institution or second chamber to bring this about. Other countries break up parliament into small legislative committees to carry out that role. As I mentioned, this is part of a bigger programme of reform, which will result in fewer politicians in the country. There will be approximately 600 fewer councillors this time next year after the local elections, we will have one fewer member of the European Parliament, there will be eight fewer Deputies in the next Dáil and, if this referendum is passed, there will be 60 fewer Senators. It is not that I wish to engage in a cull of my colleagues but we should bring the number of politicians in this country into line with countries of a similar size. It is wrong to compare us with America, which is very big, although it is also wrong to compare us with Liechtenstein or San Marino, which are very small. It is right to compare us with countries of a similar size, with a population of approximately 4.5 million to 5 million. Having 160 Members of Parliament brings us roughly into line with such countries. The bigger reform agenda involves changes in local government and more open governance, including an effective ban on corporate donations and legislation to protect whistleblowers and regulate lobbying. Changes have been made in how we make public appointments and many Ministers - including me - bring legislation to committees at the heads of Bill stage, which is before final drafting. We are extending the Freedom of Information Act to other bodies. All these reforms are part of a package and the Seanad abolition should be seen in that light. There are savings of approximately €20 million to be made each year, although some of that may need to be used to beef up the committee system. There will be significant savings in payroll. People often argue for reform of the Seanad, but I am certain that although there will be many promises of reform from those who can and cannot deliver it, the reform will not happen. In 1979, a referendum was approved by the people on Seanad reform, allowing change to the way in which graduate seats are elected. That has not happened. I cannot remember how many reports have been published, although I believe 15 is the correct figure. The Seanad reform has not happened because there is no consensus about what a reformed Seanad should look like. Some want Members to be directly elected, leaving the Chamber in competition with the Dáil, whereas others want Members to be indirectly elected, as it is now. Some people want votes for emigrants and others do not, whereas some people want votes for people in Northern Ireland and others do not. Some people want an elite Seanad made up of experts from the great and the good, including people who are so great that they do not believe they should have to run for election. Another model would have a sectoral Seanad representing interest groups, and in many ways that 1930s vocationalist system of the Seanad, which we now have, is supposed to achieve this through an administrative, labour, industrial and commercial panel. The idea is outmoded and one could ask where people like the self-employed or sole traders fit into that system. These are people who do not consider themselves to be part of a particular interest group but rather citizens who pay taxes and obey the law. They do not want to be put in some panel or section. Another model of reform would amount to a citizens' assembly, with people included by virtue of being part of some demographic group, whether they are young, old, or of a certain gender, ethnic background or sexual orientation. Such a citizens' assembly may have value in doing other things, but it would be wrong for a Parliament to include people just because of their demographic group or background rather than abilities or character. That would amount to equality by subgroup rather than equality of opportunity for an individual, which is what should be offered. Anybody who wants to run for Parliament should be allowed to do so and everybody should have one vote for a candidate. It should not matter what panel a candidate is on, what university he or she attended, or if the candidate went to university at all. The other reform models offer a so-called buffet option, or a Seanad made up of a bit of everything. That would be worst of all parts rather than the best. In fairness to Senators Quinn and Zappone, they have made a good effort to reform the Seanad, and it may be the best possible. It is also pretty flawed. They suggest that the Seanad should have a role in scrutinising statutory instruments or secondary legislation, a practice that this Oireachtas has been very poor at through the years. There is nothing to stop the Seanad doing it now, and if there is an interest, Standing Orders could be changed to allow them to scrutinise statutory instruments. There was a statutory instruments committee of the Seanad until 1981, but it stopped functioning for some reason. It has also been suggested that the Seanad could be used to scrutinise EU legislation, which is what a functioning EU committee of this Parliament should be doing anyway. The same logic applies to public appointments, which are already scrutinised by committees. The Senators wish to retain graduate seats, which is wrong, as we should not separate people with a degree from those with no degree. They also want to retain existing panels of culture and industry, as well as appointed Members. They also propose a degree of democratic quotas for outcomes, which is very different from quotas for candidates, which give people a clear choice. Deputy Ó Cuív mentioned the guillotine and I have never used this, to my recollection, in two and half years as a Minister. Nevertheless, it is sometimes required because a decision must be made against a certain timeframe, or sometimes people filibuster by tabling large numbers of amendments or speaking forever just to prevent a decision being made by elected Members of this House. That is why it is sometimes necessary to use the guillotine. The Deputy nonetheless makes a good argument about having a qualified majority to end a debate in that way or after a period, although that would not get around filibustering.It probably could be done through Standing Orders and not just by way of the Constitution, although I may be incorrect on that. The Deputy also spoke about the role of committees and I hope what he said is not true because it was a terrible indictment of Deputies and Senators. He said that roughly one third are poor attenders, one third are poor contributors, leaving the remaining third to do all the work at committee. That is not good enough. That is an argument for a better Dáil and better Deputies. One does not create an entire institution because one third of committee members are not turning up or one third are not doing a good job. That is not an argument at all for retaining the Seanad. That is an argument for having better Deputies and a properly reformed Dáil. We do not need the Seanad in that context.

I am not sure that I will need the extra time, but I might do. I had better watch my words given that we have been joined in the Chamber by two serving Senators.  I wish to commend the legislation to the House. It is based on a commitment that was given three or four years ago during the last general election campaign. Indeed, several different political parties gave a commitment to hold a referendum on the future of Seanad Éireann. I cannot understand the criticism of politicians for actually ensuring the referendum question they committed to is being put to the people. Deputy Ó Cuív, who has just left, spoke about the Taoiseach having a rush of blood to the head. His own party leader, Deputy Martin, must have had a rush of blood to the feet from the head because he fought the last election on the basis that a referendum should be held on the future of Seanad Éireann but he has now reversed engines on the matter. Deputy Ó Cuív also made an interesting point about the role of expertise and the appointment of experts to Cabinet. He was in Cabinet for many years, albeit not a very successful Cabinet which could have done with a lot of expertise but which did not appoint any experts. I thought Fianna Fáil fought the last election on the basis that it was going to establish a new system of government where people who were not elected but who were experts could be appointed to government. Now the Deputy is saying that this is being reversed or dropped and that the Seanad route should be used for the appointment of experts. Deputy Ó Cuív did not deal with the questions posed by Deputy Farrell with regard to the current composition of the Seanad. Deputy Ó Cuív's own famous ancestor was the main character behind the composition of Seanad Éireann in terms of the panel structure as it currently exists. Deputy Farrell spoke about Catholic teaching and socialism but I thought it was to do with corporatism, which might be more closely associated with national socialism rather than socialism. Deputy Ó Cuív did not take the opportunity to clarify what the thinking was at the time. Deputy Mitchell made a number of points with which I fully agree. I have a vested interest to some degree in that I was a Member of the other House for nine years. I can say, with my hand on my heart, that the current status quo that exists in terms of the operation of Seanad Éireann is not satisfactory. Equally, however, the current position with regard to the operation of Dáil Éireann and of local government, as Deputy Mitchell pointed out, is not satisfactory either. Having said that, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has at least made a start on reforming our local government system. He has ensured that when people go to vote in the local elections next year, there will not be some who have two votes in certain parts of the country, to elect two different local authorities, while others only have one vote. That is a change in the right direction. However, the situation that has emerged with the boundary changes, whereby some people could potentially live 50 or 60 miles from their local councillors because the electoral areas are geographically huge, is not satisfactory for local government either. We have this situation on the doorstep of Dublin, whereby half of County Wicklow is in a six-seat electoral area. A person could, in theory at least, live 30 or 40 miles away from his or her local councillor. Half of County Kerry is in one electoral area while more than half of County Carlow is in an eight-seat electoral area. A similar situation also applies in County Sligo as a result of the boundary changes. Therefore, while the reduction in duplication between local authorities is to be welcomed, the size of some local authority areas is not conducive to the effective and proper functioning of local democracy. Having said that, at least the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has taken a positive step in the right direction by removing the duplication. I agree with previous speakers who raised the issue of the electoral system for the Dáil. I note what, to me, is a glaring mistake by the Constitutional Convention, a body established by the Oireachtas to look at reform. The most recent discussions by the convention centred on electoral reform, the result of which was a statement to the effect that constituencies should be larger. I come from one of the largest constituencies in the country. I do not mean this disrespectfully when I say that it is one thing to be a Deputy from a Dublin constituency or one in the immediate hinterland of the capital because such constituencies are geographically small and easier to get around, but it is an entirely different matter being a Deputy for larger constituencies. A former member of this House, P.J. Sheehan, from west Cork, used to say, as a matter of fact, that by the time he reached Mitchelstown he was more than halfway to Dublin but he was still in County Cork. The notion that Dáil constituencies should be made bigger does not make sense from a personal point of view for those who want to get involved in politics. It also does not make sense from an administrative point of view, when it is plainly obvious that much of the effort made by members of political parties who are Members of this House often has more of an eye to the activities of their potential Dáil running mate or sitting constituency colleague rather than on serving their constituents or the best interests of the country. I have long advocated single-seat constituencies with a transferable vote. In that context, I really regret the fact that the Constitutional Convention made the dramatic mistake of not giving that serious consideration and, indeed, not adopting it to ensure we have a proper legislative body in this House. I welcome the fact that the people will make the decision on Seanad Éireann. I do not see any problem with the people making a decision in a referendum on the future of the Seanad. However, if the future is to be what exists at present or no Seanad at all, then abolition is the only route that should be taken, in my view. Over the past 60 or 70 years, 15 or 16 reports have been published on reform of the Seanad but there has never been any political appetite, from any side, to reform the structure of the Upper House. Another very obvious weakness in the arguments of those who oppose the referendum is the divergence of views as to what the role of the Seanad should be, its functions and how its Members should be elected. There is no point in having a Chamber that is just a mirror image of the Dáil. Many proposals that I have read seem to focus on that, but that would not serve any particular purpose. I echo the comments of Deputy Mitchell with regard to some of the piecemeal approaches that are being taken to the reform of our political system.It has not been acknowledged by the political system that the Houses of the Oireachtas, with the President excluded, have had a significant role in the economic difficulties the country has faced over the past five or six years. A much more clear-cut reform of local government as well as the Oireachtas needs to be considered. It is remarkable and worth pointing out that we are having a referendum on the abolition of the Seanad but one of the reasons for not reducing more the number of Deputies was that we could not have a referendum. I support the Bill.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	233	On this, the 100th anniversary of the great Dublin Lock-out of 1913, we salute the titanic struggles of the working class men and women of Dublin city and county against the barbarism inflicted on them, their families and communities through the agency of the ruthless capitalist forces of the day. An Irish capitalist class existed which saw no contradiction between on the one side Irish nationalism, support for Home Rule government and allegiance to Christianity in the form of the Catholic and Protestant religions and on the other side being responsible for keeping hundreds of thousands among the working class on the island of Ireland in abject poverty with slave wages and appalling living conditions. This Irish capitalist class, when workers stood up to demand justice, fair wages, better living conditions and a decent life, did not hesitate to use all its powerful armoury of political, judicial and police repression to ruthlessly and literally attempt to starve the workers into submission in order to maintain its profits and the power and privilege these profits guaranteed. To understand how criminal the capitalist exploitation was in 1913 we need only look at contemporary reports. A September 1913 parliamentary inquiry into housing conditions found 25,800 families were living in inner city tenements, and 20,100 families were each crammed into one room. With family size ranging from three or four to seven, eight or nine, we can only imagine the deprivation and cruelty involved. The same inquiry concluded that 60,200 people were living in dwellings "unfit for human habitation and incapable of being rendered fit for human habitation". These appalling conditions contributed to a very high death rate, with Dublin up there with some of the most economically depressed cities on Earth. This led the great socialist and key leader in the Lock-out struggle, James Connolly, to declare the high death rate in Dublin was in exact proportion to the class which the victims belong, falling with the wealth of the people and rising with their poverty. Sometimes death came to Dublin's poor with shocking abruptness when the rotting tenements in which they lived came crashing down, as happened on Tuesday, September 2, less than one week into the Lock-out. No. 66 Church Street collapsed, killing three adults and four children, showing how workers were oppressed from all sides. One of the victims was 17 year old Eugene Salmon who died trying to rescue his eight year old sister. That very day he had been sacked from Jacob's biscuit factory for refusing to resign his membership of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union. The rack-renting landlords responsible for atrocities such as this were an integral part of the Dublin business elite. They were represented prominently among the Judiciary and included Dublin's leading capitalists, among them William Martin Murphy who owned the Irish Independent and Evening Herald newspapers. Murphy of course controlled Dublin United Tramways Company which ran the key tramway system in Dublin and was a notorious exploiter of labour. The tramway workers' working day ranged from nine to 17 hours, with one day off in ten. These were oppressive working conditions with massive fines for minor infringements of the company rules and pay was lower than for the workers' counterparts in Britain. It was no wonder Big Jim Larkin, a great leader of the struggle in the Lock-out, described Murphy as "a creature who is living on the sweated victims who are compelled to slave for this modern capitalistic vampire". On Saturday 19 July, 1913 William Martin Murphy called a meeting of the tramworkers. He warned them against taking strike action, verbally parading his power, and asked "what chance would the men without funds have in a contest with the Company who could and would spend £100,000 or more". This was an enormous sum in those days. With great callousness he went on to declare, "the shareholders ... will have three meals a day ... I don’t know if the men who go out can count on this". This warning of depriving workers of their food was made brutally real during the Lock-out which Murphy orchestrated a month later when an attempt was made to starve the Dublin working class into submission. When Big Jim Larkin arrived in Belfast in 1907 this was the kind of worker exploitation he set out to redress, as did James Connolly when he returned from the United States in 1910 to join him. These men became heroic champions of the downtrodden working class. They had great energy, unending courage and masterly tactical abilities. Critically, they also had a socialist analysis of the economic and social system and set their tireless day to day work of trade union organisation in the context of an overall struggle for socialism which was, as they defined it, the expropriation of the exploiter's wealth and the re-organisation of society as a democratically-run socialist commonwealth where the needs of the majority superseded the greed of a very few. The new trade unionism extended by Larkin and Connolly, along with many great men and women whose names we do not know today, was correctly seen by Ireland's nationalistic capitalist bosses as a major threat. They looked forward to home rule to assume political control to match the economic power they already wielded. They quaked at the emergence of a new force onto the stage of history, the organised working class determined to secure their rights which threatened the profits of the employers, and the capitalist class saw a mortal threat to their plans to continue to dominate society in a home rule government. It was little wonder then that they set out to exterminate the threat. In the months that followed, with great cruelty they attempted to starve the working class of Dublin, not only the workers but their children also, in their determination to smash effective trade unionism.The effective trade unionism that particularly drove them to despair was the sympathetic strike action that had been developed with great effectiveness, leading to great results for workers in the preceding years, when workers in many different enterprises stood together in solidarity on the basis that an injury to one was the concern of all. During the Lock-out, all of the institutions of the capitalist establishment backed up the brutal onslaught on the workers of Dublin. As alluded to in the Socialist Party's motion, members of the Dublin Metropolitan Police, DMP, became the hired thugs for the employers. The judges, among whom were many capitalists, shareholders and rack-renting landlords, sent hundreds of workers to jail. The Catholic hierarchy and clergy denounced the struggles, its leaders and their socialist ideas. The Irish Independent and the Evening Herald, owned by Murphy, poured out a daily dose of bile and viciousness, attacking the working class struggle for justice and slandering and smearing Larkin in particular. The Irish Independent appeared as usual on Tuesday, 2 September 1913, three days after James Nolan and John Byrne were killed by a brutal baton charge on Eden Quay by the police and two days after hundreds of workers were brutally beaten on the streets of Dublin on Bloody Sunday and another worker, John McDonogh, was murdered in his home by the police. On Tuesday, 2 September, a tenement building collapsed on Church Street, yet we find in the Irish Independent not a denunciation of rack-renting landlords and exploitation or a diatribe against the police violence, but a diatribe against the struggling workers. Denouncing the sympathetic strike, the article reads:Was ever grosser tyranny attempted to be set up in the name of freedom of combination? Yet this is what Larkinism means and stands for... It is this attempt at despotism that the Tramway Company, Independent Newspapers, Messrs. Shackleton of Lucan, Messrs. Jacob and others are now out to overturn and destroy... It is infinitely better for Dublin and the prosperity of trade and its too few industries that whatever suffering and loss may be involved should be endured for a few weeks at most than that the city should be left helpless in the toils of Larkinism for an indefinite term of years.The Lock-out ended in 1914 in difficult circumstances for the working class of Dublin. It could have been won had the magnificent solidarity of the British working class been embraced by the leaders of the British Trade Union Congress and action taken on their behalf. It stands as a lasting monument to the people who fought and the gains that came as a result in terms of workers' rights and trade union rights. The anniversary of 1913 will be commemorated by leaders of ICTU and the Labour Party, but the latter dishonours and shames the heroes of 1913. Only a few weeks ago, the Labour Party pushed through the Dáil a Bill threatening to slash public workers' wages and conditions unless they accepted in a ballot slightly less onerous but equally repugnant cuts. How reminiscent this was of the methods of William Martin Murphy in demanding the signatures of workers to disavow the ITGWU or be sacked. The Labour Party in government drives the austerity agenda with Fine Gael. Attacks on workers' living standards and conditions and public services are at the diktat of the dictatorship of the financial markets, the same vulture capitalists, bondholders and big financiers denounced by Connolly and Larkin as the origin of the suffering of workers in their day. Their profiteering caused the financial crash, yet it is now on the backs of the working class, with the connivance of the Labour Party in a Fine Gael-dominated Government. Pathetic excuses cut no ice. There is an alternative: to mobilise the power of working people in opposition to this dreadful austerity. Build a monument to the heroes of 1913 by campaigning for a socialist alternative. Taking major wealth, finance and major industry into public ownership and putting them under democratic control is what socialism means and is what is needed. Unfortunately, ICTU's leaders - with one or two honourable exceptions - also capitulated utterly to the austerity agenda, equally shaming the men and women of 1913. A fitting tribute to that massive struggle, those who pursued it and those who suffered for justice would be to pass a trade union recognition Bill this year, releasing the chains that deliberately make it difficult to organise effective strike action. Resources should be provided to industrial relations machinery, such as the Employment Appeals Tribunal, so that disputes might be heard immediately. As a particular monument, we should also assist communities and bona fide groups in marking and bringing alive the events of 1913 in Dublin with educational and commemorative events. We should have a memorial to the five workers killed - James Nolan, John Byrne, John McDonogh, James Byrne and 16-year-old Alice Brady, a Jacob's worker who was shot by a scab. We need a fitting monument to the heroism and importance of this seminal event in the history of the Irish working class. Above all, we need a fighting response to the disastrous strategy of austerity and a mobilisation of the significant power of working class people to overturn it and to achieve a democratic and socialist strategy instead.

One hundred years on, the attitude of Dublin employers and William Martin Murphy in particular are alive and well among the Irish boss class. Earlier this year in my constituency, ten workers of the Gleeson Group were sacked from the company's distribution centre in Ballyfermot for joining SIPTU. The boss got wind of their joining and sent his middle management to ask all of the workers clocking in that morning whether they had joined the union. The ten who had were made redundant practically the following day. The Gleeson Group is not a small company led by a maverick employer. The company, which employed 750 people at that time, distributes Tipperary Water and Gilbeys Wines and made a profit of just under €5 million last year. The owner, Pat Cooney, threatened to sack half of his workforce in a depot in Borrisoleigh two years earlier when a group of workers joined a union. One of the drivers who joined the union was replaced by an agency driver the day after he was made redundant. Agency workers earn €80 per day and can be taken on and let go at will. This is not an unusual case in the private sector, where employers maintain a non-union core workforce and casualise the rest of the workers at much lower rates. The 2009 figures on union density showed that only one third of workers were unionised, including 20% of part-time workers. It is clear that there would be higher levels of union membership if workers were not afraid to join unions and were confident that the trade union movement would fight for them. Last week, ICTU formally requested the assistance of the International Labour Organisation, ILO, in ensuring that the Irish Government made good on its commitment to the ILO and under its programme for Government to introduce legislation to give workers the right to bargain collectively with employers through trade unions. The ILO is the UN's agency for labour affairs. Ireland is a member of it and is subject to its rules and regulations. As usual, the Government's amendment is to delete all words after "Dáil Éireann". The text to be substituted includes the following: "a phase of consultation with key stakeholders in the context of the Government's commitment in its Programme for Government to reform the current law on employees' right...". If this is the case, why did ICTU need to ask the ILO last week to force the Government to act on the basic right of trade union recognition?In 2011, congress submitted a formal complaint to the ILO about the lack of legal effect to the right of collective bargaining in Ireland. In response the Government gave a commitment to conduct an independent inquiry, as requested by the ILO. This has just finished, but there has been nothing on this issue since May. More worrying is the statement from the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, to an employers' conference on 12 June in which he stated there is no plan for mandatory trade unions and collective bargaining will always remain voluntary. What is going on? It would appear the Fine Gael wing of this Government will stand over the Supreme Court ruling that although there is a right to join a trade union there is also a right on the part of employers not to recognise the union. Although they fully support the need for legislation as sought by ICTU, unions need to be much more proactive and militant. They should not merely ask for this right, hoping that the Labour Party will not break yet another promise. They should draw on the lessons of 1913 and agitate and organise trade union rights for workers. Trade unions fought for rights for unskilled workers under the leadership of Connolly and Larkin. That is the historical lesson they left behind - try to organise through solidarity action and fight for those rights rather than meekly request them. That is crucial. Although the fall in trade union density is a result of aggressive, anti-union bosses' policy, it is also the consequence of 30 years of social partnership. This has undermined democracy in the unions and control over those unions by their members, and has decreased shop steward activity even where workers are organised. During the recent debate on the so-called financial emergency Bill in respect of public sector workers the point was made by a long-standing trade union member that it was a legislative lock-out, 100 years on from the General Lock-out.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	236	I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak in this Private Members' debate on the 1913 Lock-out and workers' rights in Ireland of 2013. I thank and commend my colleague, Deputy Joe Higgins, for introducing this motion and this debate. It is an important debate as it allows all of us time to remember the men and women of 1913 and their great struggle and also shows how we can learn from the experiences of history. James Connolly and James Larkin should also be remembered, and the huge sacrifices they made for the people of this island. Some will say we have come a long way and in many ways we have. However, the vision and experience of the struggle should also be a reminder that in Ireland of 2013 - the world of 2013 - we must still fight, not only for the 400,000 people unemployed and those living in poverty but also for those on low wages. Tonight's motion is about the vision and leadership mentioned in the text of the motion. It is also about the rights of workers, disabled people, the carers and people struggling with mortgages and on low incomes. Connolly and Larkin would be horrified by the Ireland of today where so many people are suffering amid all the wealth around us. It is an honour for me, as a former branch secretary of Dublin City North INTO, and a former delegate to the Dublin Council of Trade Unions, to address this Dáil. These organisations have played a major role in Irish society and in creating activists and leaders in the trade union movement. Many of those activists have been elected to this Oireachtas which is a great privilege and honour. When I heard the motion would be about the 1913 Lock-out I wanted to mention one person in particular. I immediately remembered my late colleague, former Deputy Tony Gregory, who was also very proud of his own local history, in particular that of Dublin's north inner city. I wish to pay tribute to and commend him. I have fond memories of Tony being part of the celebrations in the city when he used to dress up in his Irish Citizen Army uniform, and the great fun and enjoyment he got from that. That was a tradition carried out in the inner city which links into tonight's motion. I know my colleague, Deputy Higgins, will also be aware of this. In 2013 the ethos driving the bailout of the financial market system and the austerity agenda is exactly the same as the one that drove the Dublin employers of 1913, namely, the protection of power for profit and the profit system. The Labour Party, which came into being as a result of workers' struggles in the years preceding 1913, is guilty of abject betrayal in driving the austerity agenda, at enormous cost to working people, the unemployed, pensioners and the poor. We should look closely at what is going on in Ireland in 2013, where the expenditure of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in direct assistance to households has increased by 56% between 2008 and 2011. In 2011, the society spent more than €22 million on food and cash assistance. More than €10 million was spent on helping households with their energy costs, those who were let down by the State and broader society. Those who were least well off before the economic crisis remain the same. Their struggles have worsened due to cutbacks in the support and services on which they rely. Those who have lost jobs, had business failures, have seen significant falls in their income or are affected by over-indebtedness require short and medium-term to longer-term support to ensure they are prevented from falling into long-term unemployment and poverty. The cumulative impact of austerity measures to date on individual families and communities has been devastating. I strongly oppose any further reduction in social expenditure because the people we assist, those who are struggling in Ireland, have suffered enough. I strongly support the motion. Let us remember the men and women of the 1913 Lock-out and James Connolly and James Larkin. Let us also remember the late and great Tony Gregory. Let us remind ourselves we all have a duty to stand up for the men and women of no property in 2013.
#PatrickNulty	unknown-#PatrickNulty-party	unknown-#PatrickNulty-dob	unknown-#PatrickNulty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	237	I commend my constituency colleague in Dublin West, Deputy Joe Higgins, on tabling this motion. One hundred years ago Dublin was a place of poverty. There was a housing crisis and malnutrition and overcrowding were the daily reality. The State did little or nothing to alleviate the conditions for workers. This year we recall that struggle in 1913 where Irish trade unionists and workers commemorate the courage and vision of working people in that year, at a time when again we face a crisis and a difficult challenge. A full 100 years on from the 1913 Lock-out, austerity policies are hitting the poorest and most vulnerable hardest. There are renewed and sustained attacks on workers. Their right to collective bargaining through a trade union is still not recognised. In that context, I ask the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, when Ireland will ratify the convention to protect domestic workers, something it still fails to do. Will he remind his colleagues at the Cabinet table that Ireland has given a commitment to legislate to give effect to the European Court of Human Right's ruling on the right to collective bargaining through a trade union? This is set out clearly in the programme for Government but several times when I have raised this matter with the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste on the Order of Business, the response I have been given was a mixture of lack of interest and flippancy about an essential piece of industrial relations legislation required in this country. Where does the Government stand on the commitments given to the International Labour Organisation which is meeting this week, attended by ICTU vice-president John Douglas and others? It has committed that Ireland will bring its laws in line with the ILO conventions and will not continue to undermine the conditions of workers. Let us examine the context of modern Ireland. Although many things have changed in our society during the past 100 years, regrettably the deep-rooted inequalities remain. In 2011 Crédit Suisse showed that the richest 1% in our society owns more than 25% of our nation's wealth and the richest 10% owns more than 60%. Income distribution has become more unequal than it was in 1980. Social Justice Ireland notes that since 2008, 100,000 more of our fellow citizens are at risk of poverty. Housing waiting lists have soared to a point where almost 100,000 households are waiting for homes, while in 2008 the number was only 56,000. Why is there no attempt to have a stimulus plan to build and provide social housing for people? Any public representative in this House knows there is a crisis in housing need in this country but the political establishment refuses even to acknowledge or debate this.Some 78% of people waiting for social housing have incomes of less than €15,000 per annum. One in four of our fellow citizens has literacy difficulties, compared to just 3% in Sweden. Let us not forget the shameful abolition of the Combat Poverty Agency by the previous Fianna Fáil Administration in order to prevent analysis and discussion about poverty and inequality. The motion uses the language of betrayal. I prefer to use a different type of language because I believe in the politics of persuasion. A more equal society is in the interest of everybody and we can convince everybody to support progressive policies. I am reminded of the words of Martin Luther King, who said: "Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred." No progressive Member of this House has a mandate to cut child benefit, respite care grants, the fuel allowance, maternity leave or the Sunday premium for security and other workers. Where were these policies in the election manifestos? The former British Labour Party MP, Tony Benn, said: It's the same each time with progress. First they ignore you, then they say you're mad, then dangerous, then there's a pause and then you can't find anyone who disagrees with you.This Government has a majority in this House. Fine Gael and those who support it will defeat this motion, just as they defeated many progressive proposals. Let us be clear, however, that despite five years of austerity, working people will not be defeated. The last word has not been spoken. Things will change and we will continue to fight relentlessly for an Ireland of equals, based on the principles of progressive democratic socialism. That is the mandate I was given by the people and I will continue to represent them in this way until we overcome the obstacles to building a society based on equality and justice. I support the motion.
#LukeMingFlanagan	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-party	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-dob	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	238	I thank Deputy Joe Higgins for an excellent motion, which I will be supporting. The 1913 Lock-out achieved something massive by establishing that ordinary people have power if they flex their muscles. They still have this power. It also established that the media, if left unchecked, can act as an instrument that destroys democracy and the people’s right to choose their own leaders. The same muscle that was used by unions over the decades with varying degrees of success became atrophied during the so-called Celtic tiger period or disaster. When this muscle needed to be flexed once again after the collapse of the economy, unfortunately it had become limp, like an arm taken out of plaster of Paris, when it should have been ready. One of the reasons we are told the unions did not take the radical action for which they had a mandate is that of the risks involved. For example, an ICTU conference mandated a mortgage strike but it was seen as too risky. The people of 1913 took risks that were bigger than losing the right to go to the cinema for a month. They lost the food from their mouths and they went through hellish pain to leave behind their legacy. Some might say they did not win in the end but they established something. The most important thing to remember is that it is sometimes necessary to go through pain and to take risks to change things. I am critical of the unions because they have the ability and people power to bring change if they want to do so. I credit the INMO for showing more resolve than many unions since the collapse of our economy. When in 2011 it passed a motion calling for a mortgage strike, which was then brought to ICTU, it presented an opportunity to consider workers’ rights from a different angle in terms of the money going out in debt as well as that coming in. If that idea had been pursued it would have saved us significant hardship because we will end up in a big hole anyway. We will have to make big decisions of this nature. If unions had used their firepower and acted as bravely as the people of 1913, we would not be in our present hole. Regardless of how we dress it up, we are in the middle of a new lock-out. People are being locked out of basic services because of the banking debts. Hundreds of thousands of people could have been mobilised fairly easily because they are union members. However, the unions failed to act. People would have had more money in their pockets because they would not be paying crazy mortgage payments. We would have fought the ECB and the Government could have claimed these terrible people were forcing its hand in calling for the debt to be written down. That can still be done and it has to be done. When one thinks of the power these unions could show if they wanted to flex their muscles, it is sad that a little group from Ballyhea that is growing all the time can have a greater impact and has not yet given up. Why do the union leaders not show similar bravery? One would have to suspect they are too comfortable. Surely their ideas cannot change that much, from pegging stones at pickets to being union leaders who no longer give a damn. People need to learn something from what happened back then. There are times when we have to take a risk. What risks are the unions taking anymore? People are going through hell. Things are so bad that people cannot get into a mental hospital when they are on the verge of suicide. I was told to go away.

It offers a very selective reading of history, as does the majority of Deputy Joe Higgins's interventions. The motion suggests that the Catholic Church was against the workers in 1913 when since 1891 it had expressly condemned the misery and wretchedness pressing unjustly on the majority of the working class. The church supported the right of labour to form unions, rejected communism and unrestricted capitalism and affirmed the right to private property. In delivering the keynote address at a conference celebrating the centenary of the 1913 Lock-out last Saturday, President Higgins, who has a huge mandate from the people, stated that it shone a light on Dublin that could never again be denied. The conference reflected on the years from 1912 to 1923, a decade of war and revolution in Ireland. I support much of what my colleague, Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan, has said about unions and rights. Unions have abandoned the ordinary people. They got cosy with the last Government, IBEC, the IFA and many others, and forgot about the ordinary people. As an employer, I respect workers. I wonder how many more employers are in the House other than the Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Perry. It is a two-way street. I do not agree with some of the shenanigans that are happening. I recently received a letter from a businessman in my own county whose father had been in business for 50 years. He complained about the way some employees submit claims to rights commissioners under employment legislation. The vast majority of employees work diligently to create a living for themselves and to support their families and the companies for which they work. Complaints about the working time directive, payment of minimum wages, unfair dismissals and racial discrimination have become a charade. I will not name the individual who takes most of the cases but he is a solicitor on College Green. He threatens people and then he goes to the employers in advance of the court case offering to settle for €7,500. This is the position in which we have found ourselves. It is outrageous that good employers are being extorted by employees. Claimants can make whatever allegations they wish at the various hearings and the onus is on the employer to prove them wrong. We find ourselves in this sad and despicable position 100 years after the founding of our so-called democracy and the establishment of so-called union rights.  I salute employees and employers but not those who wish to milk the system and try to create havoc by accusing employers of all types of things. These employees leave others to pick up the pieces when gardaí and ordinary people are attacked by Éirígí outside the gates. We need balance because the current situation is appalling.  Small employees are being treated in the same manner as factory workers. While clocking in and out is not a problem if one works in a factory where it is easy to maintain records relating to breaks, hours worked and so forth, this is not an easy task for a haulage company with 50 international, long-haul drivers who all start and finish work at different times and deliver different payloads. It is not simple to have one system covering all types of company. It is compulsory for all articulated lorry drivers to complete certificate of professional competence, CPC, courses annually. These courses are supposed to educate drivers on all aspects of the haulage industry. My constituent, in his letter, states that his company has been asked at Labour Court hearings to demonstrate that a driver was told to take a break after four and a half hours and was informed when his break was over. The company has also been asked if it has informed drivers that they must receive 24 hours' notice of routes. It is not possible to do this in business. The Labour Court thinks nothing of handing out compensation awards of up to €10,000, some of them to people who may have been in employment in this country for only six months.

I support my employees and my record can be judged by everyone, but reason must prevail. Employees in the company to which I refer have abandoned loads and walked away, leaving the company to cover the significant cost of recovering vehicles and causing a great deal of grief to customers. The company does not have recourse to recover the costs other than to go to court and run the risk, even if it were to win, of not being paid. My constituent states that some, albeit not all, employees breach their contracts of employment on a regular basis, yet the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission are not interested. The company has been told on a number of occasions that these are civil matters. As everyone knows, civil matters generate even more costs.  The country is experiencing difficult times. I do not agree with much that the Government is doing. We need to strike a balance, because we have moved too far in one direction. The National Employment Rights Authority and many other agencies are sending legions of staff out to companies to persecute, frighten and upset employers. Most employers have a good relationship with their staff. While the events of 1913 were wrong, it is also wrong to make the accusations Deputy Higgins has made. I will vote against the motion.

The Dublin Lock-out began on 26 August 1913 when all the trams on O'Connell Street stopped as workers sought pay rises ranging from one to two shillings a week. In response, the Dublin Tramway Company locked out members of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union who refused to sign a pledge to leave the union. A general strike was called and, in the disputes that followed, more than 20,000 workers were either locked out of their jobs by their employers or went on strike. In saying that, it is important to recall that not all employers took part in the Lock-out and some still have a major presence in the city. The Lock-out continued for six months, with the strikers and their families suffering ever-increasing hardship, despite assistance from trade unions and charitable institutions. By early 1914 the Lock-out wound down as their worsening personal circumstances forced the strikers back to work. While the Lock-out was seen by some at the time as a defeat for the trade union movement, history has shown that it set in train events that led to the improvement and protection of working standards. The 1913 Lock-out will be the subject of a programme of major events supported by the State in co-operation with many organisations, including Dublin City Council, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and the national cultural institutions, universities and vocational education committees. While many of these events are still being finalised, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, has indicated he has provided funding to The Irish Times to facilitate the production this year of a special edition supplement on the Lock-out, a copy of which will be provided by the Minister to every school. I will now address the Government's record on the economy and workers' rights. On its election, the Government was faced with an unprecedented economic crisis domestically, including an unemployment rate of more than 15%. The economy had endured three consecutive years of negative growth, more than 250,000 people had lost their jobs and the unemployment rate was at a level not seen since the mid-1980s. The banking system was teetering on the edge of collapse and we were locked out of international bond markets. We had recently obtained the EU-IMF bailout, an appalling scenario never before experienced by this country. Faced with this, the Government had a very clear idea of what needed to be done. We needed to reinvent and rebuild the economy, exit the bailout and get people back to work. Such a catastrophe was always going to be extremely challenging and people had to take difficult decisions. However, the results of these decisions are becoming apparent. The economy has returned to consistent growth and is predicted to grow steadily next year and thereafter. Private sector employment levels have grown by an average of 2,000 per month since the first Action Plan for Jobs was launched, notably in some sectors of the domestic economy. The unemployment rate is below 14% for the first time in three years and is predicted to decline further as the domestic economy begins to recover. I remind Deputies that in the three years before the previous general election, 7,000 people on average lost their jobs every month. Ireland is now ranked by independent studies as the second most attractive country globally for foreign direct investment, which continues to deliver benefits for the economy.  The Government is also working hard to correct the public finances. Long-term Government bond yields now stand at less than 4%, down from 14% not long ago. Moreover, the bailout agreement has been renegotiated to reduce its cost, which will save approximately €9 billion in repayments. The promissory notes have been eliminated and we have cut our borrowing requirements by €20 billion over the next ten years. We are also on track to leave the bailout by the end of the year.  Despite the macroeconomic gains hard won over the past two years, it is perfectly understandable that people believe the burden is weighing heavily and the road is too long. Having achieved stability, the Government is now focused on measures that will return appreciable growth to the economy. It is these that will ultimately bring a lasting easing of the financial burden being experienced by so many. To do this, we must continue working to bring our national finances under control; work out the legacy of personal and mortgage debt; do everything we can to create more and more jobs; and make Ireland the best country in the world in which to do business by 2016, in line with the mantra of the Taoiseach.  The Government's annual Action Plan for Jobs is a firm focus for the Government in driving this recovery. Last year, 92% of the 270 actions designed to make it easier for employers to protect and create jobs were implemented. The plan for this year continues the targeted approach for our industrial policy in encouraging key clusters and sectors and we have implemented strategies in the areas of manufacturing, cloud computing, health care and life sciences. The agrifood sector, with which I am most familiar, is an integral element of the Government's 2012 Action Plan for Jobs. The Food Harvest 2020 strategy has the capacity to deliver an additional 25,000 jobs if we meet the targets set out in the plan. Achieving these objectives is my priority as the chairman of the Food Harvest 2020 implementation committee. The protection for vulnerable workers is particularly important during a recession. While job creation is our primary focus, the Government has also been very active in protecting the lowest paid, the most vulnerable workers in the economy. One of the first decisions taken by the Government was to reverse the cut of €1 per hour in the national minimum wage that had been introduced by the previous Government in January 2011. In addition, the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 provided for a series of reforms aimed at transforming our statutory wage setting mechanisms - REAs and JLCs - modernising them and making them fit for purpose. As Deputies will be aware, a recent Supreme Court judgment held that Part III of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 - the legislation providing for the registration of collective agreements - was invalid. This is a significant judgment which has raised a number of important questions, including possible implications for the 2012 Act. In this regard the Minister, Deputy Bruton, has sought legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General on the various issues arising. The Government intends to conclude its considerations of the implications of the Supreme Court decision as matter of urgency with a view to providing a constitutionally robust legislative framework in this area in the not too distant future. It is just over a year since the Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Act 2012 came into force. With the exception of pay, the provisions of the Act came into effect on 16 May 2012. The Act applies the principle of equal treatment in terms of basic working and employment conditions for agency workers as applies to employees recruited directly by the hirer to do the same or a similar job. Regarding workplace relations reform, in 2011 the Government inherited a complex system dealing with enforcement of employment rights that was no longer fit for purpose. It was frustrating for employers, employees and professionals representing them. There were real issues involved including long delays, a confusing array of methods to process cases, an overlap of functions between the bodies and different appeal avenues for elements of the same case. Substantial progress has already been made in reforming the system, including a new single workplace relations customer service portal which is now fully operational. A new workplace relations interim website is now in place, a single complaint form that deals with over 100 first instance complaints has replaced the 30 forms previously in use and complaints are now acknowledged and employers notified, on average, within five working days;. The next major step in this reform programme is to establish a two-tier workplace relations structure where two statutory independent bodies will replace the current five. We will have a new single body to be called the workplace relations commission and a separate appeals body, which will effectively be an expanded Labour Court. While considerable progress has been achieved to date, completing the proposed reform requires legislation. The Government is committed to enactment of the legislation at an early date, with a view to having the proposed new structures in place from 2014. Social dialogue continues to play a critical role in policy making and in the management of the Irish economy at what is a very difficult time for many citizens. This has been evident in addressing public sector pay. The Government has sought to deliver the necessary savings by agreement and this has been the basis for engagement with public service unions over recent months. I hope this process will be successfully concluded. A number of unions have been balloting in recent days. It has been the consistent policy of successive Governments to promote collective bargaining through the development of an institutional framework supportive of a voluntary system of industrial relations. In the context of the programme for Government commitment, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, has written to all social dialogue actors about reviewing collective bargaining against the backdrop of industrial relations legislation. Submissions have been received and discussions have been taking place between stakeholders' representatives and departmental officials. The Minister expects to be in a position to conclude this consultation shortly and to report to Government in the autumn on the outcome of that process and what proposals to improve the system of industrial relations might be brought forward in 2013. In this context, I am certain that satisfactory arrangements can be put in place that will reconcile Ireland's constitutional, social and economic traditions, and international obligations, while at the same time ensuring continued success in building Ireland's domestic jobs base and in attracting overseas investment into the economy. The Government has had to make many hard choices in putting this country back on track and our work is far from done yet. It has negotiated - and will continue to negotiate - constructively with the trade unions, most of which know that sometimes it is necessary to take a step back in order to preserve the long-term interests of their members. Hard choices are a part of leadership the Government has shown. We have some way to go before we see full economic recovery but I am confident we are on the right road and are doing what is best in the interests of our country and our people. I thank the Deputies opposite for tabling the motion. The Government will not support it and has tabled an amendment which is self-explanatory. It has provide me with the opportunity to outline in some detail, on behalf of the Government, what the Government is doing in not just talking about workers' rights but also introducing the reform and modernisation needed to balance workers' rights with the need to create a competitive environment in which to set up, do and grow business in Ireland and out of Ireland. The Government is achieving that balance and the evidence is there in terms of meeting job creation targets, but we have a long way to go. The Government is only half way through its term. We have considerable reform to introduce in this area as well as in many other areas. We will continue on that reform agenda for the next two years and at the end of that process I hope we can be judged as a Government that has reversed the fortunes of Ireland - an Ireland that was collapsing when we took over but an Ireland that will be growing and expanding in a way that respects both workers and employers, and puts a legislative framework in place to back that up by the time we go to the country in two and a half years.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	251	Ireland has a comprehensive and strong corpus of current employment rights legislation. The evolution of the main elements of labour law relating to employment rights, employment protection and non-discrimination, reflects a strong focus on the enactment of legislation based on clearly identified needs at national level and arising from wider European developments. In the formulation of labour law there has been a clear policy focus aimed at finding the appropriate balance between the security which employees require in terms of working and employment conditions, and the flexibility required by employers in terms of organisation of work, work practices and the mobility of the workforce. Despite very challenging circumstances, the past two years have seen the introduction of a generation's worth of landmark reforms in the labour affairs area. We have initiated the most significant reform in the history of the State of the workplace relations machinery for the vindication of individual employee rights; levelled the playing field for agency workers by bringing their wages into line with their full-time counterparts; enacted the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 after the High Court found employment regulation orders to be unconstitutional; renegotiated the EU-IMF agreement and restored the minimum wage to protect vulnerable workers; and concluded the first round of consultations with stakeholders in line with the programme for Government commitment in the area of collective bargaining. Through all these reforms, though some are contentious and the Government took criticism from all sides, at all times our focus was clear and consistent.The Government has been determined to strike the right balance between protecting vulnerable workers and providing reforms that would make the systems more responsive and more flexible to allow for the creation of jobs. Anyway, there is more to be done. In the judgment, delivered on 9 May last, the Supreme Court held that Part III of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 was invalid having regard to Article 15.2.1° of the Constitution. The article provides, in effect, that the exclusive power to make laws is vested in the Oireachtas. The Supreme Court took the view that registered employment agreements were instruments having the status of laws made by private individuals subject only to a limited power of veto by a subordinate body. While the Constitution allows for the limited delegation of lawmaking functions, the provisions of the 1946 Act went beyond what is permissible under the Constitution. The effect of the decision is to invalidate the registration of employment agreements previously registered under Part III of the 1946 Act. This was a significant judgment that requires careful consideration having regard to the amendments to the 1946 Act contained in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 as well. The Attorney General has been asked to supply advice on potential implications of the judgment for the 1946 Act as amended by the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012. The Government intends to conclude its considerations of the implications of the Supreme Court decision as a matter of urgency with a view to providing a constitutionally robust legislative framework in this area. I am mindful in particular of the significance of the issue of collective bargaining in the context of the centenary of the 1913 Lock-out. It has been the consistent policy of successive Governments to promote collective bargaining through the laws of the country and through the development of an institutional framework supportive of a voluntary system of industrial relations, premised upon freedom of contract and freedom of association. There is an extensive range of statutory provisions designed to back up the voluntary bargaining process. The freedom of association and the right to organise and bargain collectively are also guaranteed in several international instruments which the State has ratified and which it is, therefore, bound to uphold under international law. The 2007 decision of the Supreme Court in the Ryanair case cast doubt on the mechanism that had been established in the industrial relations Acts of 2001 and 2004 to resolve problems between employers and workers on employee representation issues in cases where that could not be done through existing procedures. Prior to the outcome of the Ryanair Supreme Court case, the original legislative arrangements had been seen as a workable compromise. The legislative model for resolving issues relating to employee representation had reflected a shared commitment that, where negotiating arrangements are in place, the most effective means of resolving differences that arise between employers and trade unions representing employees is by voluntary collective bargaining. In the absence of a practice of voluntary collective bargaining, subject to agreed qualifying criteria, the industrial relations Acts from 2001 and 2004 provided a mechanism by which the fairness of the employment conditions of workers in their totality could be assessed. In a related issue, in 2012 the committee on freedom of association of the International Labour Organisation issued several recommendations arising from a complaint referred to it by ICTU and IMPACT. It arose as a direct result of the Supreme Court judgment in the Ryanair case. In its findings, the ILO committee did not uphold these complaints but made several recommendations to the Government. I welcome the fact that the ILO report did not find Ireland to be in breach of its obligations under ILO conventions in respect of collective bargaining rights. Further, I note that the ILO did not find that a resolution of the difficulties arising from the Ryanair judgment would require the introduction of a legal regime of mandatory trade union recognition. Rather it referred to promoting machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers' and workers' organisations for the determination of terms and conditions of employment. There is a commitment in the programme for Government to ensure that Irish law on the rights of employees to engage in collective bargaining is consistent with recent judgments of the European Court of Human Rights and, to this end, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, recently concluded a first round of consultations to hear the views of employers and trade unions on the matter. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, expects to be in a position to come forward with proposals to reform the law, as appropriate, during 2013. I am certain that satisfactory arrangements can be put in place which are suited to our constitutional, social and economic traditions as well as to our international obligations. I am also convinced that they can be framed to ensure continued success in attracting investment to our economy. Social dialogue continues to play a critical role in policy making and in the management of the Irish economy at what is a difficult time for the majority of citizens. I was heartened to hear that when the director general of the ILO was in Dublin last February he commented during his visit that he had seen at first hand that social dialogue in Ireland was very much alive. The Government values dialogue with the key representatives of civil society and recognises the contribution that social dialogue makes in maximising common understanding of the challenges facing all sectors of society. In addition, regular contact takes place on issues of concern through bilateral contacts or consultation structures across Departments. Extensive discussions and consultations have taken place and in some instances are still ongoing. One recent and significant example of how social dialogue is helping to address Ireland's priority needs is in addressing the public sector pay bill. The Government has sought to deliver the necessary savings by agreement and this has been the basis for engagement with public service unions in recent months. If accepted, the agreement will deliver an unprecedented increase in productivity throughout the Irish public service and a range of other efficiency and reform measures. Therefore, the value of the potential agreement to the country at this time is most significant and I acknowledge the efforts of all those currently involved in this crucial effort to deliver industrial peace in the public service at a critical time on our path to economic recovery. Beyond the public sector, IBEC and ICTU have agreed two national protocols for the orderly conduct of industrial relations and local bargaining in the private sector and I salute them in their efforts. As I have already noted, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, has been engaged in consultations with employers and trade unions in terms of reviewing collective bargaining against the backdrop of industrial relations legislation. We are all aware of the scale of the jobs challenge facing Ireland and the global economy at present. Behind every job that has been lost there are families and businesses struggling to cope with the impact of the downturn. That is not what we want for the economy or for society. That is why in Ireland the Government has put the jobs and growth strategy centre stage and made job creation its key priority. However, transforming the economy is not only a matter for central Government. The Government recognises that local government, local businesses and local communities all have a part to play in supporting our companies, encouraging growth and gaining competitive advantage while maintaining and creating jobs. The Government has put in place the Action Plan for Jobs with the dual mandate of encouraging growth and creating and maintaining jobs in our economy. The intention is to transform the Irish economy from a failed system that was based on property, banking and debt to an economy built on supporting enterprise, building new export markets, creating access to finance for small business, improving competitiveness, driving innovation and growing successful businesses to win new markets. The Action Plan for Jobs has the stated aim of making Ireland the best small country in the world in which to do business. The Action Plan for Jobs does not purport to be a silver bullet to change our economic fortunes overnight. Rather, it is about getting to transform how we support businesses one by one to make Ireland a better place in which to do business. The Action Plan for Jobs is a national plan but its effects will be felt throughout the regions. The focus on SMEs in particular can help employment growth in all regions. One year into the Action Plan for Jobs process, we can see evidence that the strategy and architecture are working. There were 270 individual actions committed to last year to improve the operating environment for businesses, provide an impetus for emerging sectors, support export growth and remove barriers to employment creation. More than 90% of these actions were completed during 2012. More important, there has been a stabilisation in job numbers in the past six months. The quarterly national household survey for quarter 4 of 2012 showed the first annual increase in employment since the middle of 2008. Let us compare that to the 250,000 private jobs lost in the three years before this Government took office. Enterprise Ireland and IDA client companies created almost 10,000 net jobs between them last year through their focus on enterprise, innovation and exporting. This was the best performance of the agency client companies in many years.
#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	252	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this Private Members' motion which, I believe, is a shameless attempt to hijack the 100th anniversary of the 1913 Lock-out to promote a range of agendas as colourful and meaningless as the Technical Group collective. The 1913 Lock-out has an honourable place in Irish history and the terrible events of that tumultuous period undoubtedly influenced and shaped the Ireland that evolved in the subsequent years and up to today. When I think of that period I think of people like Paddy Hogan, a Labour Party Deputy from County Clare who was involved in the initial setup of trade unionism in Clare at the beginning of the 20th century.As a young man he joined the Gaelic League and the Irish Volunteers and was involved in the 1913 strike. He was arrested and jailed before being deported to England. Returning home, Paddy Hogan fought for union recognition in Clare and continued to fight for union recognition throughout his life, particularly at Shannon Airport following its establishment. He was a major contributor to the Irish Worker Union publication in 1913 and was acknowledged as a major strategist for the union in the republication of the magazine earlier this year. When the Ennis United Labourers Union was brought into the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, ITGWU, in 1919 Paddy Hogan demonstrated his leadership and pragmatism. He favoured rights of workers over the ego of the individual and he favoured amalgamation with larger unions. He continued to support trade union amalgamation throughout his life. That is not something that would be supported by the proponents of tonight’s motion who would instead prefer to see the splintering of the trade union movement, the weakening of congress and with it the weakening of workers’ ability across this State to bargain their labour against powerful economic forces. Those economic forces are stronger now even than they were 100 years ago due to the globalised world in which all nations, with the possible exception of North Korea, must operate. While I appreciate that the ideological purity of North Korea, if not the downright misery of the place, might appeal to Deputy Higgins it is not a state that we in the Labour Party would like to see replicated here.

#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	254	Paddy Hogan was a major player in the trade union movement on a national level and his passion for workers’ rights meant that he stayed to fight for workers’ rights throughout the bitter Civil War in which he did not partake. During the Civil War there was a blockade of Ennis and Hogan reacted by appropriating supplies for distribution among the labourers of the town who could not acquire food elsewhere. Of course, caught up in the demagoguery of the Technical Group, Deputy Higgins probably only remembers him as the Ceann Comhairle who met President John F. Kennedy at Shannon Airport. No doubt he would probably criticise him for having greeted President Kennedy because, regardless of President Kennedy's achievements for the poor that he and the Democratic Party represented in the United States, he was not perfect. I am sure many in the Technical Group would rather have seen Pol Pot arrive in Shannon Airport than President Kenney. That is Pot, the Cambodian dictator, as opposed to any contraband substance. That is the reality of the colourful group that proposed tonight’s motion.

He was my predecessor in the Clare Labour Party. I think of Hogan as a practical man who provided good and responsible leadership in times of great hardship. He was not a reckless demagogue who misled people with false promises of an El Dorado that simply could not be achieved. The proposers of the motion seek to cast themselves in the heroic mould of the tragic characters of Plunkett’s Strumpet City. They rant and rail against the world in very general terms and against the Labour Party in particular. Their shrill voices and empty rhetoric are not only useless, but are dangerous.

Decent turf cutters have been brought into conflict with the Garda and the courts. Unfortunate householders who listened to the false gods now face higher household charge penalties and possibly court action. Responsible trade unionists who negotiate long and hard on behalf of their members are demeaned by these fantasists and accused of selling out 1913 when in fact they continue to fight for exactly the same thing which Larkin and Connolly wanted the opportunity to fight for in 1913, namely, to be able to sit down and argue for workers’ rights in the face of strong economic forces. Instead of taking the easy road of castigating every possible proposal which comes out of the Government, instead of never seeing the good in anything, the Labour Party took the harder road of going into government. I have no doubt that had the Labour Party not gone into Government we would not have seen the restoration of the national minimum wage so soon in the first term of the Government, we would not have seen the replacement of the JLC system with an equally efficient and effective system and we would not have seen 330,000 low paid workers taken out of the universal social charge net. On that basis alone I oppose the motion which is merely rhetoric from the Technical Group.

I remind him to look at the records of the previous Dáil. I commend Deputy Higgins on introducing a motion that allows us to discuss 1913 because despite Deputy McNamara’s barbs, without him this Dáil would not have had the opportunity to discuss the centenary of 1913. It is the second part in a number of celebrations and commemorations we will undertake over the next decade after last year’s Ulster Covenant. It was forgotten about and would not have featured in discussions in Dáil Éireann were it not for the motion this evening. While I disagree with much of the motion, at least Deputy Higgins has given us the chance to reflect on the centenary in the Oireachtas and its impact not just on the industrial relations tradition and history of this country but on independence generally for the country. It was the spark that ignited a flame in 1913 that showed people they could stand up and collectively organise not alone for workers’ rights but for the rights of our nation. It was unfortunate and ironic that even with the Labour Party in government – Deputy McNamara might take the opportunity to raise the matter with the Whips to give us the chance to reflect on the centenary at some stage during the year – nothing was formally tabled in the House. At least Deputy Higgins deserves the credit for doing that. If anybody is serious about looking at that period of Irish history at the weekend we had the honour of the Taoiseach being in my home town opening the Jackie Clarke Library, which is the most extensive repository of all things to do with Irish history over the past 200 years, even more so than any of the museums in Dublin. There are elements of the library that relate to 1913 but more material on the struggle that followed. I would recommend anyone to visit the library and if people have material to add to it then I am sure Sinead McCoole, the curator, would be more than happy to discuss it. It is ironic that as we start on the commemoration, the Minister for Education and Skills is considering reducing the status of history at junior certificate level. At a time when we are commemorating the most important decade in the formation of the nation, history is being downgraded to an AOB item in the junior cycle which means people will not have the chance to get an appreciation of the impact of the period and the various things that happened – the First World War, the Rising, the War of Independence and the Civil War. They will all be downgraded and the only opportunity to hear about it will be at national school. It would be horrific if during the commemoration one of the marks of the decade of commemoration was the further downgrading of history. As someone with a sense of history I hope Deputy McNamara will oppose that within the Labour Party. Deputy McNamara can go now.

Those who took up the cause of downtrodden workers are rightly and properly lauded by people today, but it would be wrong to equate the difficulties faced in the labour market today with those experienced during the Lock-out. We have a lot to be proud of as a State in terms of the evolution of labour law during that 100 years. My party was in government for many of them. I refer to the Adoptive Leave Act, the Carers Leave Act, the Employment Equality Acts, the Industrial Relations Act from 1946 onwards, the Maternity Protection Acts, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, the National Minimum Wage Act, the Parental Leave Act, the Payment of Wages Act, the Protection of Employment Act and the Redundancy Payments Acts and the Unfair Dismissals Act. The legislation, together with bodies such as the Labour Court, the rights commissioner service, the Labour Relations Commission and the Employment Appeals Tribunal exist as a bulwark against the worst excesses of employer abuse such as what ignited the flame of 1913.Moreover, they represent a significant body of labour law and labour institutions, as well as substantial protection for employees and rightfully so. It is important that in drawing parallels between 1913 and the present, one acknowledges this progress and that protection, which forms part of the law. It is recognised that Ireland's employment law generally is perceived as being more employee-friendly than that of many of our European partners and in particular in comparison with its United Kingdom equivalent. The Workplace Relations customer service is a forum for workers to gain access to employment legislation, their rights and the making of a complaint. It is an amalgamation of several former bodies and there is no equivalent body in the United Kingdom. One also should recognise the importance of Bunreacht na hÉireann in this regard. While the present Administration tends to disregard Bunreacht na hÉireann when that suits it, Article 43 has a significant role in respect of unfair dismissal. It also is important to point out that the spirit of this motion appears to put forward an idea that all employers in Ireland are reckless and that each employer is in the tradition of William Martin Murphy, which is patently untrue and unfair, as 95% of Irish employers are good, decent employers who work with their employees, keep within the law and run very good ships. In the current climate, many owners of small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, in particular will pay their employees before paying themselves, in order to maintain the job and the business, as well as a sense of being able to grow that job and employment. It is important to put such struggles on the record of the House as well. In the SME business that is finding it hard to access bank finance or is finding it hard because of sales issues or is finding it hard to get paid, workers generally will get paid but the owner may not. All Members, regardless of the views they hold in this House, have met such people and they certainly are not William Martin Murphys or anything like it. They are good, decent employers and represent the majority of Irish employers, who are trying to keep the business going in spite of it. There also are times of mixed messages from the Government towards employers and towards small employers in particular. I acknowledge the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, and the Ministers of State at his Department, Deputies Perry and Sherlock, are doing a difficult job in trying to promote employment culture and a business-friendly culture. However, I suspect the motion tabled by Deputy Higgins encouraged some of the headlines from the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, that appeared in The Sunday Times at the weekend pertaining to minimum wages. The Minister has come out and suggested raising the minimum wage at a time when many employers are struggling to keep open their doors. She regularly has a go about sick leave and suggests there will be a change in this regard, having completely abolished the redundancy rebate. These two kites she regularly flies, namely, threatening to increase the cost of employing people and preventing jobs from being created, seek to undermine the worker, the employer and the culture of employment. Fianna Fáil seeks a single approach from the Government and not a sideline speaker who may appeal to a different audience. She may appeal to the Labour Party membership for some struggle down the line and is using Irish employers as her canvas card for so doing. However, the Government must have a single approach, which supports employers, including those who wish to create jobs and to maintain jobs. Earlier, I listened to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney. There appears to have been a Government takeover, in that there has been a one-man Government for the day. He acted for the Taoiseach earlier and is the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and for Agriculture, Food in the Marine. I do not know whether this is some sort of political reform, whereby there now is a single member of Cabinet, but he spoke about the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012. While he mentioned the reform of the employee rights bodies, he declined to mention that much of the blueprint for those reforms was in place and was ready to roll when the Minister, Deputy Bruton, came into office. The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 is based on the Duffy Walsh report, which was commissioned by the previous Government. Moreover, subsequent events in the courts have shown that further changes are needed in that system and it is important that some sense of urgency be injected into consideration of the recent Supreme Court appeal because I do not imagine Members will have sight of legislation before the autumn. There are employers, albeit probably in the main not employers based in this country, who will use the lacuna that is there at present, in terms of paying wages and in respect of differential wage rates in these sectors, to come in to tender for jobs, such as some of the new capital projects announced last week, while the Irish employers still are subject by law to the existing arrangements. The Government appears to be rather hesitant in dealing with this matter. It was not as though this decision came as a surprise. It was known that this judgment could have happened and a greater sense of urgency is required. Deputy Higgins championed the cause of the Gama workers in 2005 and I genuinely believe we again have a lacuna in which another Gama could happen while there still is a legal doubt over the Supreme Court judgment. A Gama-type company can come in and tender for a Government job and we will be back to a position in which such companies will be within the law. This is because all they must do is pay the minimum wage and they will not be obliged to pay the rates that are being paid to operatives at present.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	268	Yes.

All the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, which was established as a response to the Gama case at the time, will be able to do is to implement the basics of labour law. Consequently, far greater urgency is required in this regard. I listened to how the Minister, Deputy Coveney's speech suggested the Government has brought so much to the table but it has not. It is quite extraordinary for a Labour Party in government that its members have disengaged themselves from the entire area of employee rights and are satisfied to sign up to the line that this or that was done. I acknowledge the minimum wage was restored and that its reduction by the previous Government was a mistake. The restoration was carried out and Fianna Fáil welcomes that. However, one must also consider the other things the Government and the Labour Party in particular have not done. In this context, I note several ex-SIPTU officials in its parliamentary party have gone very quiet in the whole area of pushing for ongoing reform of labour law. The reforms in respect of the employee rights bodies are to be welcomed but again, they are dragging on. A far greater sense of urgency in delivery is required in this regard. The single form is particularly to be welcomed because the confusion as to where one went to pursue one's rights was not helpful and again created a vacuum in which people could be abused. People were sent in many different directions to look for their rights in the hope that if one delayed and confused them within the apparatus of the State, they might not get those rights. I reiterate the single form and one-stop-shop approach is welcome. Equally, however, something similar must be done in the case of small businesses. They must understand, through a single form or one shop, what are their responsibilities as employers, because the majority of labour law violations or NERA violations pertain to the mishandling of a situation, not for purpose but because of a genuine misreading or misunderstanding of the law. I refer in particular to the role of the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, in the rolling out of the local enterprise offices, LEOs, and the one-stop-shops. This should be a specific part of that roll-out and people within the LEOs should be trained up in this area. There is no sense in having generalists doing this job, as people who understand labour law both from the point of view of the employee and employer are required. The LEOs will be judged on their ability to assist employers in dealing with this whole area. Ireland has a huge corpus of labour law. It is being undermined by court decisions and is being fought and various court decisions have resulted in the strengthening of some law and the ignorance of others. However, one cannot take it for granted. Employers, particularly large multinational employers, are changing and in recent weeks in various debates, Members have seen what that means. Consequently, one must continue to be aggressive in the protection of workers. However, propagating an idea that all employers are in the spirit of William Martin Murphy is patently wrong and is unfair to the majority of people who are pursuing a dream and employing others. Moreover, enforcing legislation that will restrict the ability of people to create employment and to create jobs also is wrong because there is no sense in having absolutely armour-plated employee protection legislation, while not having any employees.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	270	Tonight's Private Members' motion on workers’ rights reminds Members yet again of the power of capital and the willingness of the business class, supported by other conservative elements, to use State violence, excessive force and the law when, in its estimation, its class interests are under threat. William Murphy was particularly vicious and his intransigence and basic lack of humanity still has the power to shock. Murphy was unyielding despite the fact that the working men and women who were active during the Lock-out were living in some of the worst conditions and in the most abject poverty imaginable. Indeed in 1913, Dublin had the highest rates of infant mortality in Europe and the worst slums in the British Empire.Fast forward to today, and crucially, as a modern State, we have dealt with the premature deaths of babies and very young children due to diphtheria, bad housing and malnutrition. However, when it comes to the issue of workers' rights, we still lack fundamental safeguards that are enshrined in law. For example, Ireland is out of step with other countries in that we still lack any form of protection for collective bargaining, and there is no requirement in law for an employer to recognise a trade union in a specific workplace or to engage with it. In that regard the Irish State is out of step with judgments of the European Court of Human Rights and with International Labour Organisation conventions. Before the last election the Labour Party gave a commitment to introduce legislation that would address these important issues. Indeed, the programme for Government committed to "reform the current law on employees' right to engage in collective bargaining so as to ensure compliance by the state with recent judgements of the European Court of Human Rights". Thus far, nothing has happened with regard to that commitment. On the contrary, a number of forms of collective bargaining have been struck down in recent years, including joint labour committees, JLCs, in 2011 and registered employment agreements, REAs, this year. What is especially worrying is that in the case of the latter, the Supreme Court described collective agreements as "giving rise to the prospect of burdensome restraints on competition for prospective employers". Even more worrying, it went on to describe such agreements as "intrusive paternalism for prospective employees". As mentioned earlier, the right to collective bargaining was judged by the European Court of Human Rights essentially to be a fundamental and basic human right. It is exceptionally worrying, therefore, when the Irish Supreme Court describes such rights as intrusive and not in the interest of employers. Unfortunately, one could cite an endless list of abuses against workers in the Ireland of today. Long hours, low pay, poor working conditions and abusive and exploitative employers are still very much part of the everyday landscape of work in Ireland. We need only think of the Lagan Brick workers, the Vita Cortex workers in Cork and the thousands of women and men who work long and hard in endless repetitive jobs for which they receive low pay, limited personal satisfaction and virtually nothing in terms of societal status and respect. In keeping with the struggles of the workers in 1913, contemporary Ireland also has a chronic housing problem. However, that is not due to capacity or the state of the housing stock but to speculation, greed, bad planning, Government policy and corruption. We now have more than 100,000 people on the public housing waiting list throughout the country. That is an appalling indictment of the policies and priorities of this and the previous Government. Sinn Féin supports this relevant and timely Private Members' motion and we endorse and acknowledge that the struggle for workers' rights is an ongoing one, especially in the current political climate where neoliberalism reigns supreme and the market and individuals take precedence over collective rights and the common good. In the Ireland of 2013 the poor are still with us, and issues to do with injustice, inequality and the general welfare of the working class are as pressing and as relevant as they were 100 years ago. Unfortunately, the William Murphys of this world are alive and living and they are as embedded in the political and social establishment, and just as willing to use the law or force to maintain their privilege, as they were in 1913.

The conscious and deliberate removal or shrinking of a democratic space is and should be a cause for great concern and alarm. Having said that, I acknowledge that there are serious problems with the Seanad as it is presently configured. How could ordinary Irish people have any sense of ownership over the current Seanad when most people have never even voted in a Seanad election, with the result that the second House is seen as an indigenous version of the House of Lords, where professional elites mingle with both aspiring and failed politicians and retired business people? This in and of itself does not justify abolition. After all, why should the majority of Irish people be punished for the failure of successive Governments to implement much-promised reform measures? Why should the people be expected to pay such a high price in terms of the democratic functioning of the State? It is because successive Irish Governments failed to put in place a proper system of governance that is fitting for a modern democratic state, the plain people of Ireland must yet again pay the price and suffer a further diminution of the democratic sphere. It is simply not good enough to argue for abolition on the basis that the Seanad is elitist and that it has no relevance for the vast majority of Irish people. It is all of these things, but then so is Dáil Éireann, and I do not hear any call for this House to be abolished. The fact is that since the foundation of the Irish State democracy, freedom of expression and radical dissent have been subject to excessive scrutiny, exclusion, censorship, ridicule and limits. The machinery of government, as reflected in the two Houses of the Oireachtas, has not produced a system of government that has served successive generations of Irish people well. Indeed, on a regular basis the past failures of the State are debated and legislated for in this House. If the Irish State were a closet it is not an exaggeration to say it would be full of the ghosts of the past crying out for justice. The state model that emerged in the 1930s is in essence the very same structure with which we work today. That was a State founded on the building blocks of ideological and political repression. It was shaped and modelled to reflect the world view and social conservatism of a hegemonic Catholic, nationalist middle class. Church and State divided the spoils between them and thus, while the shopocracy captured the State and used it to further its own class interests, the church was given free rein to discipline, punish and control the hearts, minds and bodies of the oppressed women, men and children of Ireland. We now know that not only did the State and its institutions facilitate this oppression, it actively
assisted the church through Government institutions and social policy. The Irish system of government and our State institutions reproduced the Magdalen laundries, mother and baby homes, industrial schools and a class structure that ensured the poor and the working classes were kept at the bottom of the economic ladder and that they were seen to be culturally and socially inferior. While the aforementioned institutions are now a thing of the past, thanks primarily to various campaigns, the institutional legacy of the foundational building blocks of the State is very much evident for all to see. We know that women are grossly under-represented in this House; of 166 Deputies, only 25 are female. We also know that at every level of government in this country, what can only be termed a sprinkling of women is to be found at city, county, and Seanad level. Even worse, not one Member of this House or the Seanad is a member of the Traveller community. We have no first-generation immigrants or people of colour. We have no poor here, and the dispossessed and the disaffected of Irish society are nowhere to be found. The working class, the unemployed, the working poor, the under-employed, the stretched middle class and the disabled are not here. That raises the question: if all of these people are missing, who is it that governs Ireland? The answer is that we have an Executive and two Houses of the Oireachtas that are overwhelmingly comprised of a conservative, white, middle-class male elite. This is a group of people that never or rarely questions the exclusionary basis on which its class, gender and racial privilege depends. When the Fine Gael Members talk of abolition of the Seanad and the need for the State to modernise, we would do well to keep in mind the ideological philosophy that shapes this party’s political world view.Abolition in this perspective must therefore be seen within the broader context of a Government that not only eagerly pursues harsh and cruel neoliberal economic policies, but that genuinely believes in the social and political utility of such neoconservative-inspired programmes. Therein lies the nub of the matter. Fine Gael's plan to abolish the Seanad is not borne out of a desire to modernise the State or to open up the formal political terrain to a greater and more diverse populace. Rather the abolition of the second Chamber must be seen within shifts in the political economy of capitalism and the pre-eminence of the neoliberal political doctrine, which this Government has wholeheartedly embraced. In this context the abolition of the Seanad is, it may be argued, a certain type of reform but it is not a progressive type of reform born out of a love and respect for democracy and dissent. It is instead a retrograde step prompted by a deliberate desire to narrow the possibilities for political opposition. In plain language it is a dumbing down and shrinking of the political sphere that will lead to an increase in anomie and apathy towards politics, politicians and political debate in general. This process is already well advanced and much of what passes for acceptable political debate ignores this disenchantment and disillusionment. The dominant political discourse stresses repeatedly that as a people we have no option other than to embrace, however grudgingly, the politics of austerity. The problem is that this specific brand of austerity is aimed not at the rich and well-off, but at the vulnerable, the poor, the unemployed, low and middle income workers and children. When there is opposition to these measures, such is the power and nature of the dominant ideology that the ruling political elite, the State, its institutions, and the wealthy and affluent class simply soak it up, and render it neutered. Marshall McLuhan’s infamous phrase about the manufacturing of consent is now more than ever apt, accurate and true. There is an even greater price than austerity to be paid for conformity. Philosophers, political scientists and political activists have long understood that the disposition to disagree, however irritating it may be at times, is the very lifeblood of an open society. They have also warned us that a democracy of permanent consensus will not long remain a democracy. Indeed, a closed circle of opinion or ideas into which discontent or opposition is never allowed, or allowed only within circumscribed limits, loses its capacity to respond energetically or imaginatively to new challenges. Republics and democracies exist only by virtue of the engagement of their citizens in the management of public and political affairs. If angry, concerned, and genuine people forfeit politics, they abandon society to its most mediocre and venal civil servants.  Throughout Irish history Irish men and women have fought and died so that we could be free to determine our own future, in the interest of all our people. The current proposal to abolish the Seanad and replace it with nothing is very worrying to say the least. We already have an exceptionally centralised, powerful and unaccountable system of government where power is concentrated in the hands of the Executive. Conversely, our system of local government is weak, underfunded and characterised by a lack of any real power for local representatives. Thus we are left with a scenario where power is concentrated in the hands of a few elite senior politicians, civil servants and an oligarchy that is embedded in senior positions within the media, academia, business, and the professions. Abolishing the Seanad without reform of local government and reform of the Dáil needs to be seen for what it is: more power for Government while the people will have to make do with less accountability, less democracy and even fewer checks and balances against political corruption, abuse and patronage. Yet again, it would appear that the people are to be presented with an either-or scenario: abolish the Seanad or keep it as it is, and that is the end of that. There is no talk of reform or indeed of the possibilities of what a reformed and reinvented Seanad could do for Irish democracy. Imagine for a moment a Chamber that was truly representative of the ethnic, racial, socioeconomic and gender diversity that is contemporary Ireland, a Chamber where real people could thrash out and debate real issues that concern all of us, where we could actually for once in our lives see democracy in action. Unfortunately, such thoughts and ideas are outside of this Government’s political consciousness. Of course, a reinvigorated dynamic political sphere is the antipathy of the neoliberal project. It is therefore imperative that actions and policies are enacted and carried out to ensure such a space does not occur. The Government, had it so wished, had ample opportunity to explore the range of possibilities not jus for the Seanad but for extending the democratic sphere in general but it chose not to. It could have asked the Constitutional Convention to address the issue of political reform in general and, in so doing, prompt and foster wider public debate about political reform in general. Again, this did not happen. All of this is hugely problematic. The shrinking of the political sphere and a society with a democratic deficit is especially worrying when these factors are coupled with a politics of austerity and a political philosophy that fosters the cult of the individual, the primacy of the market and relegates ideas or discussions of solidarity and the common good. Irish people need, deserve and are entitled to have a robust and informed debate about what type of society it is that we want live in. Such a discussion would obviously have to address also issues of governance and structures of government. In a mature democracy, this is the debate we would be having. We would also set about the task of drafting a new constitution that had at its core a clear statement of what a fair and democratic Ireland would look like. The men and women of 1916 did not fight and die so that a Government of aloof and pampered politicians could cut mobility allowances to disabled people. They did not fight so that this very same elite could introduce policies and laws that are, in plain language, a deliberate and conscious rejection of egalitarianism. Sinn Féin believes, just like the women and men of 1913 and 1916, that there is another way forward. We believe that it is conceivable to have a society without poverty, if we so choose. We would do well to remember that what rich people call the problem of poverty, poor people call with equal justification, the problem of riches. In an unequal society, the conscious and deliberate shrinking of the democratic sphere is not only unfair and unjust, it is a betrayal of the people.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	274	I welcome this Bill. The Labour Party's assessment of the case for the abolition of the Seanad was first detailed in the policy statement I issued on behalf of the party, New Government, Better Government, in January 2011 as part of a comprehensive programme of Government, political and public service reforms. That recommendation reflected a long, hard look at Seanad Éireann by Members, former Members and colleagues of former Members of Seanad Éireann. As the policy statement stressed, the decision about the future of the Seanad is one that will have to be made by the people as a whole. Following the adoption in the programme for Government of the abolition of the Seanad as a key element of the programme of constitutional reform, this Bill now paves the way for a broader public debate to commence on the merits of the conclusion that the case for the retention of Seanad Éireann has failed. I look forward to bringing the analysis and assessment underpinning that recommendation to the people as, ultimately, the decision on the abolition of the Seanad will be for the people by way of referendum on the basis of this Bill. As I highlighted early in 2011, the Seanad's shortcomings can be summarised as arising from the fact that it is dominated by the Government, it lives in the shadow of the Dáil, and the rules for choosing its members are bizarre and anachronistic. The reality is that there is popular indifference about its future. The reasons for that are, quite simply, that no one is sure what purpose the Seanad is meant to serve.If, as broadly recognised, maintaining the status quo is unacceptable, and I have heard no voices from the beginning of this debate that argue for the status quo, there are only two options: abolition or reform. The fundamental determinant of conclusion in "New Government, Better Government" that the Seanad should be abolished is that it is simply not possible to identify any bodies or sections in our society that deserve - because, for example, they happen to be university graduates or county councillors - to be singled out as constituting a special and separate electorate entitled to vote for their own special House of the Oireachtas. As expressed in the neutral and dispassionate language of the political scientists, Professors Michael Laver and John Coakley, the composition of Seanad Éireann is described as "unique" with a type of vocational representation not found at national level in any other country. They characterise university representation as "unusual" and the system of Taoiseach's nominations as "without parallel". Seanad Éireann is a vestige of a bygone era. It is a product of history that sits more comfortably among the political landscape of the 19th century than in a modern-day parliamentary democracy. The reality is that the Seanad serves little or no purpose in a contemporary context. It is neither representative of the people nor effective as a check and balance on the Dáil, and everybody knows that. Currently, the Seanad mirrors the Dáil, both institutionally and in terms of its political make-up. This leads to an unnecessary and expensive duplication of functions between two separate Houses. The mechanism by which Senators are appointed is antiquated and erratic. Not all sectoral groups in society are represented; only ones that were important in the 1930s. Even with regard to the six Members who are selected by graduates of certain universities, there is no representation for two of the State's universities or any of its institutions of technology. Even if the system of appointment were to be reformed, it would be virtually impossible to define fair and objective criteria to determine the membership and relative weight of different groupings in society. Deputy McLellan spoke of women, Travellers or persons of colour. Who balances who should and should not be a member? There is no point in having two Houses if both of them are directly elected by the people because then one would have two Houses in conflict. Since its inception, the Seanad has not operated as a check on the powers of the Dáil. As the Dáil is the only House directly elected and accountable to the people, it is indisputable that it should have the final say when it comes to making decisions about the force of law rather than to permit such power to be the preserve of a Seanad, with its clear democratic deficit. We need checks and balances in our system, but these should come in the form of a strengthened and enhanced Dáil. I have argued that for 30 years. It is the Dáil that currently provides the check on the main promoter of legislation which is the Government. Many other countries have shown that rigorous checks and balances can and should be created in a single-chamber parliament. A reformed and strengthened Dáil can act as an effective unicameral parliament and hold the Executive to account. It will bring Ireland in line with other modern parliamentary democracies that have moved to a unicameral system, such as Sweden, Denmark, New Zealand and, of course, Israel, which had a unicameral from the start. In Europe, Ireland is the only small unitary state with a second House. Reform of the Dáil is currently under way and we are working towards a renewed and enhanced political system with better accountability, better oversight and better scrutiny of legislation. At the centre of this reform is an enhanced and strengthened committee system which will enable the House to adapt and meet the needs of our modern democracy. Fourteen Dáil committees will be established, each comprising 12 members. As other parliamentary committees around the world preparing for legislation do, these committees will have the power to invite external experts to provide specialist input into their work. The d'Hondt system will be introduced to distribute chairs of key committees on a proportional and equitable basis. The Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Bill 2013 that I initiated in the Dáil last month represents a substantial step in securing accountability through investigations by Oireachtas committees into matters of significant public importance. Such inquiries could represent a very substantial strengthening in the effectiveness and contribution of the Legislature to our democratic system by not only helping us learn vital lessons from past events but through their recommendations identifying the legislative reforms and policy changes essential to ensuring that egregious policy errors are not repeated. The way in which legislation is dealt with in the Dáil is also being reformed. In general, legislation will initially be submitted to the relevant Dáil committee in Heads of Bill form, allowing for committee input prior to the publication of the finished Bill. A proposed new Dáil schedule will increase time spent on deliberating on legislation. A new pre-enactment Stage will be introduced by Standing Orders whereby each Bill will be referred back to the committee which considered it at pre-legislative and Committee Stages for a final examination after Report and before the Bill is finally passed by the House. It is proposed that a Minister will revert to the relevant select committee within 12 months of the enactment of a Bill to discuss and review the functioning of the law and to allow for a debate from members and stakeholders as to whether the legislation is fulfilling its stated purpose. Additionally, a new ten-minute Bills procedure will be introduced to give Deputies a greater opportunity to initiate legislation onto the floor of this House. The abolition of the Seanad should be seen in the context of these broader reforms. It is a stepping stone on the path to a dynamic parliamentary system that enjoys the confidence of the people it represents. The Dáil derives its legitimacy from the people who elect it. Whatever Members may say about the composition, male or female, colour, gender or religious viewpoint, we are the elected representatives of the people chosen in constituencies throughout the breadth of Ireland. The existence of the Seanad undermines public confidence in the political system because of the way it is chosen. It is hostage to political insiders, and operates without popular mandate, clear purpose or efficacy. It is not possible, nor should we try, to identify certain bodies or sections in our society that deserve to be singled out as constituting such a special and separate electorate that they are entitled to vote for their own separate House of the Oireachtas. I believe, after careful consideration and approaching this issue with a completely open mind, that the existence of the Seanad can no longer be justified. I ask a simple question. We should not turn logic on its head. The question should be, "Is there is a role that is so unique that we must have a Seanad to fulfil?", rather than, as now seems to be asked, "Can we create a role for the Seanad?" When I hear Members say that we could give it European legislation to deal with, I say European legislation is Irish legislation that has the force of law here and ask why should any Chamber, other than the directly elected Chamber of the people, determine European legislation. We need to give European legislation better scrutiny here rather than hive it off to some other area because we are too busy to deal with it. We need to be responsive to the needs of a modern democracy and adapt accordingly. An enhanced, more effective Dáil that is efficient in law-making and accountable to the people is the way forward.

While listening to some of the contributions that have been made over the past couple of days on this, there might be a temptation to forget that we are debate a Bill to allow a referendum. That is the most important point. I am sure the debate on the merits or otherwise of the decision that will be taken afterwards, and the debate that will take place in public, will be energetic and those on opposite sides will have their say. The Bill before the House is in keeping with the programme for Government and it is also in keeping with the manifestos of the parties in government.Some people may find this Bill has caused shock and awe but that arises from the Government keeping a promise. These people are entitled to take issue with the fact that the Government is doing what it stated it would in the programme for Government but there are people in this House who take issue with everything the Government does or, in some cases, has not been able to do until now. I stood for the Seanad and it was a fairly enlightening experience. I hope I never have to repeat it and, to be perfectly honest, I would not wish it on my worst enemy because of the manner in which the Seanad is elected, how candidates seek a nomination and the way one must traverse the Twenty-six Counties to meet local authority representatives. Anybody who comes through that system has a massive achievement under his or her belt because when one is dealing with professional politicians, who make up the bulk of the Seanad's electoral college, it is no easy achievement to come out the other end. It has been mentioned that some very good people have come from the Seanad and there have been some exceptionally notable speeches and contributions. That is all well and good but the Government, as part of an election manifesto, gave a commitment which is being partially fulfilled now. It will be up to the people as to what happens to the Seanad. There is an issue with the decision being taken by the people, particularly with the mechanism put in place when the debate starts. There is a ludicrous position in this country whereby every democratically elected Member of Dáil Éireann can be in favour of an issue but when it is put to a referendum, 50% of debating time may be given to people with no representation in here, or in some cases practically no representation in here. Such people have 50% of the available time in which to formulate erroneous, spurious and sometimes outlandish commentary and reasons for people to vote against an issue that would be in the common good. I have mentioned on Second Stage of previous Bills to amend the Constitution that the Government must examine this issue of media coverage being given on a 50-50 basis without any cognisance being taken of the Dáil's make-up. The debate allowed in referenda should be covered by the referendum commission, which should be placed on a more permanent basis, and the rules should be proportional to the representation in the Dáil. It should certainly be proportionate to the Deputies in favour or against issues that come before the country by way of referendum. It is ridiculous that referendums are used as a "Lazarus-type" effect by people whose political parties have gone up in smoke or into cold storage. This will happen again in the case of Seanad abolition, and we will hear from people whose political parties no longer exist trying to reinvent themselves. We will have to forget that in 1992 these people were the first to advocate abolition of the Seanad as they have now gone the road to Damascus and seen the Seanad as something that should be retained. They will get 50% of the debate, along with their colleagues, to bombard RTE, TV3, The Irish Times and the Irish Independent. It will be the oxygen desired by some people in trying to get back to the Dáil. That is a cynical use of the original intention to provide balance in a constitutional debate, and there may be no bearing on the issues at hand. A previous speaker from Sinn Féin is no longer in the Chamber but she machine-gunned the Government and Fianna Fáil with a litany of insults, personal and otherwise, which cannot go unchallenged. She referred to the dominant ideology of this House but that does not fall from the sky; it falls from ballot boxes and it is insulting to the people who voted for me, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and other Deputies in the House to have somebody suggest somehow that we should not be here. She implied that because I am a member of Fine Gael or others are members of the Labour Party, they should not be here.

I find that personally insulting and I am sure the people who voted for me find it insulting as well, as my party and I have a mandate. With the Labour Party we have a bigger mandate than the other parties in here, and it is to govern. We are putting this electoral promise made by us to the people. The Deputy also questioned local government reform. I do not know where the soundbites in her speech came from but Sinn Féin has also opposed local government reform. Nevertheless, when the party crosses the Border, its members seem to inhale some sort of toxin that changes their minds, as they are in favour of local government reform in the North, along with the abolition of certain councils, PSNI stations and small schools. They are also in favour of local taxes and water charges in the North, despite their opposition to such issues down here. It irks me that the initial attack launched on the Government this evening referenced the church and the provisions of the 1937 Constitution but it failed utterly to make any reference to the fact that Sinn Féin is a recent convert to this process anyway. The party spent most of its political past, certainly in my lifetime, trying to subvert not just certain aspects of the Irish Constitution but the Constitution in its entirety. It has used every mechanism in its arsenal to ensure the provisions of the 1937 Constitution would be subverted and, in some cases, attacked in a military fashion. The 1937 Constitution has served us well and its authors - Fianna Fáil was in Government at the time - should be commended. Europe was in a troubled position at the time and the Constitution has, by and large, served the country well. It is insulting, to put it mildly, to impugn this Chamber, which is directly elected by proportional representation with a single transferable vote. I know Fianna Fáil tried on two separate occasions to use its popularity to introduce a straight vote in the hope of achieving a British-type scenario of massive majorities but the people rejected those. It is insulting to every person in here to suggest that we are somehow not democratically elected and the next time the good Deputy has the opportunity to stand on her feet, she might apologise to those of us whom she openly insulted because we represent different ideologies. The Deputy referred to us as being aloof and pampered but there is only one group of people I know who are as aloof and pampered as the Deputy described, and they are the abstentionist Members of Her Majesty's Parliament at Westminster. They have no problem taking the Queen's shilling in expenses but they will not take their seats to represent the people who elected them in Northern Ireland. This issue is about giving people the opportunity to have their say on a commitment given both in the programme for Government and the manifestoes of both parties. There will be a vigorous debate, which I welcome, and there is an opportunity for everybody to have their say on what happens in the Seanad and what could have happened if there had been a reform as outlined in one of the many reports commissioned but which never got anywhere other than on a shelf to gather dust. It may be a pity but the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is correct in that this goal is not unique to Ireland, and the process has been done before. Other countries have gone this way and the Minister referred to New Zealand: I have never heard of it being referred to as an axis of anti-democracy. The Government is giving the people an opportunity to have their say and I am sure even Sinn Féin would agree that democracy and referenda are not something to be afraid of. This is an opportunity for people to have a debate and for the Government to advocate a platform of political reform at national, local and the regional level, which is often overlooked. It is badly needed.

I am here just over four years and I can share the frustration, disappointment and anger at how business is done. On the one hand we have rushed legislation, with increasing use of the guillotine, and on the other hand it can take an inordinate amount of time to get business done. One answer was to increase the size of the committee system but I must ask how productive that has been.We also see serious inequalities when it comes to representation. There is a lack of democracy vis-à-vis the Independent Members of this House because we do not have the same rights and opportunities as the members of political parties. Most glaring of all is the lack of detailed, comprehensive discussion on reform of the Seanad. It is as if political reform equals reducing the number of TDs and abolishing the Seanad, without adequate discussion and that will tick the box on political reform.  When one talks about political reform, it is first important to look at the underlying reasons for introducing it, that is, the principles under which it has to happen. For me, it has to happen on the basis of greater democracy, more transparency and more accountability. A reformed Seanad could play a significant role in providing greater democracy, accountability and transparency. However, the Irish electorate is not being given a real choice here, a wider choice which includes the option of a reformed Seanad. If the referendum is carried, the Senate is gone but if it is lost, it stays as it is. I do not think anybody wants it to stay as it is. I wish to acknowledge the work of the Seanad in the scrutiny of legislation. The perspectives of Senators have added to legislation and debates and produced worthwhile amendments. It must also be acknowledged that the Senate has a greater representation of women than the Lower House. I particularly want to acknowledge the work of Senator David Norris in initiating the first ever debate on AIDS, introducing the Civil Partnership Bill and calling for a special committee of inquiry in to the use of Shannon Airport for rendition flights. The latter move was later subverted by a group of local councillors in the Shannon area. The Seanad also saw the first resolutions against cluster munitions and Members did challenge the Celtic tiger and the bank guarantee.  There is no doubt about the need for reform and the first area is in the way in which members of the House are elected, which is not democratic. There has been a long debate over many years on the need for reform and many Governments, of varying political hues, have had the opportunity to do something on reform but did nothing. One must ask why and the answer is that it suited the political parties because of the way they used the Senate. While not wishing to be disparaging to individual members of the Senate, we all know the way the parties used the House as a training ground for new recruits or a reward for service. Maybe that did produce good Senators. Indeed, I am sure it did but the process was extremely restrictive and undemocratic. I have never seen such a complicated and convoluted system of electing people as that which operates through the panels. As a university graduate I have a vote on the university panel, but I do not see why, in a democracy, one citizen should have an extra right because he or she happened to get a third-level education.  I am one of the independent members on the Convention on the Constitution and one of the topics for consideration by the convention is Dáil electoral reform. Most people at the convention believed that we really should have been looking at political reform and Dáil reform that is not just confined to electoral reform. I cannot understand why reform of the Senate was not on our agenda. An attempt was made to include it more recently but I understand the reasoning of the Chairman, Mr. Tom Arnold, that the convention could not really add any more topics to the eight that it was given. It was suggested that it could be added later but there is no point in it being considered under "other relevant constitutional amendments" because by that time it could be abolished. One must ask why it was not included in the first place. Independent members have played a very significant role in the Senate, as have the Taoiseach's nominees this time around, who did not fall in along party political lines. I am all for doing more with less, as long as that is applied to everybody. One of the arguments against the Senate is that it is too costly but costs will be involved in what is being presented as the alternative, that is the wider committee system. Furthermore, those countries with one chamber also have a much stronger and better-resourced system of local government, so that will involve a cost too. I believe there is a role for reformed, more democratic elected Senate, perhaps smaller than the one we have now. The Senate could play an important role in scrutinising EU legislation because I do not think the Oireachtas committees have the time to do that properly. It could also play a role in revising Government programmes, furthering public consultation and direct democracy, as well as in reducing the highly concentrated power that lies with the Executive in this country.

If this Bill passes, with the help of my vote, I will certainly be voting in the referendum to abolish it. I have heard many saying that people should be given more of a choice, that it should not just be a straight choice between abolition or keeping it the way it is. I would agree with that point of view but if I was given that option, I would vote for abolition anyway because I have full confidence in the people of Ireland and the Dáil system which allows ordinary people to go out and vote for other ordinary people to get into this House. If engineers or computer programmers want to be represented in this House, let them go out and run for election. This is not an exclusive club. If one goes out and burns a hole in one's shoe leather, listens to people, knocks on doors and tells people one's ideas, they vote for one and one gets in here. I really do not see any problem with the system if we get rid of the Seanad. I do not think anyone would be left out and if people feel that is the case, they should wake up to the fact that anyone can run for election. It is a challenge but one can do it. I find it interesting to see some of the characters that are involved in trying to keep the Seanad, such as the former Minister, Michael McDowell of Democracy Now. I suggest that group should change its name "Democracy When it Suits", because it seems he is interested in democracy one minute and is not interested in it the next. If he wants to represent the people, let him go out and look for votes. He got his answer the last time and I would imagine he would get the same answer again because people have not forgotten the damage he did to this country. I must say that I am delighted that he is on that side of the campaign. Most of the people I have spoken to in Roscommon have said that any thoughts of voting to keep the Seanad are now gone out the window because of his involvement. It is good, in that sense. I am glad to see he is finally achieving something.  Some people have argued that if we did not have the Seanad, we would not have brilliant people like David Norris in politics. However, I believe that if David Norris ran in an election for the Dáil he would be elected. I would vote for him if I was in his constituency because he has proved himself to be an excellent parliamentarian and an excellent contributor to debates. I do not think anyone should be afraid of that. The down side of abolition is the belief that there will be less oversight because the people in the remaining House, the Dáil, just would not have the time to scrutinise all of the legislation properly. However, there is a way in which we would have the time and that is if people were not poking their noses in a failed local government system all of the time. I am sad to say that the reforms being suggested for local government will not do it. I had six years experience in local government but the reforms being proposed are very disappointing. I do not think the Seanad provided much accountability anyway but if we are going to take away even a thin layer of accountability, we need to put something else in its place. The biggest benefit of having proper local government would be that we could spend every last minute of our time in here crossing the t's and dotting the i's on legislation. I must be honest and say that if we had proper local government, I probably would not be here anyway. I would prefer to be in local government with real power to help local communities and to use the money that is there at a local level to benefit those communities. There would then be a better selection of people who would come in here who might be more suited to scrutinising legislation.  I will be voting for the Bill before us and will be voting to get rid of the Seanad. I will be then be hoping that the rest will be reformed and while the news is not good on that front, I am certainly not changing my view on the Seanad because of that.

The Bill will probably be guillotined. I have only been given five minutes to speak on it, during which time I am expected to represent the views of the constituents who spoke to me, both for and against abolition of the Seanad. This Government promised reform, change and a different way of doing things but it is the most autocratic Government since the foundation of the State. It is guillotine after guillotine. It is bullying and intimidation. It is regressive legislation all of the time. Our Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, whom I wish him well in many aspects - I respect his position and I voted for him as Taoiseach - adopted this as his pet project. He did it out of despair because the last Taoiseach was so popular. He told his beloved he would abolish the Seanad. If he succeeds it will be about the only promise he has ever made that he will have honoured. If all of the people in his own party and the Labour Party who I feel are saying they are against it are honest, they will oppose it and he will get nowhere. When the previous Government was in power I saw the Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny, standing on this side of the House objecting to the guillotine and rushed legislation, some of which was dangerous legislation. The present Government took the mantle like a relay torch and ran with it. It also guillotines and rushes through legislation, including on banking and the promissory notes. It is a most undemocratic Government. Several minutes ago I saw the Chief Whip on the news on the television. He is in the United States getting a torch and bringing it back to Wexford. He has a torch here and is burning legislation and not respecting the Whips of our group or anybody else. They will not allow us as party leaders to have our say. People will have a choice and will say "No" to this. Comments have been made about the former Minister, Michael McDowell. I certainly was not a fan of his but he went for election and was not afraid to face the people. When he was rejected he came back again. I suggested to the Technical Group I wanted to be a substitute at the Constitutional Convention, but I say to my colleagues Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Murphy that I have not once been invited to participate. They are great democrats when it suits them, but they want to keep everybody else down and bully their own ideas on others. I am too old-fashioned and they want modern legislation. This is democracy. They can speak about democracy all they like, but they do not mean it because it is not practised in my group. It is as simple as that and this is how it happens. A reformed Seanad would be very beneficial but will we get it? We will not. This is Enda's ego trip, with all of his Ministers clapping him on the back. Some of them were Senators. I have never been in the Seanad and never canvassed for it. However, I want to see checks and balances on the legislation we introduce. The Taoiseach has broken all of his promises. He wants to keep this one but the public will decide. The Constitutional Convention is a bit of a charade. Why did the Taoiseach not leave the issue there? He is afraid somebody else might decide something else. We need a reformed Seanad and should possibly allow our emigrants and diaspora to vote on it and have it democratically elected. We should have checks and balances and we should be allowed time. A company law reform Bill, on which I recently spoke, was 1,400 pages long. How could I, as an elected politician with limited resources, check it? It was in gestation for 20 years and they wanted us to pass it in a short number of days. We need proper accountability and proper respect for the people who vote us in here. If we asked tomorrow whether we should also get rid of the Dáil I am sure the people would do so, and I would not blame them because they have been sold down the river, particularly by this and previous Governments. We need accountability, honesty and openness. When people are picked for positions they should have a chance to participate and not be blocked out. This Government is the most autocratic of all time. Thankfully the people of Ireland elected a President who is ready, willing and able to speak on issues about us kowtowing to Europe, other discrepancies and the lack of democracy. This cowardly Taoiseach will not allow a free vote on a serious constitutional issue. I will not call the other Bill before the House by its name, which mentions protecting mothers and nothing else. It is a Bill to introduce murder and slaughter into this country, yet the Taoiseach will not allow his own party people to have a free and conscientious vote. Where is the democrat? He is hiding and running but the people are waiting for him in the long grass and they will pay him back in good time. Democracy means nothing to him. He has no respect for it, but he should have because he has been here for much longer than I have, something on which I compliment him. The Taoiseach will not allow a free vote in his own party. What is he afraid of? What is he hiding from? He wants to kowtow to the Labour Party on this issue when he has destroyed it on many other issues. When he finishes here he will probably go to Europe with the Minister, Deputy Hogan, and the other fellows. The country will not forget Fine Gael and the so-called democrats in my group who will not allow me attend the Constitutional Convention for one day.
#PatrickNulty	unknown-#PatrickNulty-party	unknown-#PatrickNulty-dob	unknown-#PatrickNulty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-06-18 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	282	I welcome the Bill. I pay tribute to my colleague Councillor Dermot Looney on South Dublin County Council, with whom the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, is familiar. He tabled the original resolution at the Labour Party conference demanding the abolition of this archaic undemocratic 1930s relic of an institution. Without his strong campaign on this issue the Labour Party may never have supported the referendum. It is important to put this on the record. My comments are in no way a reflection on any individual Senator, many of whom make very fine contributions and I have the utmost respect for them regardless of their various political perspectives. We need a serious debate on this. What is the function of the Seanad in our modern democracy? As has been stated, countries such as Denmark, with very similar demographics and profiles, function perfectly well with a democratically elected House elected by all of the citizens. Contrast this with the Seanad where not one single Member is elected in an election open to all citizens, as is the case with constituency elections. I am a graduate of Trinity College and the NUI and as such I have a vote in both elections. I find it abhorrent that graduates of several particular institutions have a greater say in our democracy than anybody else. What about the outstanding graduates from the institute of technology in Blanchardstown? What about people who are unemployed? What about carers? Our right to participate in democracy comes from one principle only, which is the fact we are citizens of a republic. No other factor should come into play. Any election should be based on equal citizens engaging in democracy. Our democracy is imperfect due to the influence of corporate forces, but it is a democratic system. The Seanad is something which we simply do not need. What about the Taoiseach's nominees? This is no reflection on any individual person, but on what basis should someone serve in the parliament of a country because they happen to be in the good books of the Taoiseach or Tánaiste of the day rather than seeking to put themselves before the people and be elected? This is profoundly and ridiculously undemocratic. The point is being made about the need for political reform. As a first term Deputy I can say that the need for reform is stark. Look at the time of day at which we are debating this issue. How difficult would this be for a Deputy who is a lone parent or has a range of other commitments? It is completely family unfriendly and needs radical overhaul to allow participation. The point has been made about the Government's overwhelming majority. We have a unique situation whereby the two largest parties in the country are in coalition together. This never happened before and is unconscionable. The obvious government was a Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael government as they are in complete agreement on most key questions. It would make perfect sense for Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, which share the same ideological outlook, to form a government so we could have a genuine right left debate in the Dáil. Unfortunately, and much to my disappointment, this did not happen but this is democracy and we must accept it. There has been much talk about the party Whip system in the Dáil. I can speak with some authority on this as someone who lost the party Whip. Political parties are entitled to impose a Whip if they wish. They should have more nuanced Whip systems such as those in the House of Commons and other chambers, but at the end of the day individual Deputies need to stand up and be counted and if they feel they need to break the Whip on a particular issue they should do so and stand over their actions. One thing for certain is that removing the Seanad is not a power grab. It is removing an irrelevant institution based on 1930s corporatist Europe and not on 21st century democracy. The idea that the Seanad, which has people not popularly elected but elected by local authority members and university graduates or are the friends of the Taoiseach, should be able to provide a check on the people elected through universal suffrage is a farce. I look forward to the referendum if this legislation passes and I will campaign for a "Yes" vote to scrap the Seanad and remove it.

The motion was never taken and was disposed of by way of referring it back to the executive. The party leadership was not sure how the motion would fare and whether it would be passed. There was a strong possibility it would have been defeated. South Dublin County Council voted on a similar motion last week and it was defeated.
