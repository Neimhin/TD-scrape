          <p eId="para_1">Will the Taoiseach justify to the House and country the decision to spend in excess of €50 million on the purchase of a new Government jet at a time of great economic uncertainty and austerity? It is a time when primary schools are being run down, accident and emergency wards are dilapidated, the extra gardaí promised to fight crime have not arrived, many carers are struggling to cope and our cities are grinding to a halt. Every week brings new killings, assaults and thefts and new revelations about our crumbling health service, and confirms that the nation was conned last May.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">Perhaps the Taoiseach thinks that was worth it because he and the Government can forget about betraying the people while sitting in leather-lined seats and gilded jacuzzis at 30,000 feet. Up there, he will not have to worry about rat-infested school buildings, sick people without hospital beds or the scandal of homelessness which blights our towns and cities. This happens while the Taoiseach and Government preach austerity to the rest of us. Is the nation to tighten its belt while the Government wraps a €50 million Charvet shirt around itself?</p>

          <p eId="para_19">The Deputy also asked about the Government decision to look at the most feasible way of dealing with the ministerial aircraft service. Two aircraft are currently used, the Beechcraft which is over 15 years old and has not been much in use in recent years, and the GIV which was leased for a decade and bought some years ago. The overall cost of the GIV, between leasing arrangements and the buy-out cost of €9 million, was over €40 million. Several issues must be considered with regard to the ministerial aircraft which, because of age, landings and miles travelled, needed to be changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">Ireland will hold the EU Presidency next year and 25 countries will be involved in that. This is the most globalised country in the world with regard to trade, according to the recent A T Kearney globalisation report, and is one of the biggest exporters in the world. Ireland depends on trade and exports, and on travel as a means to talk to our trading partners.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">The Government considered the best possible means of disposing of the additional aircraft. It was decided to dispose to the smaller seven-seat Beechcraft in 2001 but the market conditions were not right at that time. They are right now because the global situation means that there are thousands of aircraft on the ground. The cost of a new GIV has been considered but the best way to do this has not been decided, whether to buy outright, lease or make lease-purchase arrangements. The NDFA, with the experts in the Department of Defence, will consider the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">We will have to deal with 4,000 meetings during the Irish EU Presidency next year, including over 50 Council meetings. The Government will find the most cost-effective way of doing this and I look forward to that.</p>

          <p eId="para_24">I have never heard so much waffle in my life. The Taoiseach justifies this on grounds of age, landings and the amount of miles.

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_51">Is the Taoiseach aware that the management at Dublin hospitals must now resort to desperate measures to cut costs? I refer him to a confidential memorandum circulated by the chief executive of one Dublin hospital to senior staff stipulating that he is required to cut his costs by 10%, or €20 million. His senior staff are engaged in discussions with the EHRA to consider how this money will be saved and the following measures are proposed: the capping of cancer and dialysis treatment, which will place people's lives at serious risk; the closing down of the night dialysis shift, which will deprive patients of life-saving care; the closure of 35 more beds from April, which is the equivalent of a full ward; and major savings by eliminating the use of certain medical devices, thereby running the risk of increasing the mortality rate after certain treatments.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">Is the Taoiseach aware that the hospital has been forced to consider additional cost-saving measures, including returning patients to the hospital from step-down facilities in nursing homes, thereby filling hospital beds with people who do not require treatment? Is he also aware of this confidential memorandum and that, to the best of my knowledge, it is being replicated in two other Dublin hospitals?</p>

          <p eId="para_59">Over 700 additional beds have been provided and an additional €29 million in funding has been allocated to cancer treatment services. Total additional Government spending in this area is €131 million. This year, the Minister for Health and Children has provided additional resources to all areas of the health services, including consultants, nurses, paramedics and junior doctors.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">Given the enormous increases in funding, those involved in providing health services must manage their resources. The allocation provided this year should be more than adequate in this regard. There have been huge increases on previous years. Those involved should address their difficulties in the normal way, through the EHRA and the Department, with whom they are in discussion. It will not help the position of those managers who seek to get advertisements for their dilemmas. I am sure they are dealing with the EHRA and the Department, and they should continue to do so. The manager in question does not need Deputy Rabbitte to help him.</p>

          <p eId="para_61">I do not apologise for irritating the Taoiseach. Should he wish, I will provide him with a copy of the memorandum. The case is Beaumont Hospital. The Taoiseach's waffling does little for patients suffering from kidney failure or to address problems arising from the capping of expenditure on cancer treatment facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_62">This situation is unprecedented and it affects three hospitals. The Taoiseach has the audacity to blame the managers at a time when he has imposed a cap on their spending. At the same time he is sending the Minister for Defence to the marketplace to procure a fleet of jets. When he gets his bargain basement prices it would not be surprising if the Minister does not also get a helicopter for the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Treacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">How can the Taoiseach justify his position when yesterday a patient discharged himself after spending five days on a trolley in a hospital? He was charged €200 for the privilege of not being attended to. This case illustrates the state of the health services, yet the Taoiseach blames the managers.</p>

This year it has provided €29 million in addition to an earlier allocation of €31 million for these services. It is cheap for somebody to seek to create a commotion by giving Deputy Rabbitte an internal report that is highly confidential. It is not the correct way to proceed.</p>

          <p eId="para_66">Yesterday, the Minister for Health and Children repeated his often stated acceptance that there are capacity constraints at Beaumont Hospital and all other major acute hospitals. Under the Government's bed capacity initiative, an additional 35 beds are being provided to Beaumont Hospital and the Department of Health and Children has been informed they will shortly be commissioned. It will help to alleviate some of the capacity constraints at the hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_67">Pressure on the acute hospital system increases over the winter months. In recent years, funding has been provided for the contracting of additional places in private nursing homes. A major €27 million refurbishment programme, initiated through the Department and funded through the EHRA, is currently under way at Beaumont Hospital, which will provide it with a greatly enhanced environment. I am pleased Deputy Rabbitte identified the hospital as it has given me the opportunity to inform the House of this new development.</p>

          <p eId="para_68">The Taoiseach will be aware that An Agreed Programme for Government refers to helping all children to develop to their full potential. Will he indicate how this can be possible in the case of a child aged seven and a half years with autism who has not received speech or occupational therapy for two years? He is one of 50 children whose parents were obliged to protest on Monday outside the offices of the North-Eastern Health Board in Kells.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">Is the Taoiseach aware that from today, children at St. Mark's national school, Tallaght, will protest outside the Dáil because their two special language classes have been without speech therapists for some time? No advertisements have been placed to fill the posts. The INTO has said it should be a cause of national embarrassment that parents of children with special needs have to protest outside health board offices and the Parliament to demand the resources their children need.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">Will the Taoiseach, as a matter of urgency, raise with the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Education and Science these major deficiencies in the provision of care for children with special needs? Will he also undertake to provide the necessary resources to ensure and increase the supply of qualified health professionals? Will he consider the establishment of a national speech and language therapy service to help children with special needs to reach their full potential, as An Agreed Programme for Government commits?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_59">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_71">I am aware that over recent years there has been a lack of staff, especially in the areas of autism and special needs. For that reason, the last Government and this one have increased dramatically the number of special needs teachers by over 1,000. I am not saying that fulfils the needs of every school. There has been an enormous increase in the service within schools and communities and in the national service.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">As has been pointed out, there are still some major difficulties regarding people with intellectual disabilities in school care, residential care and home care, which I acknowledge. This year, given a difficult capital programme, the Government endeavoured to deal with that on the capital, pay and non-pay sides. We have provided over 1,500 new day care places in recent years. Many non-residential places have also been created.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">I have met a number of the groups associated with autism, not those the Deputy mentioned, and we will continue to try to deal with the matter. The Deputy would admit that, in the past three or four years in particular, the increases in resources, staff, equipment and structures for children with autism have been enormous. I will take on board the concerns of the Deputy and others to try to continue to increase the number of places for children with autism.</p>

          <p eId="para_74">I cannot acknowledge the Taoiseach's response that there has been a significant improvement in the provision of resources for children with special needs in the past two or three years. The reality denies that claim. The families who protested outside the North-Eastern Health Board offices on Monday, and those who will protest outside this House today, will find it impossible to recognise the picture the Taoiseach painted in his reply. I ask the Taoiseach again to affirm that he will take the necessary action and intervene to prompt both the Ministers for Education and Science and Health and Children to address the issue of special needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">We are talking about resources for children. Just to show how mean-spirited and penny-pinching is the current attitude towards children, I refer to the decision of the Minister for Education and Science to stop completely the physical education and sports grant, which amounted to a mere €2.5 million.</p>

          <p eId="para_78">There are almost 1,000 teachers dealing with autism. Additionally, there are 3,500 special needs assistants working in classrooms. The Deputy will acknowledge that that represents a huge increase over a short period because we came from a position in which there were hardly any special needs teachers or assistants. Both Deputies Martin and Woods, as Minister and former Minister for Health and Children, changed that quickly. There were under 100 special needs teachers in the State and they increased this number to over 1,000; they also increased the number of special needs assistants to 3,500.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">In addition, an enormous number of extra training places were provided in the fields of physiotherapy, speech and language training and occupational therapy. Many of the relevant issues in this respect are addressed on a statutory basis in the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill. Discussion have been ongoing with the organisations dealing with disabilities groups. They have outlined what they would like to see in the legislation. They have also acknowledged the huge increases and have made 68 submissions the content of which they want reflected in the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">I acknowledge that sufficient resources do not exist in every part of country because we have moved from having little or nothing four years ago. We shall continue to make progress but we should acknowledge what has been achieved.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_98">I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 10, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_99">The public service modernisation programme is co-ordinated by the implementation group of Secretaries General, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department. The different strands of the modernisation programme are overseen by sub-groups of the implementation group, including the high-level group on regulation and the quality customer service working group, both of which also operate under the aegis of my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">As I informed the House in my reply of 26 November 2002, the high-level group on regulation has made considerable progress since its establishment in May 2001, following publication of the OECD review on regulatory reform in Ireland. The group has met 15 times to date and reported to Government on its progress in November 2002. The report, "Better Regulation", is available on my Department's website. The next meeting of the high-level group will take place on 20 March.</p>
          <p eId="para_101">The group has focused on two areas in particular. First, it has begun the process of framing a national policy statement on better regulation through the publication of the public consultation document, "Towards Better Regulation". The consultation document was designed to highlight the key issues that are likely to feature in the national policy statement and to promote public debate and awareness in relation to better regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_102">The consultation document sets out the key questions we need to address in considering why we regulate, what we need to regulate and new approaches to governance in a global economy. It is important to emphasise that this process is not about resolving micro-level regulatory issues or specific market problems. Rather, it is about giving us a set of core principles to guide future regulation and policy-making.</p>
          <p eId="para_103">The consultation process was widely publicised in the media, through Government websites, seminars and presentations. Approximately 4,000 copies of the consultation document were distributed and 89 submissions were received from a wide variety of interested parties. A full list of submissions is available on my Department's website.</p>
          <p eId="para_104">To inform the subsequent formulation of the national policy statement, these submissions have been studied and analysed. My Department has recently published a booklet containing two papers, the first of which summarises the submissions received and the second offers an independent analysis and commentary on the submissions by an independent economist. More than 1,000 booklets have been sent to interested parties and copies have been placed in the Oireachtas Library. A drafting group composed of senior officials from key Departments held its first meeting at the end of January to commence preparation of a draft national policy statement. While a specific date for publication has not been set, it is anticipated that the draft text of the statement will be submitted to the Government in early summer with a view to publication some weeks later.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">The second priority of the high level group has been to develop a system of regulatory impact analysis as recommended by the OECD in its report. RIA is a policy tool designed to identify and quantify, where possible, the impact of new and existing regulations. A working group of officials has been developing a suitable model for the Irish context. The group has recommended piloting the model in a small number of volunteer Departments and the preparation of detailed guidance material and supports. It has also recommended the devising and delivery of a programme of awareness and training to inform civil servants and other interested parties about RIA. Steps are being taken to implement these recommendations. The publication of a White Paper on regulation in 2003 and the introduction of RIA across Government Departments are two of the commitments on regulatory reform made in the proposed social partnership agreement Sustaining Progress. Significant progress has been made in the area of better regulation since the establishment of the high level group last year and I look forward to a continuation of this trend in the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">The quality customer service working group was established in 1999 to oversee the development of the quality customer service initiative. The working group is chaired by Mr. Frank Daly, chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, and includes officials from Departments and offices as well as representatives of trade union, business, consumer and equality interests. A number of sub-groups have been established to address specific aspects of customer service. The group continues to develop policies to ensure improvements in the level of service the public receives from the Civil Service. The group has published 12 principles of quality customer service for customers of the public service and established the QCS officers network to support the work of those directly involved in promoting and delivering the QCS agenda in individual Departments. In consultation with the Equality Authority, it published a support pack on the equality and diversity aspects of quality customer service and commissioned an independent evaluation of the customer action plans produced by Departments and offices. Lansdowne Market Research was commissioned to conduct a survey of satisfaction with the level of service received from the Civil Service. A copy of the survey results has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">The evaluation of action plans and the overall strategic management initiative was carried out by PA Consulting. It concluded that considerable improvements have been achieved in the level of customer service provided by the Civil Service. The survey by Lansdowne Market Research found that there was a very high level of satisfaction with the Civil Service generally, with 79% of the public being very or fairly satisfied with the level of service received. A range of recommendations for further improvement were made on foot of these evaluations and the group has drawn up a work programme to implement them.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">On 11 December last, I spoke at a major conference on QCS in the Civil Service and asked every Department and office to publish a charter of service standards. This should set out the clear standards of service to which the Department or office is committed. These standards should be established following consultation with customers and staff and the achievement of the standards should be evaluated and reported on in annual reports. This charter initiative builds on the achievements of the QCS initiative to date and will reinforce the efforts Departments and offices are already making. The QCS working group is currently preparing detailed guidelines and supports to assist Departments in implementing the initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">While the improvements in the level of customer service depend ultimately on the commitment of management and staff of each Department and office, the QCS working group has helped to deliver significant improvements over the last few years. Its support for the roll-out of customer charters and the remainder of its work programme will ensure many further improvements.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">In answer to Deputy Durkan's question about delivery of targets set in the strategic management initiative, the evaluation carried out by PA Consulting made a series of recommendations to ensure its full implementation. In response to the evaluation, the implementation group of secretaries general is preparing a new vision, strategy and action plan for the modernisation of the Civil Service. The recommendations set out in the evaluation with regard to specific aspects of SMI formed part of the negotiations on modernisation of the Civil Service in the context of the implementation of the benchmarking report. The measures agreed in these negotiations will significantly advance the reform process. The issues raised in the evaluation are also being addressed by the relevant sub-groups of the implementation body.</p>
          <p eId="para_111">Much progress has been made on the better regulation and quality customer service initiatives as part of the overall public service modernisation programme. I look forward to substantial further progress in these projects and other strands of the modernisation programme during the lifetime of this Government. I expect them to further the development of partnership in the Civil Service.</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_71">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_112">I thank the Taoiseach for his lengthy reply which I will read two or three times in order to absorb all of the information contained in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">The OECD report published in April 2001 advocated changes to legislation relating to public houses, pharmacies and gas and electricity supply, while calling for more accountability for regulators. Does the Taoiseach accept that the Government's inability to deal with the problems highlighted in the report is contributing to Ireland's lack of competitiveness and a high rate of inflation? Is the Taoiseach concerned that two years after the publication of the report, Ireland has slipped from 11th to 24th place in the world competitiveness ranking? We read yesterday that the price of electricity is to rise by 9%, which is almost twice the rate of inflation, while ESB bills have increased steeply by 13%. The deregulation of the gas and energy sectors which was recommended by the OECD has been ineffective in that consumers and businesses are paying more as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">Is the Taoiseach concerned that several prospective service providers have withdrawn from this market because of the pace and nature of deregulation? The result is that energy shortages are a real possibility. A number of weeks ago, our entire electricity capacity came close to being over extended and this could do serious damage to our reputation as a State capable of accommodating industrial expansion. Is the Government focused on attracting market entrants to ensure that we have adequate capacity in the electricity generation sector?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_72">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_115">Bord Gáis and the ESB are undertaking substantial capital investment programmes to avoid shortages and to ensure they do not encounter difficulties in the future. The latest information indicates that the capacity concerns of a few years ago should prove unfounded. There are some problems with infrastructural programmes in the north-west and the companies are anxious to get on top of them. The regulator sets their standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">The OECD made many recommendations when it was brought in to assist us with our analysis of our methods and procedures. During 1999, an enormous amount of work was carried out to discover how we could do things better. The OECD recommended that we construct a rigorous model of regulatory impact analysis to ensure that we examine the potential impact of a regulation before it is introduced. A model is being established with which people will have to comply when designing or considering changes to regulations or when they are proposing deregulation. The model involves examining alternative options, compliance costs, benefits, enforcement and economic and social inputs while consulting with the relevant persons. Instead of discovering five or ten years after changes have been made that there was a better way of doing things, an audit of best practice will be carried out in advance. The detailed and complicated OECD report set out ways in which we could work to find a user-friendly, proportionate and appropriate model for the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">Deputy Kenny asked about some of the areas being examined such as pharmacy, professional services, liquor licensing. That work is not being carried out by my Departmental group but obviously it has an interest in what happens in these areas. The pharmacy study is looking at the public and interest group consultation, analysing the existing position as a result of the changes made last year when the present regulations were found to be <i>ultra vires.</i>Deputy Kenny is correct about professional services. The Competition Authority is completing work on a study of the professional services. That report is due before Easter. The study deals with eight professional groups – doctors, dentists, vets, optometrists, solicitors, barristers, engineers and architects. It has been shown that competitive practices in the services area and in the professional services area have an effect on inflationary trends.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">The group studying liquor licensing has produced three interim reports to date. The first report was published in 2001 and dealt with off-licensing. The second interim report was published last year. The third report on admission and service in licensed premises was published in December. To answer the Deputy's question, there has been a positive effect in helping the competitiveness of the economy through better regulation. It is already bearing fruit in areas which the Competition Authority has examined in recent years. Other countries such as New Zealand and France did a great deal of work of this nature and we are the third country to undertake regulatory analysis. It must be built into the system now. I answered the question about the quality customer service working group in my reply.</p>

        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_73">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_119">Will the Taoiseach not agree with me that the problem here is that these reports and studies have an administrative focus rather than a focus on the economics of regulation and competition? As a result, no action is being taken in an economy that is transparently not competitive. It is losing competitiveness, prices are running very high, inflation is twice the European average and yet we are discussing reports. The Taoiseach refers to the fact that the liquor licensing report is the third report on that area alone. Is it not the case that there are areas of the economy where it is obvious that competition does not apply? Are we not entitled on this side of the House to be sceptical about promises to tackle the question of professional services?</p>
          <p eId="para_120">The Government leads on areas like legal services. The previous Attorney General negotiated headline rates for barristers on a <i>per diem</i> basis that are beyond the wildest imagination of the average person. Even if it is the case that the very top lawyers can earn very high rates in normal litigation, surely the Taoiseach agrees with me that this was never contemplated for tribunals that are running for longer than the Second World War? How can there be any basis for confidence that the Government will tackle any of these vested interests? Is it not the case that we are focusing on the bureaucracy of regulation, not the economics of regulation or competition?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_74">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_121">Apart from the work of the tribunals, I assure Deputy Rabbitte that the work of the Competition Authority in considering the professional services will produce a very detailed report with detailed recommendations. It will set out what action is necessary in these areas to make them more competitive. Many areas have been regulated to remove restrictive practices over the years, areas where costs had been driven up and people had been stopped moving into those areas. Both this Government and the previous Government have tackled a number of these groups but behind every one of them is large vested interests. I cannot blame them for trying to protect their interests. Steps have been taken to open up the pharmacy service but everyone is aware of the campaign in that area. We are aware of what happened in the taxi industry and in the case of off-licences and liquor licensing. It can be predicted that when the Competition Authority and the Government agencies move to implement the report, there will be plenty of difficulties. There are already examples of people getting ready to fight off the issue. Many of these areas have been regulated and, for example, the Tánaiste is involved in the regulation of the insurance industry. Regulation has resulted in issues of competitiveness, potential savings and better value for money for consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">I know what Deputy Rabbitte means when he says there is an administrative focus. The high level group on regulation in my Department deals with the administrative end of the issue. The group is endeavouring to look at existing regulation and to find a model which will avoid restrictive and non-competitive practices. This is the point set out in the reports. The group has examined areas where there is regulation that is too bureaucratic and probably not necessary and in many cases could be more user-friendly and simpler. If it was simpler, more people would have access to the industry in question and there would be more competition. More competition makes an economy more effective.</p>
          <p eId="para_123">I cannot disagree with the Deputy on the cost of legal fees. I do not think that a <i>per diem</i> arrangement for fees was ever visualised for the system that we have. Deputy Rabbitte may have some sympathy for me because in September 1997 I did not think all the inquiries I set up in that autumn would still be running in the new millennium. They are still going strong and God knows when they will end. The Minister for Finance has strong views on this matter and I know he has been in consultation with the Attorney General regarding those matters. The <i>per diem</i> rate was based on the view that a barrister would be away from the Law Library for a short period which would take him away from normal business and I can understand the logic of that reasoning. Obviously that is not what is happening now. I can tell the Deputy that the matter is not being ignored but neither is it easy to change.</p>

          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_124">Will the Taoiseach agree there is a flaw in the regulatory process which deals with energy? With the onset of the energy regulator the incentive to conserve energy that used to exist within the ESB is now giving way to the need to compete in generation of energy. Will the Taoiseach agree that difficulty is compounding the problem when the ESB has taken the opportunity to build a 500 megawatts station in Spain but it cannot do so in Ireland because of the regulatory system? As Deputy Kenny said, we have a crisis in terms of meeting our energy supply demands. Will the Taoiseach agree there is a need to look at the energy sector in particular and recognise that it needs to be within State control for the sake of national interests and national security? We have a problem relating to climate change as well as in energy provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">Will the Taoiseach ensure that budgetary constraints, for example, the abolition of tax breaks for wind energy construction, are looked at again? Ireland is unique in the European Union in having this competition system which is strangling the potential of the renewable energy sector. We need the energy. A thousand megawatts are ready to go yet competition will only allow 500 megawatts. Will the Taoiseach recognise that while regulatory reform might be appropriate to many areas, it is not appropriate to energy? He should work with his colleagues to reverse the budgetary decisions made which are strangling renewable energy and should recognise that energy regulation is not the most appropriate way to deal with this sector.</p>

          <p eId="para_130">Our position is to look at it overall and not just from the wind energy aspect. If we could up our capacity we could also export energy. I understand there are private sector people involved who are prepared to invest in both the onshore and offshore areas. The Minister is prepared to consider that. The Deputy suggested that the solution might be to restore tax breaks but large businesses could use their business tax arrangements anyway. The issue is that we do not get cheaper energy. The likelihood is that energy costs will be dearer if we go this way. I am not against that but it must be taken into consideration. The companies engaged in this and the experts who have analysed it say—</p>

Denmark uses 15% renewable energy whereas we have only a small percentage. The cost involved must be considered against the Kyoto fines which will come down the tracks soon. I support the change in culture that is required and the Minister is actively engaged in trying to resolve the difficulty. Since we last addressed the issue during Question Time the Minister for Finance has taken an interest in the matter and has started looking at the trade off between one side and the other.</p>

          <p eId="para_135">It is precisely on a few of the general principles of the OECD report on regulatory reform that I want to ask the Taoiseach some questions. One of the bottlenecks identified in the report is physical infrastructure. Does the Taoiseach agree that traffic chaos throughout the country is a serious problem for the economy? Is Government policy, which devotes more funding to roads rather than to public transport, compounding the problem along with his Minister for Transport's penchant for privatising existing public services?</p>
          <p eId="para_136">A principle laid down as a key factor in the report is that the economic future should be predicated on less labour and more productivity. Does the Taoiseach agree that this poses difficulties for workers if it is carried out to the extent promoted in the report? It is already putting pressure on the lives of workers and their families.

The liberalisation of public-private services is another principle which was pushed in the report – a code word for privatisation.

It is intended for use in Departments to ensure that our legislative proposals are well founded and do not have unintended costs or other impacts for consumers, businesses or other groups in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">We are spending €0.5 billion on public transport this year. The rail transport review is in the process of presentation and we have put an enormous amount of money into it. The economy has doubled over the period of a decade and that is bound to create congestion. Regulatory impact analysis is not a means of privatisation. It seeks to look and see if there are ways of doing things better, more efficiently or in a more cost effective manner. Everything has to be looked at that way. It also considers the impact on quality of life. The Minister's review will deal with all of those issues. No doubt the OECD report impinges on how we look at things. How things were done in the past, how they are done now and how they will be done in the future is different.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">Any other specific question should be addressed to the Minister. We live in a changed environment. We should not just look at what the OECD says. We must look afresh and should not take an ideological view that competition or regulation automatically mean the privatisation of assets.

We appear to have slipped down the table in international comparative studies in the past six or seven years. We have gone from a position where we were extremely competitive on the international scene in the delivery of services to one where we are now cluttered up with reports and commissions, each attempting to identify the cause of the bottleneck.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">Will the Taoiseach take any initiative to direct the various Ministers with responsibility for this area with a view to achieving more competitiveness? While I will not go into detail, the insurance industry is a classic example of where there is currently a total absence of competition.</p>

          <p eId="para_151">What is interesting about the competitiveness survey is that we were as high as number three or four and we are still number one across a range of areas. While there are areas where we have dropped dramatically there are other areas where we were never that high, such as in the area of investment in technology. While we are very good in some aspects of technology, in other areas we are not. I continue to drive forward Departments and agencies to improve our position.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">We recently made a significant investment in broadband. There was a direct investment of €65 million by the State, which does not reflect the true figure because a number of statutory agencies were involved such as the ESB and CIE. All of the private companies in the communications area are working together under a report prepared by Ira Magaziner to try to get broadband moving. Some 19 areas have been identified and there is a huge amount of work still to be done. We are in a low position in this area which probably affects us most in terms of our competitiveness. However, we can improve our position over a few years. This will require investment not just by the State – we also need to get private companies involved. I am grateful that they have come back into this area having pulled out of it for three or four years because of losses on 3G licences.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">Another area that is taken into account is our ability to transport our goods cost-effectively. We are very strong in this, as we are with our tax mechanisms. I agree with Deputy Durkan that we have to continually look at the areas where we are weak and try to maintain the areas in which we are strong to keep ourselves up there in regard to competitiveness. One of the biggest factors affecting our competitiveness is wage rates and, unfortunately, we are very high in that regard.</p>

The use of technology in regard to broadband can help to address this matter. The CSO comes under the remit of the Taoiseach's Department but it has not been reformed in regard to the use of technology. A huge amount of manpower hours in small businesses is tied up trying to fulfil the regulations and paperwork involved with the CSO. No action has yet been taken in that area.

          <p eId="para_170">In regard to Deputy Naughten's general point, the whole idea is to look at alternative options, costs and benefits, economic and social inputs and to have consultations with clients in order to avoid getting ourselves into positions where a cartel or monopoly is built up or where areas which one cannot regulate develop.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">Deputy Kenny asked a question in regard to regulators and how we will handle this area in future. The point has been raised that there should be standards and that they should deal with everybody, in so far as is possible, in an equal way. We started off with just one or two but now it has become a cumbersome area. When David Byrne was Attorney General he put proposals to Ministers and into the public domain that this issue be dealt with, some of which has happened. They operate in different areas and are independent but there should be an overall umbrella body of standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">Deputy Joe Higgins asked a question in regard to the monopolies. As he knows, it was the courts that decided on the taxi issue. That is where it was struck down at that time. As I said, the report of the Competition Authority is imminent in regard to the professional services study, which will deal with the areas of doctors, dentists, vets, solicitors, barristers, engineers, architects and so on. It will be a challenge for these groups to implement the recommendations of the report. We will come back to this again in a very short time. It is important that we deal with this area which is why the Government commissioned the Competition Authority report. Inflation figures show an increase in costs in this area. The Tánaiste has already set out what she is doing in regard to the insurance industry and is following through in the implementation of the various issues that she raised last October.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">I agree, if I understand the question correctly, that we should not have competition for ideological reasons or deregulate no matter what. There are some areas where that may not be possible and by breaking up monopolies one sometimes creates difficulties. The general European view is that there is no area where that is the case but our view is to tread carefully. At the same time when one treads too carefully one can get a poorer service and not a lot of activity. One has to move on. In Ireland we are open to the criticism that in some cases we have lived with regulation for too long. A number of Ministers are now tackling these problems which are not easy. However, we should not force deregulation in areas where it does not make sense.</p>

The recent appointment of a Deputy Editor with responsibility for committees and the filling of seven reporter vacancies in the debates office has resulted in the clearing of a considerable backlog of committee work and will lead to an earlier publication of transcripts. In general the "blacks", the unedited version of committee proceedings, are available the following Monday on request from the debates office and this was the case in respect of the particular meetings to which Deputies referred last week and yesterday. However, to improve the service to Members I am making arrangements to provide access to them through the House network in that format in the future. I remind Deputies to bear in mind that the "blacks" are, as I have said, unedited first drafts and are liable to be corrected. Fully edited transcripts should be available within one to two weeks. While this is longer than the time taken with regard to Dáil or Seanad transcripts, it is normal practice to allow time for witnesses to see their transcripts.</p>

We have also seen the launch of the End of Child Poverty Coalition, bringing together a wide range of groups which are committed, in a way the Government clearly is not, to eliminating child poverty. It was the Government's decision to ignore child poverty in the last budget, and in real terms that is certainly what it did. It is perhaps the most striking example of stroke politics at its worst. In the programme for Government, it promised a programme of multi-annual increases in child benefit to ensure the combined value of child support is increased in line with its commitment under the national anti-poverty strategy. The four year progress report stated that one of the key priorities is to bring forward a programme to effectively address child poverty and that the Government is committed to exceeding this PPF target by dramatically increasing child benefit over the three years of the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">This year – 2003 – the last year of this promised programme, should have seen an increase of €31.80 per month, €38.10 for the higher rate, in child benefit. This is an allowance which many see as the fairest and most effective way of supporting low income families caught in the poverty trap. It would also have been an ideal opportunity to remove another anomaly by making the new rates applicable from January 2003, in line with the welfare and tax year. However, the pledge to seriously tackle child poverty seems to have got lost in the Bill before us. The Government is increasing child benefit by what amounts in real terms to 54 cent a week. Yet during the budget debate, backbenchers were tripping over themselves to announce how pleased they and their constituents were with the extra 54 cent. I know the Irish are famous throughout the football world for partying, but one could hardly imagine spontaneous street parties taking place anywhere to celebrate a 54 cent increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">The truth is that the Government chose to ignore child poverty and failed in its commitment to deliver on this area. We see the results every day. This morning, throughout the State, children went to school hungry, some of them cold and poorly dressed. Some 90,000 Irish children live in consistent poverty, and almost a quarter of a million in relative poverty, in what is supposed to be one of the wealthiest countries in the world. The Government has a tendency to ignore relative poverty while focusing exclusively on consistent poverty. I recall a Fianna Fáil backbencher challenging the figures of an Opposition spokesperson during the budget debate on the grounds that the figures used referred to relative poverty. Let me be clear, relative poverty means children without proper clothes or food, children who go to school hungry and who are deprived of certain essentials of life. We should ignore this artificial distinction between relative and consistent poverty, which is a distinction almost unique to this State. Poverty is poverty, and whatever name one wants to put on it, the Government will ignore it just the same. It is true that children were targeted in the last budget. They were targeted for cutbacks in the form of broken promises made in terms of child benefit and greater access to medical cards.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">I welcome the move in this legislation to broaden the scope of the child dependant allowance, but it has remained at this level since 1994. According to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the absence of an increase in this allowance effectively means a 6% cut in income for the poorest families, amounting to 400,000 children. According to Focus Ireland, there are 1,100 homeless children in Dublin alone, 600 of whom are under the age of five. They are among the thousands of children forced to beg on the streets for money or to rely on charity simply for a decent breakfast. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to these charity workers, particularly the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, who fill the gap left by the State's failure to provide accessible quality public services.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">On Monday, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul launched a report which highlighted the educational disadvantage many of these children experience. Low income families are unable to afford basic educational expenses such as school books and other classroom materials. The society makes the point, which has been made by others many times, including Sinn Féin, that until the unequal and unfair distribution of wealth is tackled, educational disadvantage will continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">There are also other developments in social welfare which need to be addressed. Over the past couple of weeks, I have been contacted by students throughout the country incensed at the decision of the Department of Social and Family Affairs to scrap the back to education allowance for post-graduate students. On budget day, the Department supplied every TD with a list of increases in many social welfare allowances. While we are all grateful for this, there was no mention of the removal of the back to education allowance for post-graduates. Several students and their union officials throughout the country were surprised to learn of its removal. I have also been unable to find any mention of this decision on the Department's web page. Perhaps in future it might consider providing all the information needed by both TDs and claimants, rather than just the material on which they hope the media will focus. Some sort of explanation as to why post-graduates have been targeted and have had an avenue of access to education closed off to them would be most welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">The extent of the failure of budget 2003, and consequently the legislation before us, was clearly shown in a report obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. An internal departmental memo accepted that the increases in social welfare in the budget fell far below what was required for the Government to live up to the pledges it made in the programme for Government and the national anti-poverty strategy. The anti-poverty strategy is another objective to be piled on the mountain of the Government's broken promises.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">Let us put this Bill in context. There have been substantial increases in the cost of living in the past few months. Price increases have hit households which depend on social welfare payments. Recently we have seen increases in public transport fares, the cost of private rented accommodation, a 22% increase in the monthly drug payments scheme, a 26% increase in the cost of casualty department fees and an incredible 21% increase in the cost of electricity since 2001. On Monday night we heard the news that gas prices are to increase by 9%. Together with this there are all the regressive stealth taxes introduced by the Minister for Finance on ATM and credit cards.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">The Government has yet to find a CE scheme it could not cut; some 5,000 places are gone, in addition to the 5,000 public sector jobs cut by the Minister in the recent budget. These decisions will be the most difficult for the low paid and people on social welfare.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">These are the people who have benefited most from CE schemes only to find these schemes abandoned by Government. The people involved in them have been treated with contempt, despite the incredible work they have done in their communities. They will be forced to rely more and more on the public sector which is not only experiencing cutbacks but is now set to have 5,000 workers thrown on the dust heap.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">From cuts in the top rate of tax to cuts in corporation tax and capital gains tax over the past five budgets, the richest 10% of the population has received 25% of the benefits while the poorest 20% has received a mere 5%. While Sinn Féin acknowledges the economy is not as strong as it was 12 months ago, this State is still comparatively wealthy. The Government should have made the choice to redistribute the wealth of this State to look after those who have been abandoned by the rising economic tide which has lifted far fewer boats than the Government admits.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">The gap between rich and poor has widened. Poverty is on the increase and this is now one of the most unequal States in the first world. The Government will claim there is not enough money to do all we propose. The truth is the money is there but the real question is, does the Government have the political will to deliver? Does it have the will to put the needs of the most vulnerable, the poor, the hungry and the sick before the desires of the better off in society? From the legislation necessary to enforce the decisions of the Minister for Finance, the answer is clear that it does not.</p>

        <speech by="#JamesBreen" eId="spk_233">
          <from>Mr. J. Breen</from>
          <p eId="para_308">In dealing with this Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2003, the Government has lost touch with reality. An increase of €6 to €11 per week for people in receipt of social welfare pensions is an insult. Since the budget was introduced last December, there have been mini-budgets on a daily basis. For instance, where councils have privatised refuse collections, where there is no waiver for old age pensioners and where the increase, in some cases, has gone from €240 to €360, what good is this increase in social welfare? The price of petrol, diesel, heating oil and gas has increased.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">People with children with special needs did not receive an increase from the Department of Health and Children. The increase for old age pensions and contributory pensions should be rounded up to at least €260. Child benefit under section 3 should be rounded up to €130 and €160, respectively. In regard to the carer's allowance, the means test for people looking after loved ones in their own homes should be abolished. If someone being looked after at home was institutionalised, it would cost the State €160,000 plus per year. In areas where it is hard to get respite care and where there is no help or relief for the carer, surely the carer should be entitled to this allowance? People on long-term disability payments do not get a Christmas bonus. Also, where claims have been disallowed, people must lodge an appeal. The length of time taken to determine an appeal should be reduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">There is an anomaly in the Bill which has not been addressed. A widow in receipt of the widow's and the blind person's pensions loses the blind person's pension when she reaches old age thus reducing her income by 50%. Given the small number involved, the Minister should allow such people to keep the blind person's pension.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">In regard to dental benefits, resolution of the dispute means a further increase for people on PRSI which is totally unjust. How can those on the average industrial wage with young families afford this increase? This Government has lost touch with ordinary citizens. Will the Minister refund those who had dental treatment during the dispute and who are rightly entitled to such treatment?</p>
          <p eId="para_312">In regard to the back to school allowance, will the same rate apply to all children regardless of age? Surely a person entitled to rent allowance should be able to draw this allowance regardless of from whom they rent? If they rent from a relative, they are not entitled to the allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">I know the community employment scheme is not under the Minister's remit but she will be left to carry the bill. Men and women employed in these schemes and who took pride in what they were doing for their communities have been plunged back on to the dole queue because of the reduction in the community employment schemes. Where is the saving to the Exchequer? Some of these people will draw social welfare payments for the rest of their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">After a period of enormous economic prosperity, this Government has done nothing to help the most vulnerable in our society. What plans are in place to help the homeless in our towns and villages? This is a matter which needs urgent attention. When walking to my place of rest last night, I met a young lad of 15 years of age who had been tossed out on the street by his godmother two nights ago. When I asked him where he was staying, he said he was sleeping in a doorway, yet we have plenty. I ask this Government to address the issue of homelessness in our towns. I hope the Minister will see the homeless are looked after.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatCarey" eId="spk_234">
          <from>Mr. Carey</from>
          <p eId="para_315">I wish to share my time with Deputy Ardagh.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">As the Minister said in her concluding remarks last night, this Bill builds on the work of the previous Government in the area of social inclusion, it is part of the Government's programme and it is grounded in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">I listened with increasing despondency to the contribution of Deputy Crowe. I know what Sinn Féin is against but I am at a loss to know what it is in favour of. When Deputy Crowe's colleagues were Ministers in the Northern Ireland administration, and they were very able Ministers, they were able to take decisions. They took decisions in the health area in which expenditure is limited. They took decisions not to go ahead with hospitals and to close down certain facilities. One of their members was education minister and made some very brave decisions in relation to the eleven plus examination. They are decisions similar to those a Minister in our administration must take.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">We could go on for some time talking philosophically and ideologically about what the social welfare system should be about. We must strike a balance between schemes in which people are legitimately given money to take them out of poverty, whether consistent or relative poverty – it is no consolation for a sociologist to say somebody is consistently or relatively poor because they are still poor by their own standards – and schemes administered by the Department which have been introduced over the years by Members on both sides and which I regard as very enlightened schemes. I compliment people such as Deputy Woods, Deputy Dermot Ahern, Deputy Durkan and Proinsias De Rossa MEP who promoted schemes, such as VTOS, during their tenure in the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">We talk about social inclusion measures. This Government, as did the previous one, set up a Cabinet Subcommittee on Social Inclusion which meets regularly. It has provided significant funds to areas of considerable disadvantage. To advert to what Deputy Crowe said, does he even know what is happening in his own constituency? There are programmes such as the Springboard initiative, which provides services for parents and children at risk, and the breakfast clubs. I acknowledge the contribution made by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Barnardos and others towards the success of those programmes which are in operation in many areas throughout the country. I recognise that, in many cases, funding is relatively small but that the impact of these programmes is significant because they are delivered, by and large, by committed people working voluntarily. We should not have to hire professional full-time people to do everything. In fact, some of the best programmes are delivered efficiently by voluntary groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">The clothing allowance, which is important particularly to people in working class areas, has been increased by €30 to €150 for children aged 12 years and over. Child benefit has gone up significantly, although we would all have liked to have seen an even more significant increase. The family income supplement thresholds have been significantly increased. All the increases outlined make a difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">I compliment the Minister on the resolution of the dispute with the Irish Dental Association. It was unfortunate that the dispute took place but I compliment the Minister and the association on reaching a resolution. I am pleased an independent review will be carried out on aspects of the scheme. For example, price lists will be displayed, which will be important. Dentists who were quick to send letters to Members outlining how much PRSI workers paid them over and above what they ought to have, will participate again in the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">I refer to enabling measures in which the Department is involved. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions centres throughout the State do great work. There is a significant network of them and in my constituency they deliver the most innovative programmes in the education sector. For example, they run the opt-in programme, which is as good as any school completion programme. Young people who would not otherwise be in the school system are supported by the programme. The money advice and budgeting service is supported significantly by the Department and it has established a number of development offices that support other centres in Leinster and help them to be more effective. These services are not recognised and they should be acknowledged as significant initiatives taken by the Department and the Government to remove people from consistent or relative poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">Education programmes are important and I compliment the Department for being more daring and brave than the Department of Education and Science in pushing out the boundaries in this regard. All of us know long-term unemployed people who left school early and found that the education system had failed them but who returned to full-time education. Very often they began with low literacy and numeracy skills but they went through the system completing the junior and leaving certificates over a number of years. Some have broken through the glass ceiling. I know one young lady who having left school at 13 or 14 has been called to train as a primary teacher, something to which I aspired while in school. She has deferred her training for a year because she wants to specialise in the charter of fundamental rights, which many Members might not have time to discuss. I know other early school leavers who are lecturing, practising at the bar, working in the IT sector or who have improved the quality of their lives and supported their families thus ensuring that they, in turn, can participate and remain in the education system.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">I will defend the Department's interventions and its lack of capacity on occasion to deliver as much as I would like in monetary terms for certain programmes when I see the good work it does in association with the Department of Education and Science. It is a partnership, which involves a hugely influential multi-agency approach. Another enabling measure involving the Department is the support of families through the Family Support Agency. A groundbreaking survey was published recently by Kieran McKeown in association with ACCORD which identified the issues relating to family break-up and so on that need to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">The Minister has made progress in regard to the child dependant allowance. It is one issue on which Deputy Crowe and myself might agree. There is a need for further targeting of people who are not able to re-enter the workforce to take up the allowance. This issue ought to be delivered on as soon as possible. The provisions in the legislation will contribute to the improvement in the quality of life of a significant number of people and I compliment the Minister and the Government in this regard.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanArdagh" eId="spk_235">
          <from>Mr. Ardagh</from>
          <p eId="para_326">The Minister, in her budget speech, said the 1916 proclamation included the ideal of resolving "to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation and all its parts, cherishing all the children of the nation equally". I am proud to be a member of the party and Government which have responded to that call and delivered on it in many respects. Between 1997 and 2003 there has been an increase of €4.5 billion in social welfare payments, which exceed €10 billion overall. This is a caring Government. We care about children, families, the elderly, carers and other social welfare recipients and the Government has done well.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">The weakness of the Opposition did not create an obstacle to the social progress made by the Government. An oxymoron was published as a headline recently for an article that suggested the leader of the second least small party in Opposition, Labour, had signalled an alliance of his party with the least small Opposition party, Fine Gael, while at the same time suggesting that he would bring back a wealth tax. It is not the greatest start but it is good that he has set out his stall and there is a possibility of the two parties coming together. This is in the interest of improving parliamentary accountability and effectiveness and it would be beneficial if both parties came together to form a reasonably sized, cohesive Opposition. It would be good for all parties, the House and the nation. I wish Labour and Fine Gael well in their deliberations on that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">Deputy Crowe suggested the Government's theme was other than it is but there are many themes to its work. One theme is to tackle child poverty while, at the same time, giving options to parents in the provision of child care. I am delighted that since 2000, child benefit for the first and second child has increased by €71 to €125 a month and for the third and subsequent children by €86.20 to €157 a month. The draft of the new partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, contains a commitment to ensure further substantial increases will be paid in child benefit in 2004 and 2005. The footwear and back to school clothing allowances have been increased by €30 to €150, which is a substantial increase of 25% for children aged 12 and over while the allowance is €80 for children aged between two and 11. These are necessary payments for parents when children are returning to school.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">Since 1997 another theme in the Government partners' programme has been to improve the lot of pensioners. Without the efforts of our senior citizens who have made a fantastic contribution over the years in the evolution of the State we would not be where we are and the Government has repaid them by increasing payments to them. The Government has also made a commitment that by 2007 the old age pension will increase to €200 per week. This provision was included in the programme for Government and also features in Sustaining Progress, the proposed new partnership agreement. Exemption limits for senior citizens have increased to €15,000 for a single person and €30,000 for a married couple. Elderly people have, since I entered politics, been wondering why they have to pay tax on their pensions given that they paid them in earlier years. The exemption limit of €30,000 for a married couple is to be admired and it is greatly appreciated by most senior citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">Another important provision in the Bill is that people in receipt of social welfare payments will qualify for free schemes if they are living with a person whose income is less than €203 per week. That is a laudable provision. Another theme of the Government has been the care of widows and carers. The income disregard for carers has been increased by 10% to €210 per week for a single person and €420 for a couple. That is a significant provision. The respite care grant has been increased from €635 to €735. That also is a significant increase. A carer taking care of two people will now receive €1,470. The carer's benefit, introduced by the Government in October 2002 allowed people to take a break from work to care for sick relatives. The income disregard in that case has been increased from €95 to €150. That allows the person receiving the benefit to keep in touch with work and people. That, too, is to be lauded.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">Sustaining Progress also includes a commitment to make substantial increases in widow's pension during the lifetime of the proposed partnership agreement. The increases for widows contained in this Bill have been greater than in other cases. The Bill also contains a provision whereby payments will be made to a spouse for six weeks following the death of his or her partner if such person had been in receipt of a number of social welfare allowances and pensions. This, too, is to be applauded.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">We have seen the value of shares and equity drop dramatically in recent times. The underlying value of pensions has also dropped. Fear was expressed that there would be a drift from defined benefit pension schemes to defined contribution schemes. This would be a retrograde step and I am delighted the Minister has included in the Bill a provision for actuaries to make reports in such a way as to ensure it does not act as a catalyst to this undesirable change. Personal retirement savings accounts now in place provide an excellent vehicle for people to supplement their employment pensions.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">The PRSI charge on benefit-in-kind from 1 January 2004 is to be welcomed. It gives greater equity to the whole tax and pay related system. Unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, has dropped substantially during the life of this Government and the previous one. The number of people claiming social welfare payments has decreased. There is a commitment that payments in 2007 will be €150 per week in 2002 terms. That is also included in Sustaining Progress, the proposed new partnership agreement. That, too, is to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">There are a number of other items I wish to speak about. I congratulate the Minister and the Irish Dental Association on their resolution of the dental dispute. A reasonable conclusion was reached. The PPS number will now be used by the Central Statistics Office and that is important in the interests of efficient administration. I would like to ensure that the Official Secrets Act or similar legislation will apply to civil servants who will access this information, particularly those in the CSO. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_342">I find it hard to accept a situation where under the British-Irish Agreement workers in IFI Belfast find themselves in a deplorable situation as employees of a company partly owned by the State. They are totally isolated. For Ministers to ignore that in a time of so-called peace and reconciliation is unacceptable. I know the Minister of State was unable to come to this House when difficulties in that regard were being expressed, but that is another day's work.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">The Government has looked after horse owners and stud farms. Only last week it had to withdraw a proposal to bring into the tax net women in Gaeltacht areas who take care of students for six weeks. At the same time those who ensured Ministers such as Deputy Joe Walsh were returned to their ministerial positions walked scot free. Many people will be waiting in the long grass for Fianna Fáil. It happened to another party and I have no doubt it will happen again.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">On leaving the House this morning I walked past Buswell's Hotel and on to the European Parliament office where I saw a young person lying on the roadside. That young person felt it necessary to sleep on the streets of Dublin last night. The Government says it is interested in an inclusive society and cares for everybody equally, although it is contemplating spending thousands of millions of euros on projects to boost its self-esteem, such as the "Bertie bowl" or the proposed new Government aircraft. I ask it to examine the fact that young and not so young people are homeless on the streets of Dublin and elsewhere, not because of a lack of money, but because of the way in which it is spent.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">On the Bill itself, I have already refuted the claim of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs that the Government is creating an inclusive society. The great difficulties that exist in that regard are exemplified by the fact that although the Government has given an extra €6 to the unemployed and single mothers, the cost of a rented flat has increased by €4.80. It is hard to reconcile an increase of just €1.20, in real terms, with the Minister's use of the word "inclusive". We are constantly reminded that the Government's social welfare expenditure of €10 billion is a massive figure compared to the 1997 one. Deputies should remember, however, that Fianna Fáil has been in Government since 1987, with the exception of just over two years. Members of that party should not blame this country's problems on the events of the rainbow Government's term in office. Fianna Fáil has a long history of mismanaging this country's affairs. It should not be forgotten that unemployment was decreasing and wealth was being created in 1997, but we are now going in the opposite direction as a consequence of the mismanagement of the past five and a half years.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">I welcome the modernisation of the general registry office for child benefit, as it means that decisions on child benefit can be made by an individual without having to go to a deciding officer. This Government has shown itself to be good at increasing the numbers involved in administration, not only in relation to social welfare but right across the community. In the North-Eastern Health Board, 400 extra people are now employed in administration and 100 extra workers, such as nurses, are employed at the coalface. I welcome anything that will improve the delivery of service and ensure that certain problems I have encountered in recent times do not continue. I know of a mother who had to wait four months to receive child benefit, but there have been improvements. Officials involved in social welfare matters are always extremely helpful when Members of the Oireachtas or their staff telephone the Department of Social Welfare. They try their best to deliver a quality service despite the fact that they are under tremendous pressure, as they will say without any fear.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">Previous speakers have mentioned the increase in the respite grant in this Bill. I welcome the fact that the grant will be €735 for one person this year and €1,470 for two. I make no apology for praising the good aspects of this Bill and the Social Welfare Acts generally. If a person dies the day before the cut-off date, however, the loved one who cared for him or her will not receive a respite grant. One has to ask why. I recently encountered the case of a lady who looked after her husband for many years and who received carer's allowance for about three years during that time. Her husband died a day too early to allow her to receive a respite grant for the last year of his life. A person who becomes a carer a few weeks before 5 June receives the grant for a full year. This situation should be rectified and such small-mindedness should not be allowed to continue. I understand that the Department needs to set certain rules, but they are mad in the circumstances I have outlined. The Minister was sympathetic and gave a commitment to look into the matter when I outlined its details to her, but the lady in question has not yet received any money, which is what really counts.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">The Government and the Oireachtas should be conscious of the needs of carers. The issue of subvention for the elderly was raised in the House today. The budgetary problems associated with subvention would not exist if more support was given to carers. While I appreciate that the Department of Social and Family Affairs deals with carers and the Department of Health and Children is responsible for subventions, the Government is responsible for both issues and taxpayers contribute to the funds of both Departments. It is impossible to understand why the care system is so restrictive. If the husband of a women who is looking after her parents or her in-laws dies suddenly, she falls under the contributory widow's system and automatically loses her carer's allowance. Such a person may be quite capable of working in a full-time job and retaining her contributory widow's pension, but she is not entitled to receive any carer's allowance for looking after her parents, her late spouse's parents, or anybody else. I ask the Minister to look at this matter seriously. If a carer is looking after two people, he or she receives full carer's allowance for one person and half the allowance for the other. Can the Minister not find a better solution for the relatively small number of people to whom I refer? She should ensure that people do not have to live in absolute poverty just because they are widowed.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">I admire the courage of a Government Deputy who referred to major improvements that have been made in arrangements for widows. I agree that there has been a slight increase in the widow's pension, but it applies only to those over a certain age. Widows are most in need of social welfare assistance immediately after the death of their spouses, but no increase has been made in the provisions for such people. They are treated as if they are unemployed. Any benefits given to widows or widowers should be provided irrespective of age and at the time when they are most needed. I urge that the problems of widows be treated as a priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">I welcome the important changes in the qualification of the children of those on short-term social welfare benefits. Since the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Government was re-elected, without its four spare wheels, it has increased registration fees in colleges, third level education costs and child maintenance costs. Many people from my constituency had to opt for courses they did not wish to take because they could not afford to live in the city, and that can be substantiated.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">I welcome that those aged over 25 years and living at home have been recognised by an independent body as people in their own right and that a living at home allowance is not taken off them for social welfare purposes. However, I find it difficult to understand why the Minister curtailed this to those over 29 years when the body concerned advised the age of 25. The Minister should explain that and outline how many people aged between 25 and 29 could benefit and what would be the overall cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">I listened with interest to the discussion on the PPS number. Following the expected passage of this Bill, five new agencies will have access to PPS numbers. There was a massive campaign to advertise the PPS number but I do not remember the Minister mentioning, when she advised everyone to obtain a PPS number, that five new agencies would be added to those that have access to it. How necessary is this and how tight will the information be? People are concerned that personal information is freely available and that this information can be drawn down at the touch of a button in Dublin, Brussels or elsewhere, and in some cases used against them.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">I recently came across an example of this with regard to the banks. Somebody signed what they thought was a harmless form to give a 20 year old money to buy a car. Two years later, because a payment or two was not made at the right time, the person who signed the form is now on a black list on a computer and cannot find a way off that list. These are serious matters and people are genuinely worried that enormous damage could be done to their futures when somebody else is at fault. It is much harder to get a name off a computer if it is there for the wrong reasons than it is to get it on for the right reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">I listened with interest last night to the Minister speaking on television about the Pensions Board and its problems. I wish the board well in trying to maintain the value of pensions in the current environment. It is vital that pensions, which people understood they would have for their retirement, be maintained and guaranteed. I know of a recent situation where a person who thought he was to draw €100 plus per week in a few years found that the pension is €30,000 to €35,000 short. It is difficult for a person coming to the end of a working life to find himself or herself in that situation. It is a major problem that the insurance company, which was very brave some 15 years ago at saying what the person would get, now advises the person that the lump sum will be short.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">The cuts in the summer jobs scheme, CE schemes and back to work allowances are critical issues for social welfare and community structures. I have letters on my desk from community groups which are absolutely shattered by Government action. These groups were encouraged by politicians to improve the lot of the elderly and disabled, local towns, villages and rural parishes. Nonetheless, their funding is being severely cut.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">Where is the Government going? Where will young people get the small amount of money from summer jobs that they got in recent years? How will communities work without CE schemes? How much damage has been done to the future for those seeking work following the removal of the back to work allowance?</p>

          <p eId="para_359">I wish the Minister, who is from my neighbouring constituency, well in her remit. This is the first time I have spoken on a Bill for which she has responsibility. I also wish the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, well in his role. The Departments of Social and Family Affairs and Enterprise, Trade and Employment have many links and should link more often than at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">I arrived in the Dáil on 2 April seven years ago, so I am close to an anniversary. At that time, I was in Opposition and watched child benefit increase by £1. I remember checking the price of a bar of chocolate and an apple at that time and realising that £1 was not going to have much effect for any child. Since then, I have been proud to stand on this side of the House and watch the significant increases in social welfare. I have been proud to watch the Department of Social and Family Affairs being aided by the Cabinet with substantial budgets.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">Seven years on, expectations have grown hugely and everyone anticipates that increases each year should be the same or more than the previous year. It is nearly impossible to live up to expectations. I listened to the Opposition decrying the recent increases but it is worthwhile to note the importance of those increases, including the €10 increase per week for pensioners, the €11 increase per week for widows and widowers over 66, the €8 and €10 increase in child benefit, the €7 increase for widows and widowers under 66, the €100 increase in the respite care grant and the increase in the income disregards for carer's allowance. There are many more measures that will make a difference to those receiving them. I accept that we must aspire to give the maximum possible but, if they are related to the situation over a number of years, the recent increases are an important contribution, and I congratulate the Minister on her achievement in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">There are other issues to be addressed. I agree with Deputy Crawford regarding the support needed by widows and widowers under 66 when a spouse dies. I have alluded to the links between the Departments of Social and Family Affairs and Enterprise, Trade and Employment. There should be similar links between the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the health boards with regard to considering the supports required by widows and widowers. That might be in the context of support towards refurbishing a house at the time of a spouse's death. This is a relevant issue because while it is one thing for a household to have one or two incomes, if the main breadwinner dies the means at the disposal of the family changes considerably.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">The supports available for the elderly, including the housing aid for the elderly, the disabled person's grant and the essential repairs grant, are not available to widows and widowers. This must be addressed because those who are vulnerable need to be looked after, and widows and widowers can fall into this category. The Department should consult the Department of the Environment and Local Government with a view to providing them with cover under the housing aid for the elderly scheme, which is operated through the health boards. A review of possible loopholes in these kinds of schemes was undertaken and I ask the Minister to consider providing cover under this aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">While I am pleased that there is support for carers, the means testing thresholds for the carer's allowance must continue to fall and should ultimately be abandoned. It is suggested that if means testing is abandoned millionaires will claim allowances. This is unlikely to happen as they can afford to provide care without calling on the support of the Department. I am concerned about those who are severely disabled. A doctor's certificate should be sufficient to enable them have their needs covered.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">While I would much prefer to see everybody working and paying their taxes, thus eliminating the need for unemployment benefit and assistance, I welcome the increase in the threshold for family income support. It is important because of increasing job losses, especially in my constituency. These have arisen mainly because of closures in the textile industry. In the period 1998 to 2002, 1,200 people in Buncrana lost their jobs following the closure of one factory. People in many other towns in the constituency have also lost jobs. They need unemployment assistance and benefit. Even where they transfer to lower paid jobs they need family income support and I am pleased that the threshold has increased.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">I welcome the abolition of the assessment of benefit and privilege for unemployed people aged 29 years and over. People should not be penalised for trying to pursue a family ethos. At present, if a person over the age of 18 years is living in the family home everything is means tested. If the person left the house and took up employment he or she would be entitled to rent subsidy and other State supports. The Department should provide support if the person stays at home and I would prefer if the abolition of assessment applied to those aged 25, not 29, years and over. However, I accept that improvements and changes of this kind take place more slowly than desired.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">I ask the Minister to look at the issue of rent allowances. Changes were introduced to address short-term problems. It is important that those in receipt of them have their accommodation inspected. This may necessitate the Department working with the health boards and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. While there is good accommodation available, some of it is substandard. It should be inspected to ensure that the rent paid reflects the amount warranted. Steps should also be taken to strengthen provisions on the registration of landlords. If, following that, problems persist the recent changes to rent allowances should be reviewed.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">I strongly advocated the retention of the summer student jobs scheme and I am disappointed that it has been abolished. It is important that students are made aware of its abolition. In some areas, such as in my constituency, it can be very difficult to secure alternative employment. The Department must play a proactive role in trying to place students in summer employment. I understand that even in areas of my constituency where there is high unemployment some employers are crying out for workers. The Department should match those who need workers with those who are prepared to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">Over recent weeks Greencastle has suffered a tough time. The Minister met representatives to deal with the question of family income support and PRSI. She is working hard to try to resolve both issues and I wish her well.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelGrealishPD" eId="spk_247">
          <from>Mr. Grealish</from>
          <p eId="para_370">I thank Deputy Keaveney for sharing her time with me. I support the Bill. It is the second of two Government Bills to implement the €530 million social welfare package made available under the 2003 budget. It follows the Social Welfare Act 2002, which provided for increases in social welfare payments from the beginning of January 2003. When enacted, this Bill, combined with the changes effected by the 2002 Act, will bring the level of expenditure on social welfare in 2003 to over €10 billion. This is a huge figure by comparison with the expenditure of €5.7 billion in 1997. Even the members of the Opposition will be compelled to agree that it is proof of the Government's commitment to the most vulnerable and marginalised groups in society. Social welfare spending represents a sizeable proportion of overall Government expenditure of €38 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">As a member of the Progressive Democrats, I particularly support the Bill as it includes a number of measures which my party promised to implement in its general election manifesto. We negotiated hard to have them included in the subsequently agreed partnership for Government. We pledged that if elected, we would increase child benefit and the respite grant to carers, extend child dependant allowances and increase the old age pension. This Bill honours these commitments.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">The Bill provides for the increases in child benefit announced in the budget. It amounts to €8 per month in the lower rate, payable to the first and second child, and €10 per month in respect of the third child and subsequent children. It brings the monthly repayment rates to €125.60 and €157.30 respectively. From next April, a family with three children will receive €408.50 compared with €382.50 at present, an increase of €26 per month. That is significant, especially for those families who depend on it. It helps with expenditure on school and clothes and provides a support to families.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">This measure will mark the final phase of the child benefit investment package initiative in budget 2001. When completed, Government investment in the scheme will rise by an additional €1.27 billion. An estimated 530,000 families with 1,032,000 children will benefit from the increases in 2003. Research has shown that child benefit, as a universal payment made directly to families, is the most effective and efficient way in which the Government can provide support to children. The rate of child benefit payment is now more than three times the level paid in 1997. It is a huge increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">The Progressive Democrats recognises the important role played by carers. Thousands of people devote a large part of their lives to caring for sick or elderly relatives, often in very difficult circumstances. They make huge personal sacrifices to provide an essential service which would otherwise require substantial Exchequer funding, and they must be complimented on their work. Many of them provide a service 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">More than a decade ago, the Progressive Democrats was instrumental in securing the introduction of the carer's allowance. In our election manifesto of 2002 we committed ourselves to new measures to recognise and reward the role of our carers and I am delighted that they are being implemented. This Bill now provides for an increase in the annual respite care grant payable to recipients of carer's benefit and carer's allowance, as announced in budget 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">In introducing these measures we will continue to support the valuable work undertaken by carers. The new rates of grant, payable from June 2003, are €735 where the carer is caring for one person and €1,470 where the carer is caring for more than one person. This will benefit 24,700 carers and will cost an additional €2.7 million per annum, thus honouring the Progressive Democrats' election pledge.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">The Progressive Democrats also made a commitment in 1997 to increasing the value of old age pensions to £100 per week. We have been as good as our word and have not only reached that target but surpassed it. The old age pension has risen by almost 50% over the five budgets since we entered Government. The old age contributory pensioners now receive €157 per week and this shows that the Government is working to ensure the old age pensioners are catered for and in receipt of adequate funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">Our long-term goal as partners in Government is to achieve the elimination of pensioner poverty. We will build on progress made over the past five years and ensure that every pensioner has significant income to enjoy a reasonable standard of living in his or her retirement years.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">The Progressive Democrats have ambitious objectives regarding the increase of pension rates. We set a target of €200 per week for the basic contributory old age pension and we will continue to campaign, as junior partners in Government, to ensure it is reached by 2007. It ought to be because of the rate of inflation.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">I welcome Deputy Coughlan's provision to protect those with personal retirement savings accounts. That amendment will benefit consumers and protect people from being moved from one perfectly good pension plan to another.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">The Bill amends the Pensions Act 1990 to strengthen the powers of the pensions board to allow it to respond, on a case-by-case basis, to schemes that are in funding difficulties on foot of the current downturn in the equities market. There has been much comment surrounding pensions in light of the fall in global equities markets. The impact of the decline poses sharp but, I hope, short-term problems for many employers and pension fund trustees who may have difficulty in meeting the funding standard under the Pensions Act 1990. The impact of this funding crisis must be carefully managed to avoid a drift away from the benefit of defined contribution schemes as this may not be in the long-term interest of scheme members.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">The Bill extends entitlement to an increase for a qualified child aged between 18 and 22 years and in full-time education to recipients of certain short-term social welfare payments as announced in budget 2003. This extension will apply to people who have been in receipt of disability benefit, injury benefit, health and safety benefit, supplementary welfare allowances, unemployment benefits and assistance for more than 26 weeks. This measure, contained in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, implements the commitment to increase the qualified child age limit to 22 years in line with the current arrangements for long-term payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">Other provisions include the extension of special allowances currently paid to pensioners over age 66 who are living on islands to recipients of invalidity pension, disability allowance and unemployability supplement. This allowance will be payable from April and amounts to €12.70 per week.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">The Bill also extends entitlement to six weeks' payment following the death of a person in receipt of certain social welfare payments to the surviving spouse or partner who is receiving a payment in his or her own right. It provides for the abolition of the assessment of benefit and privilege for people aged 29 and over who claim unemployment assistance and pre-retirement allowance payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">According to recent estimates by the ESRI, the number of people living in consistent poverty in Ireland fell to 6% by 2000, compared to 10% three years earlier. This is a huge fall. We are making real progress on tackling poverty and have been since 1997. Old age pension, social welfare and child benefit payments have risen, as has the respite grant to carers.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">I support the Bill because it will put into legislation the commitment the Progressive Democrats made to the electorate last May and deliver on our commitment to creating a more inclusive and caring society.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnPerry" eId="spk_248">
          <from>Mr. Perry</from>
          <p eId="para_387">I wish to share my time with Deputies Connaughton and Breen.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">One must be very careful speaking about election manifestos because of the costs that have been incurred in the economy since they were first produced. Every day we hear of increases in the price of electricity and rent. The cost of everything has gone up. Also, we are dealing with a valueless currency. A sum of €100 would be the equivalent of about £60, a devaluation which has occurred over a very short period.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">The previous speaker raised the issue of child care. The costs associated with this are huge. Also, we heard about the loss of the student summer jobs scheme and this heralds a return to private enterprise. Public sector job creation has increased by 6.7%, but in real terms there is a 5% drop in the industrial sector. Quarterly figures announced last week suggest there could be up to 15,000 additional people looking for work. It is very easy to create jobs in the public sector, which was evident prior to the election. When one considers the huge costs associated with job creation in the private sector, one realises it is much more difficult to create a job in this sector compared to the public sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">On the basis of a five year review, there is an average overpayment of €26 million per year by the Department, partly resulting from fraud. How is that being addressed? It is a huge sum of money. An average of €10 million is totally written off every year and cannot be reclaimed from any source. That is also a huge sum of money. The casualties in this respect are the people in real need. How does the Department decipher the amount of over payment and the percentage of over payment attributable to fraud or suspected fraud? There has been no significant improvement in its effort to combat over payment in recent years because €26 million per annum amounts to €0.5 million per week. This money is not accounted for and its loss impacts most on those who really need to benefit from it. Personal public service numbers would be useful in trying to eliminate fraud.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">Obviously, one has to operate within a confined budget, but some people are not receiving the benefits of the respite care grant. It is disappointing when senior citizens are discharged from hospitals and allowed only five hours per week of home help – one hour per day from Monday to Friday.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">The provision in section 7 for making payments to spouses after death is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">There is a slowdown in the economy. It is worrying that the Department of Social and Family Affairs spent almost €20 million in the past two years on spin doctors and consultancy fees covering the period from 28 November 2002 to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">I understand that 36 reports have been commissioned. This huge expenditure is outrageous and unwarranted. I cannot understand how €20 million can be spent on spin doctors in two years. It costs money to promote the Minister and his associates on television where they announce different schemes. This €20 million plus the €26 million lost to the Exchequer through fraud or otherwise totals the very large sum of €46 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">People are applauding increases of a couple of euro which is nothing at all when one considers the valueless currency with which we are dealing. With inflation running at 6% to 8% in real terms, there is no increase in payments to senior citizens. I read in the print media that the television licence entitlement is to be withdrawn from pensioners. Is it true that RTE is not to extend this provision to new applicants? If that has been agreed by Government, it is the lowest of the low.</p>

          <from>Mr. Perry</from>
          <p eId="para_397">If the newspaper report is unfounded, I would like the Minister to repudiate it. At a time when the Department faces budgetary constraints, huge amounts of money are being spent on spin doctors and departmental promotion. Public sector job creation is boasted of when the small companies which have been the backbone of this economy's success are finding it difficult to be productive. It was very easy to create jobs in the public sector prior to May of last year, but the recent embargo will probably only be adhered to until the next local elections when it will be repealed to increase the Government's popularity.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">The words I have heard from the Government side today ring very hollow. The rate of inflation makes a mockery of the Government's generosity. Furthermore, I dispute the inflation figures which are being published. As a retailer, I see price increases day after day.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulConnaughton" eId="spk_251">
          <from>Mr. Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_399">This Bill is, like most others, something of a curate's egg in that it is good in spots. I agree with some of its provisions, but as I have only a few minutes to speak, I will concentrate on its extraordinarily lousy aspects.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">A constituent in Loughrea, County Galway, contacted me yesterday to say that new applicants, be they single people or couples without dependants, do not qualify for rent allowance where rent exceeds €90 per week. If that is true, it is a disaster and I would like the Minister and his officials to take note of it. I cannot understand it. Existing recipients of rent allowance are to be treated as new applicants if they are forced to leave their current accommodation due, for example, to the landlord's desire to sell the property. I am also told that existing recipients whose rent increases to more than €90 on renewal of their current lease will have their claim referred by the chief executive officer to a superintendent of the Western Health Board. In several of the towns I represent, it is very difficult for a childless couple or a single person to find accommodation which costs less than €90. If they have to pay €91, they will be denied rent allowance. My informant went through the wringer last week with regard to this, which is something I hope officials will bring to the Minister's attention when she replies.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">The suspension of the summer jobs scheme is a bad turn. Rural areas are experiencing a tormenting time with FÁS schemes grinding to a halt. The summer scheme was particularly useful for a certain type of student. It is strange that the scheme was allowed to continue while the economy was doing well and it was easy to find summer jobs for young people, yet the minute there is a downturn, the scheme is suspended. I find that extraordinary.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">On balance, I welcome the introduction of the Pensions Bill, but it is full of deficiencies. The lack of a compulsion on employers to contribute to pensions will have a negative impact on the 30% of the workforce on lower salaries. I was around in 1988 when RSI for the self-employed was introduced. While the measure is not the same sort of scheme as the one in question and it had its teething problems, it proved a very useful instrument. The provisions of this Bill will not work as well because of the collapse of share prices and the under-valuation of pensions. It is a nightmare. I know several people who have come to pension age in the last year and who are not getting back what they paid to insurance companies. They are almost left without a pension. Troubles with the special savings scheme and the Eircom share price will cause people to doubt the Government's sincerity when it talks about an investment for retirement.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">The Department of Social and Family Affairs must guarantee to those who are not able to join the proposed voluntary scheme that the non-contributory old-age pension will always be there. Many are afraid they will not receive a pension if they do not enter the scheme now.</p>

          <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O'Donoghue)</from>
          <p eId="para_409">The Government has agreed that expressions of interest be invited by way of public invitation from the private sector in participating, on the basis of a public private partnership, PPP, in the capital redevelopment of the Abbey Theatre in and-or around the vicinity of the site of the existing theatre.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">Expressions of interest from the private sector will now be invited on the basis that any redevelopment requires: a signature development, representative of a national theatre in the 21st century; an appropriate civic setting to form part of the overall urban regeneration represented by the O'Connell Street integrated area plan and north-east inner city plan; the redevelopment must meet the specified accommodation requirements of the theatre in terms of size and configuration; the redevelopment must embrace the Abbey and Peacock theatres and satisfactorily address the current problems of the two theatres; the facilities available to the national theatre must at all times be consistent with the operational needs of the theatre and with the requirement to provide a top-quality experience to audiences.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">However, subject to the above, the design may include the provision of additional elements, facilities or functions. It will fall to the relevant private sector developer to assess the feasibility and financial implications of the property acquisition required, planning issues likely to arise etc., and to factor these risks into the final proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">The Office of Public Works, in close collaboration with my Department and with the national theatre, will shortly seek tenders for the provision of expert advice on the detailed preparation of this public invitation. At this stage it would be premature to speculate on the likely commencement date and projected overall cost.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_256">
          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_413">I welcome the announcement by the Minister that progress is being made. If this is proposed to be a PPP project how will the Minister reconcile this with the fact that private property will need to be acquired? There is obviously not enough space in the present location to provide a theatre as outlined here. Properties adjacent to the existing building will have to be acquired. Will there be a conflict of interest in the case of a public private partnership? I ask the Minister which aspect of the partnership, public or private, will acquire the property?</p>
          <p eId="para_414">The Minister invited expressions of interest for a national stadium and he received 23 responses. Judging by the article in last Sunday's edition of <i>The Sunday Business Post </i>these proposals are now more or less being discarded. In the event of the Minister not obtaining a satisfactory public sector client, has he a contingency plan to provide a much-needed national theatre?</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_415">It is important to point out to the Deputy that the existing national theatre has a historic and emotional resonance for many people. It is therefore desirable to proceed with the construction of a new national theatre on the present site. Deputy Deenihan correctly points out that if this is to occur, the present footprint is too small and a larger one will be required. The question of who would acquire those properties will be part of the consideration which the Office of Public Works will give in formulating the invitation. As I indicated, it will take some time to formulate the invitation. If it should not prove possible to acquire the properties adjacent to the current Abbey Theatre, there are alternatives, I imagine, which can be looked at. However, the preferred option is to build on the present site of the theatre and expand the footprint.</p>

          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_416">In view of the inadequacy of the present theatre and the fact that so many people have expressed their concerns about the standard of the theatre's seating and stage facilities and audience capacity, will the Minister give the House an assurance that all the processes as outlined will be completed in the near future? Will the Minister give an indication of the likely timespan involved? It reminds me of the saga of Stadium Ireland. Procedures and bodies were put in place but at the end of the day we ended up with nothing. I hope this will not be a similar saga. I ask the Minister to state how long he will allow for the preliminary investigations and whether there is a set commencement date. Will the Minister ensure that there is no delay in the project?</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_417">I will seek to ensure that there is no delay in the project. It will be necessary in the first instance for the Office of Public Works by way of a notice in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union</i> to seek tenders for the expert advice and detailed preparation of the public invitations. Having regard to the timescales which are laid down in the relevant EU directive, I anticipate that the panel of experts will certainly be in place within a period of four months. I cannot be definitive in relation to the timescales from there on in, for the simple reason that I do not know what those timescales will be. Suffice to say that the Government has given agreement in principle to the replacement of the current Abbey Theatre. As Deputy Deenihan has stated, everybody realises that there is a need for a new national theatre. The Abbey Theatre as it stands is inadequate for the needs of today and to an extent, much of it is now antiquated.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_260">
          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_420">I propose to take Questions Nos. 107 and 109 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">As I previously advised the House in response to Questions Nos. 2 and 4 on 30 January, I expect to present a report to Government in the near future on the evaluation of the expressions of interest received in developing a privately financed stadium at Abbotstown. My report will deal, <i>inter alia,</i> with issues of stadium location, size and cost. In particular, it will take cognisance of the acknowledged need of the major field sporting bodies for additional modern sporting facilities, the provision of which remains a Government commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">My consultations with both the Football Association of Ireland and the Irish Rugby Football Union, in the context of the recent joint Scottish-Irish bid for the 2008 UEFA finals, served to highlight the difficulties that confront both of these organisations. The position of the FAI, in particular, becomes acute next year when qualifying fixtures for the 2006 World Cup get under way. FIFA is insisting that Ireland's home fixtures must be played in all-seat stadia. The provision of temporary seating accommodation will no longer be acceptable. This will bring into question the viability of Lansdowne Road as a location for competitive international soccer fixtures. The current capacity of Lansdowne Road is limited to 49,000 spectators for rugby and 35,000 for soccer but this will be reduced to 24,000 when the new FIFA requirements come into effect in mid-2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">While Lansdowne Road still provides adequate facilities for international rugby matches the availability of a modern stadium with increased capacity would generate additional income for the IRFU. It is estimated that, in the event of a 65,000 all-seater stadium being provided, the additional gross income would be of the order of €2.3 million per match. This would be a major financial boost for the IRFU, which would assist with the funding of the game of rugby. In addition, the income which would accrue to Ireland through the attendance here of larger numbers of supporters from abroad would also be significant. For example, a report commissioned by the IRFU, under the UCD marketing development programme, found that the two home internationals held in Lansdowne Road in 1999 – Ireland versus France and versus England – generated for the Irish economy an estimated €18.5 million from both home supporters and visitors from abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">I met recently the IRFU and FAI and asked them to assess and delineate their needs for stadium facilities and to put forward their proposals for meeting these needs. I expect to receive a report from them within a month which I will then bring to the attention of the Government. I will ask the Government to consider that report in conjunction with consideration of the expressions of interest received for a privately funded stadium at Abbotstown.</p>

          <from>Mr. Wall</from>
          <p eId="para_427">The problems envisaged by the FAI in the coming year will have to be addressed as a matter of urgency. Does the Minister expect the FAI and the IRFU, if they are to participate along with private partnership, to make financial projections as to their input into a proposed stadium? What percentage will they have to come up with in that regard? I support the stadium project and think it should be progressed urgently. Where does the FAI and the IRFU stand as a result of the meeting the Minister had with them? What indication did the Minister give them of the financial implications of their participation? Does the Minister feel the submissions to the Department offer a means whereby the FAI and IRFU could be included with the Government and a private partnership in providing a stadium?</p>
          <p eId="para_428">There are three main questions. Is it possible a private partnership could include the FAI and the IRFU? If so, what are the financial implications for the two associations? Can the timescale element be met in regard to grouping the FAI, IRFU and private partnership together? That will be a complicated matter. What is the timescale for the overall package?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_264">
          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_429">I appreciate Deputy Wall's support for the concept. I met the FAI and IRFU and asked them to come back with proposals before the end of March. At the moment neither of them are oozing with cash, quite the opposite. While the IRFU might not be badly off with regard to fixed assets both itself and the FAI have financial difficulties. That is often the case with sporting organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">As I read the situation, the financial proposals to be put forward by the FAI and IRFU will take account of the amount of advance ticket sales they can expect. Obviously they will look towards the business and corporate sector in that respect and I envisage their forthcoming contribution including funds they will accumulate arising from advance sales of tickets.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">I suppose it would be possible for the private sector to proceed with the IRFU and FAI but the truth is that most of the 23 expressions of interest we have received have conditions attached. Many of them are not attractive conditions. I am opposed to any private developer getting land at the taxpayer's expense and making large profits from it. That is not a runner.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">At the moment I am awaiting word from the IRFU and the FAI. When we have heard from them we will proceed to formulate a report for the Government. At that point we should know where we are going.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_265">
          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_433">It is three years since the Taoiseach scuppered plans for Eircom Park and it is two years since he provided £60 million to the GAA to ensure it would not allow rugby or soccer to be played in Croke Park. Last October this Minister sought expressions of interest in the provision of a new stadium but it is obvious from his statement today that the 23 expressions of interest have been discarded. The new scenario is that we are now waiting for the FAI and IRFU to come back with their proposals. There is no clear outline as to how we will achieve our final objective.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">For example, what happens if the IRFU and FAI come back and say that Lansdowne Road is not suitable for a development. What alternative plan has the Minister? He stated clearly in his expansive interview in a Sunday newspaper that there would be a definite stadium plan by the end of March. Can he assure the House, the IRFU and the FAI that there will be a definite stadium plan by then? If Lansdowne Road cannot be expanded into a 65,000 seater stadium, which is what is required, what alternative proposal has the Minister in place to satisfy the needs he outlined, both in terms of the economic reasons and the facilitation of the two sports and their supporters?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_266">
          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_435">As I have said on a number of occasions, I am absolutely convinced of the need for a stadium. The current situation of the FAI and the IRFU is simply untenable. Even if the GAA decided to open up Croke Park in the morning it would not resolve the problem for several reasons, not least of which is the question of overlapping fixtures. Other factors include pitch deterioration caused by too many games being played, the objections of residents and floodlighting. In these circumstances the only alternative to the dilemma with which the FAI and the IRFU are faced, is for the Government to become involved in the construction of a new stadium.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">I asked the FAI and the IRFU to report back to me by the end of March. The potential sites which have been identified are those at Abbotstown, Lansdowne Road, Newlands Cross and the location of the former Irish Glass Bottle Company. It must be remembered that Lansdowne Road has two tenants and it is not known if they are willing to move. There is also the question of planning in regard to turning the stadium by a 90º angle in order to achieve the required capacity. The IRFU also owns the Newlands Cross site.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">My position is straightforward – I am waiting to hear from the FAI and the IRFU and when I have heard their final proposals I will bring a report to Government, at which point a decision can be taken. It is true that there were 23 expressions of interest from the private sector and these will form part of the report which will go before Government. The consideration of these took longer than I had hoped or anticipated. A final decision can be expected after I have heard from the FAI and the IRFU, which are in an untenable position in so far as the hosting of international games are concerned.</p>

          <p eId="para_439">The Abridged Estimates for 2003 provide an amount of €9 million for expenditure this year under the local authority swimming pool programme. When compared with €3.9 million expended under the programme in 2002, the 2003 allocation of €9 million represents a 130% increase on the previous year's expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">The 2003 provision is regarded as sufficient to meet the anticipated demand for funding, given the pattern of drawdown to date in this multi-annual programme. Expenditure this year, to end January, has been €53,000.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_441">Does the Minister agree that the 41% cut in the capital provision of the building and renovation costs of swimming pools is already having a detrimental effect on communities? Does he not agree that given these circumstances it is the height of pretence to be building a 50m pool? While I welcome and support the planned 50m pool and recognise the benefits it will have for developing the potential of the Gary O'Tooles and Michelle Smiths of the future, in some areas young people are being denied the opportunity to swim because there are no pools in their area or because the existing ones are closed due to renovation. In some cases the necessary funds are not there to carry out these renovations. Is that not a contradiction in terms?</p>
          <p eId="para_442">Does the Minister agree that a swimming pool is no longer a luxury but an essential amenity for communities? Local communities and sporting bodies are working together to provide recreational facilities which are a vital outlet for the energies, talents and abilities of young people. Such interests provide a bulwark against anti-social activities.</p>
        </speech>

          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_443">I agree with Deputy Ferris that it is desirable that swimming pools be available to young people, and, indeed, not so young people. Swimming is a tremendous recreational outlet.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">I do not know where the Deputy gets his figure of a 41% cut. As I outlined, the actual amount allocated for swimming pools this year is 130% more than last year. During the years 2000-02, the amount of expenditure in all three years was less than the amount of the Estimate. In the year 2000, the Estimate was €19.3 million but expenditure was only €7.4 million. In 2001, the Estimate was €14.6 million while the actual expenditure was only €8.1 million. In 2002 the Estimate was €15.3 million while the expenditure was €3.9 million. In 2003 to date the expenditure has only been of the order of €53,000. The Estimate for 2003 is 130% higher than the actual expenditure in 2002. The expenditure in 2002 was €3.9 million and the Estimate this year is €9 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">There are complex reasons for this. Various procedures are involved in the construction or refurbishment of a swimming pool which, of necessity, require a lot of time. All of the applications which were approved prior to July of 2000 are under consideration and are at various stages of progress. Unfortunately, I cannot progress them any further than their current stage. In many instances it is up to the applicants to progress the project to the next stage. I know the Deputy will be pleased to hear that the works at the Tralee Aquadome have been completed and the grant of €86,000 has been paid.</p>

      <b>Mr. Wall</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism</b>
      his views on fears expressed by tourism industry representatives that a conflict in Iraq will dramatically affect the number of visitors to this country for an indefinite period; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [5728/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_270">
          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_448">I am keenly aware of the concerns expressed by the tourism industry in relation to the impact that the continuing uncertainty in relation to Iraq is having on booking patterns. Whereas indications for business in the first quarter of 2003 look good, it seems apparent from reports from the industry that there has been a considerable softening in bookings for the period after March, most notably from the United States.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">This is a time for cool heads and measured responses. The key to tackling the situation is to closely monitor evolving consumer reactions in key marketplaces and to develop appropriate and balanced responses, in particular in the area of marketing and promotion.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">My officials and I have met the chief executives of the tourism State agencies to ensure that a robust contingency plan is in place to respond to the impact of any outbreak in hostilities. My objective is to be proactive and to support the industry in whatever way I can in dealing with the emerging situation. The contingency plan has three central tenets: establishing a communications network to gather market based intelligence on actual events and their impact on consumer behaviour and confidence; evaluating this intelligence and altering our tourism marketing campaigns and programmes as necessary; and putting in place an industry response group to monitor events and actions as a central pivot to maintaining excellent communications with the tourism industry in Ireland and overseas.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">An internal response team is meeting within Tourism Ireland Limited on a weekly basis to analyse the most current information available from the markets, utilising its global office network located in 19 countries worldwide. The objective will be to identify the best prospects available to us and to review our marketing messages, mediums and programmes to ensure that they suit the changed environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">Although remedial action would be premature at this point, this may eventually entail shifting focus from marketing Ireland as a destination towards the use of tactical marketing, working in tandem with the industry to promote specific products and services and focusing on territories closer to home. The domestic marketing campaign and niche marketing activities programmed by Bord Fáilte will also be adjusted as necessary. A tourism industry response group, operating under the auspices of the tourism marketing partnership, will be convened and will meet as often as necessary to review the situation and the implications for marketing activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"><i>Additional information</i>The marketing programme for 2003 was devised by Tourism Ireland and Bord Fáilte against a background of political and economic uncertainty. It is flexible and highly responsive to emerging market developments. To financially underpin the marketing programme I have secured an additional €5 million for the tourism marketing fund in my Department's Estimates for 2003. This brings the Exchequer investment in frontline marketing activities to €48 million, part of which can be specifically earmarked to cater for measures to deal with a possible Gulf conflict.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">Both policy makers and tourism practitioners have learned a great deal from the experiences of foot and mouth disease and the events of 11 September. The tourism sector in Ireland is a mature and resilient industry which has a proven capacity to deal with external shocks. The major difference between the previous two crises and the Iraqi situation is that the industry has had good notice.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">No one can predict with confidence how the current situation will unfold or how long it will take to resolve. We are however, forewarned and I am confident that the tourism agencies and the industry are well placed to implement whatever contingency plans are necessary to deal with the difficulties and challenges that lie ahead.</p>

          <from>Mr. Wall</from>
          <p eId="para_456">I thank the Minister for his detailed reply and I look forward to reading the remaining section in the Official Report. Does the Minister agree that the competitive edge of the Irish tourism industry has been damaged by the increases in insurance premiums and VAT. The Irish VAT rate of 13.5% compares unfavourably with the rates of 7% in Spain, 5.5% in France and 5% in Portugal. Besides, the current rate of inflation in Ireland is 5%. These rates must influence families or groups of people when they decide where to go for their holidays.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">What is the position of the Minister's Department on this matter? Has the Department held meetings with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment regarding the problems caused by high insurance premiums. The high cost of insurance and the high rate of VAT are critical factors in preventing Ireland from being an attractive holiday destination.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">I recently read a newspaper report of a large international insurance company which is considering Ireland as a possible marketplace. I hope this company will come into Ireland to create a competitive edge in the insurance industry. Does the Minister see the erosion of the competitive edge, caused by the increase in insurance premiums and VAT, as the major difficulty in attracting tourists to Ireland?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_272">
          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_459">Public liability and employers' liability insurance has risen considerably in recent years. I share Deputy Wall's concern in that regard. There is no doubt but that the cost of insurance is having an adverse effect on the industry itself. Sometimes when prices are increased this can be directly related, in part, to an increase in the premiums which people are now obliged to pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is responsible for the insurance sector. She has plans in place to tackle the question of awards and legal costs and there is a proposal for a personal injuries assessment board. A recent report on the insurance industry has made various recommendations, which the Tánaiste has indicated she intends to implement. That is the Tánaiste's area. However, the Government is cognisant of the problem which people are facing and is trying to tackle it.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">Any increase in VAT will impact on the tourism sector. We are, after all, speaking about the provision of food, drink and accommodation. This year VAT increased by just 1% and there was a decrease in corporation tax of 4%.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">All in all, I am hopeful that we will have a very good year in the tourism sector. However, I am aware that our attempt to increase business from the United States by 10% would be devastated if hostilities broke out in the Middle East. Overall, we are trying to increase the number of tourists coming to the country by 5% and revenue by 10%. If we were to achieve those targets the country would have the best tourism year ever.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_465">The national lottery-funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country for projects which must be directly related to the provision of sport and recreation facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">The guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme clearly stipulate that "applicants will have to submit rules and procedures as evidence of non-discrimination on the grounds of sex, religion, ethnic origin etc."  This emphasis on ensuring equality of treatment is reflected in the fact that grants allocated under the scheme are made available only to organisations whose membership is open to both sexes. It should, however, be borne in mind that in some situations patterns of participation may differ as between males and females.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">Over €213 million has been allocated under the programme since 1998 to more than 2,900 projects. As far as the Department is aware, allegations of discriminatory practices have not been made against any of the recipients of these grants.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">As the Deputy is aware, I have recently commenced work leading to the putting in place of a long-term strategic plan to ensure the development of sports facilities throughout the country. I assure the Deputy that the issue of ensuring equality of access and opportunity will be examined by the inter-agency steering group which is to be set up to oversee the preparation of this long-term strategy for the development of sports facilities.</p>

          <p eId="para_469">I am sure the Minister will agree that the needs of women in sport have not been fully addressed over the years. The involvement of women in sport has been undervalued and, at times, even trivialised. Does the Minster agree that where facilities are provided for use by both sexes more women will participate, whether for reasons of leisure, recreation, health or higher performance? Across the country there are black spots where there are no sports facilities for women. Despite the aspiration implicit in the grant application procedures, improvements are not happening in practice. Gender proofing is not taking place. Grants are being allocated on the assumption of gender equality but it is not happening. Women throughout the country are being deprived of the opportunity to participate in sport, at whatever level they require. Will the Minister ensure that both sexes are treated equally and that all grants are properly gender proofed?</p>

        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_276">
          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_470">If one excludes the three major field sports of gaelic games, rugby and soccer the participation rate of women in sport is 50%. However, when those sports are included there is a disparity and participation of females is approximately 37% of male participation.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">It is true that when grants are given to Gaelic games, soccer and rugby, females can participate. Some very fine Kerry footballers are female, as the Deputy will be aware. I agree with the Deputy that there is a need for a greater level of participation by women in sport generally. It is important to address this issue. In that context the audit and strategic review should provide some interesting answers.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_475">The Irish Sports Council Act, 1999, provided for the establishment of the Irish Sports Council on a statutory basis. The establishment day of the council was 1 July, 1999. Since the establishment of the Irish Sports Council, this legislation which was debated in the both Houses of the Oireachtas has worked satisfactorily and I do not intend to amend either section 6(<i>b</i>) or any other section of the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">This country now has the benefit of a statutory body with clear functions and strategy, fully dedicated to the development of sport for all people, including women and girls, across a wide range of support programmes and initiatives. To enable the Irish Sports Council to carry out its functions, funding provided by my Department has increased from €13 million to more than €28 million in three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">As is required under the provisions of the Act, the Irish Sports Council prepared its first statement of strategy for 2000-2003 which was published. The council has now submitted a new statement of strategy for the next three years which, in accordance with the Act and following my approval, will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">Section 9 of the Act provides for the council to have to Government policy and it should comply with any general policy directive which may from time to time be given to it by me. In addition, I am sure the three women members of the sports council will have a particular interest in this area of sport participation and will bring forward proposals to the council should they consider that such an initiative is warranted.</p>

I ask that in future the Minister would answer questions on women in sport. I have sent these questions to the Irish Sports Council but I have not yet received a reply, perhaps it is seeking the information. I think they are being prepared. Will the Minister ask the council to set up a women's sports forum where women could address the various issues relating to them, the barriers preventing their involvement in sport, sponsorship and media coverage which is abysmal for women. For example, in more than ten days of the photographs in the national media, 97% were of males and only 2.7% were of females. Given that women get a raw deal in sport there must be some mechanism where these issues can be addressed.</p>

          <p eId="para_482">I said earlier that the participation rate for women in sport decreases to 37% when one takes out the major field games. I should have said 33%. I fully support the Deputy's concern about the participation of women in sport. It is important to have a far greater degree of participation. In this respect the sports council is aware of the necessity to take initiatives and has reported that there are programmes in which females can take part at present. These include: youth sport; TOPs, which is for developing the essential sporting skills that children should acquire at an early age – running, jumping, throwing, catching and moving with a ball; sports for older people and local sports partnerships. I am assured that the council will continue to support women in sport. In its first strategy statement, a new era for sport, the council has provided for significant support and assistance for women and girls in sport. There are a number of examples of this. If the Deputy is asking me whether I will request the sports council to be ever more pro-active in relation to the participation of girls and older women in sport the answer is in the affirmative.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_490">I propose to take Questions Nos. 113, 114, 129, 137 and 141 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">As I said in reply to a priority question on today's Order Paper, the reported downturn in the US market this year is based on the booking trends reported by tour operators for the month of February. There are, no official visitor statistics available at this stage in the year as these statistics are released on a quarterly basis. On the general issue, it is important that we keep things in perspective and ensure that our responses to an ever-evolving situation are based on the best information and expertise available.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">While contingency planning in the context of Iraq has been under way for some time now and the tourism marketing programmes for 2003 have been devised to cater for a variety of contingencies, we should not start reacting in haste or in a knee-jerk manner to what are very early trends emerging in one market.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">Tourism Ireland has worked closely with the industry since its establishment and it will continue to engage closely with the sector in setting out a course of action aimed at addressing any adverse fall-out from a war in Iraq should this arise. The primary focus continues to be on securing quality tourism business wherever the best prospects exist. If the "wait and see" approach to booking foreign holidays persists in the US, Tourism Ireland's marketing programme is sufficiently flexible to enable it to re-allocate resources to markets and marketing activities which may offer a better return. It is simply too early to make this call based on the evidence to hand. If and when this situation arises, Tourism Ireland will make the strategic and tactical decisions which are deemed appropriate, in tandem with the industry. Contingency planning in this type of situation is far from an exact science. There are many unknown factors which will have a key influence on how this situation plays out over the weeks and months ahead. The reaction of air carriers, international tour operators and most importantly, the consumer are crucial yet impossible to predict with any degree of certitude.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">While the tourism agencies and industry have learned a great deal from previous experiences of external shocks, the global tourism market and consumer behaviour patterns have changed in many significant ways since 11 September 2001. Similarities with the previous Gulf War do not necessarily apply now. There is no doubt that, in the early 1990s, the US consumer felt safer at home. Whether that is still true to the same extent, having regard to the impact of 11 September, is difficult to judge. The type of consumer Tourism Ireland is increasingly targeting is a more well-informed, independent traveller who may not be as easily deterred from travelling by an outbreak of war in Iraq.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">With all the uncertainties pervading the sector at the moment, there are some things about which we can be certain – Ireland continues to be a top class tourist destination offering excellent value for its premium product. Our tourism agencies have an enviable record when it comes to winning business internationally and the Government has resourced them sufficiently and in such a manner as to allow them get on with the business at hand. What we need now is a steady hand and a sense of perspective. I am confident both the industry and the tourism agencies will rally together to meet whatever challenges lie ahead and that Ireland will continue to fight for and win good quality tourism business.</p>

          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_496">Given that the phone inquiries from American tourists directly to Ireland have almost stopped, it is time the Minister considered seriously other markets to make up the shortfall. During the Gulf War there was a fall-off of 20%, with much smaller numbers. This time we are talking about a decline of 20% on a figure of approximately 850,000 to 900,000, which would reduce the number to 700,000. I am sure the Minister will agree that this will have major implications for the tourism industry, particularly in our own County Kerry, which depends so much on the spending power of American tourists. The likelihood is that there will be a decline in the number of tourists from America.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">The Minister said in reply to Deputy Wall that he will be proactive. What marketing arrangements is he putting in place in the UK? Has he put extra resources into marketing Ireland in the UK, our nearest neighbour, with possibly the greatest potential for future customers? What marketing arrangements is he putting in place in the European markets such as Germany and France, in particular, and the Northern European countries?</p>

          <p eId="para_502">First, I have made no direct approaches to Aer Rianta because that is a matter for the Minister for Transport, with whom I am in regular contact on improving access to the country. As Members will be aware, access is about to be improved from the United States as a result of two additional routes. There will also be 11 additional routes from Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">On the question of the marketing spend, as the programme currently stands, 34% of the budget is being targeted at Britain, Ireland's highest volume market. In addition, 32% will be focused on continental Europe, which generates a good market. The British market accounts for 62% of visitors while the Continent currently generates 20% of total visitor numbers. As things stand, there will be a very strong focus on the European market. It was stated in An Agreed Programme for Government that we would seek to increase our share of the continental market, which is why there will be a strong marketing campaign on the Continent this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">It is true that there has been a fall-off in the number of American tourists since 11 September. The fall-off for 2001 was estimated at 13% and the fall-off last year was estimated at 10%. The experience during the Gulf War was that there was a reduction of 20%. An outbreak of hostilities would have a very serious impact on our plans. As I said, however, I have been proactive. I have met the tourism agencies and many people dealing with contingency planning, and contingency plans are now in place.</p>

It will be difficult to prove that these carriers are not coming to Ireland for logistical reasons as opposed to security reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">It has been reported that the Minister will travel to Scotland in March for the St. Patrick's Day parade. What are his plans to use the occasion to try to beef up visitor numbers from the UK, or has he plans to visit England and Wales in this regard?</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_507">I am pleased that there will be additional access this year from the United States. We previously had six gateway cities and we will now have two additional gateway cities. The Baltimore-Washington route is being restored by Aer Lingus and US Airways will fly directly into Dublin and Shannon from Philadelphia. That will increase the air carrying capacity from the United States this year by 25%, which everyone will welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">In regard to visits abroad, I am very conscious that visits by Irish Ministers during the St. Patrick's Day celebrations worldwide provide a tremendous opportunity to sell Ireland, which is precisely what will be happening during visits this year. Each Minister travelling will be given the fullest possible assistance. For the first time, I am co-operating with the Department of Foreign Affairs to ensure that each Minister has a sufficient brief and sufficient material to enable him or her to sell Ireland in a serious way. That is not to say that Ministers were not doing so before – they certainly were – but it will now be more formalised in the sense that each Minister will be provided with excellent briefing and material. Few countries in the world have the opportunity to ensure their country gets maximum exposure and St. Patrick's Day provides Ireland with an opportunity it would be foolish to miss out on.</p>

Will he not agree that this well informed independent traveller is the sort of person opposed to the aims of the US Administration? These people are well aware of Ireland as a safe tourism destination and will be more concerned about the rip-off culture, increased dumping, increased litter, lack of accessible public transport and the decreasing access to land. Given that war is approaching and the decline in the economy, travel access will be diminished, people will be more penny-pinching and the well informed independent traveller is more likely to be discerning. Is the Minister aware that the July-September 2002 figures showed a 2% decrease in visitor numbers to this country and a 20% decrease in the length of stay, indicating that people are moving in line with their pockets?</p>

      <b>Mr. Coveney</b>
      asked the

      the position regarding future plans for the development of the National Concert Hall; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [5669/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_305">
          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_521">The National Concert Hall is the premier and most successful venue for classical musical performance in Dublin. It was built within the Earlsfort Terrace complex and shares its accommodation with University College, Dublin. From the outset it was recognised that there were inadequacies in the overall space allocated to it and that its backstage accommodation in particular was limited.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">Since 1981 the NCH has developed as a venue for many forms of musical performance in addition to classical music. Last year the NCH catered for more than 300,000 patrons. The inadequacies inherent in the original location are now a serious constraint on its operations and further development. In addition, it most notably lacks a self contained auditorium for musical performances of a more intimate character.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">A high level group comprising the Secretaries General of the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, the Department of Education and Science and the Chairman of the Office of Public Works, was established in July 2000, to examine and report on all the issues involved in relation to the NCH at Earlsfort Terrace. On foot of Government consideration of the report of the high level group the Office of Public Works was asked to put together, in consultation with the management of the National Concert Hall, a full brief of the physical and other requirements tailored to serve the needs of the National Concert Hall for the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">In the light of this brief, my Department, together with the Office of Public works, is examining all the options that exist for the provision of a new modern concert hall suitable to the requirements of the 21st century. This will take some time. When the necessary considerations are completed, I will seek Government approval to implement my decision.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_306">
          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_525">I agree with the Minister that the National Concert Hall, in its present form, is not suitable for large, international performances, in particular, and that is an inhibitory factor. The National Concert Hall is one our main tourist attractions and with more international performances, it would be a bigger draw. Also, the local consumer is entitled to be exposed to major international performances but that is not happening because the National Concert Hall is not large enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">What options are being explored? The first option will be to retain the National Concert Hall at its present site and to expand the building, similar to what is being done at the Abbey Theatre. Is the space available to do that? If it is case of relocation, has another site been looked at?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_307">
          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_527">Many issues must be considered before we reach that stage. Deputy Deenihan is correct in that the Earlsfort Terrace location is not satisfactory. There are difficulties in relation to the auditorium itself and to backstage and on stage facilities. Numerous difficulties need to be resolved. I await the report to see how we can progress this matter. It must be remembered that the cost of construction of a new National Concert Hall could be of the order of €130 million. It is a major undertaking and one which we must get right.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">I imagine the group will consider a number of locations with a view to determining which would be the best option. Early soundings from many people involved indicate that Earlsfort Terrace may not be way ahead. If that is the case, an alternative site will have to be identified. It has been suggested that the new hall could be located in the Grand Canal area of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority. A feasibility study is in course regarding the adequacy of such a site for the purpose of a National Concert Hall. It is too early to say whether that site would be suitable. Indications are that the current site at Earlsfort Terrace does not meet modern requirements.</p>

          <p eId="para_532">I propose to take Questions Nos. 116, 128 and 134 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">I outlined in my response to Priority Questions Nos. 2 and 3 the position in regard to the provision of stadia to meet the needs of the major field sports, in particular soccer and rugby where there is an urgent need to provide modern all-seat stadium accommodation. In the absence of such facilities, the Football Association of Ireland will be faced with a major dilemma next year in meeting the requirements of FIFA for all-seat stadia for our home fixtures in the qualifying competition for the 2006 World Cup Finals. The Irish Rugby Football Union, for its part, needs to expand and upgrade capacity for international rugby fixtures in order to fund the development of the game of rugby in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">I recently met representatives of the FAI and the IRFU and have asked them to consider all the options open to them for meeting their stadium requirements and to submit these proposals to me in that regard within a month.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">I will report to the Government in the near future on the evaluation of the expressions of interest received in procuring a privately financed stadium at Abbotstown. I will incorporate in that report my assessment of whatever proposal is tabled by the FAI and IRFU.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">With regard to the development of sports facilities throughout the country, the Government continues to provide funding for the development of sporting facilities under the sports capital programme and I will announce the 2003 programme in March. As in previous years, the funding of facilities under the sports capital programme will be available to benefit suitable projects for a wide range of sporting activities throughout the country.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_538">The reason I favour Abbotstown is that the National Aquatics Centre is located there. It would be possible to have a stadium there and future Governments, even future generations, might decide to add on to the campus in such a way so that there would be facilities for various sports and that Ireland could ultimately bid successfully for a major sporting event. However, my overriding concern at this point is to try to provide a stadium. As I have outlined on a number occasions, I recognise the FAI and IRFU are in an untenable position. I am willing to look at all options with a view to providing a stadium. From a visionary perspective, Abbotstown is my preferred choice because it would give an opportunity to future generations and Governments to develop a campus capable of attracting a major international sporting event. I am nothing if not a pragmatist and my overriding concern is to try to see if we can provide a stadium.</p>

          <p eId="para_550">I referred briefly before the debate was adjourned for lunch to the acquisition of a new jet by the Government and the case of a male patient who checked himself out of hospital yesterday and was charged €200 for his trouble. The slogan "Jets for the boys, long hours for our doctors and nurses and unbelievably long queues in our hospitals for the rest of us" applies. The stark reality is electricity charges will increase by 10%; gas prices by 9%; VAT by 8%; motor tax by 12% and hospital charges by 26%. Meanwhile the threshold for the drugs refund scheme has increased by 31%, VHI charges have increased by 18%, bank charges by 108% and the television licence has increased by 40%.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">Prices in supermarkets are increasing by 5% per annum, the highest rate of increase in Europe. The price of a house has almost trebled since Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats came into power. According to EUROSTAT, despite the boom and the election promises, our standard of living has deteriorated and is among the worst in Europe because increases in the cost of goods and services have run far ahead of income increases.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">The Bill does nothing to counteract this. Child benefit will increase by €8 a month, which is barely enough to buy a packet of nappies. This increase has been introduced by a Government that promised to tackle child poverty. It is a case of promises made, promises broken. Full rate social welfare payments have increased by €6 a week which is not enough to cover the increase in the cost of prescription medicines or to match inflation. The Government said it would work towards a benchmark of €150 for all social welfare payments. It is again a case of promises made, promises broken.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">The old age pension has been increased by €10 a week and the Government is probably proud of that, but it should not be because it will be more than offset by the increase in Government charges.</p>

The allowance is virtually denied to anybody with an income and it has been increased by an utterly pathetic €7 per week. Carers, who earn only 77 cent per hour for work in their homes, save the State a staggering €2 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">The programme for Government states, "We are committed to building service provision and legislative frameworks which enable people with disabilities to fulfil their potential and make a full contribution to the economic and social life of our country."  How this can be achieved by treating carers with such insulting disregard is beyond me. The Bill is the product of an ugly, greedy mentality that has infected the Government and the country where we are viewed merely as statistics in an economy and not as people in a society.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">This failed Government has provided for a revolting widening of the wealth gap by a massive €243 per person. The rich have become richer, the poor have become poorer and the Government has washed its hands of them. Fine Gael's message is stark. There are 50,000 families on local authority housing waiting lists, 6,000 people without a home and crime is soaring. Home ownership is out of the reach of young people, with house prices soaring. Unemployment is on the increase while job creation is decreasing. Almost 600 jobs have been lost in my constituency over the past two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">The national development plan is overdue and over budget. Our schools building programme is crumbling. I refer to a meeting with the Minister for Education and Science in Clare last Monday. An extension was promised for a secondary school in Kilmihil. There are currently 330 pupils in a school designed for 175 pupils.</p>

          <p eId="para_564">There is no promise of a new school as there is in many parts of the country. Our hospitals resemble something from Crimea. A sum of €15 million was promised to Ennis General Hospital but nothing has happened in that regard. We are waiting for the Minister for Finance to release the funding, if he ever does.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">The poor failed to benefit from the boom and are suffering in the slump. Why, at a time when stud owners are not taxed and the badly planned SSIA scheme presents a financial time-bomb for the Exchequer can the Government not see where the axe should fall? What warped set of priorities and values does this Government hold when people are sleeping wrapped in blankets in doorways and families on minimum wage are unable to maintain a basic standard of living?</p>
          <p eId="para_566">Through this Bill the poor are paying for the Government's great election lie. A sum of €1 billion was set aside in budget 2002 for social welfare provisions. That amount is halved this year. That is not readjustment, it is a cutback. The test of a Bill is how well it sits with the people. As the Minister for Education has explained, the Minister for Social Welfare should explain his proposals to social welfare recipients. Let the Minister address the people of Tallaght, Kilrush, Clare and Gweedore in County Donegal. The Government knows this Bill is an insult and is the product of bad economic management. Such is the moral bankruptcy of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats that they are no longer affected by such matters. Let the message go out loud and clear, this Government has again broken the promises it made in the last election. It has protected the rich and penalised the poor, shame on it.</p>

          <from>Mr. Killeen</from>
          <p eId="para_570">I will do my best not to extract a similar response from people in the public gallery.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">This is the second Bill on social welfare provisions from the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Coughlan. I commend her on the work she has done in the Department since her appointment. The Bill provides for expenditure of €530 million out of a total social welfare budget of €10 billion which is a record level of provision in this area, as the Minister said yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">The Government is rightly proud of the substantial increases it has been possible to introduce in the area of old age pensions. Previous speakers contend that increases did not reach the level of inflation. If one looks at the figures, they exceeded it by a considerable distance. Anyone who remembers the situation which prevailed four or five years ago will only be too well aware that the pension provision was extremely miserly. Significant advances for people in receipt of pensions have been made since then. People who care to remember, will know that the undertaking given to increase the old age pension to £100, the currency used then, was laughed out of court. Fortunately, it was delivered on and has been further increased in the intervening period.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">One of the worrying and negative aspects of this and other debates has been the number of people prepared to find fault with the provisions made for the elderly. We owe a debt of gratitude to the older members of our society. They worked hard to build up a fledgling State, a reserve and an economic power previously unheard of and did so in very difficult times. Whatever provisions are made for them are only what they deserve. I look forward to further increases in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">The biggest breakthrough over the past five years has been in the area of child benefit. It is long since accepted that child benefit is the most effective intervention in terms of addressing child poverty. The substantial increases provided by the Government in recent years have made a significant impact. Child benefit has become a key strategic tool for intervention in the area of child poverty. It has been much more successful than is generally credited. It is an area which should continue to receive attention and resources. There is a need for specific targeting of some geographic areas and some families. It is important to consider this in the context of the numbers involved. More than 500,000 families are in receipt of child benefit and there are more than one million children on whose behalf it is paid. They represent the future. It is important they be given every chance in life. The manner in which they are provided for dictates to a great extent what kind of society we will have in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">Targeting of child benefit ahead of other payments, particularly in times of reduced resources, is a system that will work to the benefit of the country. One of the areas in which considerable progress can be made – and some progress has been made – is access to education at all levels. Young people should have access to education in a manner which enables them to derive the maximum benefit from it. Many factors militate, very strongly in some instances, against the delivery of equal education in some communities. Targeting of ways to address the difficulties created by poverty which commenced seven or eight years ago have had considerable success.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">The appointment of resource and remedial teachers is new. People are so used to talking about school requirements that they forget the appalling reality from which we emerged a very short time ago. I have been in politics for a little more than ten years. Prior to that I spent 20 years as a teacher, mostly as a school principal. I never had the pleasure – operating in a school of fewer than 100 pupils – of welcoming a resource or remedial teacher or any kind of classroom assistant to the school. Whatever provision is now being made has replaced virtually nothing. Special needs assistants were available to bigger schools but even then the level of provision was much less than would have been desirable. Considerable progress has been made in addressing children's needs in terms of poverty and education. Even more progress was made when it was possible to target the resources at particular areas. That is the challenge which faces us now.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">The area of social welfare is one in which political activists and public representatives have reason to make representations from time to time, as we do in relation to a host of other Departments. I pay tribute to the staff of my local social welfare office in Ennis. They display great professionalism, not only when dealing with public representatives but also when dealing with the public at every level.</p>

          <p eId="para_579">They provide a wonderful level of service and they go far beyond what is required of them in terms of explaining entitlements and helping people to access benefits. Such facts ought to be acknowledged.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">Particular difficulties are being faced in the agriculture sector. Single income farm families with school-going children have many concerns and face an uncertain future. It should be possible to amend the social welfare code to provide short-term assistance – for as little as a month or two – to families that have particular concerns because the income they need is not always available.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">Substantial advances have been made in meeting the needs of carers, but they have been made against a background that was particularly bad. Campaigns are frequently mounted to extend carer's allowance to everyone, regardless of income, but I believe it is difficult to sustain such an argument in the context of limited resources. Substantial negative factors, such as the spread of available resources, are associated with the lack of a means test. There is a strong case for addressing the burdens and needs of certain carers, such as those providing 24 hour care with relatively little respite, by paying them a higher level of carer's allowance. The people to whom I refer encounter many difficulties as a result of their burdens, despite the fact that the carer's allowance is at a reasonable level.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">There is considerable merit in examining the possibility of directing more resources to those with the greatest need. I refer to those who care for people with autism or a disability, for example. Deputies are familiar with the cases of people who receive carer's allowance for looking after people who are almost as capable of caring as the carer. Equally, we encounter cases where there is an obvious need for carer's allowance to be paid, but it is not being paid for one reason or other.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, has announced changes in provisions for orphans and foster carers, arising from the recommendations of the working group. I commend the Minister and a number of her Cabinet colleagues for addressing various working groups' recommendations. There is a fear that wonderful reports will be ignored, even though they have been prepared at considerable expense. We should acknowledge Ministers who take on board proposals made in reports of working groups.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanSmith" eId="spk_335">
          <from>Mr. B. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_584">I am happy to have the opportunity to contribute to this important debate on the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2003. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs mentioned yesterday that the Social Welfare Bill 2002, which was necessary to facilitate the payment from 1 January 2003 of increased social welfare benefits, including pensions, was passed shortly before Christmas. She also pointed out that the 2003 social welfare budget is about €10 billion, compared to €5.7 billion in 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">Deputy Killeen stated that there have been welcome improvements in pension rates and child benefit payments. Deputy Patrick Breen mentioned the need for better primary schools accommodation, and all Deputies share that view. The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, referred to the fact that additional accommodation is needed in many instances as a result of the increase in population. The Ceann Comhairle and I are familiar with schools in our constituency that have lost teachers, have had to close or have been amalgamated with other schools as a result of depopulation, but that, thankfully, is no longer the case in most of rural Ireland. Those of us who represent very rural constituencies in the Border region know that towns and villages suffered over the years when their population levels decreased. I am glad the recent census showed that the trend has been reversed and that the population is increasing, which means that there is pressure for more school accommodation in rural Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">Two important and successful schemes in the area of education, which was discussed by Deputy Killeen, are operated by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the vocational training opportunities scheme and the back to education scheme. I would like the VTO scheme to be extended and promoted throughout the country. All Members of this House and public representatives at local authority level have encouraged individuals to avail of the VTOS. Many of the people I encouraged went on to study at other centres of further education, such as Cavan College of Further Studies and Monaghan Institute of Further Education and Training. Many of the people to whom I refer went on to obtain a third level qualification at an institute of technology or a university. It is obvious that educational attainment is linked to a person's ability to obtain employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">If we are to end the cycle of poverty and disadvantage that is prevalent in many communities, we have to encourage people to participate in education and to gain qualifications. The Department and the vocational education committees have done a good job in operating the VTOS. Perhaps literature could be sent out to interested parties as part of the extension and promotion of the scheme. The back to education allowance is not availed of to a satisfactory extent. A good allowance is made available to people to go back to college to pursue courses and to obtain skills and qualifications to help them to take up positions in the workforce. The Department of Social and Family Affairs, in conjunction with the Department of Education and Science and the vocational education committees, should expand the schemes I have mentioned and make further provision for them. I commend the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, for her work in that role to date. I do not doubt that she will improve the delivery of social welfare services in many respects during the next four and a half years.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">Complaints have been made to me on many occasions in relation to people on low incomes who are not helped, under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, to obtain or purchase essential items when they move into a new home. All public representatives have received representations from persons with low incomes who have been allocated local authority houses, but who feel they are being discriminated against in comparison to their neighbours, whose only income consists of social welfare payments but who may not have a smaller disposable income. There may not be many cases of persons in employment being discriminated against in such a manner, but the clause that means that they are denied supplementary welfare allowance should be reviewed. Persons in employment, but with low incomes, should receive assistance if they need it.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">Deputy Killeen referred to the positive work of social welfare officers throughout the country, many of whom go beyond the call of duty by encouraging people to avail of their rights and to claim their entitlements. Community welfare officers from health boards provide assistance to families in difficult circumstances, when they are at their most vulnerable in times of bereavement or when they are experiencing household problems. In recent years, proper recognition has at last been given to the provision of an adequate pension for senior citizens. The Fianna Fáil Party commitment in 1997 to raise considerably the payment of pensions was honoured and more.</p>

          <p eId="para_618">It saddens me to hear members of the Government party clapping themselves on the back for giving to people on social welfare payments which are so low that no Member of this House would be prepared to live on them, and I doubt if many people working in the State apparatus responsible for administering the payments would be prepared to live on them either. The increases made by the Government, such as they are and about which we hear such self-praise from the Government benches, do not even come up to the level recommended by the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">The paper presented by the Department to the tax strategy group recommended payments in order to fulfil the commitments made under the programme for Government, the revised national anti-poverty strategy and the PPF. The increase recommended for old age pensions was €13.20 while that given by the Government was €10; that recommended for the lowest rate of unemployment payment, including supplementary welfare, ranged between €10.10 and €15.40 while that given by the Government was €6; and that recommended by the Department for child benefit was €31.59 while that given by the Government was €8.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">A Government which is not even prepared to implement the level of increases which its Departments recommend is one which is miserly with the poorest of people, but that is not all. It would be one thing if those who received the increase were allowed to keep it but, of course, they are not because many of those on social welfare are in local authority housing. Social welfare recipients in local authority housing may hear on the news that they are to get €6 extra in the budget and they might say "hurrah" to that. However, their local city or county manager then revises their rent and €4 or €5 is immediately whipped from the increase.</p>

For example, a person on the lowest level of social welfare payment got a €6 increase in the budget but the Minister for Social and Family Affairs takes back €4.36 in the personal contribution to the rent allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">In reply to a Dáil question last week, the Minister told me that there are 55,000 recipients of rent allowance. That is a lot of people paying back to the Minister €4.36 per week for each of the 52 weeks of the year. The Taoiseach, his Ministers and the Members who support the Government are fond of coming to the House and talking in millions of euro every time an issue is raised; yet here are a few millions to ponder. There are some 55,000 paying back €4.36 per week in personal contributions to their rent allowance. Over 52 weeks, that comes to some €12 million the poorest people are paying back to the Government.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_628">The CWO is not involved. The Minister signed the regulations to which I have referred. They provide that a rent supplement shall not be payable where an amount of rent exceeds the appropriate maximum amount of rent as determined under paragraph (<i>g</i>) of sub-article 2. Take the case of a person in rented accommodation who loses his job, his rent is in excess of the limit set down by the health board and now capped by the Minister. In theory, the person becomes eligible for a rent allowance, but on application to the community welfare officer he will be told that no rent allowance may be paid. He can be advised to seek cheaper accommodation, but this does not take account of the fact that the person's home is involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">The Minister cannot advise on the effect of these regulations. While she can advise on the number in receipt of rent allowance, she has indicated that figures are not available as to the number of cases where a reduction in the amount of supplement occurred or where an applicant failed to meet the qualification criteria. Although the regulations were introduced before Christmas the Minister is unable to advise how many will be affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">The regulations were apparently introduced to impose a control on rent increases. However, in practice tenants whose rent exceeds the rent allowance get the appropriate form from their community welfare officer and gets their landlord to enter on it the amount, which coincides with the cap. Rent allowance is then paid on that basis. However, a separate arrangement between the landlord and the tenant means the tenant pays a higher rent.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">These regulations will have to be changed because over time increasing numbers of people will be told they are not entitled to a rent allowance. This trend will accelerate as job losses rise on a weekly basis. Many of those affected who are in rented accommodation probably never considered that they would need recourse to an allowance. They will now be told by their community welfare officers that they will be liable for the full rent imposed on them. If the penny has not dropped yet with the Minister, the consequences of these regulations will become apparent and she will have to amend them. I urge her to act sooner rather than later before she puts tenants, community welfare officers and health board staff in an impossible position trying to enforce an impossible regulation.</p>

        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_369">
          <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_632">The Minister made extravagant claims about the additional social welfare budget of €530 million. She did not tell the House that the budget for 2003 is effectively a cut of 50% in the budget available to her predecessor in 2002. In view of this, her speech in this debate was fatally flawed.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">The Minister referred to the Government's achievement in increasing social welfare expenditure for 2003 to over €10 billion. However, according to EUROSTAT figures, Ireland is at the bottom of the league of European Union and OECD countries in terms of expenditure on social protection. The Minister has become a smiling face for the imposition of major cutbacks in social welfare and protection. My colleague, Deputy Gilmore, dwelt on her vicious attack on the rent supplement and her attempt to cap it. Overall levels of social protection are lower than what is required and all the figures indicate that society has become more unequal.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">Over recent years attempts have been made to establish a basic minimum income for all citizens. The Bill deals with specific changes. One or two of them are welcome but I am unsure about a couple of others, especially with regard to pensions. An attempt should be made to amend these on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">The overall provision for the significant part of society dependent on social welfare income is not helped by the two Bills introduced by the Minister. Her predecessor promised to introduce a Green Paper, a White Paper and legislation on the question of a basic income. During his term as Minister he waltzed the CORI organisation and others around their proposals without introducing any fundamental reform. We are still waiting for the Government to seriously address income deficiencies in this society. It was to be hoped that the targets agreed under the PPF would at least have been approached. Deputy Brendan Smith referred to the achievements regarding the provisions for senior citizens under the Bill introduced before Christmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">However, the Senior Citizen's Parliament, which emerged from a SIPTU initiative, set as an initial target a basic income of 40% of the average industrial wage for senior citizens on contributory and non-contributory pension. It then agreed on a target of 34%, yet the Government is struggling to reach a target of 30%, despite the previous Administration's much vaunted target of an old age pension of at least £100 per week. It has not attempted to seriously address the imposition of a basic income for senior citizens, never mind for those on lone parent incomes, assistance schemes and the other benefit schemes, including long-term sickness and invalidity pensions. The Minister has no intention of addressing seriously the issue of income. The Government has calmly ignored the various contributions of CORI and others.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">I wonder why the community platform, the third part of our economy, would sign up to another national agreement given that one of its most basic requests, which is for basic income for all citizens or at least a living income of perhaps 30% of average industrial earnings, has not been taken on board seriously by the Government. The section that refers to child benefit involves an absolute breach of trust with the social partners, as the Minister well knows. We thought we had a three year programme under which child benefit would increase by at least £25 over the three years. However, the Minister has recently announced a miserable €8 increase for the first two children. A fundamental promise by the Government to have a basic income for our children over three years, which I thought it made in the context of partnership, has been cruelly abandoned.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">The Minister's speech is a great deal of bluster in terms of its being able to address the key issues of people on low income. She has implemented some significant cutbacks. The data we receive from the Combat Poverty Agency and ESRI in its survey of 2000 indicate that the income divide in our society is widening. The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer under the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">My colleague, at the outset of his speech, referred to the levels of payment that now obtain under the social assistance and social insurance funds. Many people, such as those on long-term unemployment assistance, find it outrageous to be asked to live on €24.80 per week. That is the basic income in society, and a miserable €82.80 is allocated for an adult dependant. The previous Minister made some significant promises in relation to adult dependants, but they have not been adhered to this year because we had a rise of only €4. The basic €6 rise across social assistance was an insult to approximately 1 million people who depend primarily on social welfare for income.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">Carer's allowance is currently €129.60 and the non-contributory pension is €144. This is the tenth occasion on which I have had the privilege of being able to comment on the Social Welfare Bill in this House. The levels of income offered this year are derisory and insulting. This is a major issue which the Government should address, but the Minister has paid little attention to it so far.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">I agree with Deputy Smith's comment that the contributory pension for the under-80s of up to €163.70 is still a relatively low income. It does not approach the basic targets that have been set by many of the organisations working for and representing senior citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">There are a number of problems regarding pensions which my party shall address on Committee Stage. So far, the Minister has not succeeded in addressing the key issues facing social welfare recipients, and because she is highly regarded in the House I urge her to fight radically for decent increases for such people.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanHaughey" eId="spk_370">
          <from>Mr. Haughey</from>
          <p eId="para_643">I wish to share my time with Deputy Cooper-Flynn. I congratulate Deputy Coughlan belatedly on her appointment to ministerial office. Unfortunately, she became a Minister at the same time that financial resources were becoming scarce. Nevertheless, her practical, but caring and compassionate, approach has already been evidenced and I wish her well in her endeavours. The package of measures announced in the budget concerning social welfare was good in light of the circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">Child benefit is being increased to €125.60 for each of the first two children and to €157.30 for the third and subsequent children. The Minister is pursuing a similar approach to that adopted by her predecessor in that child benefit increases are being used to tackle child poverty in a direct way. In addition, the child benefit system is being used to help parents with child care expenses. I agree with the approach to child care. It ensures that both the stay-at-home parent and the parent working outside the home are treated equally, which I welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">The respite care grant is being increased to €735 per annum and to €1,470 for carers looking after two or more children. I also welcome this measure. Since 1997 a wide range of measures has been introduced to improve the position of carers, 13 major changes in particular. At the end of 2001 there were 18,800 carers in receipt of the carer's allowance, which represents an increase of more than 104% in the number of carers receiving it since the Government took office. The scheme is being improved each year and this year is no exception.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">There are demands to abolish the means test with regard to the carer's allowance. Although that is something we should strive to achieve, it is not practical in the short-term given the resources of the State. However, I welcome the measures introduced each year pertaining to the income disregards to allow more people to qualify. I urge the Minister to continue with that approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">The Bill extends entitlement to six weeks' payment following the death of a person in receipt of certain social welfare payments to the surviving spouse or partner who is receiving a payment in his or her own right. I congratulate the Minister on this initiative. Sometimes the system can be bureaucratic and unresponsive to the realities of life. The social welfare system can, at times, appear to be callous. A bereavement is very stressful for people and can result in many additional expenses. Therefore, this measure is welcome and represents a move in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">Has the Minister any plans to re-examine the PRSI classes? As a public representative, I receive complaints from self-employed people who run into difficulties and find they are entitled to very little despite the fact that they have paid heavily into the PRSI system. Can the Minister explain the rationale behind the various classes? Presumably, they are based on an historical evolution and it may be time to re-examine them in the interests of all potential social welfare claimants.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">The national fuel scheme assists householders on long-term social welfare and those in receipt of health board payments who are unable to provide for their heating needs. The fuel season runs for 29 weeks between 1 October to late April. I regularly receive complaints from constituents which relate to the non-payment of the fuel allowance during unseasonably cold or wet weather outside that time period. This is a difficult problem to solve given the unpredictability of the weather, but there is a case to be made for extending the fuel season in light of recent experience. Doing so would alleviate the hardship experienced by these claimants which is why I hope the Minister will look on the proposal favourably. Exceptional needs payments, facilitated through the supplementary welfare system, are not the answer which is why a review of the national fuel scheme should be carried out.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">I support the section which provides for entitlement to rent supplement. The Bill provides that for new applicants rent supplements will be payable only where the claimant is lawfully resident in the State. Meeting the accommodation needs of asylum seekers will now be the responsibility of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform under the direct provision scheme. This is sensible given the changes made by the Minister, Deputy McDowell, with regard to refugees and asylum seekers generally and the provision will be welcomed by the community as a whole. It ensures a co-ordinated approach to these matters by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the health boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">Members of this House face complaints about the entitlements of refugees and asylum seekers from their constituents and our role in combating racism is not appreciated. At least once a week, a constituent complains to me about refugees and asylum seekers being granted supplementary welfare to buy cars. I draw their attention to the reply to a parliamentary question by the then Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, on 26 February 2002. In that reply the Minister said he was aware of rumours circulating to the effect that asylum seekers and refugees were in receipt of payments from the social welfare system to which citizens are not entitled. Items mentioned included cars. The Minister pointed out that the rumours were untrue and without foundation and he agreed with former Deputy de Rossa, who asked the question, that they were being used to promote resentment against asylum seekers and refugees. He was glad to refute the stories.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">The Minister's points cannot be restated often enough and I am happy to reiterate them. Constituents regularly complain about perceived advantages granted through the social welfare system to refugees and the role of Deputies is to explain the facts. That role should not be underestimated, but rather appreciated by the media and others.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">I praise the Minister for her work in relation to the family. She has encouraged research into family break-up and she has provided financial support for counselling services. There are major pressures on families in modern society and the Minister and her Department are attempting to deal with and research them. Practical measures are being put in place to help families overcome the difficulties they face. On foot of the budget, the Minister has introduced a good package of measures in relation to pensioners, widows, widowers, carers and child benefit recipients. In view of circumstances, she has done extremely well and I urge her to continue to honour the commitments outlined in the programme for Government.</p>

        <speech by="#BeverleyCooperFlynn" eId="spk_371">
          <from>Ms Cooper-Flynn</from>
          <p eId="para_654">I join colleagues in congratulating the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, on her appointment as a member of Cabinet. It gives me great pleasure to speak on this Bill which brings to €10 billion the total spent on social welfare.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">The changes to rent supplement provisions have proven to be the most controversial aspects of the legislation. We must look at the capping of rent levels from the Minister's perspective. The Minister is concerned primarily for the applicant who has to claim rent supplement in the first place. Her provisions aim to protect applicants by ensuring that they do not find themselves in desperate financial circumstances by paying more than they can afford to. I listened to Deputy Gilmore cite a particular case during his contribution. He referred to the possibility of job loss by persons who are paying rent which is over and above the levels set by the Minister. The Bill provides that the community welfare officer has discretion to provide additional assistance in the circumstances he outlined. I compliment the Minister on that. In practice many landlords charge exorbitant rents to people who can ill afford to pay. The health boards set the level of supplement and pay the allowance accordingly, irrespective of the actual rent, which means that the tenant is hurt. Even in smaller towns, landlords are charging very high rents in these circumstances which makes things extremely difficult for young families. I support the Minister's initiative, the success of which will only be revealed in the fullness of time. We must recognise that her motives are correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">I support the provisions in section 13 which address the payment of supplementary rent to asylum seekers. It is important to make this the responsibility of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Rent supplement should only be made available to persons living lawfully in the State, but I recognise that there are exceptions to every rule. This is addressed in the legislation through the inclusion of elements of discretion and flexibility in terms of the operations of community welfare officers. Perhaps this is an area to which the Minister will refer when she makes her concluding remarks.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">I compliment the Minister on the resolution of the dental dispute. This is a clear example of the Minister's attempts to protect PRSI contributors by ensuring that they are not abused by being forced to pay exorbitant fees for dental services.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">I am delighted that this dispute has finally come to an end and that service can now return to what it was before. I ask the Minister to examine the situation where people have received dental treatment over the past 12 months while this dispute was ongoing. Unfortunately, our teeth do not wait for disputes to be settled. People needing emergency dental treatment during the dispute have run up considerable bills. Like other public representatives, I have received numerous representations from people who have incurred dental bills during the last year. A person pays PRSI and expects certain benefits from the scheme and dental treatment is one of those. Whether or not there is a dispute between the Irish Dental Association and the Department should not concern people who pay their lawful PRSI contributions. I ask the Minister to examine that situation to see if there is any way of compensating those people who have incurred very necessary dental expenses in the past year.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">I have listened with incredulity to some of the former Democratic Left, now Labour Party, Members talking about what this Government is doing for the old age pensioner. We all remember when Democratic Left was part of the rainbow coalition Government. We presumed that at least the social welfare recipients would be given great benefits under that Government. We sat in disbelief when the Minister, Deputy De Rossa, announced the lowest ever percentage increase for social welfare recipients. We will all always preach the good news from our own side of the House—</p>

          <p eId="para_678">I have no doubt that our commitment to old-age pensioners in An Agreed Programme for Government will be honoured over the term of this Government. I compliment the Minister for continuing in that vein. Any society that is not prepared to look after the older people who have contributed over the years is a very negligent one. I am pleased to see this Government is not negligent.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">I am delighted with the very significant increases in child benefit over the past few years. I am personally pleased because this year I am receiving it for the first time. These benefits serve a very useful purpose in the provision of child care. It is very important not just to the working woman but also to the woman who decides to stay at home to look after her children. I welcome the very significant increases, particularly the rate for the first two children which has increased by €8 per month and for the third and subsequent children by €10 per month. These increases are included under section 3 of the Bill and bring the monthly rates to €125.60 and €157.30, respectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">I have written to the Minister and to her predecessor about a situation of which I have heard at my clinics. A woman paying PRSI for 18 years gave up her job to stay at home with her children. As she chose to leave her job, she was unable to avail of the 15 months' PRSI payments. Had she lost her job and been unemployed, she would have received the benefit of those 15 months payments. When a person has contributed over a significant period of 18 years, it is very hard that they do not receive any benefit from their social insurance contributions. I ask the Minister if anything can be done for women who stay at home to look after their children. I understand that there must be consistency across all these measures and that is the reply I received in the past. I would appreciate if the Minister could examine the case again.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_684">I wish to share my time with Deputies Finian McGrath and Gogarty. Not long after the recent election, my party colleague, Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, received a telephone call from a woman to whom it is no great exaggeration to refer as one of Ireland's unsung heroes. Her name is Margaret Hoffman from Boyle in County Roscommon. She rang in tears of frustration and hurt because she is a member of one of the most ignored and undervalued sections of Irish society; she is a carer. She takes 24-hour care of her son, Daniel. She is not paid for holidays, nor does she get any holiday. For herself and her husband, after whom her son is named, every single week is a struggle, every bill through the door is a source of fear and almost every night is sleepless with worry.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">In a letter she wrote to the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, Margaret asked why the formula for the means test does not take into account essential outgoings such as rent, mortgage, medical expenses, insurance or a car loan. Without a car she would not be able to take Daniel to his various and numerous medical appointments. She asked the Minister how she can justify a carer's allowance of €5.30 per week for an adult providing full-time care. I ask if that is the value the Minister places on the work Margaret does. She asked the Minister to justify the means test. She reminded the Minister that an end to the degradation and humiliation associated with the means test was promised in election campaigns and budget negotiations by successive Governments. All this Government has done is increase the weekly income disregard by a few euro. I am sick and tired of the tinkering around at the edges of the means test by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy. It is unfair, unjust and it must stop. There should be no more fiddling about with income limits. The Minister should get rid of the means test now.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">The most shocking part of Margaret's story is yet to come. Her allowance was cut from €62 to €5.30. The Department of Social and Family Affairs took money from this woman. It is one of the worst cases I have ever heard of. This Government will give her an extra €7 per week which will bring her income to €12.30 per week. She provides 24-hour care for €12.30 per week. There are thousands of people in this State who earn more in one half an hour and the Minister and the Members of this House are part of that number. This is not a unique case. Year after year, the Carers Association asks for the means test to be abolished and successive Governments have failed to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">There are 100,000 carers and the overwhelming majority are women. They have had to fight every step of the way to gain even the most basic entitlement from successive Governments. I ask the House to imagine the terrifying vista that would unfold in our health service if these men and women did not do the work they do. Every year they save the Exchequer hundreds of millions of euro. The top rate VHI scheme allocates €70 a day for people convalescing in medical homes. That is €490 a week. In one week VHI provides more support to a patient than the Minister for Social and Family Affairs provides to Margaret for a year.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">Margaret, and other carers, make an enormous contribution to the State but receive, perhaps, the least recognition for it. In their pre-budget submission the Carers Association said the Department of Social and Family Affairs continues to regard the association as a system of payment for carers who need income support. The Government should recognise the work these people do and reward them properly for it instead of treating the allowances like income support.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">I ask the House and everybody here with a conscience to recognise the role of carers and to recognise the discrimination of the implementation of the means test on carers.</p>

        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_394">
          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_690">I welcome the debate today as this Bill provides for the introduction of a range of social welfare improvements announced in budget 2003. Any increase in child benefit or the respite care grant is a step in the right direction but we need to do more for people. We are discussing the welfare and well-being of all our people. This must be an important part of any strategy to deal with poverty and social exclusion. It is a pity this Bill does not deal head on with the major problems of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">Section 3 of the Bill provides for increases in child benefit as announced in budget 2003. The increase is €8 paid in respect of the first and second child and €10 in respect of the third and subsequent children. These increases come into effect in April 2003. They are low and come nowhere near meeting increases in inflation or child-rearing costs. Is the Government living in the real world? There is a reduction in living standards, particularly since the increases in fuel, ESB and transport costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">Many of us demanded an increase in the qualifying adult allowance to cover inflation but the Government only gave €4. This is a disgrace and shows clearly the direction the Government is taking in looking after its people. The income threshold for the family income supplement, FIS, should have been raised by at least €39 per week. The Government gave €17, less than half the amount required to maintain the living standard of below-income families. The Government ignored the request to raise the current rates of child benefit allowance to a single rate of €25 per week for each child. This has led to consistent erosion in living standards of the poorest households in the country. The rich-poor gap has widened and child poverty is a scandal, with over 400,000 children affected. In Ireland 2003, there are 400,000 children living in poverty. Many boys and girls go to school in the morning without proper clothing or meals or turn up late because of family crises.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">This is what we are trying to deal with when discussing the social welfare Bill. This Bill is an example of how our society is drifting to the right. It is against the gut instinct of the majority of people who would have no time for right wing politics. Of course, we all know from where the Government is coming, particularly when we look at election figures. We do not look after the 38% of our poorest people who do not vote. Instead we tap into the affluent and middle classes in society. It is important to point out that the 38% who are constantly excluded are the same people who do not vote. I call on them to get involved in the democratic process, otherwise nothing will change.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">Last year we had the debate about the Bertie bowl and now we have the new debate about the Bertie bird, the new jet costing €41.6 million.</p>

          <p eId="para_697">This is another example of the use of public funds which could be channelled in other directions. I am an optimist and I believe things will change, as has happened in Venezuela and Brazil. Ireland needs leaders with guts, vision and determination who will look after the weaker section of society. The formation of the Technical Group is a response and puts down a clear marker of the way forward. In discussing this Bill we are standing at a crossroads and must decide which way to go. We can go back to the old stale policies of Thatcherism or go the route of caring for people. I challenge our media commentators on this, particularly those in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> who seem to be taking sideswipes at politicians who want to create a more caring society.</p>

          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_699">My vision was the reason I was elected in Dublin North-Central. The Deputy got it wrong on the peace march and is getting it wrong again. This Bill should be about compassion and welfare but it is not. Section 4 provides that the increase in the annual respite care grant, payable to recipients of carer's benefit and carer's allowance, will be paid in June 2003. Why is it delayed until then? Why can it not be paid now? The sum of €735 is a small price to pay for a carer caring for one person. This is caring on the cheap and is not acceptable. The carers of the country are saving the State almost €2 billion and we offer them €735 a year. This is a disgrace and a national scandal.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">Over the past seven years we had a glorious opportunity to end poverty. This Bill makes no serious provision for the weaker sections of society. I have no alternative but to vote against legislation which only reflects the greed of a Government which does nothing concrete for the people. Last week we saw one of our largest banks make a profit of €1.4 billion. We must face the reality that some people are making huge profits while weaker sections of society are on waiting lists. It is time to shift some of the wealth from the greedy to the needy. This will mean a more equitable taxation system and a new type of social welfare Bill. It will mean radical change and tough decisions in the interests of ordinary people. It will mean legislation must have teeth to deliver real change and it will mean that all of us have to change. I accept that. We need a new radical type of civic republicanism which will make the Bill relevant to the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2003 should be about change. It should be about looking to the future and developing strategies to wipe out poverty, end homelessness and improve our education service and the quality of life for our people. This Bill is not about welfare and there are no real social changes for society. Cutting back today will mean major damage in the future. Investing €1 now would return four times that in the future. That is not just economic but common sense. I urge everyone to reject this flawed legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_703">What I have to say about this Bill could be said in a sentence. It is absolute bull and of no benefit to the people. However, I will use the time available to me to make a few pertinent points. I live in the real world and do not often get the opportunity to speak in the House so I reserve the right to make comment when it is due. Before Christmas, when I first spoke on the Social Welfare Bill, I pointed out that the 9% social welfare increase for pensioners was meagre compared to the pay rise of Deputies to whom I sent a letter asking them to make some form of joint submission to the Minister for Finance forgoing our October pay increase in order to send a message of solidarity in recognition of the fact that we were living in tighter times.</p>

          <p eId="para_743">We need ongoing investment in transport infrastructure to help with tourism. We also need to ensure the most vulnerable in our society have access to such infrastructure. If one looks at the more disadvantaged areas of my constituency or in south-west or north County Dublin, it is clear that the most vulnerable have been placed in such areas. They have to contend with an inadequate public transport system and are given meagre resources. The further delay in the extension of the medical card affects them hugely. All this leads to the continuation of a ghetto society. If one does not always have access to a decent meal at home, even the best run breakfast club will not facilitate one staying in school throughout the primary and second level cycle.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">I would have liked to have seen some meaningful benefits provided in the Bill that would enable those within relative and absolute poverty traps to get out of them. The Conference of Religious in Ireland – I know this is being dealt with in the context of redress – has consistently stated – the Green Party agrees with its policy – that there is a need to provide a guaranteed basic income for every man, woman and child in society in order that people can have access at an equal level while still promoting the notion of enterprise.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">The Green Party has often been castigated by the Deputies opposite and their Progressive Democrats cohorts. They say: "The Greens are fine. They are idealistic but wait until you see their economic policies."  Investment in environmental efficiency actually saves money. The Government should take a leaf out of the Greens' book and invest in some environmentally friendly initiatives. The savings could be put towards investing in a better, more equitable social welfare system, certainly one far better than what is suggested in the Bill. I thank the Deputies for their interruptions in what has been a most interesting debate.</p>

          <from>Mr. Andrews</from>
          <p eId="para_753">I apologise, a Leas-Cheann Chomhairle. It is my view that 85% of people at the last general election voted for what Deputy Finian McGrath would refer as right-wing parties, although I would refer to them as other than that. It is his hope and the hope of many opposite that we will be able to propagate a left-right divide when it is patently obvious that this will never happen. We have a growing middle class and a shrinking working class. There are many people with more means than before. It is a shame to treat the House to such revisionism as most of what he said was fair and reasonable.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">The Deputy should also remember that there was a different march of 100,000 people in Dublin some 20 years ago. People then marched because they wanted taxation to come down. It has done so but the new parties coming into the Dáil are telling us that we have to put it back up again. They have clearly learned nothing from the past 20 years during which we addressed the fundamental problem of an excessive tax burden on society.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#BarryAndrewsFF" eId="spk_450">
          <from>Mr. Andrews</from>
          <p eId="para_756">They want to start all over again with taxation and borrowing as though 17 May 2002 marked the first day of politics in this country. The Deputies opposite should read a little more about these issues. Deputy Finian McGrath forgot about the levy in the budget that will raise money directly from the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">The figures in regard to poverty being bandied about by various Deputies are inconsistent. Deputy Crowe who spoke on behalf of the Technical Group said there were 340,000 living in poverty while Deputy Finian McGrath referred to a figure of 400,000. That loose grasp of facts suggests that Opposition Deputies will continue in opposition for a long time until they can convince the people they understand economic conditions and can grasp such basic figures.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">The Social Welfare Bill is to be commended to the House. In particular, I welcome section 5 which provides for greater child dependant increases. These continue up to the age of 22 years which clearly is welcome to those trying their best to stay in education. The Government is committed to ensuring third level education is more accessible. This is one way in which that commitment can be secured.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">Many Deputies, particularly in the Fine Gael Party, lecture us about the effect special savings investment accounts are having on the economy. At the same time they claim inflationary effects are taking away from the benefits accruing under the Social Welfare Bill. These two standpoints are inconsistent. SSIAs have effected a control on inflation and ensured the full benefit of social welfare increases will accrue to those at whom they are directed.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">The Minister has delivered another equitable step by extending the means test, as recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare. The value of benefits such as free board and lodging is no longer regarded as means which is also to be welcomed. It is my hope the Minister will continue to decrease the age limit from over 29 to over 25 years. However, I am concerned that certain rent increases in the social housing sector are tending to take away from the benefits she hopes people will derive from the Social Welfare Bill. Next month in Dún Laoghaire rents will be increased. An increase in social welfare pensions reflects an improvement in a person's way of life which he or she is entitled to keep. It should not be taken away by another arm of government.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">Deputy Haughey referred to section 13 which relates to asylum seekers. No other Deputy has referred to this section which deals with a very sensitive area skirted around during last year's general election campaign. The Minister has made a sensible provision. I hope we will watch the development of this situation in the coming months and years.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">The pension scheme provisions of section 23 are an excellent example of a Department taking a proactive role rather than waiting until something becomes an issue. People are losing out through the weakness in the equity markets, although it may be dramatic to speak about the creation of time bombs for those who have invested heavily in pension schemes, especially equity and hedge funds. The Minister has been charitable, generous and far-sighted in making the provisions in section 23, even if they are technical.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">For these reasons I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#DonnieCassidyFF" eId="spk_451">
          <from>Mr. Cassidy</from>
          <p eId="para_764">I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity to make a contribution to this debate on the Social Welfare Bill. This is the second of two Bills which deliver a social welfare package worth €530 million in the budget of 2003 and, for the first time, bring the projected level of social welfare expenditure to more than €10 billion. Any fair minded person will see that from 1997 this increased from €5.7 billion to €10 billion and almost doubled the allocation.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">Carers are the unsung heroes of our society. I compliment the Government on the successive budget increases and measures to develop the services and supports which provide practical assistance for them. It is continuing to honour its commitment to support the valuable work undertaken by them by increasing the respite care grant by €100 from €635 to €735. Carers looking after more than one person will receive a grant of €1,470, an increase of €200. We are told by the Minister that this will benefit 24,700 carers at a cost of €2.5 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">As a matter of urgency, the Government should look into the cost of eliminating the means test for carers who make trojan sacrifices. Daughters often give up their careers to look after a parent who may be suffering from Alzheimer's or another disease. I know of many hardship cases of people who are not properly remunerated, although if the parent who is ill had to go into hospital, the cost to the State would be enormous. I would like to see this matter addressed in future Social Welfare Bills. I believe I speak for every Member of the House when I acknowledge the wonderful work done by those who care for their parents and continue the long tradition of sons and daughters showing their parents care and respect and repaying them for the sacrifices they made in earlier years.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">I welcome the increase in child benefit. Increases of €8 for the first two children and €10 for the third and subsequent child are substantial. For the first two children the benefit is €125 per month and €157 per month for every subsequent child. A family with three children will receive €408.50 every month. The Ministers for Finance and Social and Family Affairs must be complimented on the wonderful increases they have given which are so richly deserved. These increases support families and are an acknowledgment by this caring Government of the contribution of parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">I acknowledge the arrangements for the payment of social welfare benefits for six weeks after death which are designed to give transitional family support immediately following the death of a pensioner. The Minister has addressed a number of anomalies in section 7 of the Bill. I acknowledge her understanding in making this provision for those in receipt of disability benefit, unemployment benefit, invalidity pension, unemployment assistance, unemployability supplement, supplementary welfare allowance, pre-retirement allowance, disability allowance and farm assistance allowance. My family has been associated with the undertaking business for generations and I know this provision is most welcome and will be put to very good use. I compliment the Minister and the Government on this measure.</p>

He lectures Deputies, yet he continues to accept the increased payment. There is much to be learned by that young man. He must learn that when one finds oneself in a hole, one should not continue digging.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">The social welfare increases allowed for in this year's budget amount to €530 million. It would be useful to compare that with previous Governments. In its last budget the rainbow coalition gave an increase of €273 million. This year social welfare payments will almost double the level set by Fine Gael and Labour when last in Government. As a result of the changes made in last year's budget all social welfare weekly increases are paid from 1 January. That is a significant improvement on the previous position.</p>

          <p eId="para_774">The House will know that all of the budgets introduced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, have been characterised by measures designed to improve the position of older people in society. There is no doubt that the elderly have been satisfied with what has happened. In 1997 we promised to increase all old age pensions to over £100 per week. That was done emphatically. At the 2002 election we promised to increase the State pension to €200 per week and over the term of this Government that will happen. In budget 2003 we were well on track to deliver on that because it has increased the full personal rate of old age pension by €10. People will have selective political memories.

The figures speak for themselves. In monetary terms the statistics are even more stark. The effect of the increases under the Fianna Fáil-led Government is that the rate of old age contributory pension will now stand at €157.30 per week. That is a monumental increase on the €99 per week, which was the rate payable under the champions of social justice, under Proinsias De Rossa and the Fine Gael-Labour Government when in office. The increases in pensions this year are real.</p>

          <p eId="para_785">We achieved two thirds of that planned increase in the last two years. This year we are announcing an additional €105 million in a full year to increase child benefit even further. Child benefit rates will increase by €8 per month for the first and second child and by €10 per month for the third and subsequent children. Let us look at the comparisons in order that we can appreciate the scale of child benefit under Fianna Fáil in Government. It is worth emphasising that when we returned to Government in 1997, child benefit was payable at the rate of €38 per month for the first and second child and €49.52 for the third and subsequent children. Therefore, the increases and the priority which Fianna Fáil has attached to child benefit means that following budget 2003, child benefit will now be payable at the rate of €125.60 for the first and second child and at the rate of €157 for the third and subsequent children. These increases mean that in our period in office we have more than trebled the payment rate of child benefit. It is a record with which the rainbow Government parties cannot compare or compete.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">This year's budget increases in tax credits, exemption limits and mortgage interest relief combined will take 37,400 taxpayers out of the tax net. One third of these taxpayers are aged 65 or over. In one year, Fianna Fáil has almost equalled the number of people removed from the tax net that the Fine Gael-Labour Government did over three budgets. As a result of the measures introduced in the rainbow Government's budget, 38,000 taxpayers were removed from the tax net in 1995, 1996 and 1997. We have beaten that record 11 fold over our budgets in that 417,000 taxpayers have been removed from the tax net.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">If one looks at the 2003 budget even further progress has been made towards our intention to increase the tax entry point towards the level of the minimum wage. In this year's budget by increasing the employee take we have raised the entry point in the tax system for a single person from €209 to €223 per week. The progress Fianna Fáil has delivered in this area is highlighted by the fact that when we came into office the relevant entry point was €97.70. The entry point to the income tax system is now 90% of the current minimum wage. That is a feature that has to be lauded and recognised. Certainly it was recognised by social welfare recipients in the last budget when they knew exactly for whom to vote.</p>

In terms of rent supplement and the role of the community welfare officer, the time has come when we must examine in detail the role of the officer and ask whether local authorities should vet and give out rent supplements and mortgage supplements as against the health boards and community welfare officers. That is in no way to denigrate the contribution made by community welfare officers. If people are on a housing list, the housing inspector will have a far better perspective on the state of the house because the person will have visited that accommodation. They will know the circumstances of the family involved and will be in a far better position to judge the need for and the extent of rent supplement.</p>

It read, "Health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped."  It was a simple message. The message portrayed to the general public was that the Government would put an end to that and would do what the public wanted if it elected them.

It is a good job I have pity for them, because no one else will have pity for them. I will tell them what will happen. The public is now about to wake up.

If a CAW, which applies to all aircraft, is applied, the aeroplane will fly for the appropriate number of air miles, and it will not break down afterwards. That is the whole basis for the CAW. If the Minister of State wants more information about the CAW, I will give it to him later.</p>

Why not increase the number of carers throughout the country? There was an opportunity to do it. The Government could have done with a smaller jet. It does not need one as big as the oil sheikhs.

          <p eId="para_822">Reference has been made by Members to the extent to which the increases, or otherwise, in social welfare payments this year have cushioned the public against the impact of inflation. If Members opposite will think back seven, eight or nine years, they will find that jobs were being created at the rate of 1,000 a week. The economy was going well, all the fundamentals were in the correct trajectory and going in the right direction. One can blame 11 September for what has happened since, but what is actually happening now – the public is aware of this – is that the Government is saving up for the next general election. Having sat down after the last election, it thought it was a great success, it almost made it by pulling off a massive stroke.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">The Government has now decided to pull a second stroke by way of cutbacks and saving as much as possible in the hope that the public will not realise what is happening, and, lo and behold, a week before the next general election arrears of child benefit will be paid. Payments will be flowing in letterboxes throughout the country. There will be increases in old age pensions to beat the band. People who are not even old age pensioners will get increases through their letterboxes. It will only be at that juncture that the public will question when it last got such increases. Members of the public will then realise the sting facing them and that the last time they received such handouts was immediately before the general election. They will work that out for themselves.</p>

          <p eId="para_830">Change for the people at present comes in the form of a letter from a health board stating that it is sorry but that new guidelines have been introduced in regard to the rent supplement and that it will only pay up to a certain amount. When the unfortunate tenant tells the health board that they cannot find a house to rent at that amount, the health board says it is sorry. As a result, people will have to sleep in the open air. I do not exaggerate when I say I have come across cases in the past 12 months where young women and their children have slept in the open air because there was nowhere for them to go. Members opposite can talk about Government jets as often as they wish and about how much has been done by this Administration and how little was done by previous ones but unless somebody opposite recognises the injustice being done to people in these circumstances, the marches they have seen in the past will be nothing compared to those they will see in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">I refer to medical card guidelines. If one earns €180, one does not qualify for a medical card. I have dealt with cases of widows and widowers who find themselves in an awful position when they receive a letter from the health board outlining the guidelines. The income limits have been kept artificially low. Members on the Government side know what I am talking about because their constituents will have shown them evidence of this. I cannot understand why Government backbenchers and frontbenchers have not risen up and rebelled and asked that something be done about the guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">I mentioned the VAT increases which affect everybody, be they old age pensioners, widows or widowers. Transport costs increased in the budget and, as a result, have eroded any social welfare increases.</p>

          <p eId="para_833">I laugh when the parties opposite, which are entering their seventh year in power, look back to before that time by way of response. I hope the public is not as angry as it is now when they go to the electorate because if it is, there will be changes. There will be a number of vacancies on the Government side. It is in their interests to try to do something now. They should not be too cynical and try to save money at the public's expense in order to pour it out in the weeks before the general election because the public will not buy it.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">Reference was made to rent assistance and rent allowances in lieu of local authority and other housing. The record of this and the previous Government in this area is abysmal. Never in the history of the State have there been so many people on housing lists for so long and living in such awful circumstances. Relationships and marriages have broken up before those concerned have been able to get a home. In some cases, people have been on housing lists for seven or eight years before even being considered for a home.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">In the meantime, rent allowance is being provided in lieu of housing which costs the Exchequer somewhere in the region of €100 million to €150 million per annum. This is being repeated year after year. The money is going to landlords, yet there is no resolution to the housing crisis. Nothing is being achieved and it is a waste of money. Instead of spending this money on rent allowances, it would have been far better to put it towards reducing the numbers on the housing lists by a certain number each year. The Minister of State, Deputy McDaid, knows what I am talking about and agrees with me, although I do not expect him to say so here. It is a disgrace that so much money is spent subsidising rent at a time when it is possible to provide housing. We must remember we had a booming economy for the past number of years but all that happened during this boom was that the number on the housing lists got bigger.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">One thing which has changed is that the question of security of tenure has gone down the river. In the past few days, somebody boasted that the old fashioned wish of the Irish to have a semi-detached house is gone and that apartments and continental style living are the future. I would not bet on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_838">The 35,000 houses were bought by investors and financial institutions and they are rented to unfortunate people who are stuck in a poverty trap and cannot move forward or backward. The Government, through the Department of Social and Family Affairs, Department of Health and Children and the health boards, is giving them a pittance so that they can survive. It is a waste of money and the sooner the Government realises that, the better. Although this has been going on for seven years, I cannot understand why nobody recognises what is happening. We live in a society which is hugely encouraging to investors and financial institutions but which is hugely discouraging to people on housing lists.</p>

          <from>Dr. Fitzpatrick</from>
          <p eId="para_845">We will keep the chill away for a while. Deputy Durkan referred to carer's allowance. The Government provided for an increase in the annual respite care grant payable to recipients of carer's benefit and carer's allowance in the budget. We have, over successive budgets, introduced measures to develop the services and supports that provide practical assistance to carers. By introducing this measure, we are maintaining our commitment to support the valuable work undertaken by carers. The new rates for the grant which will be payable from June are €735 where the carer looks after one person and €1,470 where the carer looks after more than one person. This measure will benefit 24,000 carers and will cost an additional €2.5 million per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">My primary interest in the debate is the Minister's role in the resolution of the dentists' dispute. She has promised an early independent review of the dental scheme. The independent chairperson should examine the cost base of dentists because it is cheaper to have one's dental work done in Northern Ireland than here. What additional costs are faced by dentists in the Republic compared to their counterparts in the North? How can dentists in the North deliver at a substantial discount a comparable service in terms of quality, care and technical ability to that which is provided in this jurisdiction?</p>
          <p eId="para_847">The independent chairperson should also examine the role of ancillaries and technicians in dentistry. For example, denture work could be done by properly trained technicians at a fraction of the cost of the service provided by fully qualified dental surgeons. A case has been taken in the courts by a dental technician who has breached the dental Act. The Ministers for Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs and the Irish Dental Council have sought to block him from providing a service to the public.</p>

          <p eId="para_849">Ministers are always slow to upset the <i>status quo</i> no matter who is in power. However, I welcome the agreement of the Irish Dental Association to display a price list for dental fillings, setting out the private patient and PRSI patient fees. This will provide for greater transparency. Basic preventative dental treatment, including examination, scale and polish, will remain free. The Department will pay a 10% increase in its fees to dentists and dental treatment fees, where relevant, will increase by 10% for PRSI patients. This takes effect from the date of this agreement and includes the increase due last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">The Bill legislates for an increase in child benefit. The Government announced its intention in the 2001 budget to invest an unprecedented €1.27 billion in increased child benefit payments over a number of budgets. Two thirds of the planned increase was achieved over the past two years. This year the Minister for Finance announced an increase of €105 million in a full year in child benefit. The Bill, when enacted, will result in child benefit rates increasing by €8 per month for the first and second child and by €10 per month for the third and subsequent children. Given the priority the Government has attached to child benefit, the increase in the 2003 budget will mean child benefit will be payable at the rate of €125.60 per month for the first and second child and €157.30 for the third and subsequent children.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">The Government launched the national children's strategy in November 2000 in an effort to improve the quality of services to children. The strategy, which ensures the voices of children are heard, has been praised by the United Nations. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_852">The Bill provides for the introduction of a range of social welfare improvements announced in the recent budget and a number of additional proposals approved by Cabinet. It legislates for increases in child benefit and the respite care grant, taking effect in April and June, respectively, at a cost of €104.83 million in the case of child benefit and €2.5 million in the case of the respite care grant in a full year. The Bill also extends child dependant allowances for certain children of recipients of short-term social welfare payments as provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and it provides for changes in the means test for certain social assistance schemes and includes PRSI measures announced in the budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">The legislation amends the Pensions Act 1990 to strengthen the powers of the Pensions Board to allow it to respond, on a case-by-case basis, to schemes which find themselves in funding difficulties on foot of the current equities downturn. There has been much comment recently regarding the uncertainty surrounding pensions generally in light of the exceptional fall in global equity markets. The impact of this decline poses sharp but, hopefully, short-term problems for many employers and pension fund trustees who may have difficulty meeting the funding standard under the Pensions Act 1990.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">Other provisions in the Bill include the extension of a special allowance currently paid to social welfare pensioners aged over 66 who are living on islands and recipients of invalidity pension, disability allowance and unemployability supplement. It takes effect in April and the allowance will be €12.70 per week. The legislation also extends entitlement to six weeks payment following the death of a person in receipt of certain social welfare payments to the surviving spouse or partner who is receiving a payment in his or her own right.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">The Bill provides for the abolition of the assessment of benefit and privilege for people aged 29 and over who claim unemployment assistance and pre-retirement allowance payments and amends the rules governing entitlement to rent supplement. With regard to new applicants, rent supplement will be payable only where the claimant is lawfully resident in the State. This means that certain non-EEA nationals, including asylum seekers, will not be entitled to rent supplement after the commencement date of this provision. In future responsibility for accommodation for asylum seekers will be the responsibility of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform under the direct provision scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">The conditions for receipt of supplementary welfare allowance are also being amended to align it with the entitlement conditions that apply to unemployment assistance as appropriate. The Bill also provides for amendments to the definitions of "reckonable earnings", "reckonable emoluments" and "reckonable income" in order to facilitate the introduction of non-cash remuneration into the PRSI code. The application of PRSI to benefits-in-kind was announced in the budget and is due to take effect from January 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">Only last week the Minister for Social and Family Affairs authorised funding of €150,000 for the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed towards the cost of maintaining and developing a welfare to work service and the publication of an information booklet, Working for Work. Her Department has funded the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed for more than ten years. Funding commenced in 1992 with a grant of £15,000 and increased to more than €146,000 last year. This year's funding consists of €123,000 for the welfare to work service and €27,000 towards the publishing of the booklet Welfare to Work. The INOU's welfare to work service aims to help long-term unemployed people enter the economy by providing a confidential one-to-one information and advice service. The booklet Welfare to Work complements this service. It is intended that 25,000 copies will be distributed this year and that it will be made available on the Internet.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">The social welfare system seeks to be comprehensive in addressing social need and fair, consistent, simple and cost effective in its administration. I was interested to read in recent days that Deputy Rabbitte favours a wealth tax in certain circumstances as an alternative to increasing income taxes to pay for improvements to health, education and transport services. In his speech to party members in Dublin last week setting out his vision for the future of the Labour Party, the leader stated that the new stresses and strains in a more wealthy, more unequal and better educated society have pulled Fianna Fáil onto the side of those with wealth, property, power and influence. That is garbage. Fianna Fáil has always had more working class support than the Labour Party. We are a populist party, we represent everybody not just specific interest groups. It galls me to listen to ill-informed rubbish such as this.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">I joined Fianna Fáil to represent everybody in my county and country. I am not on the side of the wealthy. Ireland is now one of the most prosperous countries in Europe and Fianna Fáil played a major part in that. The country has prospered over the past five years with GDP per capita increasing substantially. People have reaped the benefit of a strong, progressive partnership Government with Fianna Fáil at the helm. Much has been achieved for Ireland since June 1997. This Government has been responsible, during the last five years, for the most sustained and significant strengthening of the Irish economy. For the first time in our history we have come close to full employment. The policies we have implemented have supported the creation of 370,000 extra jobs positioning us among the top countries in terms of global competitiveness. We have worked to achieve unprecedented investment in disadvantaged areas and RAPID programmes benefit 165,000 people across the 25 most deprived urban neighbourhoods. We introduced the largest ever increase in pensions. The old age contributory pension is now payable at €147 per week, an increase of almost 50% since Fianna Fáil took office.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">We introduced new integrated strategies to tackle homelessness and a ten year national children's strategy to improve the quality of life for children. It should also be remembered that an important part of the social welfare administration is based in Longford. I thank the management and staff there. I welcome this Bill and look forward to another four years of Fianna Fáil-led social partnership and Government for all the people of Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_861">I welcome the Bill which provides for increases in child benefit to €125.60 for the first and second child and €157.30 for the third and subsequent children, costing an additional €105 million in a full year. This compares with rates of €38.09 for the first and second child and €49.02 for third and subsequent children in 1997. This, in any man's language, is a significant increase and means child benefit has trebled in that period. I am delighted the Government was able to provide it.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">There has also been a substantial increase in old age pensions from €99 to €157.30 per week. The increase in the annual respite grant to €735 for a carer looking after one person and €1,470 for a carer taking care of more than one person are also welcome. It shows that this is a caring Minister. The disregard of the first €420 of a spouse's income for the purposes of obtaining the carer's allowance is to be welcomed. I have promoted this issue for a number of years. The increase in this area will allow more people to qualify for the carer's allowance. Carers should be given due recognition for the wonderful job they do. This Government is working hard to achieve that.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">I would like to see the introduction of the proposal under the health strategy whereby home-based subvention will be paid to people at home. This would give people the choice of remaining at home rather than going into nursing homes. Many people would prefer to stay in their homes for as long as possible. Implementation of home-based subvention would permit them to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">Another change which I especially welcome is the abolition of the assessment of benefit and privilege for people over the age of 29 claiming unemployment assistance. I hope it will remain so in future budgets. I have always felt that the payment of reduced benefit to an unemployed person living at home was wrong. This system drives people from their family homes. They end up obtaining rent allowance at great cost to the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">I am delighted to be a part of this Government which is taking care of the elderly, carers and the children of Ireland. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Mr. S. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_868">When speaking on the Social Welfare Bill in December last I stated that the 2003 social welfare package was an utter disgrace. I gave examples of unemployed couples with one child who would receive an actual increase of 25 cent per week. A person on unemployment assistance in receipt of the lowest level of payment in social welfare will receive €6 per week – 30 cent per week or 4.25 cent per day after inflation is taken into account. An unemployed single person with one child would be worse off in real terms taking projected inflation into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">The Minister took umbrage at my highlighting these hidden facts. Two months later the situation is even worse. The consumer price index has shown significant increases in food items such as potatoes, cheese, minerals and fruit, all of which are so important for families on low incomes. In addition, we have seen the price of public transport, electricity and gas heating also increase significantly in this period. In recent weeks substantial increases in local authority rents have further eroded social welfare increases.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">I wish to put on record the thoughts of people living in poverty as recorded in Against All Odds: Family Life on Low Income produced by the Combat Poverty Agency. Quotes include: "It always comes back to finance. This determines what kind of lifestyle you have. It can even determine whether your marriage survives or dies"; "The message is be rich and you'll be looked after, be poor and you won't be looked after"; "I told them if I had a cheque book, you'd have me in straight away and the doctor says its not like that, but it is let me tell you"; "It's worse financially. I've the same money but it's not going as far. The weekly shopping is costing more for less."</p>
          <p eId="para_871">I share the sentiments of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, a voluntary organisation which is doing invaluable work on the ground for people in need. Once again the most vulnerable have their living standards reduced, their access to adequate housing, education and health care shelved in what they are told is the interest of our economy, while at the same time those with money, power and influence have their privileged position protected. We have been told time after time by Ministers since the general election that money is scarce and it is not possible to do all we would like or all they promised. This has been the excuse used to justify lower than expected social welfare increases and the Government's failure to provide money to tackle shocking conditions in many of our schools and the appalling problems we face in the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">One of the reasons money is scarce and is going to become even more scarce over the coming years is the total recklessness shown by the Government and the Minister for Finance, in particular, in introducing the special savings incentive accounts. The Minister totally ignored the advice of the officials in his Department who warned that this scheme would be very expensive. He deliberately understated the cost when questioned about it in the House, suggesting that it would cost approximately €127 million per year. The full potential cost of the scheme is only now becoming apparent. The Minister, in reply to a parliamentary question yesterday, admitted to my colleague, Deputy Burton, that the full cost of the scheme was now €535 million per annum. This means, over the five years of the scheme, the total cost to the Exchequer will be in the region of €2.6 billion. This is only half the story. Many participants are still entitled to increase the amount they contribute every month. If they do, the total cost will be well over €4 billion. This is very close to the entire Estimate for the Department of Social and Family Affairs for this year. I do not blame people for opening an SSIA – I have such an account. One would have been mad not to do so as one was being offered money for nothing.</p>

          <p eId="para_879">Section 4 provides for an increase in the annual respite care grant paid to recipients of carer's allowance. This will provide a modest increase for approximately 20,000 carers, less than one in six of the total figure. Those who benefit will receive €129.60 per week, even though each carer saves the State at least €400 per week. Is it any wonder that carers are angry about the Government's lack of recognition of their role in society?</p>
          <p eId="para_880">Life expectancy has increased as a result of medical advances and many more with chronic illnesses and serious disabilities need to be cared for. Family carers in the home are expected to provide the bulk of care for the chronically ill, the disabled and dependent older persons. At least 33,000 with dementia have to be cared for, with 3,500 with multiple sclerosis, 5,500 with Parkinson's disease, 20,000 adults with intellectual disabilities, at least 5,500 who use wheelchairs and between 2,500 and 3,000 who have strokes each year and need constant care as a result. The role of the carer has historically been defined by tradition, culture and religious factors incorporating ideas of self-sacrifice, duty and acceptance but such attitudes are changing. Those who want to care for their loved ones are becoming increasingly angry at the lack of recognition, services and supports they receive.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">There seems to be an erroneous perception that carers are always other people. We are all potential carers as we cannot tell when, or if, we will experience the emotional, physical or financial effects of caring for a loved one struck down by an accident, illness or the effects of old age. Only in the event of such circumstances will we recognise the effort needed to provide proper care 24 hours a day, 52 weeks a year. It might be prudent to put in place a proper community care service for old age or in case we are struck down by unexpected illness. Carer's allowance should be realistic to provide carers with the means to care effectively, not just a reallocation of social welfare money for those on low incomes, as it appears to be at present. Carers should be seen as professionals providing care in the community. Their work should be fully acknowledged and remunerated.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">The ability of carers to continue caring and cope with life when caring ceases depends on having interests other than caring. Time off is necessary to help them to develop outside interests. They need to be able to devote time to other members of the family. While respite care is important, the Government has failed to provide suitable respite care provisions that acknowledge the role of carers. It has neglected to look after the thousands of carers who do a substantial job. On the basis of the arguments I have made, there is no way my party can support the Bill.</p>

          <from>Ms McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_883">I am sure Deputies are familiar with the scene in Charles Dickens's <i>Oliver Twist</i> in which the orphan has the temerity to say, “Please, sir, I want some more”. The official response was to expel Oliver from the workhouse for daring to ask for more gruel after, in the words of Dickens, “he had eaten the supper allotted by the dietary”. One might imagine that such attitudes belong in the past but I have to ask myself if that is the case having listened to this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">The coalition has defended its record on poverty for years by referring to the concept of "consistent poverty" but I wonder if Members know what is meant by the term. It is worth being aware of how consistent poverty is defined. The test that determines whether one is said to be living in consistent poverty is based on one's answers to questions about eight key items. Can one afford new, not second-hand, clothes? Can one afford a meal with meat, chicken or fish every second day? Does one have two pairs of strong shoes? Does one have a warm, waterproof overcoat? Can one afford a roast joint of meat or its equivalent once a week? If the answer to any of these questions is "No", one is defined as living in consistent poverty. One is also asked if one had to go without a substantial meal any day in the last two weeks, if one had to go without heating in the last year due to a lack of money, or if one has experienced debt problems, or availed of charity, to meet ordinary living expenses. If one answers "Yes" to these questions, one qualifies as living in consistent poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">The questions I have listed comprise the test the Government sets itself and, as we can see, the bar is not set very high. The test does not refer to meeting transport costs, purchasing a newspaper, having a telephone or enjoying the occasional pint. Such luxuries do not count as the official test refers to more basic matters such as a warm, waterproof overcoat, two pairs of strong shoes and a meal with meat, chicken or fish every second day. Is the Government saying that is its definition of poverty? Are Deputies claiming that to be poor in a country which counts itself as one of the richest in the world one must have only one pair of shoes or no shoes at all? Are we really saying the poor are always with us but we are not always with them? Is one defined as not poor if one is wearing an overcoat? Is it right that someone who eats supper two days in a row is deemed to be exceeding "the supper allotted by the dietary"? Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats are telling the people that this is the case.</p>

          <p eId="para_889">It is a fact. The Minister cannot dispute that inequality has increased during the lifetime of the Government and its predecessor. The ESRI's research has shown that the number below relative income thresholds was often higher in 2000 than in 1997. The percentage of persons living on less than 60% of median income increased from 18% to 22% between 1997 and 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">The Government is seeking to deny the fact that it has increased the gap between the haves and have nots. It is a fact that seems to particularly upset the Taoiseach who is trying to promote a culture of contentment that does not leave room for such unpleasant matters. Despite the fact that the Government is deeply right-wing, he is not prepared to face the consequences of a right-wing ideology. He is a deeply conservative politician – his conservatism is a traditional one – and offers no vision of society. He is content to peddle the notion that progress means a few bob extra for everyone, which was not difficult to deliver during the boom, and football on the television. He is not interested in radical ideas of social change or greater equality. He has made no serious attempt to tackle the structural problems at the core of poverty and social inequality. He has done his best to ensure the rich get richer and is content that the poor have stayed at the bottom of the economic pile. He has widened the gap between the rich and poor who must wait even longer for change now that it is more difficult to find extra funds. However, the urge to spread contentment compelled him to make promises about tackling poverty which were clearly outlined in the paper submitted by the Department of Social and Family Affairs to the tax strategy group. The promises the Government made and the type of increases in social welfare required to deliver on them were listed in the paper in the finest Civil Service tradition.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">The promises made were a con trick; they were made to be broken and were. In the revised national anti-poverty strategy the Government committed to increase the lowest rate of social welfare to €200 per week in 2002 terms by 2007. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats repeated this assertion in their election manifestos and stated it again in An Agreed Programme for Government. However, they utterly failed to make any real progress towards it in the recent budget. It is bizarre that they have made the same commitment again in the new social partnership agreement. It is clear from the Bill that there is no intention of delivering this time either.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">The tax strategy group paper states that for the Government to meet its commitments under the revised national anti-poverty strategy the lowest rate of social welfare should be increased by €10 to €15 per week – the increase granted was €6. To meet its promise on pensions, an increase of €13.02 should be granted but only €10 was delivered. At election time much political mileage was made from the programme's increases in child benefit. The electorate was promised an increase of €31.59 per month but got just €8. The only record the Government has on poverty is one of broken promises.</p>

          <p eId="para_894">Once again the Government is trying to pass off the same old line. The national anti-poverty strategy promise made before the general election was dumped at the last budget. It has now been dusted off and offered once again to the community and voluntary sector like a child who wants to stay up late and promises to keep his room tidy forever more. When the community and voluntary sector understandably balked – it is important to listen to voices from the sector as it is not just the Opposition which is saying this – at this insult to its intelligence, the Taoiseach sought to browbeat it into signing up to the agreement. He has made it clear that membership will have its privileges but non-membership will be as cold a place as he can make it. No one is to be allowed to challenge the culture of contentment.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">Those on the lowest rate of social welfare will gain a mere 30 cent per week from the budget after inflation is taken into account. A one parent family will be worse off by 8% per week, even when the increase in child benefit is taken into account and on the basis of the Government's inflation target which may yet be exceeded. Despite this, Government backbenchers come to the House to defend the Bill. They must be out of touch with the reality of their constituents' lives.</p>

          <p eId="para_911">The House got the greatest dissertation ever on aircraft during discussion of the Social Welfare Bill. Deputy Durkan also referred to cheques coming in in January, February and March which is an important item of which to take note. It was one of the key reasons for the collapse of the rainbow Government, though I had not realised until this evening that the Deputy was one of the relevant Ministers. One of the key reasons for that Government's fall was the suggestion that all social welfare payments should be delayed until October of the year they were granted. The Deputy criticised cheques coming in ten months earlier than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">The Government has made one of the most costly but one of the most welcome changes in social welfare. There was criticism when Deputies or others got pay rises because they got them immediately. At the same time, measures introduced in a budget might not be paid for perhaps two or three months. However, the last budget announced by the rainbow Government extended this to the end of the year – a ten month difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">Deputies Gogarty and Ferris and others were worried about carers and what had not been done in that regard during the years. Deputy Finian McGrath made a fair point when he discussed funds being channelled in other directions. I accept that money was diverted to other channels. For many years the country suffered because money that should have gone to carers and other needy groups went on minding banks, post offices and the Establishment State. Millions of pounds of taxpayer's money which should have gone to build up the infrastructure of the State and facilities for the needy was wasted. It is now being paid for. For the past six years the Government has been playing catch up in many areas. However, the money was diverted. The country was practically wrecked, economically and otherwise, for 20 to 25 years and a price was paid. I will not take lectures from those who say money was not put into the right areas during the years. It was put not where I would have put it but where it had to be put.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">The Minister has put the greatest amount ever into social welfare. I am worried the public will not appreciate the size of the social welfare budget which now stands at approximately €10 billion. There is a tendency to take figures like this for granted. The extra money provided is needed and welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">I ask the Minister to provide a breakdown of the number of transactions undertaken by the Department. They amount to tens of millions. The Department is critically important and does a good job. In addition to the unprecedented increases in funding over the past five years, there have been big innovations in the IT area. Most Members were elected more than five years ago. At the time the biggest difficulties in the Department involved delays in providing money because of form filling and old styles of administration. That has changed and the Department is now up to date. The Minister and her predecessors are to be congratulated for this, as are the staff who are probably the hardest working in the public sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">The essence of the left of centre ideology is to spread wealth equitably. On this criterion, the record of this and the previous Fianna Fáil-led Administration makes them the most left of centre in government in the history of the State. The Bill marks another important step in the Government's aim to create a prosperous and equal Ireland for all. I am pleased to commend it to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_917">I welcome the Bill which differs from the previous five Social Welfare Bills to the extent that more money has been made available to the most vulnerable in our society, despite what has been said by Members on the other side of the House. It may be some time since the Fine Gael Party had a Minister for Social Welfare but Members of the House on the left had a Minister in recent years who, to his credit, delivered an increase of €2.95 in child benefit.</p>

          <p eId="para_921">Members on the other side of the House rightly pointed out that the general election manifesto promises would not be implemented in the first year of the Government's term of office. Every game of football takes 70 minutes and no game is won or lost in the first five. The Government's promises will be implemented and at the next general election the public will again vote for Fianna Fáil to return to government.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cregan</from>
          <p eId="para_925">Fianna Fáil was also returned to power because there was no credible alternative Government. I look forward to the next four Social Welfare Bills to be introduced by the Minister. I compliment her for securing extra funding in her negotiations with the Minister for Finance at a time when it was very difficult to increase budgets. Most of her ministerial colleagues had to accept cutbacks and reductions in spending.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">I also compliment the Minister on taking issue with the European Commission over difficulties involving post offices acting as agents for social welfare payments. To his credit, Deputy Ring promotes the importance of rural post offices. I am proud that the Minister is taking the lead on this issue. I wish her well in resolving this dispute and hope rural post offices will continue to act as agents in the delivery of social welfare payments, especially to old age pensioners and those who have no access to public transport who depend on their post offices in providing them with their payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">Much has been said about the resolution of the recent dental dispute, about which concern has been expressed on the Order of Business on a number of occasions. To her credit, the Minister has been patient in her approach to the dispute. She has succeeded in resolving it and in so doing has ensured PRSI patients will have a proper and full service. I welcome this.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">I also welcome the doubling of grants for hearing aids for vulnerable elderly persons. Thousands will benefit from the expanded medical appliances benefits scheme operated by the Department. A payment of €700 will be made in respect of one hearing aid which will double to €1,400 if a second is required. In the absence of aids those affected have a poor quality of life. In many instances these additional payments will mean that 50% of the cost of securing aids is covered.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">The social welfare improvements provided for in the Bill will amount to €530 million in a full year. In the rainbow coalition Government's last year in office and with a Minister for Social Welfare from the left the total budget was €273 million. Social welfare expenditure has doubled since. As a result of the changes made in last year's budget, all social welfare increase were, for the first time, payable from 1 January. That is very important because in previous years payments announced in the budget were deferred.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">We must rightly concentrate on old age pensioners who are the most vulnerable in our society. I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister. I am sure she will have the opportunity to introduce many more Social Welfare Bills with a view to improving the condition of the vulnerable, especially those in receipt of child benefit payments and carer's allowance.</p>

The improvements announced in the budget will cost approximately €530 million in a full year. As a result of changes announced then, all weekly increases have been payable from 1 January. The Bill provides for these improvements and a number of additional proposals approved by the Cabinet.</p>

I listened to Deputy Gogarty this afternoon making a speech in which he mentioned the number of Deputies who had agreed with him. If he believes in taking a pay cut, he should do so. There is nothing to stop him.</p>

          <from>Mr. Curran</from>
          <p eId="para_947">If that is the best contribution the Green Party can make on the Social Welfare Bill, God help it. What difference would a pay cut make? It might effect a 5 cent increase in old age pension or a 1 cent increase in children's allowance. Deputy Gogarty should not enter the House any more to make such statements. If he believes in taking a pay cut, he should act on that belief. It is a right of each Deputy to do as he or she feels. The Deputy has the opportunity to deliver. It would be hypocritical for him to say he made an offer on which Deputies did not take him up.</p>
          <p eId="para_948">The Bill provides for an increase in child benefit of €8 per month for the first and second children and €10 for the third and subsequent children. These increases bring child benefit to €125.60 for each of the first two children and €157.30 for the third and subsequent children. However, they should not be considered only in terms of this year's budget alone but in terms of the progress made on child benefit in recent years. It is worth noting that when Fianna Fáil returned to government in 1997, the rates of child benefit at the time were €38 per month for each of the first two children and €49.52 for the third and subsequent children.</p>
          <p eId="para_949">Let us examine the issue in another way. I am a father of three young children whom I had in Leinster House this morning. In 1997 an average family with three children received a little over €125 in child benefit but will receive over €408 in 2003. That is real progress and the increases far exceed the rate of inflation. When the Opposition speaks of small increases, it should look at what the Government has done over a number of years. The increases are real.</p>
          <p eId="para_950">The budget provided for an increase of €10 per week to €157 for recipients of old age contributory pension. Again, this figure needs to be viewed in its wider context. In 1997 the Government promised to increase pensions to €127 per week during its term in office. Despite comments to the contrary and other comments this afternoon, it achieved this. The 2002 election promise was that it would increase the figure to €200 per week during its term in office. I heard comments this afternoon that that would not happen but I believe it will and that we are on the road to achieving it.</p>
          <p eId="para_951">Those who say the increases this year have been smaller than in previous years should note that the increases in any given year will always be proportional to what is available to the Exchequer. The economy is not as buoyant as it was in previous years but the social welfare improvements, as negotiated by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, are more significant than those of many other Departments.</p>

We have been labelled Thatcherites by Deputy Rabbitte while Deputy Gogarty regularly distorts the policies and principles of Fianna Fáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">I joined Fianna Fáil to campaign for social justice. It has always been a populist party which represents every social sector, not just interest groups. I represent a new constituency, that of Dublin Mid-West, comprising Clondalkin, Lucan, Rathcoole, Newcastle, Saggart and Brittas. I have lived all my life in the constituency and I am well aware of the needs of those living there. I am well aware of what affects them because it affects me also. Tackling under-investment and the poor provision of services in the area continues to be my highest priority. Fianna Fáil is the only party which has seriously tackled social inequality in the area.</p>

          <p eId="para_960">I am sharing time with Deputies Healy and Joe Higgins.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">During leader's questions this morning I raised an issue that has received very little attention and involves a relatively small sum of money. It is not under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, but I refer to it again because it typifies the mean-spirited, short-sighted and piecemeal approach of the Government when it comes to social provision. I speak of the decision by the Minister for Education and Science to axe the physical education and sports grant scheme for schools. A paltry sum, a mere €2.5 million, used to be allocated to primary schools to help buy sports equipment but it has been axed. The grant amounted to €635 for ordinary schools and €1,270 for schools serving disadvantaged communities. Now primary schools are without this pittance to encourage children to become involved in sport and physical exercise which we all agree is very necessary. I wonder how many in-flight jacuzzis one might buy with €2.5 million. This is a relatively small cut in the overall context but what is the effect? Schools in more prosperous areas will hardly even notice the difference but those more disadvantaged will certainly feel it. Poorer children will lose out while those lucky enough to come from more prosperous communities will, as always, be cushioned. This typifies the Government's approach to social provision in general.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">Bad planning, the lack of proper priorities and a piecemeal approach are certainly very evident in the Social Welfare Bill. I am sorry that is the case but it has to be stated. It is a damning indictment of successive Governments, in particular the Government in office, that poverty is still so widespread after such a long period of unprecedented economic growth. Now that the economy has slowed down we are entering another era of cutbacks when, once again, the poor, the marginalised and the vulnerable are being asked to carry the burden.</p>
          <p eId="para_963">The social welfare code and the Bill are supposed to address the needs of the economically disadvantaged. As demonstrated a short time ago, Members opposite never tire of boasting of their supposed achievements. The Minister and her colleagues can recite statistics showing the succession of increases in social welfare payments over the past five years. The statistics are facts which I accept but they are not put in context, as they should be. For instance, when the Minister quotes the increases, she does not mention the increase in the cost of living, especially in the past year.</p>

          <p eId="para_969">This Government has a logical, coherent and carefully thought out strategy to deal with all matters within the remit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In the course of a long contribution last night, the Minister outlined his strategy in detail and it is not my intention to go back over that ground. The indicators by which the performance of the Minister and his Department can be judged are the strength of the Garda, the extra prison spaces, the success of the Criminal Assets Bureau, the number of drugs seizures and the changes which have made the criminal justice system more efficient. There has been an increase of almost €500 million in Garda funding since 1997. Whatever side of the House one is on, a solid level of achievement and commitment by the Government must be acknowledged. The present strategy of the Government is to build on its achievements.</p>
          <p eId="para_970">Crime is a perennial problem. If this Chamber still exists in 100 years, and I hope it does, a debate on crime will not be irrelevant. A former leader of Fine Gael, Liam Cosgrave, was once heard to observe during a budget debate that nothing was truer than the biblical maxim "the poor will always be with us". Whether you agree with that or not, it is even truer to say that crime will always be with us. Various people have argued that there is a direct correlation between crime levels and the resources provided by Government, but it is a myth. As the American and continental experiences have demonstrated, crime rates fluctuate for a variety of reasons despite the best efforts of the authorities to tackle them. That is not to say crime is not a relevant topic and it is logical for the Opposition to periodically use the Dáil to hold the Government to account with regard to its crime policies. Crime touches everybody's life–</p>

Does the Opposition feel that the resources employed in the justice area are not yielding value for money?

Instead, he made an announcement outside the House earlier in the week, an activity for which he berates the Government constantly. I forgive him for speaking outside where he might sometimes find a larger audience. The Deputy is right to assert that there is a clear link between crime and the abuse of alcohol, but he must also be aware that we have the most draconian laws on the sale of alcohol to under age persons. Even before we changed the opening hours, enforcement was the area of greatest difficulty. All Governments must take their share of responsibility for that and I am happy to do so. I recall several occasions during the last Administration when the issue of identity cards was mooted. The then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, refused to countenance the possibility and I disagreed with him. The House should acknowledge that in the three years preceding his tenure, the then incumbent, former Deputy Nora Owen, was also beguiled by the irrelevant arguments put forward with regard to the compulsory introduction of identity cards.</p>

The suggestion is new, radical and eye-catching, but the fact that it draws the attention of the media does not mean it is not off the wall. Most media commentators have concluded that. I will not waste my time discussing the Deputy's other suggestion that we combat crime by holding Cabinet meetings, or State dinners, without the dubious pleasures of wine and other drinks. We should instead rely on crackers and Complan. That suggestion is mad.</p>

There is an old song which laments rural poverty in post-Famine Ireland and, ironically, I think it comes from Deputy Deasy's part of the country. The most memorable lines are: "We'll all be ruined, says Hanrahan, before the year is out."  The modern version of that now is: "We'll all be destroyed, says Deasy, before the day is out."  I know that Fine Gael is very familiar with fables, whether they be from Aesop or Hans Christian Andersen, but obviously Deputy Deasy has not heard the fable about the little boy who cried "Wolf". He ended up as a figure of fun and nobody believed him. I would hate to see Deputy Deasy going in that direction, and I say that sincerely.</p>

Anybody with a titter of wit will know that logistically, with all the gold reserves of Fort Knox available, it is impossible to suddenly produce 2,000 gardaí in seven months. According to Deputy Enright, the main reason this motion to debate crime was put down is that the Government did not deliver the impossible in seven months, even though it had committed to take action in this area over five years, which was opposed tooth and nail by Fine Gael in the first place.</p>

          <from>Ms F. O'Malley</from>
          <p eId="para_1016">I am grateful to Deputy Deasy for raising this important issue of crime. It is an issue which causes great anxiety and concern among the public. The motion has given the Minister the opportunity to outline the strategy and measures the Government, through his Department, have undertaken. It has given Fine Gael the same opportunity to offer constructive solutions and to show how people would be better off and safer if Fine Gael was in charge and what sensible measures it might enact in response to the problem, but, sadly, Fine Gael has not seized the opportunity in this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017">Deputy Deasy's response to the problem of under-age drinking is to make it illegal for anybody under the age of 20 to take a drink. That age is long after people are legally permitted to marry, to vote or to have sex. I ask if the Deputy seriously thinks this will have an effect on under-age drinking. His further suggestion is that there should be a prohibition on the serving of alcohol at Government functions. This suggestion is utterly ridiculous and about as lightweight as the bubbles in the fizzy orange which would be served instead. These two solutions have all the hallmarks of having been dreamed up in an alcoholic phase over the weekend.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">Young people need to be taught a responsible attitude to alcohol. The gradual introduction to alcohol in a home environment monitored by parents is what 16 year olds need. They are young adults at that age and should be treated in a responsible fashion. The urge to binge drink will be curbed more successfully that way than by taking measures to exclude people who have reached the age of responsibility from drinking legally. Given the potency and ready availability of alcohol and the centrality of alcohol in Irish social life, there is a role for the education system to develop initiatives akin to the sex education and drugs awareness programmes which are conducted in schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019">I commend the sensible measures proposed by the Minister to localise licensing laws. It makes sense that licensing regulations should have regard to the local situation and that local representatives are able to determine them. It is a simple measure but it would have a tremendous local impact. Local government representatives deserve to have this responsibility.</p>

          <p eId="para_1021">Similarly, the proposed introduction of a mandatory ID card system for people under 23 years of age will assist publicans to uphold the law in regard to under age drinking. This measure is necessary as the Minister proposes to tighten regulations. Frequently, people who flout the regulations have their establishments closed for a period. Now they will have the support of the mandatory ID system and will not fall into the trap of serving people who look over age. Further measures in the criminal justice Bill will rein in errant and unruly establishments which fail to maintain order on their premises or in their vicinity. A stricter regime in regard to the renewal of pub licences will have a positive effect on the establishment and running of responsible houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">Taking crime seriously demands that support and assistance are given to enforcers of the law. New regulations are all very well but they cannot operate in isolation. They must be enforced. That is why the programme for Government has committed to providing an additional 2,000 gardaí during the lifetime of this Government. The Opposition has rounded on the failure of this year's budget to account for a start to be made in this area. We regret this but there is still time to deliver. The current strength of the force is 11,900 while the authorised strength is 12,200. The Minister stated last night that his priority is to bridge this gap. I have faith that the commitment given in the programme for Government will be honoured.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">The increase in Garda numbers along with the extensive programme for legislative change will give the criminal justice system the ability to cope. The Minister has demonstrated the political will and drive to take tough decisions in regard to crime and since assuming his brief has worked diligently at bringing forward legislation. The country will be well served by his resolve and hunger for reform in this area. Time will demonstrate that the measures this Government is introducing will have an effect in reducing crime. I commend the amendment to the House.</p>

Despite the fact that my party is in Government I have a strong role to play and can come in every day and speak on issues of concern in my constituency and country. I am not afraid to represent that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027">I represent Dublin South-West, including the major population centre of Tallaght. The experience I can bring to the House from Tallaght, Firhouse, Greenhills and Templeogue etc. helps me to deal with these issues. The Minister of State, who represents Limerick, will understand this. There is a strong relationship between Limerick and Tallaght and comparisons are often made, which is unfair. The Minister and the Minister of State know that there is crime in every major population centre. I am satisfied that crime is a serious issue for this Government which is committed to dealing with the various issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">Initiatives in Tallaght in recent times have shown a great example to the rest of the country. The Garda have introduced initiatives which have helped enormously in the fight against crime. Today, I was in Brookfield in Tallaght with the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera, for the launch of a new centre for learning and youth services. This was launched by Tallaght Youth Service under the auspices of Foróige and County Dublin VEC. I mention that because in my community gardaí have done an enormous amount of work in crime prevention and in reaching out to young people. They have been involved in the Brookfield project; in Killinarden they have energised youth with a key project; and they have worked in other initiatives in the constituency. They recognise that working with young people works towards crime prevention and is good business in regard to policing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029">I have always been a strong advocate, as someone who grew up in a Dublin where gardaí could be seen, of Garda visibility. I said to Commissioner Pat Byrne, when he was in Tallaght last Monday, that it is right that those of us who represent communities should point out that we need to see the visibility of gardaí enhanced. Tallaght has been a pilot project for the Garda mountain bike unit. I have called for that to be extended to other parts of County Dublin and to other parts of the country. The bike unit is effective and while it may be old-fashioned it gets gardaí around the community. They are extremely visible and have the opportunity to talk to young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">On Monday I was proud that The Square, which opened 12 years ago, bought and presented a horse to the Garda mounted unit. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, was present for that and there was a lot of positive publicity for the area. I am giving these examples because I believe it is important that we support the concept of gardaí working in the community to deal with the scourge of crime, drugs, under age drinking, public order offences and all those issues with which we should deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">I wish to stress to the Minister of State the importance of the provision of accommodation for gardaí. There is an issue in my area about that. More accommodation is always needed. I was told recently by the Office of Public Works, through questions in the Dáil, that it has proposals in that regard. These issues are on the agenda of all representatives no matter what area they represent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032">I commend the Government's commitment in regard to this issue. I will vote for the Government which I am happy to support. I am happy also to support the Minister who is not a member of my party. He is doing a good job with his Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, and I have great confidence in what they are doing. I am particularly confident that they are listening to what we say. Nobody should leave the House and say that Members on the Government benches are not raising their voices or concerns. We are doing that and will continue to do so. I hope we will have progress on a number of the issues that need attention. It is vital and healthy that we have these discussions and that we demand action on issues of concern to all of us.</p>

          <p eId="para_1035">Most Ministers and Deputies in this House do not live in the communities that are worst affected by crime. I live in one of the worst hit areas of Dublin. My constituency has one of the highest rates of murder and is one of the worst areas in Europe for drugs and drug-related offences. In spite of this, one Garda station in the heart of Ballyfermot has been downgraded – it is now a sub-station of Clondalkin – and there are plans afoot to close one of the Garda stations in Crumlin at a time when it has such a high crime problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036">This debate does not address the reasons for crime in my area and other areas of this city and country. The Garda Commissioner's report in recent years has stated that 75% of crime is drug-related. If we are to take him at his word we should be focusing on this area, yet this is not the case, either in the motion before us or the self-congratulatory amendment from the Government. What is needed is a comprehensive approach to tackle the causes of crime as well as the crimes themselves. We must look at the reason for the huge epidemic of drugs, especially within urban areas. By tackling the underlying factors for this we will be addressing 75% of crime in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037">There is also a big problem with the crime figures with which we are presented. I believe they have been manipulated as a cynical vote-grabbing exercise. The Garda has had problems with PULSE. Non-indictable and indictable crimes have been replaced with headline offences. In the past there has been under-reporting by both victims and the Garda. Many more crimes are now being recorded in the statistics. Different elements of legislation have also been coming on-stream. We need to give the PULSE system a year or two to settle down so that we can compare like with like. For these reasons, the National Crime Council has said that: "Care is needed when interpreting fluctuations in crime rates, which are often more plausibly explained by changes in recording practice than by real shifts in criminal behaviour."</p>
          <p eId="para_1038">If we look properly at the data, with very few exceptions the crime rate has fallen since 1983. Recorded crime committed by juveniles has fallen since the 1960s and at present only accounts for about 15% of the total. Crimes against property make up the vast majority of indictable crimes, a full 98%, while violent crime, on which most Members seemed to focus, accounts for only a very small percentage. We are presented with a distorted picture.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">I will not try to minimise the painful personal experiences that lie behind these figures because I have met the victims of crime too often. Last weekend in my constituency a taxi driver was hijacked. Recently two gardaí were assaulted by a gang in the same area and a bus driver was shot at. These are just some of the victims of crimes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040">I am not convinced that existing Garda resources are properly used. In the Dublin south-central division there are 14 gardaí in the drug squad while 23 are assigned to traffic duty. This says much about the priorities of the Garda, the Government and the previous Administration which have allowed the situation to escalate in disadvantaged areas.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TonyGregory" eId="spk_634">
          <from>Mr. Gregory</from>
          <p eId="para_1041">I support the motion before the House because there is no doubt in my mind that we have an increasingly serious crime problem. It seems that neither the Government nor the senior levels of the Garda have an effective strategy to deal with the problem. It is a bit over the top for the Government, in its amendment to the motion, to commend itself on continuing to tackle effectively all aspects of crime, given what we all know what is happening week in and week out.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042">If we take, for example, the ever-expanding drug problem we must accept that the source and root cause of the heroin crisis lies in the inequalities of our society that has resulted in so much social deprivation and disadvantage. In spite of this, the budgetary policy of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government has not resulted in a fairer or more equal society. The CORI justice commission stated in its budget analysis:</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">The Government has dramatically failed to address the substantial poverty and social exclusion which still persists in Ireland today. It has widened the gap between the rich and the poor, a gap which is the worst in the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">In this context, no effort on the part of the local drugs task forces, no matter how well-meaning they may be, can begin to significantly impact on the heroin crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">We now have the additional problem of literally a flood of cocaine which is intensifying the drugs problem and enriching the criminal gangs which traffic these drugs. Hardly a week goes by without a murder or attempted murder related to gangland feuding or drug wars associated with control of territory. Neither the Government nor the Garda appears to have any effective response to this rise in organised crime and, indeed, many of the murders almost inevitably go undetected.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046">There was understandable rage when a prominent journalist was murdered some years ago, but more recently when a security man who had refused to be bought or intimidated by drug gangs was murdered outside his home, I did not detect the same level of outrage. There was almost an acceptance that this sort of thing happens now. I am not sure if anyone has yet been charged with that crime but I have no doubt that the gang involved is well known.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047">While I do not believe that the response to such crimes need necessarily be a cause for increased Garda numbers, or an expansion in Garda powers, there is certainly a need for more effective use of existing resources, better Garda management and new strategies on the part of Government. There seems to me to be no evidence whatsoever that the Government, particularly the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has the remotest idea as to how to respond to the serious crime problems, some of which are spelled out in the motion before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048">I previously raised with the Minister the important matter of the Criminal Assets Bureau. This was set up in response to the murder of Veronica Guerin. While the CAB has the necessary powers to go after all criminal assets it was set up specifically to target drug-related organised crime. It very quickly lost that focus and went off in other directions ranging from planning corruption to the Real IRA and various high-profile individuals, which is all very well provided the original priority has not been forgotten.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049">The continued increase in the number of drug crime gangs requires a refocusing on their priorities by the Criminal Assets Bureau and the specialist units of the Garda Síochána. There is a strong case for localising and regionalising the Criminal Assets Bureau. This suggestion has been put forward by the inter-agency sub-committee of the inner city drugs task force but so far it has fallen on deaf ears.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">It is also necessary to draw attention to what may be an attempt to establish the first base for the introduction of crack cocaine into the country. The select committee of which I am a member met yesterday with our counterparts from Westminster. Having listened to their account of the spread of crack cocaine in Britain it seems that we are totally unprepared for its emergence here. I trust that the Minister and the Garda Commissioner see the need for some task force to examine what needs to be done. There may be need for collaboration with the more experienced British police, particularly as non-nationals are involved. Whatever resources are necessary should be made available to confront the problem which many local people believe to be in the Parnell Street area, just yards from O'Connell Street in the epicentre of the north inner city.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MildredFox" eId="spk_635">
          <from>Ms Fox</from>
          <p eId="para_1051">I welcome the opportunity to say a few words about the serious deterioration of law and order on our streets. Every weekend, without fail, we hear a news report of someone somewhere in the country having been murdered or seriously assaulted. We are becoming very used to stories of unprovoked attacks on young people on our streets. It is a sad illustration of how things have changed in the past generation or so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not responsible for the complete breakdown in law and order and the lack of regard for human life but he is responsible for ensuring that adequate Garda numbers are put on our streets and that these gardaí are physically and legally equipped to deal with the reality of violence on our streets. In the programme for Government, 2,000 extra gardaí were promised and I am looking forward to seeing this number reached. However, in certain areas of my constituency Garda numbers and facilities have gone backwards instead of forwards in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053">Wicklow has seen a large increase in population in the past few years, mainly due to our proximity to Dublin. A number of local development plans have recently been passed by Wicklow County Council, particularly for areas such as Kilcoole, Newtown, Dunlavin and Enniskerry in the north of the county. Despite this fact Garda resources in these areas have not reflected the increase in population. Where gardaí have retired in these areas they have not been replaced. The opening times of Garda stations in these areas have been reduced to two hours per day and Garda activity is reduced to signing passport forms and other forms.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054">Instances of criminal damage are not included in crime figures. A crime against a person's property, such as burning out a car, is not considered a crime for statistical purposes. Crime is, therefore, under-reported.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055">The decision to close and sell Shangannah Castle is short-sighted. The arguments presented by the Minister in relation to its closure were that it was becoming increasingly difficult to identify young male offenders suitable for open prison accommodation. That is the case but surely the property could be used for other areas of the Prison Service. There are 24 acres attached to Shangannagh Castle and the opportunity is there to develop a more appropriate form of prison.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056">There should be greater liaison between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Health and Children regarding young adults who commit relatively minor offences. A number of young adults have committed crimes, such as minor criminal damage, due to what are termed behavioural problems and borderline mental health problems. There is no method of punishment for these minor crimes and nowhere for such offenders to go – many aggressive young adults are left with their families who must deal with them without help from the State. They fall between the stools of prison and mental health institutions, neither of which is appropriate for them. Mental health institutions will not take them because they have not been diagnosed with a serious illness and prison services are inappropriate for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1057">I am aware of a couple of cases where parents were forced to take out barring orders against their own children to safeguard other members of their families in the hope the young offender would go before a judge who would force the State to look after him. That is not an easy thing for any family to do, but these are people who are under extraordinary pressure and they have no one to turn to. I ask the Minister to look at Shangannagh with a view to developing an appropriate service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058">I pay tribute to the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, who allocated funding to build a new Garda station in Bray. This was long overdue and much needed. He also announced that Bray was to get CCTV cameras. I have no doubt these will make a difference but, as of yet, they have not been installed and there is no sign of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059">Wicklow, again due to its proximity to Dublin, has the task of cleaning up burned out stolen cars practically every weekend. I ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to give serious consideration to the introduction of mandatory sentencing. There should be mandatory sentencing for certain crimes, such as child pornography, rather than leaving it to the humour of the judge on the day. I hope the Minister will give serious consideration to my comments.</p>

        <speech by="#CiaranCuffeGP" eId="spk_636">
          <from>Mr. Cuffe</from>
          <p eId="para_1060">I compliment Fine Gael on using its Private Members' time for this debate. At the heart of this matter is the serious issues of the lack of additional recruitment to the Garda Síochána but, much more than that, we need to see reforms of the force itself. We need to drag the Garda kicking and screaming into the 21st century with regard to the way the gardaí go about their business and interact with the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061">The system of crime reporting is antiquated. It was antiquated in the late 20th century and it is certainly not acceptable in the 21st century. In my daily work I use post, faxes, e-mails and texting to communicate, but none of these methods is acceptable for the purposes of reporting crime to the gardaí. You simply have to turn up at the Garda station itself. This is not acceptable and gives rise to significant under-reporting, particularly of minor crimes. We need updating in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062">It is almost a year since there was Garda recruitment. As the Garda website points out, it is not possible to state when the next recruitment competition will be held. That will not bring about any great increase in the number of gardaí.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063">We must also look at the people the Garda Síochána is recruiting. There should be a system of advanced entry in the Garda. People should come in at a rank other than entrance level. We should be attracting people with degrees and other work experience and police from other forces throughout the world. People should not be obliged to come into the Garda Síochána at entrance level and I am not sure the ability to speak Irish is at the forefront of the ability to tackle crime. Some improvements are needed here.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064">Disadvantaged areas need significant resources to combat gang related violence. This was promised through RAPID funding but we have yet to see much of this being delivered. Disadvantaged areas which do not receive such funding become hotbeds of crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">The Fine Gael proposal to ban young people from drinking until they are 20 years old is ludicrous. I know there is a right wing tendency in Fine Gael but this proposal makes Genghis Khan look like a liberal. I believe Fine Gael will fall on its sword because of this issue. One should not stigmatise young people or take away their rights. Most of all, one should not insult their intelligence by criminalising their behaviour and trying to introduce prohibition. Raising the drinking age will not reduce consumption. It did not work in the United States between 1920 and 1933. It was ineffective because it was unenforceable but it also caused an explosive growth of crime in the United States and increased the amount of alcohol consumed. It is demeaning and insulting to young people to try to prohibit them from consuming alcohol until they are 20 or 21.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">Instead, we should tackle the cartel which controls the licensed trade, which invented the super-pub and which spews out thousands of drunks onto our streets every night. This cartel produces drinking halls that have no more atmosphere than an airport departure lounge. Hundreds of small local pubs where the barmen could keep an eye on the customers have had their insides ripped out and have doubled or quadrupled in size in the past few years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067">These changes are ripping the hearts out of our towns, cities and communities. The old style pub meant that the owner or publican could keep on eye on what the drinkers were doing. That sense of control by the publican has disappeared with the advent of the super pub.</p>
          <p eId="para_1068">We must reform our antiquated licensing laws. We have to update and consolidate the law. The issues of fire safety, planning enforcement and liquor licensing need to be brought together. The only way in which one can object to a licence is when it comes up for renewal at the September licensing court. That is not sufficient.</p>

That is not good enough. Guinness or Diageo labels should not be emblazoned over a football stadium. The advertising of alcohol should be banned. Alcohol should carry a health warning commensurate with the percentage of alcohol in drinks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071">We need to provide alternatives for young people. There are advertising promotions in Blackrock where one can drink all one wishes while the baths in Blackrock lie derelict and under used, as they do in Dún Laoghaire? We need to break up the cartel that controls the licensing industry and to bring the Garda into the 21st century. We should ban alcohol advertising and invest in resources for young people.</p>

When one sits beside Fianna Fáil things start to happen, and the Minister learned fast. I have here a four page list of Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil Members appointed to boards, including State boards. It did not take long for the Progressive Democrats to become corrupted by Fianna Fáil. I listened to the Minister on radio tell us that his son was attacked and he did not even bother to report it to the Garda Síochána. What does that say about the commissioner and the Garda? Is he saying he is not confident the Garda would be able to resolve the crime?</p>
          <p eId="para_1077">That is an outrageous statement for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make. He goes on radio and tells us about the tribunals and the money they are costing. This shows how much of a hypocrite he is. This is the same man who was in government for five years as Attorney General. One would think he had nothing to do with law and order for the past 20 years. He was Attorney General for five years and he sat down with his friends in the law courts and negotiated prices. He looked after his friends. The Progressive Democrats are learning fast and they are being corrupted every single day they are in government with Fianna Fáil.</p>

When the former Deputy Nora Owen was on that side of the House, I used to think the then Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, would have a stroke, he was so upset about law and order. He then told us we would have zero tolerance.</p>

          <from>Mr. G. Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_1113">I thank Deputy Deasy for tabling this motion. It is timely that he and my Fine Gael colleagues should raise this issue. How many Bills dealing with crime has this House passed since 1990? It seems that every time there is a major mishap the Government comes up with a proposal to introduce legislation. It is my contention that what we have is all law and no order. That is essentially the difficulty that has perpetuated the problem of crime. One law after another is one thing, but draconian law is another. We have passed some strict and far-reaching laws in this House. The Minister's latest response to the present situation is to introduce more legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1114">The Minister says he will introduce legislation shortly requiring people between the age of 18 and 25, or 23, he does not quite know, to carry identity cards. Do we need more legislation? It might be a good idea as part of a whole package, but to respond by saying he will solve the problem by way of legislation is wrong. That has been the solution of the Government almost every year since it first came to office in 1987.</p>
          <p eId="para_1115">We do not need so much law, we need more order. Where does good order begin? It begins with accountability. I am genuinely worried about lack of policing accountability. Before we begin to get reactionary comments from Garda Síochána magazines and Garda management, can we stand back a little and consider the whole question of Garda accountability. In Northern Ireland there is not just a policing authority but an ombudsman who is capable of inquiring into policing matters and drawing up independent reports. We do not have that facility. Unlike the adjoining jurisdiction of Britain, we do not have regional police forces, we have a national police force. I know there are reactionaries in the Garda Síochána who will paint this as an attack on gardaí, but I am not attacking anyone, I am raising genuine questions. If they are not raised, sooner or later it will reflect on the Garda.</p>
          <p eId="para_1116">People are already whispering. They are whispering about Donegal and the over-reaction of gardaí in arresting a young man during the run-up to a presidential election. If he had something to answer, he could have done so 48 hours later. However, the gardaí allowed themselves to be involved in a political act by arresting a man two days prior to a presidential election, a man the DPP said had no case to answer. Even if he had a case to answer, why was he arrested at that time?</p>
          <p eId="para_1117">People are asking about the purchase of tyres. There are many unacceptable and worrying aspects of the Garda Síochána. We need to reach a stage where there is accountability. There does not need to be interference with the management or day-to-day running of the Garda Síochána, but we need accountability. We need ministerial and judicial accountability, to which I will return later.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118">The Minister of State said he was gobsmacked. Welcome to the club, because most young people in this city are fearful of going out day or night and being gobsmacked or head-butted by thugs. The answer of the Government has been to extend drinking hours, at whose behest I do not know. Violence has increased so much as a result of the extended drinking hours that there is hardly a pub in the city centre that does not have a bouncer on the door. Extending the drinking hours has allowed people to exorcise their violence after a bout of drink. People are terrified. Young people cannot be sent to the corner shop in some areas. Old people are barricading themselves in their homes. We do not need more law, we need order and accountability. When the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has the guts to bring about a situation where there will be accountability, not just for the laws we pass and the powers we confer, but the money we entrust for the provision of law and order, we will have made greater strides.</p>
          <p eId="para_1119">I am very concerned about the Dr. Salazar type approach of the Minister, including his personal abuse during the debate last night because people dared to raise the question of law and order. He was meandering about immigrants and blaming everyone and anyone. He is the Minister. He has the chauffeur-driven car. He has the pension. He has been paid a salary for the past six years so why does he not do his job, which is what we expect of him? We do not expect him to come in here and give lip to members of the Opposition who are doing their job, with no resources, by raising questions in a reasonable manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120">Some 75% of prisoners in Mountjoy jail come from five identifiable areas of Dublin. I will take the Minister seriously when he attends to, and gets his colleagues to attend to, the underlying problems that give rise to drug-related problems in parts of this city.</p>

        <speech by="#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" eId="spk_680">
          <from>Mr. Timmins</from>
          <p eId="para_1121">I deeply regret that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not present. Last night he took a pot shot at the Opposition and then scurried off. I regret also that the Groucho Marx of Fianna Fáil has also departed the scene. He gave us a running commentary on what people said last night, which was a waste of time, because we can go upstairs and read the "blacks".</p>
          <p eId="para_1122">The Government has said it did not get proposals from us. I will give it a few simple proposals. How can we deal with crime if we do not know what it is. The Minister referred in his speech last night to the statistics for 2001. Correct me if I am wrong, but this is 2003. On 2 January I went into my local grocery store in Baltinglass, County Wicklow, and the proprietor was able to show me his returns on the computer for 2002. Here we are in February, approaching March, 2003 and we do not have the statistics for 2002. How can we deal with a problem if we do not know what it is?</p>
          <p eId="para_1123">We must have a means of measuring the problem. We can get the crime statistics on a weekly basis. Deputy Crawford can tell the House that the BSE statistics are published each Friday. I will tell the Minister what he can do. We want to see the crime statistics each week and we want them published by St. Patrick's weekend. There is the PULSE system but, if you ask me, this is a Department without a pulse.</p>
          <p eId="para_1124">A young guy who went to an ATM pass machine in recent weeks to withdraw money had his throat cut. I want to see mandatory prison sentences for the carrying of a knife in a public place for an unlawful reason. In most cases a young person who carries a knife in his pocket at night intends using it. The Minister can introduce a concrete measure to deal with this problem and not bamboozle us with the 40 Bills to which Deputy Mitchell referred.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125">On under-age drinking, Deputy Deasy proposed raising the age from 18 to 20. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was happy to borrow the concept of local authorities policing various drink regulations from the USA, but he was not willing to borrow the concept of raising the age to 21. This radical Minister said people are laughing up their sleeve at this proposal. He did not even consider it. I have a little bit of news for him. He should have asked Deputy Deasy what was behind this proposal. The radical Minister said we will laugh up our sleeve and we will drink wine at Government functions. There is growing evidence to suggest that alcohol use prior to age 21 impairs crucial aspects of youthful brain development. In a recent study, heavy drinking adolescents scored ten percentage points lower than non-drinking peers in tests requiring verbal and non-verbal recall and skills needed for map reading, geometry and science. I will send the statistics to the Minister's Department. He would be better off doing research into this aspect rather than laughing down his sleeve at people.</p>

        <speech by="#LizMcManus" eId="spk_681">
          <from>Ms McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_1126">I thank Fine Gael, particularly Deputy Timmins, for allowing me this time. It is true that crime is now central to communities which are concerned about the increase in street violence, drug abuse, drink abuse, attacks on women and anti-social behaviour. These are issues which frighten people. Women in particular are frightened by the fact that they no longer feel safe.</p>
          <p eId="para_1127">It is important to consider what is happening in our society. Two young Australian women travelled through 34 countries and the only country in which they were attacked was Ireland. A little girl who was abducted and killed was mentioned today in court. People look to Government to protect them from this type of criminal activity. When the Minister took office, many people expected that he would introduce radical reform because he had a reputation for taking on corruption. This expectation is now quickly turning to dust. What is the record? The record indicates that instead of standing up to vested interests, he caved in to them by giving the tribunal lawyers a nice fat cheque. Instead of tackling crime, he closed down Shanganagh Castle, a prison which could be a good quality rehabilitation centre. The current revolving door syndrome persists.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128">More significantly, the Minister failed to recruit extra gardaí. What he has succeeded in doing is giving us his opinions. He is certainly the master of the digestible soundbite, but unfortunately he is not a master of his trade, which is to ensure the streets are safe and that people feel secure. We know a hell of a lot about the Minister's view on cocoa and Horlicks or on Communists, but we do not know anything about his views on criminality. That is what was most disturbing about the Minister's attitude yesterday. He did not spell out clearly and thoughtfully what he will do to resolve the serious crime problems which are genuinely affecting people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129">For example, the Minister needs to look at what is happening to young girls who take a taxi home late at night. The record of the Progressive Democrats is that it deregulated the taxi industry but it did not take on board any of the issues people had in relation to safety.</p>

That does not take from the reality of the crime problem which all of us, as Deputies, encounter in our work. It is a matter of some disappointment that, faced with such a comprehensive and considered Government policy, Opposition speakers have had to resort at times to what amounted to superficial abuse of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_1135">Dr. Salazar was a very shy man and if Deputy Mitchell was aware of the facts, he would be aware that no one could be more unlike the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform than Dr. Salazar.</p>
          <p eId="para_1136">Let me again point out what has been and is being done so that future debates on this issue are constructive and informed. We have recognised the need for more gardaí. The current strength of the Garda Síochána is at an all time high. Garda recruitment and training has been prioritised to bring the force up to the authorised strength of 12,200 as soon as possible. These extra gardaí will be targeted towards areas of greatest need. A new Garda Powers Bill will be introduced giving substantial additional powers to the Garda in investigating serious crime. The new public order legislation at present before the Oireachtas will improve the powers of the Garda to deal with public order offences. The gardaí will continue to target the menace of organised crime, particularly by means of the Criminal Assets Bureau.</p>
          <p eId="para_1137">Under this Government the administration of the courts has been streamlined by the establishment of the independent Courts Service. A working group set up by the service is undertaking a root and branch look at how the courts are organised. Criminal law will be the first module of its work. The position in the prisons has been transformed since 1997. In the past, a persistent high level of overcrowding resulted in the granting of release in an unstructured manner to many offenders at an early stage in their sentences. The construction of over 1,200 new prison spaces in recent years has ended that situation. The revolving door syndrome is now a matter of past history. Six years ago, a total of 19% of the prison population was on temporary release. In 2002, that proportion was reduced to 6%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1138">The Government will continue to target youth crime by supporting and developing evidence based preventative measures and interventions aimed at young offenders and those most at risk of offending by implementing the outstanding relevant provisions of the Children Act 2001. The Government is also committed to continuing to support and strengthen the network of Garda youth diversion projects which increased in number from 12 in 1997 to 64 currently.</p>
          <p eId="para_1139">Deputy McManus referred to the current climate of fear many citizens experience, particularly female citizens. I accept that the problems caused by excessive drinking require a response involving the active participation of parents, educators, health providers, purveyors of alcohol and, only as a last resort, the Garda Síochána and the courts. In the absence of this broad social approach, the task of addressing social disorder of this nature will be difficult, despite the best efforts of those working in the criminal justice system. The Government's response has taken account of these wide net contributors and will continue to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1140">The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, established a strategic task force on alcohol to provide advice to Government and public bodies on measures to prevent and reduce alcohol related harm. The task force produced an interim report in May last year which I would recommend to Members of this House. With the agreement of the Government, the Minister is establishing an interdepartmental group to progress the recommendations of the task force and co-ordinate responses to the recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1141">Alcohol awareness campaigns are being run by the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science which are specifically targeted at under-age drinkers. Education concerning alcohol and drug misuse and abuse is addressed in primary and post-primary schools. Specific measures have been put in place to ensure that all schools in the local drugs task force areas, at both primary and post-primary levels, implement substance misuse education and prevention.</p>
          <p eId="para_1142">There should be no doubt of the progress made to date in the area of crime and of our continued commitment to maintaining and improving our criminal justice system throughout the lifetime of this Government.</p>

I would like to take the Minister back to a few words he “scripsied” in the <i>Sunday Independent,</i> not 2,000 years ago, but on 20 December 1998, when our learned friend launched a scathing attack on the Prison Service. He told us that prison officers “were holding the State to ransom”. He said “the extent to which the system is out of control is so bad that the public cannot be let in on the secret.”  He wrote “the Governors refer to a Golden Goose culture in relation to overtime” which has spiralled out of control from €21 million in 1994 to €38 million in 1998, almost enough for the new Government jet, that is, the one without the jacuzzi. The Minister called the situation “a huge scandal”. I agree with him, it is an outrage. However, in fairness to him, he had the solution. He was certain that “only political determination will bring it to an end.”</p>
          <p eId="para_1147">The Minister went on to say "A Prisons Bill could be drafted and enacted by Christmas. The overtime scam could be over by Easter. The sick-leave scam could be over by the Summer. If anyone with determination said so."  The Minister has had his chance but I have news for him. He said the situation was so bad in 1998 that the people could not be let in on the secret and that only political determination would end it. He is now Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the politician with the determination, the head honcho, the head buck cat, the man for the job.</p>
          <p eId="para_1148">Let us let the people in on another little secret. In the Minister's tenure, the overtime bill is no longer €38 million but €60 million, the cost of the Government jet with change. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, "the determinator", is letting the golden goose take the people for a turkey. Instead of swirling his quill, I suggest he put his boot into crime. There is plenty to do as we discovered when the Government eventually released the crime figures it deliberately suppressed before the election last May.</p>
          <p eId="para_1149">In 2001, there were 86,000 headline offences, up 18%; 2,500 assaults causing harm, up almost 40%; and sexual offences were up by 90%. The number of teenagers drunk in public was up 370%. There was also an increase in gangland-related violence and murder, the likes of which one would normally associate with an episode of "COPS".</p>
          <p eId="para_1150">The Minister is in breach of his ministerial duty under the Constitution, as Deputy Deasy and Deputy Ring pointed out, if not by the letter, then surely by the spirit. What else can one call it when the man constitutionally charged with upholding the law and keeping order takes to the national airwaves to tell us that he did not bother to report a crime against his own family because, after all, what would be the point? In another country, he would be fired for that remark. I will outline the point to the Minister. It is a young Dubliner having his throat slashed while taking money out of a PASS machine after leaving his 1999 Ford Focus; or Alan Higgins, beaten to death on a pathway near his home for teenage kicks and a mobile phone; or Garda Tony Tighe and Garda Michael Padden setting out on a Sunday night from Donnybrook station never to return from a call out to the Stillorgan Road; or Daniel, a football mad four year old who waits every day for his father, Robert McGowan, to come from his work as a taxi driver; and five year old Aaron Fitzgerald in Limerick who, to say "Good night" to his Dad, Brian, hopes for a clear sky because a drug-fuelled gang war turned his father into the night's brightest star.</p>
          <p eId="para_1151">The coalition governs by statistic, conceals by statistic, spins by statistic and steals by statistic. These statistics are a gross and true insult to the families I have mentioned and all those associated with them. The Administration – it can hardly be called a Government – has sold out this society. To this Administration votes cost, votes pay, but life is cheap. As we approach the end game when it comes to crime, what will be the preferred course of action of the absent Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform? Will he stand and deliver on his own promises, get tough on crime and recruit 2,000 more gardaí or will he adopt his preferred revisionist stance where he will rewrite history with the help of the communications unit, those Rumpelstiltskins of political spin who can turn straw into pure gold?</p>
          <p eId="para_1152">In 28 years in the House, I have never seen a Government so smug, so arrogant and so entirely without moral fibre. The nation is repulsed by its arrogance and behaviour. No funding whatsoever has been allocated this year to recruit the promised 2,000 gardaí. However, the photograph of the latest Garda recruit, Ferdia the horse, on the front page of <i>The Irish Times</i> earlier this week was a bit of a shocker. One would wonder whether all the Government could afford was to buy the hooves. Why can the Government not put gardaí on the street? Why can they not be where the people want and need them? Why has the Minister not provided for this need? How does he intend to fulfil his promise on page 24 of the programme for Government? He stated, “We stand for a society where all people can feel safe in their communities, businesses and homes.”  So much for that promise.</p>
          <p eId="para_1153">Why have the Minister and the Government not banned all advertising of alcohol? Alcohol abuse is costing more than €2 billion per year. One in four children aged between 12 and 14 is a regular or current drinker. The Minister has done nothing, zilch. Why is the law not enforced? There is plenty of law but not enough order. A total of 1,200 public order offences are committed weekly, the vast majority of which are alcohol-related. The Government's only contribution was to extend pub opening hours. Why have mandatory sentences not been introduced for the crimes we hear about day in, day out and which we are starting to live in real fear of, such as assault causing harm, car hijacking, street violence, joyriding and dangerous driving? For example, the current maximum sentence for assault causing harm is 12 months in the District Court and five years in the Circuit Court. Surely, a minimum mandatory sentence should apply such as six months in the District Court and two years in the Circuit Court. This relates to the little matter of crime and punishment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1154">What is the Minister's grudge against the victims of crime? Where are the strong statutory protections for these people? Where are their two most basic rights – to be kept informed of the progress of the investigation and to submit an impact statement to the court before sentencing? I ask the triumvirate of the absent Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform why there is political paralysis. Where is the famous determination? It is time for the Minister to come clean. I recall his own words, "Be radical or be redundant."  Which is he?</p>

          <from>Mr. Deasy</from>
          <p eId="para_1160">It is pretty bad when the Minister is not present. It is an insult to the victims of crime and there are many of them. We were told last night that this was an ill-thought out motion. All we did was cite the statistics and outline the position as it stands. Any reasonable person would expect that we would question how bad crime levels have become. I have come to the conclusion that the Government and, in particular, the Minister do not like to be questioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1161">The Minister's speech during this debate was incredibly arrogant. He said gardaí will be given the resources to investigate crime but nobody believes that anymore. He stated, "I want to assure the House that budgetary policy aimed at improving efficiency will not lead to any curtailment of the Garda Síochána's ability to tackle crime."  He is saying the massive cuts in overtime will not affect crime rates. How can he possibly assure the House that when he cuts overtime it will not have an effect on the crime rates?</p>
          <p eId="para_1162">With regard to alcohol-related crime, he stated, "I have already outlined some proposals that might be worthy of examination."  For what is he waiting? When he heard of our proposals, the first thing he did was go on radio and throw out the idea of compulsory ID cards but when he was asked about it, he could not explain it. The Minister was struck by a story told by Deputy Hayes about a drunk 16 year old into whom he bumped in a pub. He was taken aback by the horror of it all. The Department of Health and Children's figures show that one third of 16 year olds are binge drinkers. Does the Minister not know that? This is incredible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1163">He further stated, "Our legislative package for tackling organised crime is undoubtedly one of the toughest in Europe."  That is self-praise indeed. There is not even an organised crime unit. I take it the Government decides that its policy is brilliant. The Minister then stated, "We want to ensure those convicted of crime will serve the sentences imposed on them by courts."  Does that mean mandatory sentencing, given that the Minister has been talking about it for five or six months? Where is the legislation? Everybody knows not many people serve their full sentences. This is fanciful, crazy talk.</p>
          <p eId="para_1164">The Minister then provided some rhetoric when he stated, "There will be no hiding place for those who seek to inflict misery on the community."  Is that the Government's zero tolerance policy? Where are the murderers of Raonaid Murray and Brian Fitzgerald hiding? There are plenty of murderers walking around. It is a bloody joke and all the Minister does is yak, yak, yak. He continued, "The current Government policies are successful in dealing with the threat posed by organised criminal gangs."  The incidents in Limerick must have been a figment of our imagination. This was an incredible speech given by an arrogant man. The absolute master stroke in his contribution was the proposal to give county councils the right to determine pub closing hours. This is like something that would be proposed by a fellow who had never passed the Red Cow Inn. That is how out of touch was his contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1165">The last thing the country needs is a person holding the office of Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform whose ego supersedes all common sense. He made a clever speech last night but if the Government thinks that my party's proposals are too radical or fanciful, it should explain what it has done to the increasing number of crime victims. It has not done a great deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1166">The Government will have the right to belittle my party's policies when young people are no longer knifed and beaten to death on the streets of Ireland. So far, the Government has not done that. I have stuck to policy since I took office. When I question ministerial policy, I am seen to be questioning the person. I have come to the conclusion that the Minister cannot take criticism, and that is extremely dangerous. The nub of this is that the Minister talks a good game but for society's sake he had better start listening a little more.</p>

          <p eId="para_1175">I am disappointed that the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, is not in the House to give a clear answer on this issue. He seems to have given a number of answers over recent days and there is still a lot of confusion, disappointment, anger and frustration in Cork because of the uncertainty surrounding this public private partnership deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1176">The decision to provide a new school of music through a public private partnership deal was taken in June 1999. It was announced for the first of a number of times by the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, in October 1999. The Department appointed a public private partnership bidding committee in June 2000 and, in October 2000, a short-list was drawn up.</p>
          <p eId="para_1177">On 2 February 2001, the successful bidder was appointed following consultation with the Department of Finance which has been involved all along, not just at the last minute. The project was initially to be finished by September 2003 but because of delays in the planning process that was pushed back until the end of 2004. Jarvis Projects Limited was the company chosen to proceed with the project and, in good faith, that company embarked on full design and development negotiations and legal negotiations, went through a full planning process and has spent nearly €8 million on its application for tender and on the legal and development negotiations to date. The company has now been told that the Government is shelving the project.</p>
          <p eId="para_1178">Close to 1,000 people came to the Opera House in Cork last Friday to protest at the lack of a Government decision on this, and their anger was palpable. The staff and pupils of the Cork School of Music vacated their existing building in September 2001, some 16 months ago, in anticipation of the building of the new school. They were happy to do that because they believed Deputy Martin and other Fianna Fáil Ministers when they said this project would proceed. People are now in shock. They cannot go back to the old Cork School of Music building because it is no longer in a position to be used properly. This means that they are in temporary accommodation, including Moore's hotel and rooms rented for music practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1179">What does this say about public private partnerships? They are in tatters. How can we expect a company such as Jarvis Projects Limited to come on board for another project when it has spent €8 million in good faith only to be let down by this Government? The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, blames EUROSTAT for the decision not to proceed, which is nonsense. The process has gone so far that it is not believable that a company would be allowed to spend €8 million before problems with EUROSTAT were anticipated. It is nonsense and EUROSTAT is being blamed for a decision made by Fianna Fáil.</p>

          <p eId="para_1180">This is a scandal and a mess, and somebody must answer for it. The State could lose up to €12 million if this project does not go ahead as it is costing €150,000 per month in inflation. Cork is to be the European city of culture in 2005 but will be the laughing stock of Europe if this project does not proceed. It was supposed to be the jewel in the city's crown. The students and teachers of the school, and the people of Cork, have been hugely discommoded and somebody must answer for this. Somebody should resign unless this project gets the go-ahead very soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_1181">We want answers from the Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, and the Minister for Finance should also be in the House. The Department of Finance has refused to engage with Jarvis in recent months on this issue. The Taoiseach should also be involved. It is a scandal. The Minister of State must take this matter to his Government colleagues. It is a big issue. We will be the laughing stock of Europe and public private partnerships will have no merit if this project does not go ahead. No company will come near this country for PPP projects if it does not. I want answers and will raise this matter with the Minister tomorrow during Question Time, if allowed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1182">The Government does not realise how big an issue and scandal this is, not only for Cork but for the country. I hope the Minister of State has good news and that we do not hear of some obscure EU directive that has magically appeared. Somebody must be accountable for this and I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say.</p>

          <p eId="para_1183">As the Deputies are aware, the new Cork School of Music, a constituent part of Cork Institute of Technology, is being procured under the public private partnership model. The Cork School of Music provides training in a wide range of musical instruments, musical theory and speech and drama. The school caters for first to fourth level students, be they amateur musicians, music teachers or performers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1184">The tender for this project was advertised on a European-wide basis in June 2000. Following the project launch in July 2000, 12 consortia expressed interest in bidding for it. Following the presentation of outline proposals, the number of bidders was eventually reduced to three. These bidders were issued with an invitation to negotiate in November 2000. The consortia bids were submitted in February 2001, were subject to detailed evaluation under design and construction, services, and financial and legal by officials of the Department together with specialist advisors. Following this process, Jarvis Projects Limited was selected as the preferred bidder in March 2001.</p>

          <p eId="para_1186">The Department's officials and advisers entered into a period of intense discussion with Jarvis with a view to reaching financial close on the project. During this period Jarvis, under the terms of the project, sought and received planning permission for the project from Cork City Council. However, An Taisce submitted a planning appeal to An Bord Pleanála against the grant of permission. During the period of the appeal, work on the project was suspended and was only resumed after An Bord Pleanála rejected the appeal and granted planning permission for the development on 24 December 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_1187">Recently, the Department of Finance raised a number of additional issues in respect of the project that officials from the Department of Education and Science have been examining in conjunction with specialist advisers. In addition, the question of the involvement of the European Investment Bank is being addressed. Proposals have been tabled whereby the European Investment Bank could provide refinancing for the project two years into the operations phase, thus reducing the overall cost of the project. Discussions with both the Department of Finance and the European Investment Bank are currently ongoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1188">Under EU rules, where projects are financed on a deferred payment basis by the private sector, the capital value of such projects is a charge on the general Government balance over the construction phase. As the Deputies will be aware, the general Government balance is the critical measure of what can be accommodated within our obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact of the Maastricht Treaty. A EUROSTAT group is currently reviewing the accounting rules on this issue, as will a standing committee being established by the Minister for Finance to advise on the general Government balance implications of private sector financed projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_1189">Ultimately, the final approval for the Cork School of Music will be a matter for the Government and consideration of it will be based on a thorough assessment of affordability of the project in the context of the competing demands on the likely capital funding envelopes going forward.</p>

I refer to the cutback of approximately €400,000 for the Kerry Parents and Friends Association and the cut of €775,000 for St. Mary's of the Angels, Beaufort, County Kerry. The Kerry Parents and Friends Association was set up in 1973 primarily as a support to people with intellectual disabilities and their families in County Kerry. The association opened its first residential and day service for ten adults with intellectual disability in Tralee in 1978. Since then the association has developed both day and residential services at 11 locations throughout County Kerry. The association has 217 people on its database, 53 of whom are involved in full-time or part-time residential and day services, 110 in full-time or part-time day service only and approximately 56 who are in receipt of support services under the association's home support programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1194">To maintain 2002 service levels, the association has projected a deficit in revenue funding for 2003 of €413,000. It will have no option but to curtail service delivery this year and it is currently reviewing all services in an attempt to identify absolutely necessary curtailments which will impact least on service users, their families and staff. Despite having 14 beds empty and available in Killarney, Castleisland and Valentia, Kerry Parents and Friends Association will not be able to respond to emergency demand for day or residential placement. Emergency placement usually arises following the death or serious illness of a parent or carer. Many of those on the association's database are living with elderly parents and over recent years emergency admissions have been necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_1195">The association will not be able to meet the demand for new day placements for children leaving special and mainstream schools next September. There will also be difficulties in meeting the change in service requirements of many of their current service users due to changes in needs, such as care for the elderly and challenging behaviour. It will not be able to relocate people already selected from St. Finian's hospital, Killarney, to more appropriate residential accommodation in the community, which it has done successfully in Listowel over the past year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1196">Kerry Parents and Friends Association has been underfunded for many years and this has been acknowledged by an independent consultant appointed by the Department of Health and Children. The association has incurred revenue funding deficits since 1984 and had a funding deficit of over €200,000 in 2001 and a large deficit in 2002. In the absence of additional change in funding policy in 2003 to address these serious deficits, the association faces a threat to existing service provision and employment. For example, funding for St. Mary of the Angels will be reduced by approximately €700,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_1197">No funding has been allocated for new service development in 2003, despite the fact that 1,711 individuals living at home require a full-time residential service, 861 require a day service and 1,014 require a respite service. Furthermore, more than 400 people with intellectual disability are living in totally unsuitable conditions in long-stay psychiatric hospitals. Consequently, there will be no funding for emergencies, which will inevitably arise when a parent or carer dies or is no longer able to look after their child, nor will funding be provided for day services for those children with intellectual disability leaving school this year. As a result, during this year St. Mary of the Angels will not be in a position to respond to demand for emergency day or residential placements. The respite service, on which parents heavily rely, will have to be curtailed. Day placements for children leaving St. Francis special school at Listowel will not be available and it will be very difficult to respond to the change in needs of the service users.</p>
          <p eId="para_1198">It is most regrettable that in 2003, organisations such as Kerry Parents and Friends Association and St. Mary's of the Angels will no longer be able to respond imaginatively in the true spirit of voluntary organisations to the needs of people with intellectual disability in County Kerry and throughout the country. I hope the Minister of State will have positive news for these people because they are very angry with the present situation.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_708" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Science">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_1199">I am replying on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin. I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to outline the position concerning this issue. I presume the Deputy is referring to the services provided by Kerry Parents and Friends Association. Between 2000 and 2002, the association received €8.5 million in revenue funding and €2.2 million in capital funding. In 2000 it also received a once-off grant of €190,000 to assist with a cumulative revenue deficit. Funding for 2003 has not been finalised with the Southern Health Board, which has the responsibility in the first instance for the provision of health related support services in County Kerry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1200">The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, two thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services. This funding is being applied largely to maintain existing levels of service across all service programmes, including services for persons with an intellectual disability.</p>
          <p eId="para_1201">Between 1997 and 2002, an additional €188 million in revenue and €139 million in capital funding was provided, making a total additional investment of €327 million for the maintenance and development of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. Included in this funding is €27.2 million, which was allocated to meet identified need in existing service. In the current year, further additional funding of €13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding brings the total additional investment in these services to €340 million over seven years. Of this total amount, over €200 million has been built into the ongoing budget base.</p>
          <p eId="para_1202">This funding has brought about very significant and unprecedented developments in the services. Between 1997 and 2002, approximately 1,700 additional residential places have been provided, with most of these based in the community. This figure includes new residential respite places which were developed in 1997 and 1998. Between 1999 and 2002, approximately 465 dedicated respite places were also provided. In addition, the period from 1997 to 2002 saw the provision of approximately 2,950 new day places.</p>
          <p eId="para_1203">Despite this very significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular, even though the number of persons in receipt of services, including full-time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition, persons with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously, adding to the needs of services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with health boards and other service providers in relation to service provision this year.</p>

        <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_709">
          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_1204">At Leader's Questions last Wednesday, the Taoiseach was advised by the Labour Party leader of the circumstances involving a constituent of mine and the Minister for Health and Children. I was surprised that in his reply, the Taoiseach referred to a voluntary organisation being at fault. I subsequently visited the organisation, the Cork Centre for Independent Living, and spoke to its principals. They were disappointed with the Taoiseach's remarks, which may have been made because he was misinformed or did not fully understand the situation. However, that is indicative of a Government that is all too willing to pass on responsibility, especially in relation to this area, the provision of a uniform national system of personal assistance for persons with physical disabilities and mobility difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_1205">In this area different standards in terms of quality of service apply depending on where one lives in the country. In the Eastern Regional Health Authority, a pilot scheme run through the Irish Wheelchair Association is a model to which many wheelchair users aspire. It must be asked why such a service does not exist in the rest of the country and what is the Government prepared to do to ensure that it does.</p>
          <p eId="para_1206">In the absence of a uniform national service, many of those involved in disability groups find that they are hostage to the willingness of their local health boards to provide one. Often the health boards consider that if they are to be involved in this issue they should provide the service. If the Minister of State has any awareness of the issue, it is based on the willingness of many wheelchair users to live independent lives. If a sufficiently imaginative scheme was provided, the Government would not only provide the resources for a service needed but it would do so in the most cost-effective way possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1207">Questions must be asked about the absence of a national scheme. Depending on the health board area, assistance is on a home help basis and very sporadic, entailing one or two hours per day at the board's insistence. It does not always fit in with the needs of the individual wheelchair user and continues to be dependent on community employment schemes in which there is a lack of certainty as to the role in respect of the wheelchair users, despite the good will of the people involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1208">We have had four Adjournment Debate Matters this evening to which the Minister for Health and Children could and should have responded. His failure to do so indicates the general problems in the health service. I challenge the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to ask the Minister why such a service is not already in existence and to recognise the anomalies that exist for people with physical disabilities. He should try to avoid a repetition of the circumstances described by the Labour Party leader during Leaders' Questions.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_710">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_1209">Although I am responding to all four Adjournment Debate Matters on behalf of the Minister, I am a Minister of State in all the Departments concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1210">The provision of health related services for people with physical or sensory disabilities is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority or the relevant health board in the first instance. Since 1997 my Department has allocated significant levels of funding across the disability sector, which has resulted in substantial advances in the quality and quantity of the health related services being provided to people with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1211">Approximately €100 million in additional ongoing revenue has been provided with regard to the maintenance and development of services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. Such services include residential, respite and home support services, which include personal assistance services, therapy services and day care services. A further €81 million has been provided in once-off grants for capital projects and issues such as the provision of technical aids and appliances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1212">Priorities for the allocation of funding available for the development of health related services are decided by the health boards in consultation with the regional co-ordinating committees for physical and sensory disabilities. Voluntary sector service providers and advocates for persons with disabilities are represented on these committees. The Department, in conjunction with the Health Research Board, the health boards and the voluntary sector, is working on a national physical and sensory disability database, which will provide a picture of the specialised health and personal social service needs of people with a physical or sensory disability within a five year period, including the need for personal assistance services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1213">A working group established by the Minister for Health and Children is currently examining the matter of the provision of a uniform, national personal assistant scheme for people with physical and mobility difficulties. It is comprised of representatives of the Department, health boards, service providers and service users. It has received information and statistics from health boards on current practices, procedures, service utilisation and demand in the relevant boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_1214">Draft standard policies and procedures on assessment of need, and training of personal assistants have been compiled by the working group, which cover all aspects of personal assistance and home support services to be considered by the health boards later this year.</p>

          <from>Ms McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_1215">By any stretch of the imagination, the cost-saving measures proposed by the management of Beaumont Hospital are deeply disturbing. They constitute a series of cuts that the hospital, its staff and patients cannot sustain and which has been opposed publicly by the medical board which represents the hospital consultants.</p>
          <p eId="para_1216">The measures being proposed are unprecedented. I have never before seen a memo from a senior hospital manager that proposes measures that we know will damage the welfare of patients. It is wrong that our major hospitals have been driven to this. I call on the Minister to tell us what financial instructions have been given to Beaumont Hospital, St. Vincent's Hospital, the Mater Hospital and St. James's Hospital. We need to know what they have been told about their financial allocations for the coming year. We also need to know the deficits already accumulated by them as they struggle to provide a decent level and quality of service. We are entitled to this information.</p>
          <p eId="para_1217">I also call on the Minister to send for the list of proposals made by each of the hospitals in response to their financial allocations. It is not enough for the Minister to tell us that this is a matter between the health authority and the hospitals concerned. There are two reasons the Minister must get involved in the crisis. First, the hospitals, in many cases, provide national services far beyond their immediate catchment areas or that of the ERHA. Many of the patients who depend on the staff and services of Beaumont Hospital, for example, come from beyond its catchment area. Second, I understand that in discussions that have already taken place between the hospital and the ERHA, the authority is taking the position that it will not make decisions on what services should be cut. The hospital has been told that, as far as the ERHA is concerned, it must make whatever decisions are necessary to live within its allocation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1218">The nephrologist in Beaumont Hospital, Mr. Peter Conlon, made it clear on RTE radio today that 60 or 70 patients who depend on night dialysis shifts in Beaumont could die if the service is closed down and if there is no other way of providing such a service for them. His attitude, which reflects that of the vast majority of the medical staff in the hospital, is that cuts like these will simply not be tolerated. We have reason to be grateful to Mr. Conlon and his colleagues for their forthright approach and determination to represent the patients. It is clear we cannot rely on the Government to do anything more than wash its hands of the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1219">The closure of the dialysis night shift is only one of the cost-cutting measures proposed by the hospital. Altogether, 41 measures have been proposed, ranging in severity from cuts that will threaten the lives and well-being of patients to cuts that will damage the reputation of Beaumont for having a decent standard of patient care. The measures include reductions in overtime, on-call and weekend allowances, reductions of on-call pathology and radiology services, filling of beds by returning patients from nursing homes, capping of major services including cancer and dialysis services, elimination of certain devices that are used in treatment care, restriction of locum cover, maternity cover and sick leave, closure of 65 beds with almost immediate effect, and charging for appliances that were previously free.</p>
          <p eId="para_1220">We have debated in the House today whether the Government should buy or lease its ministerial transport and whether there should be one, two or three executive jets. It is hard to imagine anything more obscene than a debate about those kinds of choices when, at the same time, our major hospitals are struggling with Government-imposed instructions that involve choices which are matters of life or death.</p>
          <p eId="para_1221">Will the Minister of State provide an honest account of the extent of the crisis faced by our major hospitals? In view of the Taoiseach's remarks this morning, will he clarify that there will be no witch hunt against any staff member in Beaumont Hospital as a result of these revelations?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_712">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_1222">I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin. As Deputy McManus is aware, the Eastern Regional Health Authority is charged with responsibility for commissioning health and personal social services on behalf of the population of the region, and on behalf of those outside the region who are referred for specialist treatment. The approved level of spending nationally for health services in 2003 is in excess of €9 billion. Of this, more than €500 million relates to capital spending, leaving in excess of €8.5 billion available for revenue spending.</p>
          <p eId="para_1223">This level of expenditure represents an increase of almost 9% on the figure for 2002, which allowed the Minister to allocate funding to the authority and the health boards approximately 9% higher than that provided for in the 2002 letters of determination. This is a very significant level of funding, and the authority and the boards have been requested to look for the most efficient and effective means to maintain services at the 2002 approved levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_1224">We are all aware of the speech of the Minister for Finance on Budget Day regarding the funding available for public services. While we would all like additional funding, we must be cognisant of the economic climate that will prevail for the next few years and work to develop our services within the parameters set down by Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1225">While acknowledging that €9 billion is a very significant funding base, the authority and the health boards will have to make some difficult decisions this year on their service provision and priorities, given the many competing demands for funding. Nevertheless, it must be recognised that, once again, the health services received the largest increases of any Government agency. That reflects the Government's commitment to maintaining the quantity and quality of services nationally in a difficult economic climate. The Eastern Regional Health Authority is in discussions with all providers in the region, including the major acute hospitals in the Dublin area, to finalise the level of services to be provided in 2003. These discussions are expected to conclude within the next two weeks and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has asked the ERHA to report back to the Department on the outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_1226">The priority in 2003 will be the consolidation of services approved and funded in recent years as it is on this basis that the authority developed and agreed its service plan for the year. The authority accepts that 2003 will be a difficult year for the acute hospitals sector as increases in funding over last year will be limited. There is a clear need for tight management of costs and activity in 2003 in the context of working within available resources. Provision has been made in the authority's service plan for the completion of major initiatives which commenced in 2002. These initiatives include the introduction under the Government's bed capacity initiative of over 300 additional acute hospital beds at St. James's Hospital, St. Vincent's Hospital, St. Michael's Hospital, St. Joseph's Hospital, Raheny, Naas General Hospital, Beaumont Hospital, Temple Street Hospital and Tallaght Hospital. An additional 35 beds are being provided at Beaumont Hospital. Funding of €31 million has been provided to meet the additional cost in 2003 of over 200 beds already commissioned by the authority while €9 million is being provided to fund the beds which are planned for 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1227">The authority has received additional funding of €9.45 million to support the consolidation of acute hospital services. This funding will be allocated to service providers to help them meet the increased costs of current levels of activity and to fund service developments initiated in 2002. This funding includes an additional €1.4 million for the continued provision of national specialty services. Additional funding of €4.5 million has been provided to meet the cost in 2003 of developing the new national lung transplant programme at the Mater Hospital. Funding has also been provided to meet the costs associated with the recruitment of additional consultants in emergency medicine and consultant anaesthetists, as well as for cancer, cardiology and renal dialysis services. The authority has worked closely with the national treatment purchase fund and its providers to enable almost 800 patients to be referred and treated under the scheme in 2002. The authority will continue to work with the fund to achieve the maximum possible reduction in waiting times in its region. The Department will continue to monitor the authority's performance in the context of its service plan to ensure that services continue to be delivered in line with objectives and within existing spending parameters.</p>
          <p eId="para_1228">I am aware of today's media publicity in relation to the accident and emergency department and other services at Beaumont Hospital. In common with the other major Dublin hospitals, the casualty department at Beaumont Hospital is under significantly more pressure at this time of year than at other times. I do not consider it appropriate to comment on individual cases, but I must point out that patients requiring admission to hospital from accident and emergency departments are prioritised according to clinical condition. My Department is advised that while the person concerned was in Beaumont Hospital a significant number of acutely ill patients required emergency admission. As the person concerned was given a lower priority in terms of his clinical condition it was, unfortunately, not possible to allocate a bed to him. The patient was under constant observation by medical and nursing staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_1229">I accept that there is a bed shortage at Beaumont Hospital, but, as I have indicated to the Deputy, 35 additional beds are being provided under the Government's bed capacity initiative. Funding for these beds has already been notified to the authority. The hospital has advised that the beds will be made available in the near future. Over the next fortnight, it is anticipated that the authority will conclude its provider plan discussions with Beaumont Hospital and the other major teaching hospitals in the region. It will be a matter for the authority and each of the hospitals to agree any specific measures to ensure that each hospital continues to maintain a high level of service within available resources. In relation to Beaumont Hospital, I emphasise that no decisions have been taken to make cuts in services and that the proposals contained in the leaked document referred to in the House today have not been adopted by the board of the hospital or agreed with the ERHA.</p>

          <p eId="para_1233">Under the national lottery funded sports capital programme administered by my Department, funding is allocated to projects directly related to the provision of sports and recreational facilities at local, regional and national level. While the majority of the funding allocated under the programme is provided to voluntary and community groups, there is provision in the programme for applications to be submitted by local authorities. For example, under the 2002 programme grants to the value of over €9.2 million were awarded to some 29 projects either directly to local authorities or for projects where the local authority was working in partnership with a sports club or a community organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1234">In terms of multi-purpose sports complexes available to the wider community, it has been a deliberate policy of the programme, particularly in the past two years, to fund a number of such multi-sport centres under the management and control of, and located on sites owned by, local authorities, keeping in mind the existing facilities in a region. Such applications must, like all others, meet the terms and conditions of the sports capital programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1235">Some such sports centre projects include those for Finglas, Waterford city, Navan, Ballymun, Carlow, Letterkenny and Portlaoise. Significant contributions towards the estimated cost of these projects were made by my Department on the basis that the local authorities involved would be able to raise the balance of the funding required for their completion. Certainly, I would encourage them and those local authorities planning similar facilities in the future to consider securing private sector funding proposals to assist in completing such projects.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_49">Of the multi-purpose sports centres listed above, those for Ballymun, Finglas, Letterkenny and Portlaoise, apart from securing funding through the sports capital programme, plan to include swimming pools as part of their overall sports complex and have also applied for funding under the local authority swimming pool programme to that end. The Deputy will be aware that under this programme grants are available towards the development of new pools or the refurbishment of existing pools. The maximum grant available is 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in disadvantaged areas 90% of it, up to a maximum of €3.8 million. Currently there are 43 projects at various stages of development under the programme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_50">In the overall context of the provision of sports facilities throughout the country, and building on the substantial investment this and the previous Government made in this area, which includes allocating over €213 million to 2,900 projects under the sports capital programme and over €57 million under the local authority swimming pool programme, this Government intends to put in place a long-term strategic plan to ensure the development of sports facilities throughout the country.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_51">It is envisaged that a national audit of local sports facilities will also be undertaken in tandem with the development of the long-term strategy. An inter-agency steering group will be set up by the middle of this year to devise the long-term strategy for the development of sports facilities. This group will include members from a number of Departments engaged in funding sport and recreational facilities and will examine further ways to ensure a strategic approach to facility provision. I would hope that the strategic plan for the funding of facilities will be in place for the 2004 sports capital programme.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1237">St. Patrick's Day has traditionally signalled the start of the tourism season in Ireland.

In addition, dialogue is being developed between Tourism Ireland Limited and diplomatic missions in order to ensure that tourism interests are appropriately recognised and catered for in relevant events being organised by the missions.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_52">For my part, I will be travelling to Britain, which is our largest tourism market, to participate in a series of tourism promotions, including the official opening of the new Tourism Ireland offices in London, where I will be joined by the Minister responsible for tourism in Northern Ireland, Mr. Ian Pearson, MP.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_53">I will also travel to Edinburgh to join in the St. Patrick's Day celebrations being organised by the Irish Consulate there on 15 March. I have asked Tourism Ireland and the consulate to consider any opportunities there may be to invite key tourism players to official events including the St. Patrick's Day Charity Ball which I will be attending that evening. I will return the following day to participate in the national St. Patrick's Parade and festival events in Dublin.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1356">The Government has provided financial support totalling €69.84 million to the Gaelic Athletic Association towards the redevelopment of Croke Park. At a meeting in October 2002, the Government told the GAA that a revised application would be required for any further funding towards the redevelopment of Croke Park. The GAA has applied for additional funding for Croke Park and this application is being considered. I should point out that the Estimates for my Department for 2003 do not include a provision for the payment of any further moneys to the GAA in respect of the project.</p>

The organisers, through contributions from the corporate sector, private donors, fundraising activities, the EU and Northern Ireland, are raising the remainder of the money required. With inflation, etc., there may be some additional pressures on the budget for the games and the organisers are currently examining the nature, extent and financing of these in conjunction with sponsors, including the Government. On the basis of the organisers' original estimates for the costs of the games, I am certainly satisfied that the Government has pledged an adequate contribution.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1365">Under the local authority swimming pool programme, which is administered by my Department, there is provision for swimming pool projects to be undertaken by organisations other than local authorities. The procedures for the planning, approval and financing of swimming pools require that such proposals must obtain the support of and be submitted through the relevant local authority. Before supporting an application, the local authority would have to be satisfied that the proposal is viable, that the balance of funding required to complete the project is available and that the project, when completed, will have a satisfactory level of public access. Proposals must comply with the requirements set out in the Department's "Procedures for the Planning, Approval and Financing of Swimming Pools and Technical Guidelines".</p>
          <p eId="para_1366">Under this programme, there are four stages in a swimming pool project following the submission of a feasibility study. These, in order of progress, are: preliminary report; contract documents; tender and construction. My Department's technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant-aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.</p>

          <p eId="para_1373">Under the local authority swimming pool programme, which is administered by my Department, there are four stages in a swimming pool project, following the submission of a feasibility study. These, in order of progress, are: preliminary report; contract documents; tender and construction. My Department's technical advisers, the Office of Public Works, Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant-aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1374">Under the programme, grants of up to a maximum of €3.8 million are available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools subject, in both cases, to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Support is available towards the cost of the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_74">The preliminary report submitted by Kilkenny Borough Council in respect of the proposed replacement pool for Kilkenny was approved in January 2003 and the project moved to the next phase of the process. It is now a matter for Kilkenny Borough Council to prepare the detailed contract documents for the proposed facility and to submit these to my Department. On receipt of this documentation, the proposal will be considered further.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1376">Ministerial responsibility for the protection of the environment rests with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. However, I am fully aware that the quality of the environment is at the heart of Ireland's attraction as a tourist destination.</p>
          <p eId="para_1377">The objective of securing an environmentally sustainable tourism sector, which, as I pointed out in reply to a question in October last, was clearly articulated in the strategy statement for the former Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, continues to be a priority for my Department. Achievement of this objective is being pursued through the tourism marketing and product development policies agreed with, and implemented by, the tourism agencies. Both Tourism Ireland Limited and Bord Fáilte regard spatially balanced tourism as a key component of their marketing strategies, with an appropriate emphasis on both seasonal and geographical spread of business.</p>
          <p eId="para_1378">The overall objective of Bord Fáilte's tourism product development scheme is to develop the tourism industry in an environmentally sustainable way that widens the spatial spread of tourism, diverts pressure from highly developed areas and increases under-performing regions' share of overseas tourism revenue. This will be achieved by concentrating support: on a limited number of new visitor attractions; on marketable clusters of existing day visitor attractions which have yet to achieve their full tourism potential; on a series of special interest activities to meet identified niche markets; and on specific pro-environment tourism initiatives in the more established tourism areas.</p>

          <p eId="para_1381">Sport has a very significant contribution to make in terms of raising our health levels and in weaning young people off anti-social behaviour and drugs misuse. All of us are in some way enriched and uplifted when sporting excellence is achieved by our leading sportsmen and women at home and abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_1382">The Irish Sports Council, which was established as a statutory body in July 1999, plays a leading role in encouraging the sustainable development of sport in Ireland. Many of its most successful initiatives have contributed to breaking down barriers and increasing participation in sport.</p>
          <p eId="para_1383">The local sports partnership initiative aims to co-ordinate and promote the development sport at local level. By the end of 2002, 12 partnerships had been established around Ireland. All are actively developing plans with the local communities to increase participation in sport. Approximately €1.5 million was allocated to the partnerships in 2002 to assist them with their work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1384">The sport for young people grant scheme is aimed at promoting sporting opportunities for young people, particularly those in areas of social and economic disadvantage and those who are marginalised and at risk. Grants totalling €891,600 were allocated under this scheme in 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1385">Buntús Play and Buntús Multi Sport are two exciting programmes developed to support teachers and other adults in introducing young people to sport and helping to develop their interest. These programmes will initially be delivered by teachers in schools in support of the physical education curriculum and they provide opportunities for young people to take part in sport, regardless of their ability, gender, ethnicity or background.</p>
          <p eId="para_1386">The sport for older people scheme aims to increase participation among older people in recreational sport and activities. The scheme has three elements, the active living programme, sports participation programme and national grant scheme. In 2002, over €300,000 was made available through the grant scheme to almost 500 local groups to enable them to buy sports equipment, organise training programmes and sports festivals.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_76">Under the recreational sport programme, the council works with the Irish Heart Foundation to provide accessible activities to all people regardless of age, gender or ability through involving families, workplaces and communities. Grants were allocated to Slí na Sláinte, which is concerned with developing accessible walkways in local areas and training local leaders to increase their usage and to Lifestyle Change, which aims to encourage Irish employees and community groups to take up a programme of regular exercise for at least 12 weeks. In 2002, 27 companies and three community groups, a total of 1,800 people, registered for the Lifestyle Challenge.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_77">Sports Council funding to the national governing bodies of sport is used to develop services, provide better coaching, support for international competition and training and provision of professional staff. In addition, several of these governing bodies, such as those for tennis, canoeing and badminton have established youth sport programmes. In 2002, the council also provided funding totalling almost €7 million to the FAI, the GAA and the IRFU to encourage and promote greater underage participation in soccer, Gaelic games and rugby.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_78">In recognition of the importance which it attaches to sport and the benefits which accrue, in particular from active participation in sport, the Government has, over the past five years invested €213 million in supporting almost 3,000 projects which provide sporting facilities for communities throughout the country. In addition, through the local authority swimming pool programme, swimming facilities have been provided in many locations and further pools are at various stages of development.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_79">Sport is now acknowledged by Government as having a major impact on all our lives and the overall budget for sport has increased from just over €17 million in 1997 to over €160 million in 2002 and this level of funding is expected to continue into 2003.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1388">The level of funding, at €44 million, allocated to the Arts Council for 2003 is an unfortunate reflection of the more difficult budgetary circumstances now prevailing. However, it should be recalled that the resources available to the Arts Council have grown rapidly over recent years. As recently as 1997 the allocation to the Arts Council was €26.44 million. The management of the available funding is the responsibility of the Arts Council, which operates independently of Government on a day-to-day basis.</p>

      <b>Mr. Stanton</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Defence</b>
      the number of FCA officers of the respective ranks currently serving; the way in which the proposed reorganisation of the reserve will affect such officers and their career prospects, especially with regard to promotion opportunities; the number of vacant officer appointments currently in the reserve; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [5807/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#MichaelSmith" as="#Minister_for_Defence" eId="spk_735">
          <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</from>
          <p eId="para_1451">On 15 January 2003 I approved, in principle, the report of the Reserve Defence Forces Review Implementation Board. This implementation board was established to formulate a plan for the implementation of the recommendations of the special steering group on the Reserve. The steering group, which I established to undertake a study of the reserve, reported to me in September 1999. The Reserve Defence Review Implementation Board sets out a six year implementation process for the reorganisation of the Reserve based on the steering group report proposals and that process is now under way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1452">The full organisational and establishment details of the new reserve will be determined in the course of the ongoing detailed implementation process. Plans are currently being prepared by each general officer commanding a brigade for the amalgamation of FCA units in line with the proposals outlined in the steering group report. The objective of this process is to ensure that better training and other facilities will be provided to members of the Reserve Defence Forces. No decisions have yet been taken on the location of the proposed newly amalgamated units but the military authorities have advised me that all proposed amalgamations will provide an optimal environment for personnel in the relevant areas to partake in the new enhanced Reserve Defence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1453">In general terms, the blueprint for the new Reserve Defence Force will involve replacing An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil with an Army Reserve consisting of two elements. One element will provide personnel who will integrate with Permanent Defence Force units to bring them up to full operational strength in a contingency situation. Personnel who opt for a period of integrated service will be provided with enhanced military training. The larger element will provide the overall Army Reserve, organised into three reserve brigades.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_87">Members of the FCA are already seeing the benefits in terms of better clothing and improved equipment and more and better quality training. As the process develops we will see additional benefits in terms of a clearer role for the reserve, a better overall organisation structure, and opportunities for suitably qualified reserve personnel to serve overseas. We will also see benefits from the closer integration of the reserve with the Army.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_88">I must emphasise I am very mindful of the need to preserve and to retain the very many traditional and well established strengths of the current reserve system, not least the admirable spirit of individual voluntary commitment, close social links with local communities and a good depth and scope as regards nationwide geographical spread. The Permanent Defence Force is now organised in a three-brigade structure and a Defence Forces Training Centre. The Reserve Defence Force will be similarly reorganised and restructured into a parallel structure over a period of approximately six years. The total number of and ranking of officer appointments in the new Army Reserve will obviously be a final end product of the wider reorganisation and restructuring process. The full organisational and establishment details of the new reserve will be determined in the course of the ongoing detailed implementation process.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_89">In order that senior Reserve Defence Force officers can serve and influence reserve activities at the highest level in brigade headquarters and the Defence Forces Training Centre, the steering group report recommended the creation of four new lieutenant-colonel appointments. It is intended that these new appointments will form part of the integrated element of the reserve and personnel appointed to these appointments would hold them for the duration of their integrated service. While the mechanism for appointing personnel to these appointments has not yet been established, it will form part of the Implementation process.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_90">The following table sets out the current position as regards relative establishments and strengths across commissioned ranks of the FCA.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1473">St. Bricin's Military Hospital can currently provide in-patient accommodation for up to 53 in-patients, a full pharmacy service and a wide range of out-patient services for members of the Defence Forces. Out-patient services provided include primary care services, post hospital reviews, ENT, ophthalmology, psychiatry, physiotherapy, radiology, pathology and dental services, including periodontal treatment. There are currently 44 beds in active use while a further nine beds are available for immediate use, and there are a further 27 beds in a reserve ward. The total number of patients admitted during 2002 was 117 and the total number of bed days was 1,080. Out-patient attendances to the hospital for 2002 came to 10,918.</p>
          <p eId="para_1474">At present there are four medical officers, one dental officer and two pharmacists serving in the hospital. There are also two civilian doctors providing a part-time service to out-patients. The most dominant factor influencing service delivery at St. Bricin's Hospital is medical manpower. The hospital is working to capacity in the light of available personnel resources. The hospital is not equipped, and would not have the staffing resources, to provide additional more sophisticated or other specialist services, other than those provided at present.</p>

          <p eId="para_1478">Grant aid of €1.4 million under the national development plan is being provided this year for the development of the commercial horticulture sector. This follows on the grant aid of €3.582 million which was paid for developments carried out over the first two years of the scheme in 2001-02. The 2003 scheme was launched on 6 February 2003 and will cover the period up to 31 December 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1479">The objectives of the scheme remain the same as in the first round, which covered the 2001-02 period. These are to help producers meet the higher quality standards being sought by consumers and the high environmental and hygiene requirements demanded of all food producers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1480">In addition, grant aid is also provided to producer organisations under the EU Common Organisation of the Market for Fruit and Vegetables. Currently 17 producer organisations are now recognised under this scheme and were in receipt of €2.967 million in 2001. The scheme enables producers to benefit from their combined strength in producing and marketing high quality fruit and vegetables. Total marketed production of these groups in 2001 was €163 million.</p>

          <p eId="para_1500">Following an approach to the European Commission in 2001 it was agreed that widows and widowers pensions – formerly called survivor's Pensions – should not be regarded as national retirement pensions until the recipient reached the normal retirement age of 66 years.

          <p eId="para_1501">It is a requirement of the European Council regulations governing both the 1994 and 2000 schemes of early retirement that the early retirement pension may only be granted as a supplement to any national retirement pension that the participant, and his or her spouse/partner in a joint management arrangement, may receive. This means that the amount of any national retirement pension payable must be deducted from the early retirement pension.</p>

      <b>Ms Lynch</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Agriculture and Food</b>
      his views on reports that Ireland is becoming a dumping ground for surplus UK ponies; and his plans to close a loophole whereby horses exported from the UK to the continent must have a minimum value of £UK715 which effectively prevents the export of equines for slaughter, but no such regulation applies between Ireland and the UK thereby creating a situation where hundreds of surplus ponies are shipped here via Northern Ireland.

          <from>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</from>
          <p eId="para_1503">Due to trade rules in place between Ireland, France and the UK for many years, based on a common animal health position in the equine sector, known as the tripartite agreement, no intra-community export or import health certificates are required for the import of horses from the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p eId="para_1504">All horses imported from the UK are required to comply with the provisions of Council Directive 90/426/EEC on health conditions governing the movement of such animals for trade purposes and in particular Articles 4 and 5 which provide that an inspection must be carried out in the 48 hours prior to their embarkation or loading. The official veterinarian of the country of dispatch must, at the time of inspection, be satisfied that the animals have not been in contact with an infectious or contagious disease during the 15 days immediately preceding inspection.</p>
          <p eId="para_1505">In addition, the horses must be identified in accordance with one of the methods laid down in the directive, namely their own passports or a current signed marking sheet drawn up or signed by a veterinarian. They must also comply with Council Directive 91/628/EEC on the protection of animals during transport and be fit to travel. An animal transport certificate accompanies them on their journey. I have no plans to change these rules.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_95">With regard to the apparent distinction mentioned by the Deputy in UK arrangements as between the value of horses being exported from the UK to continental Europe and those destined for this country, the Deputy will appreciate that I have no jurisdiction over the legislative process in another member state. I will however consider the matter with a view to determining whether it warrants being raised with the Northern Ireland authorities.</summary>

      <b>Mr. F. McGrath</b>

          <p eId="para_1507">As the Deputy is aware, there is provision for a special levy on financial institutions contained in the Finance Bill before the House. This levy, if enacted, will raise €300 million over the next three years, and this will increase the funds available for Exchequer funding in all areas, including those mentioned by the Deputy. It would not be appropriate to single out one company and apply a different tax regime to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1508">It should also be borne in mind that any multinational company resident in Ireland with subsidiaries in other jurisdictions will initially be liable to taxation in these countries in respect of the profits in those other countries. The question of Irish taxation on the profits of such subsidiaries only arises when the subsidiaries remit dividends to the parent company and credit must then be given for taxation paid in the other country if it is a country with which Ireland has a double taxation treaty. I have no plans to introduce a levy of the type proposed by the Deputy on the profits of a particular bank.</p>

It assimilates the 8 to 15 early school leaver initiative, ESLI, and the stay-in-school retention initiative at second level, SSRI.</p>
          <p eId="para_1574">The objective of the school completion programme is to provide a range of interventions in areas of disadvantage that support the retention of young people in education. It is based on an integrated approach involving primary and post-primary schools, parents, communities and relevant statutory and voluntary agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1575">Sites for participation in the programme were selected on the basis of a detailed analysis of pupil retention rates at second level using the Department's post-primary pupils database.

          <p eId="para_1988">As part of its evaluation role, my Department's inspectorate recently conducted a sample survey of 25 primary schools which had been allocated resource teacher and special needs assistant support. This review highlighted significant misapplication of the terms of the relevant departmental circulars and arrangements were made for the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) to carry out a review of some 788 applications for support. The 788 applications in question involved a total of 1,590 individual pupils in respect of whom support was sought. Of the 1,590 individual pupils involved, the review concluded that the applications in respect of 948, or 60%, conformed with departmental circulars and the resources sought have been allocated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1989">In the remaining 642 cases, the key problems identified were levels of support sought in respect of individual pupils in a particular disability category which did not conform to the support levels identified in the circulars and instances in which the relevant assessment reports required to support the application were not available at the school for inspection by NEPS. Where possible, NEPS made a recommendation as to the nature and level of the resources which should be provided and these resources have been sanctioned.</p>

          <p eId="para_2003">The allocation of speech and language therapy services to schools is a matter for the local health authority and I have no plans to become involved in such allocations. With respect to the Deputy's comment relating to advertising two vacant teacher posts for the special classes in question, I am aware that there are two specialised and experienced teachers currently in charge of the classes. Accordingly, there is no need for the board of management to advertise the posts.</p>
          <p eId="para_2004">My Department is involved in the provision of training places for speech and language therapists. In May 2002 the provision of an additional 75 professional therapy training places to tackle the shortage of speech and language therapists was announced. These places are being provided in response to the recommendations set out in a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for various professionals, including speech and language therapists, which was launched in July 2001. The announcement followed on the work of an inter-agency group, comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Health and Children and the Higher Education Authority, which was established to ensure the provision of the additional places and which considered proposals from third level institutions for the expansion of existing courses and or the introduction of new courses, including graduate entry programmes, in response to the training needs identified in the Bacon report. The distribution of the additional places in speech and language therapy is as follows: University College Cork, National University of Ireland, Cork; 25 places – Bachelor of Science in Speech and Language Therapy National University of Ireland, Galway; 25 places – Bachelor of Science in Speech and Language Therapy University of Limerick; 25 places – Master of Science in Speech and Language Therapy.</p>
          <p eId="para_2005">On foot of data received from the Higher Education Authority and based on the number of students in the final year of the courses, it is expected that the number of students graduating in speech and language therapy for the current academic year will be 23.</p>

          <p eId="para_2020">In this year of the disabled, I am glad to outline the substantial commitments being made by my Department in the area of special needs. I am committed to continuing to build on the unprecedented development of special education services, which has taken place in recent years. This commitment is reflected in the fact that the number of resource teachers in the primary system will have grown from approximately 100 at the end of 1998 to a current figure of approximately 2,300, and the number is growing in response to demand; the number of special needs assistants in the system will have grown from approximately 300 at the end of 1998 to a current level of approximately 5,100 between full-time and part-time posts, which is also growing in response to demand; in excess of 500 teachers have been deployed to support special dedicated classes attached to ordinary primary schools; in excess of 1,000 teachers are in place in 108 special schools dedicated to children with special needs; approximately €30 million is being spent annually on the special school transport service and a further €4.4 million on the special escort service for children with disabilities; the allocation for part-time tuition services for children with special needs is being increased from €12 million in 2002 to €19 million in 2003; the funding allocation for special equipment is being increased from €1.6 million in 2002 to €2.26 million in 2003; and funding for the salaries of special needs assistants is being increased from €68 million in 2002 to €100 million in 2003. These figures represent real and substantial improvements in special education services and provide concrete evidence of the Government's commitment to the ongoing development of these services.</p>
          <p eId="para_2021">In addition, I am taking steps to ensure that the necessary arrangements are put in place for an efficient and effective system for service delivery. A key development in this regard has been the decision to establish the National Council for Special Education. The council, which will have a local area presence, will play a key role in the development and delivery of services for persons with special needs. It will also have a research and advisory role and will establish expert groups to address particular areas of special needs provision. Such areas would include the question of the future role of the special school sector and how the reservoir of experience, expertise and commitment, which the special school sector represents can be better utilised to support the special education system. Arrangements for the establishment of the council are now well advanced. A chief executive has recently been appointed to the council and it is intended that it will be vested by the end of March, 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_2022">I also intend to bring forward legislation, based on the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill, to clarify the rights and entitlements of persons with disabilities to an education service and to put in place the necessary framework to deliver the required services. My Department has consulted interested parties on the proposed legislation. My objective would be to secure the passage of this legislation through the Oireachtas before the summer recess. I am confident the measures which I have outlined will ensure that all children with special needs receive the support they require to enable them to gain maximum benefit from the education system, particularly in this year of the disabled.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_107">Under the Economic and Social Infrastructure Operational Programme within the framework of the national development plan, I plan to invest approximately €223 million in energy conservation including €67 million allocated for alternative and renewable energy. The investments could, in certain circumstances, involve support to encourage greater efficiency in the consumption of non-renewable energy. However, there is no Exchequer funding provided to non-renewable energy suppliers.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_108">My Department also operates an alternative energy requirement programme, AER, to support the building of new renewable energy based electricity generating stations. Under this programme selected projects are offered guaranteed power purchase contracts with the ESB for 15 years. These guaranteed contracts reassure investors and allow developers to source investment finance which would not otherwise by available. My immediate target is to add an additional 500 MW of renewables-based electricity generating capacity to the electricity network by 2005. The Deputy will be aware that just yesterday I announced the sixth alternative energy requirement competition, AER VI, which will offer support to 578 MW of new renewable energy projects in a range of renewable technologies to be built between now and the end of 2005.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_109">In addition, the establishment of Sustainable Energy Ireland as an independent non-commercial State body focused exclusively on the sustainable use of energy including deployment of renewable energy sources is an indication of Government resolve to see sustainable energy policies implemented. Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, has already commenced a challenging work programme to increase energy efficiency and to promote renewable energy technologies. In the renewable energy field specifically, SEI has opened a research, development and demonstration programme for renewable energy technologies with a headline fund of €16.25 million to 2006. The programme is open to a wide range of proposals including policy studies, field research, feasibility studies and technology research and development. Further information on this programme is available directly from Sustainable Energy Ireland.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_110">I am satisfied the AER VI announcement and the work programme of the SEI will see significant growth in renewable energy projects in the short-term. I have already stated that I will engage in a public consultation programme on all issues facing the renewable energy sector in 2003. This will provide all interested parties with the opportunity to make submissions on all topical issues including the strengths and weaknesses of the current support system for renewables, the merits of alternative support systems and the setting of fresh targets to 2010 and beyond.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2135">As I informed the House on 5 February 2003, I am advised by the fisheries board that it has had a permit charge for trout angling for many years on the board-controlled fisheries and that the permit income is reinvested in the conservation and day-to-day management of these fisheries.</p>
          <p eId="para_2136">I understand that the fisheries board, in reviewing its management and the fees charged for its fisheries in 2002, decided to extend the permit charges to cover coarse angling on the board-controlled fisheries, on the basis that it was unfair to charge one angler to fish for one species while another angler fishing for a different species, on the same water, was not charged.</p>
          <p eId="para_2137">As this is an operational matter, I have asked the chief executive officer of the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board to address the particular queries raised by the Deputy and to reply directly to him in the matter.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_160">This Government and the previous Government have invested an unprecedented amount of funding to help clubs and organisations at national, regional and local level to provide a network of high quality facilities to meet their particular needs.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_161">Since 1998, €213 million has been allocated to over 2,900 projects under the sports capital programme and over €57 million was made available in the last three years to provide new and refurbished pools under the local authority swimming pool programme.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_162">All applications for funding under the sports capital programme are subject to an assessment process where each project is judged under various criteria including the need to achieve an equitable geographical spread of funds, having regard to the range of existing facilities in each county.

          <p eId="para_2181">As the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for the provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons lies with the health boards in the first instance. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services on a national basis, including those services provided in the Western Health Board area. The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. This year my Department and the health boards are funding 13 dentists from various health boards, including two from the Western Health Board, for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. Thus, there is an aggregate of 20 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. Creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist is another structural measure being introduced in order to increase the number of orthodontic treatments.</p>
          <p eId="para_2182">In the short-term, additional funding of €6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services in 2001 of which €4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. The additional funding of €0.628 million allocated to the Western Health Board in 2001 for orthodontic services, includes €0.533 million for an orthodontic initiative in the board. The chief executive officer of the board has informed me that under the initiative, the board has, <i>inter alia,</i> recruited an additional specialist in orthodontics. Furthermore, two specialists in orthodontics who completed their training last year, have since taken up duty with the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_2183">Last year, my Department provided additional funding of €5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. Under the scheme, the Western Health Board received €0.465 million for the treatment of patients in this way. The chief executive officer of the Western Health Board has informed me that the number of cases awaiting orthodontic assessment and treatment, as at 31 December 2002, was 744 and 971 respectively. This is a reduction of 634 on the treatment waiting list in comparison with the corresponding figure at the end of the December 2001 quarter. The chief executive officer has also informed me that there were 1,496 patients receiving orthodontic treatment at that time. For children who are placed on a waiting list for treatment, the initiatives and structural changes that I have set out will bring about an improvement in waiting times for treatment and positively impact on the future delivery of orthodontic services in the longer term.</p>

O'Malley): I am aware of the advice in question which is that pregnant and breastfeeding women should avoid eating shark, swordfish and marlin and, additionally, should limit their consumption of tuna to no more than two medium-size cans or one fresh tuna steak per week. This advice was issued by the Food Standards Agency, UK, on 17 February last. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, has assured me that it is not necessary to issue similar advice for the Irish consumer. This advice is based on the results of a mercury monitoring programme now carried out by the Marine Institute under a service contract with the FSAI. This monitoring programme shows that mercury levels in fish landed in Ireland are low, within the range 0.02 to 0.27 mg/kg wet weight. Monitored levels are well within the limits set by the European Commission's decision of 19 May 1993 of between 0.5 an 1.0 mg/kg – depending on species. The FSAI also advises that the levels of mercury in canned tuna tend to be low as only the smaller species are canned. My officials have asked the FSAI to keep this matter under review.</summary>

      if progress has been made in the implementation of the report commissioned by the Eastern Regional Health Authority in conjunction with the Dublin Dental Hospital and St. James's Hospital, and signed off in 1998, relating to the construction of a purpose built day care centre on St. James's Hospital campus to tackle the waiting list for dental patients currently referred to the maxillofacial unit, since last raised by Deputy Pat Rabbitte on 23 October 2002.

          <p eId="para_2812">The report to which the Deputy refers, Development of Oral and Maxillofacial Services in the Eastern Health Board Region was undertaken by the review group established by the chief executive officer of the eastern health board and adopted by the board in 1999. The report proposed a number of measures for the development of this specialty in the eastern region and in particular: the appointment of a professor in oral and maxillofacial surgery, OMFS; the development of cleft care services; the building of a regional day care centre, incorporating oral and maxillofacial surgery, the regional orthodontic unit and a regional maxillofacial laboratory.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_175">I am pleased to advise that for 2002, my Department provided an additional €0.299 million to the Eastern Regional Health Authority (ERHA) for the conjoint appointment of a professor in OMFS between the national OMFS unit at St. James's Hospital, Trinity College and the Dublin Dental Hospital. This is an important step as the professor, once appointed, will give strategic leadership to the OMFS discipline, especially in the realm of OMFS training programmes.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_176">My Department has also funded the appointment of a cleft team co-ordinator and a consultant in restorative dentistry, both of whom are based primarily at St. James's Hospital. The consultant in restorative dentistry forms an integral part of the cleft palate multi-disciplinary team and will provide important coordinated care for patients born with cleft lip and palate and other congenital dentofacial anomalies.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_177">The planning brief for the regional day care surgery unit has been completed and the question of funding its development is a matter for the ERHA in the context of its NDP programme.

        <summary eId="sum_178">Intensive efforts have been undertaken to improve staffing levels in speech and language therapy at local and national level. Relevant developments include the continued implementation of the recommendations of the report of the expert group on various health professions, which included new pay scales and career structures, the undertaking of a concerted overseas recruitment drive on behalf of all health boards, the introduction of a fast track working visa scheme for health and social care professionals and the streamlining of procedures for the validation of overseas qualifications. The success of these measures is reflected in the increase of 54 speech and language therapists, representing an increase of 15.6%, employed in the public health service over the past two years.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_179">The Bacon report, Current and Future Demand Conditions in the Labour Market for Certain Professional Therapists, concluded that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of speech and language therapists. This requires a significant increase in training places to meet the long-term requirements of the health service. The report advocated an annual increase of 75 training places for speech and language therapy to achieve the fourfold increase in the number of speech and language therapists over the next decade recommended in the report. Significant progress has been achieved in boosting the number of therapy places in line with the report's recommendations. In May 2002, I announced, in conjunction with the Minister for Education and Science, an additional 175 therapy training places in speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and physiotherapy to achieve the recommended increase in therapists over the next decade recommended in the report.

          <p eId="para_2842">I propose to take Questions Nos. 213 and 214 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_2843">The provision of health related services, including speech and language therapy at local community care level, is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. Accordingly, the Deputy's question has been referred to the Regional Chief Executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority with a request that he examine the matter and reply directly to the Deputy as a matter of urgency. However, I understand that all health boards are experiencing difficulties in the recruitment of therapy posts and particularly in filling senior vacancies.</p>
          <p eId="para_2844">Furthermore, I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department commissioned a report on current and future supply and demand in the labour market for certain professional therapists from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates. The Bacon report, which was published in July 2001, concluded that a major expansion is essential in the number of speech and language therapists requiring a very significant increase in training places to meet the long-term needs of the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_2845">To advance this core recommendation of the report, an inter-agency working group, comprising officials from the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority, was established to seek proposals from third level institutions to ensure the rapid provision of the additional therapy training places. On 29 May 2002 the former Minister for Education and Science, Dr. Michael Woods, TD, announced the provision of 175 extra professional therapy training places for students to tackle the acute shortage of physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists in the health service. This initiative almost doubles the number of therapy places available at present and it is expected that the first intake to the extra places for speech and language therapy will commence in the 2003-04 academic year.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_181">Other key recommendations of the report include: the provision of sufficient clinical placements within the health service through the establishment of a national network of clinical placement co-ordinators; the need for fast-track qualification and review of the existing training system; the concerted recruitment from overseas; the establishment of the planned system of statutory registration consistent with the requirement for a patient-centred health service; the career structure, workload, working practices and skills-mix issues encompassed in the context of the report of the Expert Group on Various Health Professions, published April 2000.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_182">In addition to the Bacon report, I have asked the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Health Boards to explore other approaches which might result in the maintenance of an existing level of service provision, or an enhancement, in line with agreed service developments using the resources allocated to the services. The Northern Area Health Board has also undertaken a concerted overseas recruitment drive for various allied health professionals, including speech and language therapists, on behalf of all health boards. Procedures are being streamlined to minimise the length of time taken to validate foreign qualifications consistent with the over-arching need to ensure that all therapists working in the health sector are appropriately trained and qualified.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2847">Additional revenue funding amounting to €7.554 million was allocated to the North-Eastern Health Board between 2000 and 2002 in respect of the development of services to persons with autism and those with an intellectual disability. Additional funding amounting to €1.120 million was allocated in 2003, €0.320 million to further enhance the health related support services for children with an intellectual disability or autism and €0.800 million to meet the full year costs associated with the 2002 development programme. The specific allocation of this funding to individual projects or services, within the guidelines issued by my Department, is the responsibility of the North-Eastern Health Board. The overall national strategy in relation to the development of services for people with disabilities, including those with autism, has been to put in place services which support the identified needs of this population group, including residential, respite, day, home support and therapy and other health related support services.</p>
          <p eId="para_2848">In addition to the provision of additional funding for new and existing services, my Department has also undertaken a number of initiatives to increase the availability of various allied health professionals, in particular speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists.</p>
          <p eId="para_2849">Over the past number of years, as part of the overall development of services for persons with autism, the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority have been obtaining additional information on the needs of this group in their regions and in particular in relation to those who require or who will require specialist services. My Department is working with the health boards to establish an information system which will provide accurate data on the numbers of persons with autism and their service needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_2850">Funding amounting to €190,000, to be paid over a three year period, has been made available by the Department to the Health Research Board in respect of research into autism and its possible links with gastrointestinal dysfunction. The grant has been awarded to a team led by Professor John O'Leary of the Coombe Hospital. The other members of the team are Professor Colm O'Morain – Tallaght Hospital and Trinity College, Professor Michael Fitzgerald – Tallaght Hospital and Trinity College, Dr. Martin Buckley – Tallaght Hospital, and Dr. Orla Shiels – Trinity College.</p>
          <p eId="para_2851">Gastrointestinal problems have been reported in children with autism. An association between malabsorption and behavioural problems has been suggested in these children. Professor O'Leary and his team will assess the level of gastrointestinal dysfunction and abnormalities in people with autism, using a combination of approaches; endoscopic, immunological, biochemical and genetic. The overall aim is to characterise the biology of gastrointestinal abnormalities in people with autism and to examine any discrepancies between them and patients with conventional intestinal disorders.</p>
          <p eId="para_2852">My Department is also working with the Department of Education and Science in relation to the implementation of the recommendations of the task force on autism, which was commissioned by that Department.</p>

In addition, section 30 of the Act provides that responsibility for determining how legal services should be provided is a matter for the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_2959">The Deputy will be aware that a sum of €17.075 million has been allocated to the Legal Aid Board this year. While this figure represents a slight decrease of 3% on the allocation last year, it still represents a significant increase in resources for the Legal Aid Board in recent years, up from €10.563 million in 1997 to €17.075 million in 2003. This represents an increase of almost 62% over the period in question. Sanction for the board to employ additional full-time solicitors was also received during this period.</p>
          <p eId="para_2960">As part of their function in determining how legal services should be provided, the board has decided that cases involving domestic violence should continue to receive priority under the private practitioner scheme and that maintenance, custody and access cases would generally, in future, be referred to law centres. I should mention to the Deputy, however, that where an application involving domestic violence includes another remedy, this remedy will also be dealt with under the private practitioner scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_2971">The Local Government Bill 2003 provides for the ending of dual parliamentary-local authority membership from the next local elections in 2004. There will be indirect costs for local authorities arising from the replacement of Oireachtas councillors, who did not qualify for representational payment (RP), by new councillors who will qualify for RP. The RP cost will vary as between different local authorities but overall would be in the region of €1.6 million per annum on the departure of all Oireachtas councillors.</p>
          <p eId="para_2972">Apart from the provisions of the 2003 Bill, existing regulations already provide that all county and city councillors qualify, subject to the terms of the scheme, for a gratuity amounting to about €7,800 on retirement in June 2004, whether voluntarily or otherwise. This amount will now be made available to Oireachtas councillors who retire between 4 May and 30 June 2003 together with an additional retirement gratuity of €5,000 in recognition of their departure from the local government service. The cost of the additional gratuity would amount to about €600,000 if all Oireachtas councillors were to retire within that period.</p>

          <p eId="para_2974">Notification of capital allocations to local authorities in respect of the payment of disabled person's and essential repairs grants in 2003 will issue as soon as all authorities have submitted their expenditure outturns on the schemes for 2002 as well as estimates for 2003. As the administration of the disabled person's grant scheme is the responsibility of individual local authorities it is a matter for them to decide on the level of funding to be provided for the scheme in their areas from within these allocations. My Department also recoups to local authorities two thirds of their expenditure on the payment of individual grants and it is the responsibility of authorities to fund the balance from their own resources from amounts provided for that purpose in their annual estimates of expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_2975">The significant improvements made in recent years to the maximum disabled person's grant and the level of recoupment available have resulted in increased levels of activity with expenditure on the scheme increasing from €15.8 million in 1999 to €41.7 million in 2001. The figures for 2002 are currently being compiled. In line with this increase in the Department's capital provision for the scheme, recoupment costs have also increased significantly from €6.3 million for 2,512 grants in 1998 to almost €31.5 million for 5,070 grants in 2002. This very significant increase in the level of funding provided is a clear indication of the Government's commitment to the disabled person's grant scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_3029">I assume the question refers to non-greenhouse gas transboundary air pollutants.</p>
          <p eId="para_3030">Ireland is required to reduce emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and ammonia (NH3) to achieve the targets in Directive 2001/81/EC on national emission ceilings for certain atmospheric pollutants and in the Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution to Abate Acidification, Eutrophication and Ground-Level Ozone. Already many measures have been put in place to reduce such emissions. For example, a negotiated agreement was signed last year with the Solid Fuel Trade Group to reduce SO2 emissions from coal and petcoke and there is a requirement under 2001 regulations prohibiting the use from 1 January 2003 of heavy fuel oil with a sulphur content greater than 1% by mass.</p>
          <p eId="para_3031">The reduced excise duty in budget 2002 on low sulphur diesel has resulted in an industry wide move to this cleaner fuel and the implementation of the Auto Oil Programme Directives on fuel quality and vehicle emission standards is reducing vehicle emissions of SO2, NOx and VOCs. Emissions of SO2 and NOx from existing as well as new power plants are now regulated by the EPA under the integrated pollution control licensing system. In November 2002 I made regulations to reduce VOC emissions from the use of organic solvents in certain activities and installations. There are also synergies in achieving reductions in all transboundary pollutants with many of the measures planned and being implemented under the National Climate Change Strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_195">A discussion paper will be published shortly identifying and quantifying the potential for further emissions reductions of transboundary acidifying gases, and the measures necessary to achieve these. The purpose of the paper is to provide better cross-sectoral understanding of the scale of emissions reductions required by 2010, to seek sectoral perspectives on reduction options and information to further develop the robustness of emissions inventories and projections, and to serve as a basis for discussion between and within sectors on the most economically efficient means to achieve the national targets. Following this public consultation and in the light of inputs from sectoral and other interests I will bring a draft strategy to Government for approval.</summary>

      <b>Mr. Penrose</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
      if she will take steps to amend the legislation or regulations which prohibit widows and widowers who are receiving a social welfare pension, from receiving the respite care allowance and looking after their mentally handicapped children; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_3054">The respite care grant is paid to carers who are in receipt of a carer's allowance and to carers who are caring for recipients of a constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance. It is a contribution towards respite care to be used as the recipients wish. It is not payable with other social welfare payments. However, a person with an entitlement to more than one social welfare payments will always receive the payment most beneficial to him or her.</p>
          <p eId="para_3055">All other matters relating to the provision and availability of respite care are the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Health and Children. The Health Strategy, which was published by the Department of Health and Children at the end of 2001, commits the Government to reforming the current arrangements, including the carer's allowance, in order to introduce an integrated care subvention scheme which maximises support for home care.</p>
          <p eId="para_3056">The strategy also contains a number of other proposals, one of which relates to respite care. A number of Departments are involved in progressing these and other initiatives for carers and those for whom they care.</p>
          <p eId="para_3057">Further improvements to the carer's allowance scheme could only be considered in a budgetary context in the light of available resources. However, the development of the range of supports for carers will continue to be a priority for this Government and, building on the foundations now in place, we will continue to develop the types of services which recognise the value of the caring ethos and which provide real support and practical assistance to people who devote their time to improving the quality of life for others.</p>
